# AMALGUM v0.2

## Download

Latest data **without Reddit texts** is available under [`amalgum/`](https://github.com/gucorpling/amalgum/tree/master/amalgum) and some additional data beyond the target size of 4M tokens [`amalgum_extra/`](https://github.com/gucorpling/amalgum/tree/master/amalgum_extra). (The `amalgum` directory contains around 500,000 tokens for each genre, while the extra directory contains some more data beyond the genre-balanced corpus.)

You may [download the older version 0.1 of the corpus **without Reddit texts** as a zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1StyZjJ6u84vZgJ2bIgsuCb037zc36RXB/view?usp=sharing). The complete corpus, with Reddit data, is available upon request: please email [lg876@georgetown.edu](mailto:lg876@georgetown.edu).

## Description
AMALGUM (**A** **M**achine-**A**nnotated **L**ookalike of [**GUM**](https://github.com/amir-zeldes/gum)) is an English web corpus spanning 8 genres with 4,000,000 tokens and several annotation layers.

### Genres
Source data was scraped from eight different sources containing stylistically distinct text. Each text's source is indicated with a slug in its filename:

* `academic`: [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com)
* `bio`: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org)
* `fiction`: [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org)
* `interview`: [Wikinews, Interview category](https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Interview)
* `news`: [Wikinews](https://en.wikinews.org)
* `reddit`: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)
* `whow`: [wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com)
* `voyage`: [wikiVoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org)

### Annotations
AMALGUM contains annotations for the following information:

* Tokenization
* [UD](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/) and [Extended PTB](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/ptb_tags.html) part of speech tags
* Lemmas
* [UD](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/) dependency parses
* (Non-)named nested entities
* Coreference resolution
* Rhetorical Structure Theory discourse parses (constituent and dependency versions)
* Date/Time annotations in TEI format

These annotations are across four file formats: [GUM-style XML](https://github.com/amir-zeldes/gum), [CONLLU](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html), [WebAnno TSV](https://webanno.github.io/webanno/releases/3.4.5/docs/user-guide.html#sect_webannotsv), and [RS3](https://github.com/gucorpling/rst-xsd).

You can see samples of the data for `AMALGUM_news_khadr`: [xml](https://github.com/gucorpling/amalgum/blob/master/amalgum/news/xml/AMALGUM_news_khadr.conllu), [conllu](https://github.com/gucorpling/amalgum/blob/master/amalgum/news/dep/AMALGUM_news_khadr.conllu), [tsv](https://github.com/gucorpling/amalgum/blob/master/amalgum/news/tsv/AMALGUM_news_khadr.tsv), [rs3](https://github.com/gucorpling/amalgum/blob/master/amalgum/news/rst/AMALGUM_news_khadr.rs3)

### Performance

Current scores on the GUM corpus test set per task:

| task | metric | performance |
| ---- | ----- | ---------- |
| tokenizer | F1 | 99.92 |
| sentencer | Acc / F1 | 99.85 / 94.35 |
| xpos | Acc | 98.16 |
| dependencies | LAS/UAS* | 92.16 / 94.25 |
| NNER | Micro F1 | 70.8 |
| coreference | CoNLL F1 | 51.4 |
| RST | S / N / R | 77.98 / 61.79 / 44.07 |

\* Parsing scores ignore punctuation attachment; punctuation is attached automatically via [udapi](https://udapi.github.io/).

We harness knowledge from multiple annotation layers in order to achieve a {``}better than NLP{''} benchmark and evaluate the accuracy of the resulting resource.",
