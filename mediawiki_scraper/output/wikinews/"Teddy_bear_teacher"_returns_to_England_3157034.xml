<p>The <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">British</ref> teacher jailed for letting her students name a teddy bear "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad">Muhammad</ref>" as part of a writing project arrived in England after being pardoned - ending a case that set off an international outcry and angered many moderate <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims">Muslims</ref>.</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian%20Gibbons">Gillian Gibbons</ref> is back home after serving eight days of a 15-day sentence for allowing her students to name a teddy bear "Muhammad" as part of a writing project. This angered <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sudan">Sudanese</ref> authorities who said it was an insult to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic">Islamic</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prophet">prophet</ref>. She was released after being pardoned by Sudan's President <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar%20al-Bashir">Omar al-Bashir</ref>.</p>
<p>In Britain, the obviously relieved Gibbons said she was concerned she might have offended people.</p>
<p>"It has been an ordeal but I would like you to know that I was well-treated in prison and everybody was very kind to me. I was very sorry to leave Sudan. I had a fabulous time there. It is a really lovely place, and I managed to see some of the beautiful countryside while I was there," she said. "The Sudanese people I found to be extremely kind and extremely generous, and until this happened to me, I only had a good experience."</p>
<p>Gibbons could have received 40 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lashes">lashes</ref> or a six-month jail sentence.  After her sentencing last week, hundreds of Sudanese demonstrated for a stiffer sentence, with some calling for her to be <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/executed">executed</ref>.</p>
<p>Gibbons' arrest resulted in an international outcry and a tense stand-off between Sudan and Britain. It was also widely condemned by British Muslims. Her release followed the intervention of two Muslim peers, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%20Ahmed">Lord Ahmed</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness%20Warsi">Baroness Warsi</ref> who travelled to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum">Khartoum</ref> and met Monday with President Omar al- Bashir.</p>
<p>A senior adviser of president <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20Bush">Bush</ref> said Mr. Bashir insisted Gibbons had received a fair trial. </p>
