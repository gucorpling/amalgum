<p>Though the couple were indicted on these charges last summer in July 2006, they had a long history of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax%20protester">tax protesting</ref> and running the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent%20Hovind#Creation_Science_Evangelism_Ministry">Creation Science Evangelism Ministry</ref> without proper licensing.
