<p>Speaking in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum">Khartoum</ref> today, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan%20Egeland">Jan Egeland</ref>, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</ref>, said “this is the moment of truth. We are playing with a powder keg”. This followed disagreement about the role that UN would play in providing a force to help deal with the crisis in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Darfur">Darfur</ref>.</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</ref>, retiring <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN%20Secretary%20General">UN Secretary General</ref>, yesterday announced agreement of African, Arab and European leaders to provide a 20,000 force to supplement the 7,000 <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/African_Union">African Union</ref> peacekeepers trying to cope with the situation that had resulted in 240,000 being killed and 2.5 million being displaced during three years of conflict in the western region. </p>

<p>However, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lam%20Akol">Lam Akol</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sudan">Sudanese</ref> foreign minister, said: "What we agreed upon in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa">Addis Ababa</ref> was the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/African_Union">African Union</ref> (AU) force assuming full command, while the UN role would be confined to providing technical and logistical assistance to the AU mission." No dates had been agreed for the deployment of the UN forces.</p>
<p>Egeland said that the delay would cause the situation to become infinitely worse and would prevent the ingress of humanitarian aid to the millions affected.</p>

<p>The African Union is reported as saying that Birmaza, a northern village, has been attacked by the Sudanese government troops and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janjaweed">Janjaweed</ref> militia with air support. 70 dead are reported. The Sudan government has denied that it supports the Janjaweed.</p>
