<p>The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black%20box%20(transportation)">black box</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cockpit%20voice%20recorder">cockpit voice recorder</ref> from an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian%20Airlines">Ethiopian Airlines</ref> flight that crashed into the Mediterranean several weeks ago, killing all on board, has been found by search crews. The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight%20data%20recorder">flight data recorder</ref> had been recovered earlier in the day. The bodies of eight victims were recovered from what is believed to be fuselage.</p>
<p>"We found it and retrieved it about an hour ago today," Lebanese army Brigadier Saleh Haj Suleiman said, as quoted by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusinessWeek">BusinessWeek</ref>. According to reports, the plane made a sharp turn and disappeared from the radar upon departure; Lebanese officials, however, say it's too early to conclude the crash was due to pilot error.</p>
<p>The black box records communication data, technical information such as speed, altitude, etc., as well as conversation in the airplane cockpit, which could help investigators determine why the jet crashed.</p>
<p>The boxes will be transported to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/France">France</ref> to be analysed, according to officials.</p>

<p>Minister of Public Works and Transport Ghazi Aridi told <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Reuters">Reuters</ref>, "The priority now is searching for the rest of the bodies of victims." So far, the bodies of 23 victims have been recovered.</p>
