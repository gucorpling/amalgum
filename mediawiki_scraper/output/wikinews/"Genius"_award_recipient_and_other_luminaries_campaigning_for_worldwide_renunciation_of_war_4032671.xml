<p>In a recent ZNet Commentary, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard%20Zinn">Howard Zinn</ref> wrote that a group of people, including <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gino%20Strada">Gino Strada</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%20Farmer">Paul Farmer</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt%20Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine%20Gordimer">Nadine Gordimer</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo%20Galeano">Eduardo Galeano</ref>, are promoting the creation of worldwide gatherings to renounce war. Their intention, according to Zinn, is to make worldwide renunciation of war so popular that halting existing wars and preventing the beginning of new wars is politically irresistible.</p>
<p>In his article, <hi rend="italic">After This War</hi>, Zinn asks, "should we not think beyond this war? Should we begin to think, even before this shameful war is over, about ending our addiction to massive violence, and using the enormous wealth of our country for human needs?" He goes on to talk of ending not just "this war or that war but war itself. Perhaps the time has come to bring an end to war, and turn the human race onto a path of health and healing."</p>
<p>The five people have been actively involved in global issues for many years and have a solid track record of accomplishments on the world stage.</p>
<p>Dr. Gino Strada is a war surgeon and the founder of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency%20(NGO)">Emergency</ref>, a nonprofit, humanitarian organization dedicated to providing assistance to civilian victims of war. His recent book <hi rend="italic">Green Parrots: A War Surgeon's Diary</hi> helped persuade <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</ref> to abandon the use and manufacture of a flying anti-personnel mine.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Farmer is a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard%20University">Harvard</ref> professor and practicing physician. In 1987, he helped found the worldwide health organization <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partners%20in%20Health">Partners in Health</ref>, which treats some of the poorest people on Earth. Dr. Paul Farmer has received a "genius" award from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur%20Foundation">MacArthur Foundation</ref>. </p>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut is an <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US">American</ref> writer and humanist, currently serving as Honorary President of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20Humanist%20Association">American Humanist Association</ref>. As a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/WWII">WWII</ref> prisoner of war in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden,%20Germany">Dresden</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</ref>, Kurt witnessed the fire bombing of Dresden. This event formed the core of his book <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five">Slaughterhouse-Five</ref></hi>. In a column for <hi rend="italic">In These Times</hi>, he began "... our leaders are power-drunk chimpanzees ... the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East ... like so many bodies, is already shot to pieces. They are being treated, as I never was, like toys a rich kid got for <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Christmas">Christmas</ref>."</p>
<p>Nadine Gordimer from <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</ref> received the 1991 <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize">Nobel Prize</ref> in literature and 1974 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker%20Prize">Booker Prize</ref>.

<p>Eduardo Galeano's books combine history, political analysis, journalism and fiction. "I'm a writer obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America ... condemned to amnesia. <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Open%20Veins%20of%20Latin%20America">The Open Veins of Latin America</ref></hi> is one of Galeano's works covering the exploitation of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Latin_America">Latin America</ref> by foreign powers from the 15th century onwards.</p>

<p>Howard Zinn is a U.S. historian, political scientist and author of fifteen books. Howard writes, "In a world of clashing interests—war against peace, nationalism against internationalism, equality against greed, and democracy against elitism—- it seems to me both impossible and undesirable to be neutral in those conflicts. I do not claim to be neutral, nor do I want to be... . I will try to be fair to opposing ideas by accurately representing them."
