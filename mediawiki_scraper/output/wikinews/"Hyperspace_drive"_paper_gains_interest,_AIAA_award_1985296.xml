<p>The paper "Guidelines for a space propulsion device based on Heim's quantum theory" by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter%20Dröscher">Walter Dröscher</ref> (Austrian patent officer; retired) and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jochen%20Häuser">Jochem Häuser</ref> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University%20of%20Applied%20Sciences%20in%20Salzgitter,%20Germany">University of Applied Sciences in Salzgitter, Germany</ref>; Physicist &amp; Professor of Computer Science) has won an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20Institute%20of%20Aeronautics%20and%20Astronautics">American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)</ref> annual award for the best papers presented at its conferences (nuclear and future flight category).</p>
<p>The paper proposes experiments aimed at using intense magnetic fields to produce a gravitational field, which then propels a space craft.  The work is based upon ideas developed by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkhard%20Heim">Burkhard Heim</ref> in the 1950s.  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heim%20theory">Heim's theories</ref> are not widely accepted in the physics community.  They do, however, pass many experimental tests, such as accurately predicting masses of fundamental particles within current experimental limits.  </p>
<p>Dröscher says Heim's theories predict two additional forces, one is a repulsive anti-gravity consistent with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark%20energy">dark energy</ref> that appears to be causing the universe's expansion to accelerate, and one capable of producing acceleration of a spacecraft without expending mass, i.e. rocket fuel.  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA">NASA</ref> has investigated possible anti-gravity applications of Heim's theories before, but Dröscher &amp; Häuser say their proposed experiments differ significantly.</p>
<p>The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</ref> has expressed interest in the idea.  Experiments are expected to proceed if the idea survives further scrutiny in the physics community.</p>
