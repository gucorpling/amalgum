</div><p>The 108-floor central component of the new <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20World%20Trade%20Center">World Trade Center</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</ref> has been officially renamed <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%20World%20Trade%20Center">1 World Trade Center</ref>, ending the Freedom Tower moniker it had sported since 2003. </p>
<p>Freedom Tower was envisioned as a symbol of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">America's</ref> victory over terrorism. It is currently on track for completion in 2013, with 10 floors partially finished so far. </p>

<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port%20Authority%20of%20New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey">Port Authority</ref> Chairman Anthony Coscia commented on the change, "It's the one that is easiest for people to identify with â€” and frankly, we've gotten a very interested and warm reception to it."</p>
<p>Former <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%20of%20Governors%20of%20New%20York">Governor</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20Pataki">George Pataki</ref>, who revealed the Freedom Tower name nearly six years ago, was critical of the switch, saying "The Freedom Tower is not simply another piece of real estate and not just a name for marketing purposes."</p>
<p>1 World Trade Center has been the building's legal name and address for the past two years, with the public change precipitated by the ramp up of construction and the commencement of lease marketing. </p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael%20Bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</ref> seemed ambivalent to the change, saying "I would like to see it stay the Freedom Tower, but it's their building, and they don't need me dumping on it. If they could rent the whole thing by changing the name, I guess they're going to do that, and they probably, from a responsible point of view, should. From a patriotic point of view, is it going to make any difference?"</p>
<p>The change was approved following the signing of a two-decades-long lease by a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">Chinese</ref> real estate company, which plans to occupy floors 64 through 69. Other future tenants include the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General%20Services%20Administration">U.S. General Services Administration</ref> and the New York State Office of General Services. </p>
