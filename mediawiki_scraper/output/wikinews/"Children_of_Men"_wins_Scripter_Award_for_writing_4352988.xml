<td>This year's five nominated films were, all of them, heartfelt and elegantly wrought. In that heady company, 'Children of Men' was first among equals. Messrs. Cuarón, Sexton, Arata, Fergus, and Ostby took P.D. James's bracingly dystopic novel and crafted from it a film at once brave, subtle, shocking. This is writing and screenwriting of the highest order.</td>

<p>For nineteen years, the USC Libraries Scripter Award has honored "writers for the best achievement in adaptation among English-language films released during the previous year and based on a book, novella or short story." While there are many awards for either screenwriting in general, or adapted screenwriting, the Scripter is the only award to recognize both the screenwriters and the original authors.</p>

<li>screenwriter Patrick Marber and author Zoe Heller for <hi rend="italic">Notes on a Scandal</hi></li></ul>

The committee is made of Writers Guild of America members (including some Academy Award-winning screenwriters and Academy Award-nominated screen writers), authors, film industry executives, USC faculty, the dean of the USC Libraries, and selected members of the Friends of the USC Libraries, the sponsor of the event.</p>
