<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/North_America">North America</ref>'s largest outdoor dog festival came back to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Toronto">Toronto</ref> last weekend for its fifth year. It ran from the 9th of June to the 10th of June at Toronto's historical <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.%20Lawrence%20Market">St. Lawrence Market</ref>. A Wikinews reporter was there on Sunday to report on some of the events that happened on the last day.</p>
<p>The "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woofstock">Woofstock</ref>" dog festival attracted as many as 140,000 people with their dogs. The festival had tons of accessories, sold under tents, to buy for dogs; food, toys, designer clothes, and more. About 400 vendors and exhibitors were there to promote their products, which also gave private dog companies or groups a chance to show their new products. The local <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPCA">SPCA</ref> and some animal rescues were under tents answering questions from visitors. While walking, all visitors could see the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN%20Tower">CN Tower</ref> and other very tall buildings.</p>
<p>One of the local TV stations, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citytv">Citytv</ref>, was there. They hosted a live event at the show which was broadcast on TV. People came up on the stage and asked questions regarding their dogs and the host and co-host answered them.</p>
<p>A man, who called himself the "Chalk Master", drew two pictures on pavement with chalk. He did it for free but donations were welcome. One was a picture of a girl's head beside a dog's head, and another with a wolf.</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>"Hello Humans. I've been invited here to provide your eyeball(s), with some pretty colours. I don't get paid as I work this weekend strictly for tips... so, if you like what you see please make a DONATION. If you don't like it simply reach into the pocket of the person next to you and give me their money. CHALK MASTER."</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>A contest called "Canada's top dog" had its own tent with a professional photographer taking pictures of dogs behind a white screen; the winning photo is to be published on the cover of "Puppy and dog basics" magazine.</p>
<p>Large "Gourmet" dog bones were also served from a cart and table.</p>
<p>Next year's festival is expected to be bigger and better with even more attractions.</p>
