And recollected that "On Tuesday night, she said to me, 'get me out of here.' But it didn't happen." </p>

She had come back after all of this time. She really lived a very full and exciting life."</p>
<p>Born Anita Belle Colton O'Day, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20October">October</ref> 18, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919">1919</ref>, she escaped from a broken home at age 14, and began contesting with touring walk-a-thons popular at the time, and was occasionally asked to sing. Upon her return to Chicago, she landed her first legitimate singing job at Planet Mars, a Chicago <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub">nightclub</ref>. Carl Cons, Down Beat magazine's then-editor, was so impressed with her performance that he invited her to open his new jazz club. </p>
<p>As a showcase for promising jazz talent, The Off-Beat was frequented by such musicians as drummer Gene Krupa, and others. During one of her performances there in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941">1941</ref>, Krupa recruited her to join his <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orchestra">orchestra</ref>. </p>
<p>In <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943">1943</ref>, Anita left Krupa's band and married professional <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golf">golfer</ref> Carl Hoff. She later briefly joined <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clarinet">clarinetist</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody%20Herman">Woody Herman's</ref> band, then reluctantly Stan Kenton's. Thinking her style wasn't compatible with hers, she was surprised when in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944">1944</ref> the tune "And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine" became a national hit. </p>
<p>Anita's fierce love of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing%20(genre)">swing</ref> beats, conflicted however with Kenton's infatuation with strident rhythms and novelty tunes, and a year later, left over artistic differences. </p>
<p>Her <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation">improvisational</ref> style, and love of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebop">bebop</ref> lured her toward those with whom she could hone her talent, and by the late 1940s began her career as a solo jazz vocal artist. </p>
<p>She invited John Poole, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum">drummer</ref> whom she met at the Club Starlite in Los Angeles, to join her. She once said of John, "If the drummer is no good, I can't make it. That's why I like John Poole. He's my favorite drummer." Their musical affiliation lasted 32 years. </p>
<p>In <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955">1955</ref>, Norman Granz signed Anita to his company, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verve%20records">Verve records</ref>, and her debut album "This is Anita" was the label's first <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone%20record">LP</ref>. Though she rarely sang ballads, her interpretation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%20Nightingale%20Sang%20in%20Berkeley%20Square%20(song)">"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square</ref>," was considered so enthralling and fascinating that rocketed her career to new levels.</p>
<p>Her performances with jazz greats <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinah%20Washington">Dinah Washington</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious%20Monk">Thelonious Monk</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20Shearling">George Shearling</ref> and others were renown. She became an international star after her performance of  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz%20on%20a%20Summer's%20Day">"Jazz on a Summer's Day"</ref> at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958">1958</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport%20Jazz%20Festival">Newport Jazz Festival</ref>, which later became a documentary film. </p>
<p>Anita recorded 16 albums between <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957">1957</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963">1963</ref> with a variety of groups, ranging from small ensembles, big bands to large orchestras.

Her first Japanese tour in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964">1964</ref> was received with acclaim while stateside, the popularity of jazz was decreasing. </p>
<p>Her nonconventional, self-initiated cold-turkey recovery from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heroin">heroin</ref> addiction at a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii">Hawaiian</ref> retreat was successful, and she later returned to work. Her last public performance was at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood">Hollywood</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</ref>'s Cinegrill Cabaret Lounge at age 83. </p>
