Shelters will also be reimbursed for their services. Residents will also have a chance to be reimbursed for goods, food and water that they needed to purchase during the storm. Items such as bottled water, radios and flashlights could be among those items eligible for reimbursement, according to a press conference with city officials and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Grid%20(US)">National Grid</ref> this afternoon.</p>

<p>A flood watch still remains in effect for much of the region, as melting snow pack is causing storm drains to over flow, and debris from trees is causing some drains to clog completely making many inaccessible to city workers.</p>
<p>Delaware Park, located near the Albright Knox Art Gallery, is nearly flooded as the banks of Hoyt Lake are beginning to over flow.</p>
<p>City workers are working to clear debris from a main storm drain near the overpass next to the intersection of Delaware and Forest Avenues.</p>

<p>A local business, the Lexington Co-op on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo had to throw out nearly every perishable good in the store after being without power for almost 2 days.
