In the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref>, "Halo 3" got $170 million worth of retail sales in the opening day alone.</p>
<p>The game by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie%20Studios">Bungie Studios</ref> is available in 37 countries, which means the exact opening day figure will be much higher.</p>
<p>More than one million <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</ref> subscribers logged on to play "Halo 3" against each other over the Internet in the first 20 hours of launch, according to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft%20Game%20Studios">Microsoft Game Studio's</ref> corporate Vice-President, Shane Kim.</p>
