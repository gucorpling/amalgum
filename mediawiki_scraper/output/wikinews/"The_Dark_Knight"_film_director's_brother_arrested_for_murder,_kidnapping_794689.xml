<p>Matthew Francis Nolan, 40, was arrested last month and is awaiting extradition to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Costa_Rica">Costa Rica</ref> to face murder and kidnapping charges. He is currently being held in prison without bond.</p>
<p>Nolan is accused of killing Robert C. Cohen, a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Florida">Florida</ref> businessman, in 2005 while trying to recover <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20dollar">$</ref>7 million Cohen owed to another Florida man.</p>

<p>Nolan and an accomplice, Douglas Mejia, then allegedly kidnapped Cohen and tried to extort the money from Cohen's family, then killed Cohen when the plan failed.</p>
<p>Mejia has already been convicted of murder and kidnapping and is currently in prison.</p>
