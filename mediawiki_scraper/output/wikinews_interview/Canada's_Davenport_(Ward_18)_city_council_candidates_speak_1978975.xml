Adam Giambrone (incumbent)
<p>29-year-old Adam Giambrone is the incumbent councillor for Ward 18, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davenport%20(electoral%20district)">Davenport</ref>, Ontario Canada.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Describe the three most important issues in your campaign.</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi>
1. Some of our neighbourhoods have struggled with crime and community safety for more than a generation.  We have begun to change that, but there's still much to do.
2. Our streets and public spaces have cleaner. We must redouble the effort to make them beautiful and attractive--and yes, cleaner--so people will use them.
3. The people of our city depend on reliable infrastructure--both physical and social--and we move by transit.  We must continue to protect and invest in these priorities if we are to build a city we can continue to be proud of.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What one election issue do you feel is most relevant to your ward in this election?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Continued investment in crime reduction and safer neighbourhoods.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> For our government to work, it needs direction from problem-solvers with a strong dedication to public service and accountability, and an energetic optimism about the good things we can do together. I admire the work of these people, and I have a strong drive to contribute in the same way.
When these people have not provided this kind of leadership, I have considered it my responsibility to take up the challenge.
I have also felt the need to have the voices of younger people represented at City Hall. Being the youngest member of Council, I have encouraged other young leaders to take up the challenge of political responsibility as well.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why do you want to represent this particular ward on council?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I've lived in this ward all my life and feel a strong personal attachment to the people here.  The sense of community here is very strong, but we have not always been well represented at City Council in the past, and we know it.  I want to continue to give it the high level of care and attention it rightly deserves.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> How are you currently involved in the community?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Before I was the city councillor, I was actively involved in community groups and our parks associations.  Our previous councillor was not responsive to the community, so with research and hard work with others, I was able to provide the kind of service we were lacking.
When I arrived at City Hall, I opened and have since maintained a community office, so people have ready access to their councillor.  I have continued to work with community groups across the ward and provided ALL residents with the kind of information in correspondence and newsletter that they were not accustomed to getting.
In a very culturally diverse community, I have also worked with many cultural communities in many languages to ensure that everyone, regardless of background or language, is well served by City Hall.
I have worked successfully with the community to establish 3 Business Improvement Areas so that our struggling main streets have a fair chance to grow and succeed.
I have increased local democracy by not only consulting, but often balloting neighbourhoods about very local decisions.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Which council decision (since the 2003 election) do you feel the city/your ward should be most proud of, and which was least desirable?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> This is a community that cares about the health of our environment.  Of the decisions Council made this term, I think it's unfortunate that we didn't get to our goals in adding recycling and "green bin" facilities in apartment buildings.
I think this Council should be proud that we made a very responsible decision to keep our Transit plan on track by establishing the St. Clair Right-of-Way.  There was a lot of fear-mongering about it, but in the end, Council made the right decision.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What does Toronto mean to you?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Toronto is a city that has a proud history of distinct neighbourhoods and cultural diversity.  We are a city that has occasionally struggled against a Provincial instinct to cut back and destroy the things we have built together over generations.  I think many people who don't know Toronto would be surprised at the progressive, community-minded nature of our people.  It's a city I'm intensely proud of.

<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Describe the three most important issues in your campaign.</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> 1) Elevators or ramps in Lansdowne, Dufferin, Ossington subway stations now.
2) Turning the contaminated 640 Lansdowne Ave - the police rejected it, the city &amp; the T.T.C. are left neither wanting to pay the clean up costs (60,000,000.00) sixty million dollars. It should be capped with afoot of concrete and trees planted every 20 feet to suck out contaminates and the site used for a multi use park.
3) Split the 14 Division police force into two groups, leave one group in the old Dundas/Dovercourt Sts. site with the administrative staff remaining there, the other half to set up a large satelite <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi> station at Bloor/Lansdowne Sts.saving gas reducing pollution and putting police in the face of the hoodlums who terrorize Lansdowne/Bloor area residents.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What one election issue do you feel is most relevant to your ward in this election?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Rolling back the 9% pay increase to councillors and mayor.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I have decided to involve myself in the political process because:
1) Adam Giambrone voted for the 9% pay increase
2) Adam Giambrone voted for the extension of using city finances/resources for 2 extra months.
3) Adam Giambrone believes ward 18 ends at Dufferin St. and ignores the needs of the west part of the ward, (Dufferin St. to the C.N. Line)
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why do you want to represent this particular ward on council?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I want to represent my ward to clean up Adam's mess in our ward.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> How are you currently involved in the community?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I have been involved in a clean up campaign for the last 17 years. I believe that cleanliness is next to Godliness.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Which council decision (since the 2003 election) do you feel the city/your ward should be most proud of, and which was least desirable?                                            </p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Since the 2003 election, nothing was done to be proud of, but both the salary increase of 9.7%, and the untendered contract for the subway cars, were least desirable.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> If you were elected as a "rookie" councillor, What would you bring to the table beyond the incumbent?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I feel I could add many years of life experience &amp; that of a family provider, to council &amp; not that of a single recently school grad, with  none of "the school of hard knocks experience".
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What does Toronto mean to you?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Toronto means so much to me that I composed a Toronto song.
