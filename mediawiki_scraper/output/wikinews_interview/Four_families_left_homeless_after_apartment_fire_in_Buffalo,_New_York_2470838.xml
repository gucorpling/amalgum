At least four families have been left homeless after a fire ripped through an apartment in a four-apartment building at 630-632 Plymouth Avenue in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</ref>. One person had to jump out of a second floor window to get to safety and one firefighter was injured while fighting the blaze.</p>
<p>At approximately 4:30 p.m. (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern time</ref>) firefighters were called to the building after initial calls reported that an oven had caught on fire after grease had spilled in Apt. #4. When firefighters arrived, Apt. #4 was completely engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>"When [the firefighters] arrived, one person was trapped on the second floor, but jumped out of a window to the neighbors second floor porch. The fire started in a kitchen oven, maybe by grease, but an investigation is being conducted," said Buffalo Fire Department Chief Joe Fahey.</p>
<p>"One firefighter was injured," added Fahey. Catalano, the injured firefighter, and whose first name is not known, received a small cut under his left eye, but did not require hospitalization and was treated at the scene by paramedics.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there is at least "US$100,000 in damage. $60,000 damage to the building and $40,000 to the contents," said Fahey. At least three floors and two apartments were severely damaged by the fire.</p>
<p>All of the building's occupants made it out safely, and none were injured. Arson is not believed to be the cause.</p>
