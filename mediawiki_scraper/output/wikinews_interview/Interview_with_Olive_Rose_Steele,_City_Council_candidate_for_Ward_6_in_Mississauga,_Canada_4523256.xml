Interview
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> List the three most important issues in your campaign, and briefly explain why these are important.</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> The three most important issues to my campaign are the reform of property tax, so that is fairer to all residents, addressing traffic gridlock, and addressing air/water quality.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What one election issue do you feel is most relevant to your ward in this election? </p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> The environment, for example issues such as air and water quality, rain forests, green spaces, trails.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What vision do you have, for your ward?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> That community centers extend their hours of operation to accommodate a diverse array of extra curricular activities for our youth.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What qualities or experiences do you possess, that make you more desirable than the incumbent?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I live in Ward 6 for 15 years.  I am inspired to run for Councillor because a strong woman with unique instincts such as myself will help our council to better reflect the people it represent.  My qualifications include 15 years as a public servant, twenty years as a volunteer community leader and 15 years as a successful businesswoman……a business I started from scratch.  I believe Ward 6 Residents like the fact that I am not a career politician and I will not be operating in a “business as usual” mode.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why do you want to represent your ward on council?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I believe I possess the skill and ability needed to sit on council; I bring to the table successful decision-making skills that I now use in the daily running of my own business; I bring people skills which make me an excellent team player and, I believe the municipal level puts me closer to the residents of Ward 6 in particular and the citizens of Mississauga in general; and gives me an opportunity to have the greatest impact on their lives.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Of the decisions made by council since the last election, which one would you have changed, and why? </p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I do not have a answer to this question.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> How are you currently involved in the community?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I am on the City of Mississauga Traffic Safety Council, the Chair of Elders Connect, Director of the Canadian Ethno-cultural Council, Immediate Past President of the National Council of Jamaicans, and CEO of Blackwood Staffing Solutions.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Many councillors are quite seasoned in the civic political process. What could you bring to the table as a "rookie", above and beyond the current roster of councillors? </p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> “Seasoned” does not always translate into efficiency.  I believe that municipal political offices should be governed by term limits. As a rookie Councillor, I will work hard to get the votes of the other members of council so that outstanding items from my election platform can be implemented.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What service is most lacking in Mississauga?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I feel that school-based child-care and children and youth school nutrition programs are most lacking.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> How do you feel about Mississauga's rate of expansion?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Packing as many people as possible in our City may make initial economic sense however; the long-term consequences and costs to the environment (human and natural) are far too high.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why should businesses be attracted to locating in Mississauga? </p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Because it could be more economical to do business.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> How could Mississauga further itself in attracting corporate investment?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> One way is to establish a rapid rail system that connects with regional systems.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Because I believe that more women are needed in municipal politics — not because our male colleagues are not capable — but because our community cannot afford to lose the intelligence, insights and experience those women such as myself bring to the table.
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What does Mississauga mean to you?</p>
<hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Mississauga is my home for 32 years, Mississauga means success to me.
