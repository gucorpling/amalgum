<p>On Thursday, with 110 days until the start of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Paralympics">2014 Winter Paralympics</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sochi">Sochi</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</ref>, <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> interviewed Assistant Professor in Educational Leadership, Sport Studies and Educational/Counseling Psychology at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington%20State%20University">Washington State University</ref> Simon Ličen about attitudes in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref> towards the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Paralympics">Paralympics</ref>.</p>
<p>Licen has recently joined the Sport Management Program at Washington State University to develop its sport media and communication research and teaching contents.   Originally from <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Slovenia">Slovenia</ref>, he served as the Director of Media and Communications of a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA%20Tour">WTA Tour</ref> event and was a member of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO">UNESCO</ref> Slovenian National Commission.  He was also the Team Manager of the Slovenian <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wheelchair_basketball">wheelchair basketball</ref> national team.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> : Why do you think the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US compared to other countries like <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</ref> and even <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</ref>?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Simon Ličen</hi>: Sports in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society.  It emphasizes consumerism, the belief that success always goes to people who merit it due to their abilities, dedication and qualifications, and reinforces, rather than changes, existing ideas related to gender, ethnicity and nationality.  Paralympic sport brings attention to athletes who are typically overlooked in American society because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people who are disabled.  Although disability is not contagious, interest in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males following it.  Disabled athletes also challenge existing relations of power by displaying dedication, hard work and perseverance in different contexts than those most sports fans are accustomed to.
Other countries, including the ones you mention, have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society.  Even though legislative support may be less strong than the one provided by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201990">Americans with Disabilities Act</ref>, many social institutions including the media are more receptive to this form of diversity.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> :  What do you think the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be with the Games being <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Television">televised</ref> live in the United States for first time?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Simon Ličen</hi>: The impact depends on a number of aspects.  One of them is the channels that <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NBC">NBC</ref> as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use to air the Paralympic Games on.  Will they be shown nationally or regionally, on NBC or on any of the company’s multiple cable networks?  A second aspect is the parts or hours of the day the Paralympics will be shown.  Remember that there is a nine-hour difference between Sochi and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York</ref>, and a 12-hour difference between Sochi and the US West Coast.  So daytime events will be shown live in the United States in the middle of the night, and evening prime-time events will be shown — indeed live — in the morning U.S. time.  So showing the Paralympics live on United States television might turn out to be less glamorous than it appears.  A third important factor is the way the event will be mediated: will NBC have its best sports broadcasters following the event after having worked the Winter Olympics?  Will they treat and announce the competitions as they do all others — for better and worse?  Will they take it as an opportunity to educate viewers about disability and diversity while showing superb athletic performances without engaging in a discourse of pity?  All in all, I think this is a terrific opportunity to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects; but we will have to wait until after the event to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations.

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> : What role should the media be playing in promoting the Paralympic Games? Why does the US media provide so little coverage of the Paralympics compared to other sports?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Simon Ličen</hi>: I don’t think the media should be promoting <hi rend="italic">any</hi> sports event.  I think the role of the media is to inform about the event and to cover it fairly.  It is not just the Paralympic Games, or disable sports in general that yield very little media coverage; a recent study has shown that <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Women's_sports">women's sports</ref> only account for 1.3%–1.6% of televised news media.  The situation improves considerably during the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Olympic_Games">Olympic Games</ref> and prime-time Olympic coverage comes close to equal coverage of both men's and women's sport.  Outside of that, however, U.S. media coverage is largely limited to the men's four major leagues, college football and college basketball.   Again, the media decide which sports to cover based on their perceived entertainment value and its potential of generating sponsor revenues.  The Paralympic Games are complex to understand and its participants hard to identify with because there are less instances of dominating performances and long-standing rivalries, which are concepts that are understandable even to the casual fan.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> :  What role does the fact that the Paralympics are about people with disability competing at sport play in the American public's reception of the Paralympics?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Simon Ličen</hi>: I would speculate that the American public is largely indifferent to the event as it is currently represented in the media.  The majority of people are oblivious of the Paralympic Games.  They might greet an American medal winner as this would reaffirm the success, supremacy and tenacity of an American representative in a global field.  In more general terms, however, the American public chooses to largely overlook disabled sports as the average able-bodied person likely does not want to be represented by, and thus identify with, a disabled person.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> : Is the fact the US Olympic Committee is the national Paralympic Committee a hinderance or help in the development of the Paralympic movement in the US?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Simon Ličen</hi>: In general terms, this is both an opportunity and a risk: it can activate its sizable financial, promotional and media influence to bring attention to the Paralympic movement, but at the same time might choose to push disabled sports to the side in order to accommodate influential sponsors.  I am not familiar with the specific work done by the US Olympic Committee in terms of supporting, popularizing and expanding the Paralympic movement so I cannot speculate which way the actual work done by the USOC sways.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> : What conditions need to exist in the US for Paralympic athletes to get sponsorship similar to their Olympic counterparts?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Simon Ličen</hi>: Sport sponsorships are indeed strongly influenced by the media prominence of competing individuals.  Individual disabled athletes have already been able to secure profitable sponsorship and endorsement contracts; perhaps the most notable example is <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar%20Pistorius">Oscar Pistorius</ref> who was in this sense a true groundbreaker before falling off the pedestal due to his pending trial.  This is even more true when one considers that not all Olympic athletes are able to secure profitable or even exaggerated contacts: an Olympic archery champion is less appealing than an Olympic champion javelin thrower, a female javelin thrower is less appealing than a male sprinter, and a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaican</ref> champion sprinter is less appealing than an American elite basketball player.  Sporadic media appearances, such as those during the Paralympic fortnight, will hardly suffice to land disabled athletes major contracts; an athlete has to be in the constant media and popular spotlights to secure lucrative contracts.  Until Paralympic athletes [...] [are] able to achieve that kind of media presence, high sponsorships are likely to elude them.

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> : Many countries provide federal money to support their Olympic and Paralympic athletes.  Should the US consider this as a way of increasing visibility for the Paralympics, supporting increased opportunities for people with disabilities and increasing the US Paralympic medal count?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Simon Ličen</hi>:  Focusing on the US medal count will successfully keep the Paralympic Games away from mainstream attention!  A focus on the medal count as a means to establish supremacy is typical for American professional sports, and the Paralympics will never be able to beat the Olympic Games or the major leagues at their game.  This is why the Paralympic Games should involve a different narrative.
Countries typically allocate governmental support to the more vulnerable groups in society because those who are strong can protect their interests through their vast financial and social means.  In this sense, the United States should support participation in the Paralympic Games to promote adaptive sports in general and thus increase sports participation among people with disabilities.  People with disabilities are among those who most benefit from participating in sports and physical activity due to their health and social advantage; however, they also have much fewer opportunities for sport participation and often require expensive adapted sports equipment.  Public funds should contribute to their sport activity in general, and federal funding of Paralympic athletes could certainly provide an excellent example for local communities.  Unfortunately, I fear that even the most progressive <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US_House_of_Representatives">congresswomen and congressmen</ref> will be [reluctant] to increase that funding given the current federal budgetary situation.
