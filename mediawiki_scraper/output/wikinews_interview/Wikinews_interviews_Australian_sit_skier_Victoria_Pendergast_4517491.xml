<p>Yesterday, <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> spent time with with <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">Australian</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Paralympics">Paralympic</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Para-alpine_skiing">skier</ref> Victoria Pendergast who was in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Copper_Mountain_(Colorado)">Copper Mountain</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Colorado">Colorado</ref> for this week's <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/International_Paralympic_Committee">IPC</ref> Nor-Am Cup.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  I'm interviewing Victoria Pendergast who is an Australian female <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoski">sit skier</ref> on the development team.</p>
<hi rend="bold">Victoria Pendergast:</hi> Yer, that's right.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  How have you been doing here [Copper Mountain] so far?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Victoria Pendergast:</hi> Yer, its been alright. Like some races not so good, other races I was pretty happy with the results. We've got <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter%20Park,%20Colorado">Winter Park</ref> to look forward to, so bit of a warm-up, but, trying to get results.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Before this [skiing] the other sport you've done is <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Athletics">athletics</ref>? You competed at that for the games or was that somebody else?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Victoria Pendergast:</hi> No, that was me. I did it for the school, did <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shot%20put">shot put</ref> and did swimming for a bit.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Why would someone switch from athletics to be a crazy mono skier?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Victoria Pendergast:</hi> It was a bit of a crazy sort of events kinda went here with my family and then one thing lead to another and like wanted to give sit skiing a go.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Australia doesn't have many female sit skiers, are you shooting for <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Paralympics">Sochi</ref>?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Victoria Pendergast:</hi> It would be nice to get it. It'd be a bit hard to get points to get into it but, you know, if I can get the points to get into Sochi, I've got some [...].
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Cool. Thank you very much.</p>
