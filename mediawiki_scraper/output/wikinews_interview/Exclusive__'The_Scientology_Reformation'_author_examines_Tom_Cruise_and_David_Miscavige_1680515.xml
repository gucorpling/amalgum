<p>Rathbun attained the high-level position of Inspector General of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious%20Technology%20Center">Religious Technology Center</ref>, the division which manages trademarks and copyright over works by Scientology founder <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L.

<p>He helped manage multiple key hurdles for Scientology, including its 1993 success at attaining tax exemption in the United States, and dealing with the aftermath of the 1995 death of Scientology member <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Lisa_McPherson">Lisa McPherson</ref>.

<p>Rathbun left the Scientology organization led by Miscavige on December 12, 2004, leaving on a motorcycle.

<p><hi rend="bold">Mark Rathbun</hi>: "Nothing. It would just fade away under the do-less bureaucracy Miscavige created."</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> If you could be plopped into the Scientology organization position of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman%20of%20the%20Board">Chairman of the Board</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious%20Technology%20Center">Religious Technology Center</ref> (COB RTC) and replace David Miscavige, right now, would you do it, or who else would you suggest who would be capable in that role? </hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "No, I have no interest in organized religion. Because of that I am the last person qualified to answer the second question."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> What are your thoughts on the "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disconnection">disconnection</ref>" policy in organized Scientology? Do you think it should be discontinued?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "Yes. But it never will because Scientology management has correspondence from Hubbard from 1983 re-instating; making it impossible for such literalists to cancel it."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> In your view, what top 5 things would you change from the leadership policies of David Miscavige, and why?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "There are no five single things. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of arbitrary whims of Miscavige effectively chiseled in their minds as 'policy'. That is why I say 'Scientology Inc is dead', way past the point of possible rehabilitation."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Your first book on this subject, <hi rend="italic">What is Wrong with Scientology?</hi>, displayed on its cover the "Squirrel Busters" group who showed up on your doorstep in Texas. In a statement to the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus%20Christi%20Caller-Times">Corpus Christi Caller-Times</ref></hi>, they admitted that their goal was to make your life "a living hell". What are your thoughts on using Scientologists and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/private%20investigator">private investigators</ref> in this manner? </hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "It is reprehensible and unjustifiable in the twenty-first century."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Do you think there is any situation which would justify using <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office%20of%20Special%20Affairs">Office of Special Affairs</ref> (OSA) <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency">intelligence operatives</ref>, private investigators hired by the Scientology organization, high-ranking Scientologists, or some combination thereof, surveil, monitor, or gather information on former members of Scientology or critics of the organization? If so, can you describe what situations would warrant this type of response?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "No. The tactics are anachronistic. They were conceived during the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold%20War">Cold War</ref> to deal with a cold war era attack."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> What are your thoughts on the response of the precursor to the Office of Special Affairs (OSA), the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%20of%20Guardian's%20Office%20operations">Guardian's Office (GO)</ref>, to journalist and author of the book <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Scandal%20of%20Scientology">The Scandal of Scientology</ref></hi>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulette%20Cooper">Paulette Cooper</ref>? Is there any inside information or backstory you can share with us, regarding what happened to her? Is there anything else that you know, that hasn’t yet been exposed, about what happened to Paulette Cooper?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "Reprehensible. I have no other data to share — it is quite graphically spelled out in the GO's own documents that were put on the public record in the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.">D.C.</ref> Federal Court in 1978."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Other high-ranking executives within the Scientology organization have left before you, and tried to form groups which practiced a similar philosophy. For example, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%20Mayo">David Mayo</ref> formed the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced%20Ability%20Center">Advanced Ability Center</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa%20Barbara,%20California">Santa Barbara</ref>, California, which (according to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%20Scientology:%20The%20Story%20of%20America's%20Most%20Secretive%20Religion"><hi rend="italic">Inside Scientology</hi> by Janet Reitman</ref>) after a few years of operating by 1986 was "bankrupt after several years of litigation and harassment, shut down." Another group was called the "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free%20Zone">Free Zone</ref>", similarly formed over disagreements with David Miscavige and the RTC, which was influenced by former Sea Org member William "Captain Bill" Robertson. How and why will the current "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent%20Scientology">Independent Scientology</ref>" movement succeed, where others have failed?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "The main difference is that David Mayo and Bill Robertson tried to become the new L. Ron Hubbard and set up another version of what Hubbard created. That creation — the organization structure served the organization well for its first several decades, but became outdated and obsolete around the time of Hubbard's death, 1986. The current independent movement is predicated on the idea that Scientology was destroyed by being monopolized — and if it survives it will because enough people appreciate that was the core reason for the demise of the original organizations."</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Since leaving organized Scientology under David Miscavige have you read much about the theory of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive%20dissonance">cognitive dissonance</ref>? </hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "Yes."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> How do you think cognitive dissonance applies to those high-ranking executives still under the authority of David Miscavige? </hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "They were long ago overwhelmed with cognitive dissonance to the point where they have created a bizarre, anachronistic universe that is destined for extinction. They are clueless and they are so unreal and stuck to literally following outdated policies that it is hardwired for dissolution."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Could you reflect on and describe your own period of mental growth and cognitive dissonance since leaving organized Scientology under David Miscavige?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "I had a long three years with no contact whatsoever with any semblance of the subject or any Scientologist. I spent three years walking through my own <ref target="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible%20(King%20James)/Psalms#Psalm_23">valley of the shadow of death</ref> reflecting on my participation in abuses within that were anathema to the philosophy the organization was created to propagate.

Dozens of veterans have told me they woke up to what I was saying by first reading Scientology Inc's propaganda on me.

<p><hi rend="bold">MR</hi>: "Yes, I gave Narconon Int President Gary Smith the green light to make medical supervised withdrawal policy. I was Inspector General (Number Two) at the time, 2002.
