<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/U.S.">U.S.</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic Party</ref> presidential candidate <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bob_Ely">Bob Ely</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Illinois">Illinois</ref> took some time to answer a few questions from Wikinews reporter William S. Saturn.</p>
<figure><caption>Bob ElyImage: Bob Ely.</caption></figure>
<p>Ely, a graduate of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Yale_University">Yale University</ref>, worked for 18 years as an investment banker in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Chicago">Chicago</ref> before leaving the industry in 2000 to become a full-time investor and entrepreneur. Last year, he opened a campaign website and filed with the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission">Federal Election Commission</ref> (FEC) as a candidate challenging President <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</ref> for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. </p>
<p>Thus far, Ely has appeared on the Democratic primary ballot in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_Hampshire">New Hampshire</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Louisiana">Louisiana</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</ref>. His strongest showing occurred in Louisiana, where he won 6.57 percent of the vote, finishing in third place behind Obama and attorney <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/John_Wolfe,_Jr.">John Wolfe, Jr.</ref>. Discussing the primary, he told <hi rend="italic">Politico</hi> that despite being "a candidate who bought no ads and did exactly zero campaigning," he won 120 of Louisiana's 4,395 voting precincts, and defeated President Obama in 457. Overall, Ely has won a total of 15,502 primary votes. </p>
<p>On Tuesday May 29, Ely will appear on the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Texas">Texas</ref> primary ballot alongside Obama, Wolfe, and historian <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Darcy_Richardson">Darcy Richardson</ref>, who suspended his campaign last month. It will be Ely's last chance to qualify for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</ref> delegates. Four of his fellow challengers have already done so: anti-abortion activist <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Randall_Terry">Randall Terry</ref> and perennial candidate <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim%20Rogers%20(Oklahoma%20politician)">Jim Rogers</ref> both qualified in Oklahoma, Wolfe qualified in Louisiana and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Arkansas">Arkansas</ref>, and prison inmate <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith%20Russell%20Judd">Keith Russell Judd</ref> qualified in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/West_Virginia">West Virginia</ref>. For various reasons, the Democratic Party stripped the delegates from each of these candidates.</p>
<p>On his campaign website, Ely outlines a plan for a "job's bank", which would use the existing organization for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment%20benefits#United_States">unemployment benefits</ref> to create a program where businesses can hire individuals to new positions with government salaries of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum%20wage%20in%20the%20United%20States">minimum wage</ref>. He also wants to make it easier for businesses to terminate employees, and has proposed an increase in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation%20in%20the%20United%20States">taxes</ref> and tariffs. He is concerned about the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20federal%20budget">federal budget</ref> deficit and wishes to significantly reduce government spending. On other issues, Ely has proposed a plan for "basic health care" coverage, endorses "amnesty" for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">illegal immigrants</ref> in certain situations, and supports a strong, but frugal military used only to "protect America, Americans and America’s clear national interests"</p>
<p>With <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi>, Ely discusses his personal background and views of President Obama, a few details about his campaign, and such political issues as jobs, energy, taxes, and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation">nuclear proliferation</ref>.</p>
Personal
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">William S. Saturn</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What are some of your proudest accomplishments?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Bob Ely</hi>: #1, convincing my wife I would be a worthy husband in 1982. #2, Stealing a 10 foot tall 1-ton bronze statue as part of a college event (prank) in 1979.  Sadly, that bit a foolish mayhem is probably one of the high-lights of my life.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Have you previously been involved in any political campaigns or issues?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: No
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">If you had been elected in 2008, what would you have done differently than Barack Obama?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: Cut spending, raised taxes, really made government smaller and more efficient; made it easier for the private sector to function.  Most people don’t realize that the private sector and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">China</ref> pays, directly or indirectly. for everything in this country.  It is unclear how long the hard-working savers in China will want to (or be able to) fund our <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/profligate">profligate</ref> ways.  If that changes, everything will fall on the shoulders of the private sector.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Has Obama done any good things as president?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: Yes.  I give him a "B−."  He was dealt a tough hand and, given he knows little about business or economics, has probably played it as well as he could.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Do you expect to support the president in November?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: No.  I will likely vote for whoever is on line 3 or write in for <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ron_Paul">Ron Paul</ref>.
Campaign
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Why did you choose to run for president as a Democrat?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: I’ve always told people I am a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">conservative</ref>, not a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</ref>.  I believe the Republican party has lost its soul.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">On your campaign website you admit that you are "inexperienced". What qualifications do you have to be president?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: I’ve had to meet <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/payroll">payroll</ref>.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What kind of activities do you take part in for the campaign?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: Writing the website, designing and buying advertising and paying a lawyer to fill out FEC forms.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Does your campaign end after the Texas primary?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: Yes
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What will constitute a success in this campaign?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: I am pretty sure it is a complete failure.  I had expected that combining humor, some outrageousness and a cogent "platform" would make me a safe protest vote – pardon the oxymoron.  In a way something like <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppe%20Grillo">Grillo</ref>’s <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five%20Star%20Movement">5 Star movement</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</ref>.  I hoped that if I got traction, I would have scared the major candidates into not being <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/petulant">petulant</ref> brats and focus on solutions to the serious issues we face.  Oddly, Keith Judd was much more successful than I will ever be.
Policy
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">To pass your jobs program, you must receive the consent of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">Congress</ref>, a group of individuals that, as you say, "need to be loved" for their political survival.  Based on this, is it even possible to cut <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/entitlement">entitlement</ref>s or create a "Jobs Bank"?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">founding fathers</ref>, whose name has been taken in vain by every living politician, so why not me, designed the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</ref> to have Congress reign in the King (President).  Now, no one reigns in anything.  But if someone is willing to be despised and to take as a point of pride low single-digit approval ratings, the Constitution gives the President many powers to get things done.  No one is willing to do it because they want to be loved and care about their legacy and how they will be viewed by history.  I am perfectly happy to have a whole new level of presidential ranking just for me, under <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren%20Harding">Warren Harding</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</ref>.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">You have proposed increased taxes on energy. Since businesses require energy to transport their goods to market, this likely would result in an increase in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cost%20of%20living">cost of living</ref>. In such an environment, will people making minimum wage under your jobs plan, be able to afford basic necessities?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: Actually I propose to increase taxes on gasoline and, if the rest of the world will get on board, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coal">coal</ref>.  If I could make the numbers work I would eliminate the tax on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel%20fuel">diesel</ref> for just the reasons you cite plus the ridiculous way in which diesel has to be dyed different colors for tax purposes.  That in itself is an example of government inefficiency.  What to do about diesel engines in automobiles and light trucks?  Tax the engines (like the gas guzzler tax) to make them about equivalent to gasoline engines of comparable life.  People smarter than me may have a better solution.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Most <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools%20of%20economic%20thought">schools of economics</ref> agree that during a time of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recession">economic downturn</ref>, government should <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiscal%20policy">cut taxes</ref> to increase <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aggregate%20demand">aggregate demand</ref>. You propose tax increases to help balance the budget. With that in mind, how can you prevent a continuation of the current economic downturn?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: First, most economists didn’t see the financial crisis coming nor the rebound.  I did and invested accordingly.  Now I don’t know how to invest for what I see coming, which is why I embarked on this Quixotic endeavor.  That’s a bit melodramatic.  I do have some ideas.  But many of them are not "patriotic."  I believe when you’re in a situation you don’t like, you either have to effect change or adapt.  Getting on the ballot was my attempt to effect change.  Second, I did pretty well in sixth grade math.  With that learning, I conclude that we cannot borrow $1–1.5 trillion each year indefinitely.  <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</ref> has proven it can go on for a long time, although they borrow mostly (93%) from themselves.  Even they won’t be able to keep it up forever (watch that space closely).  Our debt is a growing tumor.  It’s either chemotherapy today or death tomorrow.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">For your "easier to get fired" plan, which allows businesses to fire employees in the first 180 days of employment for any reason, must Title VII of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">1964 Civil Rights Act</ref> be repealed since "any reason" could be construed to include the "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin" of an employee?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: No.  Any business person stupid enough to fire someone for their race when they could fire them for "no reason" should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.  I know women business people, however, who are reluctant to hire women because of the potential liability if the employee ends up being a dud.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">How should the U.S. president address the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear%20program%20of%20Iran">nuclear situation</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iran">Iran</ref>, or more broadly, the issue of nuclear proliferation?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Ely</hi>: The United States should make it very clear that any country, for example one that begins its sessions of parliament with "death to America," that we perceive has become a clear and present danger, the consequences of our military action will be the substitution of Iranian for Carthaginian in the term "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthaginian%20peace">Carthaginian Peace</ref>."
