<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Right now I am focused on bringing a peaceful America to my children and grandchildren.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Have you ever been arrested or charged with a crime?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> No.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What historical or contemporary figures do you admire?</hi></p>

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Have you run for public office previously?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> A couple of times for local offices, however, I have managed numerous campaigns for other candidates at the local, state and national level.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Why did you choose to run as a Libertarian?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> I am seeking the nomination because the Libertarian Party faces a critical test in 2012 and I want to make sure that we're up to the challenge.  The Libertarian message in 2012 must be loud, clear and unequivocal call to – stop all war! We must stop the wars in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iraq_War">Iraq</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War%20in%20Afghanistan%20(2001–present)">Afghanistan</ref>, we must stop the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War%20on%20Drugs">War on Drugs</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative%20lifestyle">Alternative Lifestyles</ref>, we must Stop the War on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil%20Liberties">Civil Liberties</ref>, we must stop the wars on food, healthcare, guns – you name it.	</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What do you feel sets you apart from your fellow contenders for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> I've been active in the Libertarian Party and libertarian movement all my adult life. I've never been afraid to passionately champion the unvarnished libertarian message of individual liberty and personal responsibility. Other candidates have tried to refine, revise or remake the libertarian message in order to appeal to voters. That tactic has failed not only the party, but the cause of liberty, as well. Instead, I propose to embrace the principled libertarian message and will not be afraid to speak truth to power.	</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">How often do you campaign and how would that change if you won the nomination?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> I am campaigning every day, either in person, online or on the phone and that will not change when I am honored with the Libertarian Party nomination.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">If elected, what would you do as president?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> My first order of business will be to disengage the United States from the tangle of misguided, immoral and unconstitutional military conflicts we are involved in by using the same authority and power as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief">Commander-in-Chief</ref> so many presidents have abused to get us mired in these <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quagmire">quagmires</ref> in the first place. </p>
Policy
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What necessary freedoms are currently lacking in American society?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> All our freedoms are currently under attack by <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</ref> politicians who have conjured up myriads of excuses, "imaginary <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hobgoblin">hobgoblin</ref>s" to wage war on American citizens and the world. They have manipulated events to distract, divide and terrorize Americans into willingly sacrificing their liberty before the great false god of Security. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">When is government necessary?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Government is only necessary to protect individual life, liberty and property. The only just and "necessary" government is one, as James Madison said, "which impartially secures to every man whatever is his own."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">In a market with little or no government regulation, what prevents an entity from seizing the entire means of production and becoming the new main regulator?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Government regulation is in reality a method by which large businesses with power and influence use government power to benefit themselves at the expense of smaller competitors. In a truly free market, there will always be competition to prevent one entity from seizing the entire means of production. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">In context of government's role, what are your stands on the legality of <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/incest">incest</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bestiality">bestiality</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Child_pornography">child pornography</ref>?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> While these practices might be repulsive to most people, as they are to me, government cannot stop them from happening. Libertarians believe people should be free to make choice for themselves about their lifestyle, so long as they do not harm others. In all cases where violations of human rights occur, the proper role of government is to prosecute those who have committed the violation.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Do you disagree with any parts of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</ref>?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> No, except that I believe the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Second Amendment</ref> should have been the first.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Should the people of the United States have a right to constitutionally amend the Bill of Rights to increase the power of the federal government and limit individual rights?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> No individual, or groups of individuals, has the right to limit another individual's rights. Our rights come from our Creator, not from any government or document. Two people, 200 people, 2 million people, even the world's populations combined do not have more rights than one person. That is why when it comes to human rights, no number is greater than one.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Should the lives of American citizens be valued above citizens of other nations?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> No. All human beings have equal value. No race, color, creed, nationality, language group, ethnic group – no human being – is of more value than any other. We are all equal under the Creator. Freedom has no race. Liberty knows no color.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What are your views on immigration?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> The so-called "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illegal%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">illegal immigration</ref>" issue is an economic issue and should be treated as such. We must change immigration law to match the reality of a dynamic society and labor market. Instead of building walls we should be opening doors. America should be creating a sane and humane immigration process to screen out terrorists and criminals while allowing honest, peaceful, hardworking people to come here to work and help build on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20dream">American dream</ref> as millions have done before them. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">When is war necessary?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> As C.K. Chesterton said, "The only defensible war is a war of defense." The libertarian principle of non-aggression does not mean you can't defend yourself. If the United States is attacked, we should defend ourselves using whatever force is necessary, and all the power at our disposal to stop the attack quickly and decisively. But we do not have the right to maintain an occupation force or engage in "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-building">nation building</ref>" in the aggressor nation.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Are you a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11%20Truth%20movement">truther</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack%20Obama%20citizenship%20conspiracy%20theories">birther</ref>, neither or both?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RW</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> None of the above. I am a Libertarian.</p>
