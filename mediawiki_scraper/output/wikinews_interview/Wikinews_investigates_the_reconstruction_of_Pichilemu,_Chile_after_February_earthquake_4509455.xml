<p>Eight months after a catastrophic earthquake, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews">Wikinews</ref></hi> has investigated the devastation caused in February and the reconstruction of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Pichilemu">Pichilemu</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Chile">Chile</ref>. The <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2010_Chile_earthquake">February 27 earthquake and a subsequent tsunami</ref> completely destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street and its oldest villages. <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> has also had access to the original design plans of the new <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kiosk#English">kiosks</ref> in Pichilemu, and conducted an interview with merchant Alejandro Mella, known locally as the King of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durvillaea%20antarctica">Cochayuyo</ref> ("El Rey del Cochayuyo"), who lost his kiosk after the earthquake.</p>
<p>Pichilemu is a coastal city in the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/O'Higgins_Region">O'Higgins Region</ref> of Chile, known as one of the "best surfing spots" in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/South_America">South America</ref>. Its current <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor%20of%20Pichilemu">Mayor</ref> is <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Roberto_Córdova_Carreño">Roberto Córdova Carreño</ref>, who was elected internally by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councillor%20of%20Pichilemu">Councillors</ref> of the city in September 2009, after several <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003–2009%20Pichilemu%20political%20controversies">political controversies</ref> that ended with three Mayors being displaced.</p>
<p>The territory of Pichilemu has a surface of 7,491 square kilometers, and comprises at least 24 villages, such as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciruelos">Ciruelos</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodeíllo">Rodeíllo</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espinillo,%20Chile">Espinillo</ref> (the latter two also severely damaged by the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2010_Pichilemu_earthquake">March 11 earthquake</ref>). Pichilemu is the most popular beach in O'Higgins Region, and many tourists visit it every summer.</p>
'The house moved from side to side. I really thought it was going to fall': First earthquake strikes
<figure><caption>People in Pichilemu fled to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%20Cruz%20Hill">La Cruz Hill</ref>, the village of Pueblo de Viudas, or simply they left the city, risking themselves because roads were very damaged. In the picture, people near <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los%20Navegantes">Los Navegantes</ref>, going to La Cruz Hill. Image: <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Diego_Grez">Diego Grez</ref>.</caption></figure>
<p>The earthquake took place in what is considered the "last weekend in the summer;" on Saturday, February 27, 2010 at 03:34 local time (06:34 UTC), while almost all Chileans were sleeping. Hours earlier, on Friday, thousands of people had arrived at Pichilemu. "The house moved from side to side. I really thought it was going to fall. It was 3 or 4 minutes long," Diego Grez, a Chilean student who was in Pichilemu at the time of the quake, told <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Diego_Grez,_Chilean_earthquake_survivor">an interview</ref>.</p>
<p>A concert was being held at the <hi rend="italic">One Discotheque</hi> when the earthquake occurred. It is said that the audience panicked and fled outside the discothèque, and then to the La Cruz Hill. Most tourists fled outside the city right after the earthquake occurred, but many others opted to stay in the La Cruz Hill or the village of Pueblo de Viudas, which are the higher points in the city.</p>
<p>"Pichilemu is the symbolic beach resort in the Sixth Region [of O'Higgins], so it was not strange to even think that [during] the last weekend before the entrance to school, many people would be going to take advantage of it to take a vacation; and that's what happened," reported <hi rend="italic">El Rancagüino</hi>, the most important newspaper in O'Higgins Region, on February 28.</p>

<p>The only radio broadcasting in the area was <hi rend="italic">Entre Olas</hi>, directed by Jorge Nasser, which also helped Pichileminians know what happened in other affected places by the earthquake, as they re-broadcasted the audio of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVN%20(Chile)">Televisión Nacional de Chile</ref> (National Television of Chile). On the day of the earthquake, the station reported that <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pichilemu%20Police">a local police</ref> truck had crashed near La Cruz Hill. There was no tsunami warning, and Mayor Córdova was away on holiday when the earthquake struck.</p>
<p>"Those who live in Pichilemu, and those who were visiting it, were surprised by the giant waves that annihilated its beach and reached the city's square, destroying everything on their way," reported <hi rend="italic">El Morrocotudo</hi> on February 28. "The most tough thing occurred when the firefighters' alarms sounded twice, and the people in the hill began to yell 'tsunami!'," journalist Tania Arce told the newspaper.</p>
<p>The earthquake destroyed one of Pichilemu's oldest and iconic buildings, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pichilemu%20post%20office%20building">the post office</ref>, which was <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Pichilemu,_Chile_former_post_office_is_demolished">demolished</ref> in July. The urban centre of Pichilemu was not severely damaged by the earthquake, but its subsequent tsunami caused most of the destruction. The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agustín%20Ross">Agustín Ross</ref> architecture in the city (three of his buildings are <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Monuments%20of%20Chile">National Monuments of Chile</ref>) was damaged. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agustín%20Ross%20Balcony">Agustín Ross Balcony</ref> was completely destroyed.</p>
'It's something unforgettable to me, I'm proud I saved all of those lives'
<figure><caption>The tsunami destroyed most of Pichilemu's coastal street establishments, including kiosks, restaurants and hotels. The picture shows the <hi rend="italic">Donde Esaú Restaurant</hi>, which was severely damaged by both the tsunami and earthquake. Image: <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Diego_Grez">Diego Grez</ref>.</caption></figure>
<p>According to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHOA">SHOA</ref>, the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy, the tsunami triggered by the earthquake first reached <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Pichilemu">Pichilemu</ref>, at 03:48 (06:48 UTC). A second wave came at 04:15 (07:15 UTC).</p>
<p>Policeman José Arévalo was the only person to warn residents that a tsunami was approaching. Arévalo was patrolling the Las Terrazas beach, when the earthquake occurred. He told <hi rend="italic">El Rancahuaso</hi> there were around 25 people in the beach. "Right after the quake, he noticed the sea had shrank around 500 meters inside. He took his megaphone, and shouted people should leave the place instantly." "The sea is coming out! The sea is coming out!," he shouted. "The warning was also preceived by nightclubs and pubs surrounding the <hi rend="italic">costanera</hi>. Then, the tragedy occurred. The sea destroyed everything on its way," <hi rend="italic">El Rancahuaso</hi> reported. "It all was really quick. Everyone is safe, luckily [..] It's something unforgettable to me, I'm proud I saved all of those lives," Arévalo added.</p>
<p>The tsunami destroyed restaurants, hotels, kiosks, the Fishermen Store (Caleta de Pescadores), surf schools, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agustín%20Ross%20Balcony">Agustín Ross Balcony</ref> (located right in front of the Las Terrazas beach) and houses near the <hi rend="italic">costanera</hi> (the nearest street to the beach), and flooded the building of the Government of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardenal%20Caro%20Province">Cardenal Caro Province</ref>, the boarding school of Pichilemu, the city square (Arturo Prat Square), and the Supermarket El 9.</p>
<p>A local worker, Ricardo Vivanco, also known as "El Gordo" ("The Fat one"), almost was killed by a tsunami, ignoring warnings by the Police and the Fire Bureau. Vivanco was drunk, and went down to the Las Terrazas beach with his friends. The wave washed him away, and was hit on the Agustín Ross Balcony's wall. His friends recorded a video and uploaded it to <ref target="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO6JHRPw0Xw">YouTube</ref>.</p>
Damage in Punta de Lobos and villages
<figure><caption><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta%20de%20Lobos">Punta de Lobos</ref>, Pichilemu's most popular surfing beach, is located at about four kilometers south of the city's centre. Image: <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Diego_Grez">Diego Grez</ref>.</caption></figure>
<p>It was reported by <hi rend="italic">Radio Entre Olas</hi> on February 27, that the tsunami had provoked massive damage in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta%20de%20Lobos">Punta de Lobos</ref>, Pichilemu's most popular beach. The owner of <hi rend="italic">Entre Mar</hi>, an hotel and restaurant in that beach, said the tsunami had destroyed all of his buildings there. </p>
<p>The village of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espinillo,%20Chile">Espinillo</ref> was badly damaged, and approximately 600 people were made homeless by the earthquake, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal%2013%20(Chile)"><hi rend="italic">Teletrece</hi></ref> reported on March 16. "We are keeping the government informed, we're also organized with some churches [<hi rend="italic">sic, religious organizations</hi>] that are working voluntarily in Espinillo, Los Boldos, Alto Ramírez [...] We thank a lot their work, that is not to give them <hi rend="italic">mediaguas</hi> [temporary tenements], but something definitive, but I also think they need resources to do it," Mayor Córdova said.</p>
'We are here because we fear about our safety': Residents scramble after second earthquake
<figure><caption>Many Pichileminians stayed in La Cruz Hill for several days after the March earthquake. Image: <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Diego_Grez">Diego Grez</ref>.</caption></figure>
<p>On March 11, Chile was hit by a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2010_Pichilemu_earthquake">second earthquake</ref>, that reached a magnitude of 6.9, and that occurred 40 kilometers southwest of Pichilemu. It occurred at 11:39 local time (14:39 UTC), while the new <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%20of%20Chile">President</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sebastián_Piñera">Sebastián Piñera</ref> was sworn in.</p>
<p>A tsunami warning was issued by SHOA, between <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coquimbo%20Region">Coquimbo</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los%20Lagos%20Region">Los Lagos</ref> regions. People in Pichilemu fled again to La Cruz Hill. Military authorities assured people in the hill they were going to be safe there, and that it was unlikely a tsunami was going to hit again Chile's coast. The tsunami warning was lifted at 15:50 local time (18:50 UTC).</p>
<p>People stayed in La Cruz Hill for a longer time than after the previous earthquake, and several activities were made there, such as a concert by Chilean-Brazilian singer <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe%20Vasconcellos">Joe Vasconcellos</ref>. People were also given food, wood (mostly remains from the destroyed kiosks), and electricity.</p>
<p>"We are here because we fear about our safety. We don't want it [a possible tsunami] to catch us. We have to settle down here and to accommodate," Edith Larraín told to <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi>. Mayor Córdova estimated that at least 2,000 people were staying at La Cruz Hill. Militaries and provincial authorities asked them to leave the hill on March 15, but most refused the deal. People eventually left the hill, due to complaints by the Mayor.</p>
Eight months on, reconstruction begins
<figure><caption>Caleta de Pescadores was destroyed almost completely after the earthquake and tsunami. The fishermen's boats were thrown more than 200 meters away. Image: <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Diego_Grez">Diego Grez</ref>.</caption></figure>
<p>On March 20, in collaboration with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor%20of%20Cardenal%20Caro">Governor of Cardenal Caro</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio%20Ibarra">Julio Ibarra</ref>, Colonel Raúl Melo, and the Mayor of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litueche">Litueche</ref> Bernardo Cornejo, Mayor of Pichilemu Roberto Córdova announced a "tourism revival campaign" of Pichilemu, promoting the surf practice, whose goal was "to make the city go back to the normality."</p>
<p>On April 4, the first monument was erected in memory of the earthquake and tsunami victims. The monument was created by local artisans, with rocks from several places of the Cardenal Caro Province. "We wanted to create this monument so we don't forget it [the earthquake] [...] This is the beginning of the reconstruction," said Julio Ibarra. The monument was placed in front of the beach, near the building of the Cardenal Caro Government. Mayor Roberto Córdova said that "it definitely will help us reconstruct [ourselves] espiritually, [and that] is essential."</p>
<p>On October 20, with the help of the Government, SERCOTEC (Technical Cooperation Service, <hi rend="italic">Servicio de Cooperación Técnica</hi>) and FOSIS (Solidarity and Social Investment, <hi rend="italic">Fondo de Solidaridad e Inversión Social</hi>), the Fishermen Store (<hi rend="italic">Caleta de Pescadores</hi>) began to be reconstructed. Caleta de Pescadores is administered by the Independent Labour Union of Fishermen of Pichilemu (Sindicato de Trabajo Independientes de Pescadores Artesanales), which has twenty-three members.</p>
<p>"The Government of President Sebastián Piñera has been worried about the fishing area, carrying out several actions in help of them, after all that they've suffered after the earthquake and tsunami that hit them [...] This area is working normally again," Governor Ibarra said.</p>
New kiosks; interview with Alejandro Mella

<p>On October 6, the Municipality of Pichilemu published the design of kiosks that were going to be constructed, as replacement of those destroyed by the earthquake. As of October 23, four kiosks have been constructed in Pichilemu, specifically on Las Terrazas beach, and two more are being constructed. According to Mauricio Grez, a construction engineer, the construction of one kiosk would cost up to US$ 2,500 (CLP 1,000,000).</p>
<p>Alejandro Mella, locally known as "el Rey del Cochayuyo" ("the King of the Cochayuyo"), is a merchant of Pichilemu, who promotes the cochayuyo (<hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/durvillaea%20antarctica">durvillaea antarctica</ref></hi>), and lost his kiosk after the February earthquake and tsunami. "I was given my [former] kiosk by the Mayor Orlando Cornejo, back in 1993. It was right in front of us [in front of Las Terrazas beach, near "the grotto of the Virgin"], and was made smithereens by the tsunami," he told <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi>.</p>
<p>"I have always worked on selling cochayuyo here, and the terrain where my kiosk was located before has been disputed by private people, and the municipality approved that. I talked with the Mayor and he said 'I don't know what's going on the beach'; that left me perplexed. [...] I like the new design of the kiosks, they are larger, and we can do more things with it, but they are way too expensive," he added. Mr. Mella also gave <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> a sample of his work as "the King of the Cochayuyo", an essay called "El cochayuyo es una mina repleta de nutrientes y sales minerales" ("Cochayuyo is a mine full of nutrients and mineral salts", pictured below), which he sells for 200 Chilean pesos (0.41 US$), and that contains "tips and information about the plant, and some recipes."</p>
