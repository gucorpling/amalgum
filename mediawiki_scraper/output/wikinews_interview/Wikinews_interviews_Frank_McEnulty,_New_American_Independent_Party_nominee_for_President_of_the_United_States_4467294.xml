<p>So far, the news on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election">U.S. presidential election</ref> has been dominated by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican">Republican Party</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic">Democratic Party</ref> nominees <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20McCain">John McCain</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</ref>. However, recently, some "third party" candidates have begun to gain notoriety, namely <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian">Libertarian Party</ref> nominee <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%20Barr">Bob Barr</ref> and independent <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph%20Nader">Ralph Nader</ref>. </p>
<p>Unbeknownst to many, there are several other minor party candidates in the race. One of them is <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_American_Independent_Party">New American Independent Party</ref> nominee <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%20McEnulty">Frank McEnulty</ref>. McEnulty has been interviewed several times by <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> over the past few months, but in one held earlier this week with reporter <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User_talk:WNewsReporter">Joseph Ford</ref>, he went into detail on why he'd be a good president, why its necessary to support a third party candidate this year, and most importantly, why you should give him your vote.</p>
<p>The interview can be read below.</p>
Interview
<p><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> (Joseph Ford): Why are you running for president?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> I am running for President because, as the father of two daughters, I am completely and utterly disgusted with both political parties in this country and am very concerned about what type of country we will be leaving for our children and grandchildren.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: You're the nominee of the New American Independent Party. What does your party stand for? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> The New American Independent Party believes in a smaller federal government that is not as wasteful of the people’s money and our country’s resources.  It also believes in a federal government that works for the benefit of all Americans and not predominantly for those Americans who belong to the President’s political party.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: If elected, how would you handle America's economical crisis? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> I would handle the current economic crisis by cutting out the cancer as soon as possible and getting the economy back on a sound footing so that Americans can do what they do best, move things forward once again.
Then, to ensure that this did not happen again, I would establish policies that would prevent this from recurring and I would instigate large criminal investigations into fraudulent lending and financial practices.  People would go to jail.  People would lose their financial assets.  People would pay for what they did wrong and allowed to happen.
For example, I would also see to it that the ex-heads of Fannie and Freddie never saw a dime of their deferred compensation even if that meant a prepackaged bankruptcy filing by both entities to void their contracts.
This mess needs to be cleaned up, but someone besides the American people at large needs to help pay for it with their assets and freedom.  This, in and of itself, would go a long way to restoring confidence in our financial system.  No one who almost brought our country to its knees financially should be rewarded when they are fired for doing so.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: How would you handle illegal immigration? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> Enforce the laws on the books and cut out all federal aid to illegal immigrants.  If there are no jobs and no benefits to being here illegally then they will go home and stay there.  This process is working in Arizona and will work nationwide.
I would also push for an amendment to the Constitution which would allow people born here to only be an automatic citizen of the US if their parents are already citizens.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: How would you handle foreign relations with Europe, where there are growing anti-American feelings? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> I would first stop being so unilateral in our policies outside the United States.  If we can’t make a strong enough argument to get the rest of the world on our side in a cause, then maybe we’d better think twice before we go off on our own.
I would also send ambassadors to Europe and the rest of the world that are truly qualified for the jobs and not political appointees who are being repaid for raising lots of money to get me elected.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: How would you handle the War on Drugs? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> I think it is time we started putting more of our resources into drug rehab than prison time.
Until we start to do something concrete and real about the demand for drugs by our people the War on Drugs will never be won.  As long as there is demand, someone will figure out a way to supply that demand.
Look at how successful we have been in cutting down on cigarette use.  Surely an anti-drug program as pervasive as the anti-cigarette programs have been would be successful in cutting drug use.  Combined with a comprehensive program of rehabilitation and we will start to reduce drug use in this country.  Throwing everyone in prison is not the answer.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: It has been over five years since the Iraq War began. As president, how would you handle it? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> The war in Iraq should have never happened.  However, now that we made the mess, we need to see it through or we will create an even bigger mess going forward.  As it appears that the Iraqi government is becoming more and more able to handle its own security and problems every day we must continue to help them grow in the job and then get out of their way as soon as they ask us to.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: For millions of Americans, health care is a major issue. How would you handle it? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> Health care is truly a big concern for a lot of Americans because it is probably the one thing that can ruin them financially quicker than anything else.  However, I do not believe in a Nationalized Health Care system because I’ve never know the federal government to run a program more effectively and cost efficiently.  I also believe that to a certain extent the health care crisis is somewhat of a media and politically created crisis.  People are not dying in the streets due to lack of medical care and, although some people are destroyed by huge medical bills each year, the numbers are not staggering.
I’m big on personal responsibility and believe that if a person takes personal responsibility for the little things in life then there should be a program for dealing with the major problems that is the responsibility of the government.  For that reason I have proposed a national, major medical insurance pool for major medical items.  Everyone who wishes to be covered would have to pay in a nominal amount for coverage, then, if a major medical event occurs, they would coverage for those expenses.  However, if you choose not to pay into the system then you have no coverage period and all major medical bills would be your personal problem.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: Homosexual marriage is an extremely controversial subject among Americans. How would you handle it? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> Homosexual marriage will not impact the sanctity of mine nor anyone else’s marriage.  This is truly a non-event in the grand scheme of things.  So I’ll keep it real simple, everyone should have the same rights in all things as everyone else – period.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: How would you handle America's educational system? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> Education and how we educate our children should be a state and local issue.  The best way in which to educate our children is best decided from the bottom up and not from the top down.
The role of the federal government in this issue is to provide the necessary funding to the states to ensure that there is adequate money for the education system to use.  Beyond that, they should stay out of the process.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: How would you handle abortion? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> Having spoken with people who have been faced with the decision of getting an abortion or not, I realize it is probably one of the most difficult decisions most women can ever make in their lives and one rarely forgotten.  My preference would be that no one would ever feel that they have to get or contemplate an abortion for any reason.  However, I also believe that this is a moral issue that is best decided by a woman, her family, friends and religious beliefs.
Abortion should be a state issue decided on the state level although I firmly believe that partial birth abortion is wrong in any and all cases.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: How would you handle the environment? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> I am an outdoorsman. There is nothing I enjoy more than hiking through open spaces, hunting and fishing. I also have children and am worried about what resources they will have as they, and hopefully someday, their children, grow older. Naturally, I am for protecting the environment. However, there is a give and take to everything. As the country continues to grow so will our demands for space and natural resources. I believe that the environment can be protected and nurtured while still being used for the greater good of all Americans. Sometimes that will require a set-aside of certain areas of the country as protected environments and sometimes that will require that we exploit the land and minerals to keep our country going. Will everyone be happy with my decisions? Probably not, but as a President that is independent of the influences of the major parties, I can always make my decisions based on the best information and the best interests of our country, both today and in the future.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: Why is it necessary that a third party candidate be voted into the White House this year? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> Because only a third party candidate can bring about the true change that is necessary to get our country back on the right path for all Americans.  Does anyone truly believe that change will come from the two major party candidates when their parties have the greatest vested interests in keeping the status quo?  I don’t think so and never see it happening.
To have true change you need someone in charge who is not a product of the system, who will hire the best people for the job regardless of political affiliation and who is only interested in doing what is best for all Americans.  That person will only come from an source independent of the political machines – from a third party.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: We haven't seen many Frank McEnulty media appearances, billboards or commercials. Will we see these in the weeks ahead? Or are you trying to run more of a grassroots campaign? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> This time around it is a grassroots campaign, but we are building a strong base for the next election that will allow us to have more resources to expend on traditional media while continuing our grassroots appeal.
Every week the campaign gathers more and more notice and that will continue to grow.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford:</hi> How are you currently doing in the polls?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> I rarely am included in any polls.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: Why are you a better candidate than Chuck Baldwin <hi rend="italic">(Constitution Party)</hi>, Bob Barr <hi rend="italic">(Libertarian Party)</hi>, John McCain <hi rend="italic">(Republican Party)</hi>, Cynthia McKinney <hi rend="italic">(Green Party)</hi> or Barack Obama <hi rend="italic">(Democratic Party)</hi>? Why should the American people give you their vote? </hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> First, they should vote for me because I truly believe that where I stand on most issues is where the vast majority of Americans stand.  We may not agree on everything all the time, but they will know that deep down I am fighting for the same things that they want to see happen.
Also, for the simple reason that I can and will do things differently than all of them would in the same position and below are a few examples of the ways in which my administration would be much different than those of any other President.
Partisan Politics and My Administration:
There will be no partisan politics allowed in my administration because I have seen first- hand how destructive they can be to getting the job done and helping people get back to their lives.
For the last three years I have been involved in developing a project in the New Orleans area.  The project is now underway, but during that time I have had the opportunity to travel to New Orleans several times and have seen first-hand what has and hasn’t been happening in the area since the hurricane in 2005 (over 36 months ago now).  Not nearly enough is getting done.  In Louisiana, they spent way too long blaming the Republicans in Washington, DC for everything that happened to New Orleans and surrounding areas rather than just getting on with the rebuild.  Now, 24 months later, there are still whole neighborhoods where very little has been accomplished and I believe a great deal of the blame for that is because of the initial partisan finger-pointing that is still going on today.
By contrast, in Mississippi, they didn’t try and blame Washington, DC for their problems (the Governor is Republican so no partisan bickering) and they got right to work and have made much greater strides towards getting the state and people’s lives back together.  Now, it will be argued for years as to why this has occurred and while the complete answer is very complex and involves many aspects, I believe a major reason for the lack of progress in Louisiana, and with many governmental initiatives,  can be blamed on the fall-out from partisan politics.
My Administration:
As an independent candidate for President my administration will not be burdened by the fact that we will need to make the proper political appointments or proper political decisions to try and help us keep and maintain power.  My chances of reelection will depend solely on how the American people believe that I am doing as their President.
Every decision that I will make as President of the United States will be based on four very simple questions:
1.       Is it Good for America?  By this I mean good for America as a whole, not for a special interest group, not for a specific industry, not for a specific political party, not for a specific politician’s reelection, but good for America as a whole.
2.        Is this Federal law really necessary?  We have thousands and thousands of Federal laws and way too many people in Congress trying to pass new ones all the time to help themselves get reelected.  Unless a law is absolutely necessary for the American people as a whole, it should not be passed.
3.        Is this a proper use of the citizen’s tax money?  The Republican administration that we have had in this country for the last several years has been on a spending spree unlike that seen in many, many years.  What happened to the theory of fiscal responsibility and smaller government?  We need to stop throwing money at every special project that people in Washington can dream up to buy votes and stop now.
I will not be afraid to veto new laws if I do not believe that they are in the best interest of all Americans.  As an independent President, I will not be under any obligation to pass a law to help a political party or to help get a certain senator or congressman reelected.  I will have the freedom to do what is right for America rather than what is right for a special interest or political party.
 HAVE YOUR SAY
 Are independent candidates just a distraction? Do you ever see the American public becoming so disillusioned with the mainstream parties to give them a chance?

Administration Personnel:
As an Independent candidate for President my administration will be free to hire the right people for the job, regardless of political affiliation.  There will be Democrats in my administration; there will be Republicans in my administration; there will Independents, Greens and non-aligned people in my administration.  The key to someone obtaining a job in my administration will be simple; do they want what is best for America, can they leave partisan politics at the door and do they have the proper credentials for getting the job done?
If a person does not have the right qualifications for a job, they will not be hired regardless of what they did to help me win the election.  I will hire as someone in the private sector will hire – hire the best person for the job who will give us, the American people, the best return on our investment.
<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Ford: There are thousands reading this right now. What could you say to convince them to give you their vote?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">Frank McEnulty:</hi> Please visit my website and read up on where I stand.  I believe you will find that I am the true moderate candidate who is looking to do what is best for all Americans and not just for a specific party or group.
