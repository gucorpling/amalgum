<p>The 10.10 version of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu%20(operating%20system)">Ubuntu</ref> (codename <hi rend="italic">Maverick Merkaat</hi>), a free operative system is to be released in the next few days. <ref target="https://fr.wikinews.org/wiki/">French Wikinews</ref> contributor <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://fr.wikinews.org/wiki/Utilisateur:Savant-fou">Savant-fou</ref></hi> (Baptiste) has interviewed Fabrice (<hi rend="italic">fabrice_sp</hi> on Ubuntu), an Ubuntu's <hi rend="italic">MOTU</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Master Of The Universe</hi>), member of the development team of the operative system.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is a computer operating system, based on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">Debian</ref>, which is created collaboratively by thousands of people. There are three official Ubuntu versions: Ubuntu Desktop Edition (for desktop and laptop PCs); <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu%20Netbook%20Edition">Ubuntu Netbook Edition</ref> (for netbooks); and Ubuntu Server Edition (for use in servers).</p>
Interview
<p><hi rend="bold">Baptiste</hi> <hi rend="bold">When did you first become interested in computers? When did you start programming?</hi></p><p><hi rend="bold">Fabrice</hi> About 12â€“13 years ago. My first computer was an MO6, and I started to get interested in programming at that age. I wrote my first program (a game) in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">Basic</ref>, and it was so big that it used two tapes (yes, yes, tapes). I am 39, so it's been quite a while since I became interested in computers. I was, and continue to be an <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autodidact">autodidact</ref>.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Baptiste</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is your profession?</hi></p><p><hi rend="bold">Fabrice</hi> I am Product Manager in a Madrid computing store, so I am still in the same field, even when I have not written a line of code in my job for a long time! My participation in the development of Ubuntu consists of maintaining the "technical" side.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Baptiste</hi> <hi rend="bold">You participate in the development of Ubuntu as "MOTU". What is it?</hi></p><p><hi rend="bold">Fabrice</hi> MOTUs are responsible for the software packages that are not included on the CD <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO%20image">iso image</ref>, about 14,000, for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maverick%20Meerkat">Maverick</ref>. We are called "packagers" (those who build packages).
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Baptiste</hi> <hi rend="bold">Becoming a MOTU is not so easy, right? How did you become one?</hi></p><p><hi rend="bold">Fabrice</hi> It's not that complicated: you should understand well how the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">Debian</ref> packaging works. And after convincing other MOTUs that we can not break everything, we can do it! It is a question of integration into the community and being trusted by other MOTUs. Basically, between my first collaboration in the development of Ubuntu until I became MOTU, I spent a year and a half, but some [users] became MOTU faster (I think the record is 4 or 6 months).
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Baptiste</hi> <hi rend="bold">How do you join it? Is there a vote (like Wikipedia, to elect administrators), an examination?</hi></p><p><hi rend="bold">Fabrice</hi> It is a vote during a virtual meeting via IRC. However, you must have previously prepared your proposal, by collecting the opinions of other MOTUs. The entire process is described here: <ref target="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/ApplicationProcess">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/ApplicationProcess</ref>, for those who are interested.
