Interview
<p><hi rend="bold">Why should Americans vote for you, your party, and your campaign's platform?</hi></p>
Fascism is the one economic system that's proven to work, and work well in country after country every time any nation has been fortunate enough to have a fascist head of state. Corporate Statism is the only economic system that has actually created ECONOMIC EQUALITY in all lands it's governed from Italy under our founder, Benito Mussolini, to Iraq, where Saddam Hussein was our head of state. If the Americans know what is good for them they had better put Jackson Grimes in the White House this time, and put an end to the shell game the political pigs in power now, are running on the masses.
<p><hi rend="bold">The election is nearing, and campaigns for all parties are reaching their final leg. What are your plans for the remaining weeks of the campaign? How will you continue to build on the awareness and momentum of your campaign?</hi></p>
Mr. Grimes will continue to go anywhere that they pay him to be, in America &amp; Canada. Of course, we will continue to court the press with form letters, do interactive radio shows, create blogs, and do whatever is necessary to make sure Jackson Grimes becomes the next President of the United States of America.
<p><hi rend="bold">If you aren't elected President in this election, can we expect to see your return to the ballot in 2012?</hi></p>
No.
<p><hi rend="bold">If readers are interested in your campaign, in what ways can they get involved?</hi></p>
