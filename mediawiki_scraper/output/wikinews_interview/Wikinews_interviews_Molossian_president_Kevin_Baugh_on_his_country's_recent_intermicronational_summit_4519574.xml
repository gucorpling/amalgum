<p>This past weekend, an important event in the intermicronational community took place. Prince Christopher I and Princess Erin, the Royal Family of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality%20of%20Vikesland">Principality of Vikesland</ref>, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micronation">micronation</ref> located in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta">Alberta</ref>, arrived in Espera, the capital city of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic%20of%20Molossia">Republic of Molossia</ref>, another micronation located near <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno">Reno</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nevada">Nevada</ref>, for what would be the two countries' first ever formal summit.</p>
<p>The Republic of Molossia, which declared its independence in 1998, has played an unparalleled role in the development of small nations. At only three years old, the Principality of Vikesland is a relative newcomer to the world of micronations. However, despite its age, Vikesland seeks to become a major power in the intermicronational community. The summit was successful in solidifying the two countries' already strong friendship.</p>
<p>Luckily, President Baugh was available to speak with. In addition to the summit, he told of his plans for the revitalization of the League of Small Nations, a nearly defunct organization devoted to the prosperity of all land-claiming micronations, and the current state of the intermicronational community. The entire interview can be read below.  </p>
Interview
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Briefly summarize the events of the summit.</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> Prince Christopher and Princess Erin arrived on Friday morning, June 27th, 2008. We held a brief ceremony in Republic Square, wherein I awarded Prince Christopher the Order of the Mustang and he awarded me the Order of Vikesland. After that, I took the Royal Family on a tour of Molossia and we spent the rest of the day discussing micronational matters in Norton Park. On Saturday the 28th, we all traveled to Donner Lake in the Sierras, and took part in Joint Naval Maneuvers, followed by a tour of Lake Tahoe. On Sunday, June 29th, Prince Christopher and I took part in a Joint Rocket Project, in which we each launched a rocket representative of our respective nations. The summit and visit of the Vikeslandic Royal family was a great success, and great deal of fun as well.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Tell us about how the summit with the Royal Family will have an impact on the intermicronational community.</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> I think that this summit, along with that in April with Grand Duke Paul of Greifenberg, shows that the ties between micronations are strong. We all share a similar vision, although with different perspectives. I hope that these two summits demonstrate how people from different walks of life and from across the world can come together, exchange ideas and thereby contribute the growth of their nations and communities.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">This is the second time this year that the leader of another micronation has officially visited the Republic of Molossia. Will Molossia be hosting anymore summits or state visits in the near future?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> I don't actually have any planned at this point, but one never knows what the future will bring. Each day affords new opportunities and new ideas, and my door is always open to any micronationalist and indeed any person interested in micronationlism.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is the current state of the intermicronational community?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> I think that micronationalism has had its up and downs over the years, it is not quite as active as it was around the turn of the century. Activity has certainly leveled off, but there are still many, many micronations out there, with new ones being founded every day. I believe that right now there are more serious nation-projects going now than there ever have been, and I look forward to seeing what might be coming next.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">How is the revitalization of the League of Small Nations, a nearly defunct organization dedicated to the prosperity of all land claiming micronations, coming along?</hi></p>
<hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> It is proceeding well, I think. An online meeting is tentatively scheduled for August or September, to ratify the Charter. After that, the serious business of advancing micronationalism will begin, with a proposed micronational postal union, and possibly joint support of a charity, in the name of the League. As demonstrated by the two summits Molossia has hosted this year, many positive things can take place when micronationalists come together, and I think the League of Small Nations is just the venue to make these things happen.
