<p>Completing my training and certification as an Air Traffic Controller in the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</ref>. Continuing my education in Philosophy and Law when time, convenience and the rigors of leading a family easily could have dissuaded me. </p>
<p>Running a principled <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives">U.S. Congressional</ref> Campaign which was based upon the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty#Philosophy">Philosophy of Liberty</ref> and which NEVER personally attacked my opponent but engaged him rigorously on policy and the issues. Getting up, when Life knocks me down.         </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What are your goals in life?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> To love and be loved by my family. To reason well. To be Free. To protect the innocent. To defend the Lives, Liberty and Property of my fellow Citizens of the Republic. To restore the Constitution and the Republic. To help ensure <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">our Founders</ref>' vision of Freedom is finally realized by the entire body politic.  </p>

<p>Every single Soldier, Sailor, Airperson, Marine, Doctor and/or Nurse who has fought with honor to defend the Republic, even if I will never know all their names, as well as their spouses who supported them in that endeavor.

Bush</ref>, George W. Bush, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ron_Paul">Ron Paul</ref>. Earlier on in my adult life, my political activities were limited to voting for the same party candidates as had my parents. However, as I began to read the Constitution thoroughly, and in the wake of its many abuses perpetrated by those same candidates, I began looking for others who espoused to strictly follow the Constitution as well as the Founders' Philosophies which underlie it. </p>
<p>This pursuit led me to Ron Paul and the discovery of Libertarianism. I will never again vote for any candidate based upon their party affiliation. What will now and forever dominate my decision is a candidate's demonstrated commitment to the Constitution and the Philosophy of Liberty.  </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Have you run for public office previously?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Yes, I was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%20in%20Oklahoma,%202010#Congressional_District_4">U.S. Congressional Candidate from Oklahoma's 4th District</ref>. Due to no <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ballot%20access">ballot access</ref> in Oklahoma for Libertarian Party Candidates at that time, I ran as a "Ron Paul" Libertarian <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</ref>. Though Ron himself has a policy of non-endorsement of GOP [<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</ref>] primary challengers against GOP incumbents, I was able to secure the endorsement of Senator <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand%20Paul">Rand Paul</ref> for my congressional campaign.   </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Why did you choose to run as a Libertarian?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Because no other party so ardently champions the Philosophy of Liberty over <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism">Socialism</ref> and Constitutional Governance over Tyranny. Were they alive today, every single one of the Founders would be Libertarians. Since that age, each new generation's battle to tear down the scourges of racism, sexism, classism, bigotry, political persecution and/or religious intolerance, has been made possible by appeal to the principles espoused in the Constitution even if the people who ratified it were limited by the tolerance levels of their own generation. </p>
<p>Thus has the time come for candidates running on our Founders' Platform to rise up, proud of the political lineage whose generations' long aim has been the complete equality of the body politic, yet humble and weary of how prejudice undermines that legacy as well as the Philosophy of Liberty itself. Giving in to socialism will not erase the moral mistakes of the past, but it will return our children to the states of slavery and involuntary servitude against which we have so long struggled. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What do you feel sets you apart from your fellow contenders for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> I do more than preach Libertarianism, or <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prognosticate">prognosticate</ref> about all the ways the GOP or the DNC [<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democrat</ref>] candidates will most certainly carry on with their tyrannies and usurpations of power, given the opportunity. </p>
<p>I articulate bold policy positions, as well as the means to institute them, based upon the Philosophy of Liberty and the Constitution with the aim of restoring Freedom, Liberty and the Republic. This is the definition of political courage, as taking these strong positions makes me a target for the bullets and blows of the enemies of Liberty. </p>
<p>But we are in the fight of our age and we must have champions willing to trade blows with the enemy, not merely repeat Libertarian platitudes.  Educational campaigns have been the mainstay of the Libertarian Party since its founding; but if we are going to take that next step — to actually convince the body politic that we can put into policy that which we preach, then we must nominate a candidate who is not afraid step out, armed with the courage of conviction and lead on every issue. </p>
<p>Of course our ability to do this is tied to cogent articulation of the philosophy which underlies our political ideology, but for too long have our other candidates engaged in academic debates for their own sake, and not actually deigned to apply that for which they argue to that which they will do. That being said, the biggest thing that separates me from my Libertarian Colleagues is that I am not running this race merely to educate or to increase the Party's ballot access; I am running to win and I believe with all my heart that we can be -- and that we must be -- victorious.   </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">How often do you campaign and how would that change if you won the nomination?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> I campaign for several hours each day. Once I win the nomination the only thing that will change is that I will have to add much more travel to the schedule. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">If elected, what would you do as president?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> I will defend the Republic and the Lives, Liberty and Property of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We%20the%20People">We the People</ref>. This I will do by way of projecting to the world our strength at home and in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International%20Waters">International Waters</ref>; and by ending all government infringements of the Constitution and of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20and%20legal%20rights">People's Natural Rights</ref>. The authority to act on this promise is found in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath%20of%20office%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President's constitutional Oath of Office</ref> to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." I will do no more than this and certainly no less.</p>
Policy
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">William Saturn</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What necessary freedoms are currently lacking in American society?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">R.J. Harris</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> With the exception of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">3rd Amendment</ref>, the Natural Rights codified in, and the privileges and immunities established by, the remaining nine amendments of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</ref>, along with elements of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">13th</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">14th</ref> amendments, are routinely infringed by all <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation%20of%20powers">three branches of the federal government</ref> through their collective and Progressive Establishment of Socialism in place of Freedom and Liberty. </p>
<p>These charges are made manifest by appeal to some of the very same made by the Founders of this Republic against the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%20of%20English%20monarchs">King of England</ref> for promulgating some of the same tyrannies which are now being foisted upon We the People by our own federal government. </p>
<p>To enumerate only a few levied by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</ref> our federal government has </p>
<p>1. "…erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their Substance." </p>
<p>2. "…kept among us, in Times of Peace, [and at our expense] standing Armies…" </p>
<p>3. "…combined with others [<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</ref>] to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving [its] Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation." </p>
<p>4. "…[cut]off our Trade with all Parts of the World [for products or services with which the elected majority finds disfavor]" </p>
<p>5. "…[imposed] taxes upon us without our consent [by way of deficit spending which will have to be repaid by those not yet old enough to vote]" </p>
<p>6. "…suspended <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas%20Corpus">Habeas Corpus</ref> and deprived "…us in many Cases of the Benefits of Trial by Jury [<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA%20PATRIOT%20Act">The Patriot Act</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp">GITMO</ref>]</p>
<p>7. "…[taken] away our Charters, [abolished] our most valuable Laws, and [altered] fundamentally the Forms of our Governments" [this referring to the federal government's many infringements of out states' sovereignty] </p>
<p>8. "…[declared] themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in [nearly] all Cases whatsoever" [by way of gross misuse of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce%20Clause">Commerce Clause</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy%20Clause">Supremacy Clauses</ref> as well as many others to pass, sign and uphold onerous legislation which would never be countenanced by a free People] </p>
<p>9. waged the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War%20on%20Drugs">Drug</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War%20on%20Terror">Terror</ref> "…War(s) against us [and in so doing] has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, burned [or seized] our [property], [invaded our privacy, killed citizens attempting to defend their property, sexually assaulted women and children attempting to travel] and destroyed the Lives of our People."</p>
<p>"In every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms [by begging for the cessation of: bailouts (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled%20Asset%20Relief%20Program">TARP</ref>), social welfares (<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act">Obama Care</ref>), undeclared foreign Wars (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean%20War">Korea</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam%20War">Vietnam</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation%20Gothic%20Serpent">Somalia</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iraq_War">Iraq</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%20military%20intervention%20in%20Libya">Libya</ref>), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No%20taxation%20without%20representation">taxation without representation</ref> and the devaluation of our Wealth (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deficit%20spending">deficit spending</ref> and the over-printing of a declining and unconstitutional <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote">paper currency</ref>), the theft and destruction of our Property (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent%20Domain">Eminent Domain</ref>) along with the killing and incarceration of our People (the Civil War on Drugs), the sexual assault of our Women and Children in the name of security (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation%20Security%20Administration">TSA</ref>), the gross infringements of our Privacy (the Patriot Act) ]: </p>
<p>Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury [after TARP came bailouts for a host of corporations, the social welfares are too numerous to list, the War in Libya goes on despite its gross unconstitutionality as does the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War%20in%20Afghanistan%20(2001–present)">War in Afghanistan</ref> despite having met the objectives contained in the Letter of Reprisal authorizing our actions there, the debt limit is about to be raised once again, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal%20Reserve%20System">Federal Reserve</ref> continues its <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantitative%20easing">quantitative easing</ref> (money printing), the Civil War on Drugs rages on despite the previous failure of prohibition and trillions spent to curb private behavior in the name of morality all to no avail, the sexual assaults being perpetrated by the TSA continue despite several state legislatures attempting to nullify them, the Patriot Act was just extended and all of this despite most of these actions not having the approval of the VAST majority of the People]. </p>
<p>A Prince [or central Government] whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People." </p>
<p>It should be clear then by the enumeration of this "long Train of Abuses and Usurpations," which represents but a tiny fraction of the same which our central government is using to pursue "invariably the same Object" and that it "evinces a Design to reduce [us] under absolute Despotism." </p>
<p>Thus by the precedent established by the Declaration of Independence, and the Founding of the Republic itself under similar, if not even less trying circumstances, that it is the Right and Duty of We the People to use the political process still available to us to "throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for [our] future Security" as well as restore our Constitution and our Republic. </p>
<p>As a potential Candidate for the Libertarian Party's Presidential Nomination I would encourage the People to begin this restorative political process by electing to the Office of President the MOST Constitutionally Libertarian Candidate available and to continue it by doing the same in the election of all future federal representatives to the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US_Congress">Congress</ref> REGARDLESS of their perceived political experience. </p>
<p>For certainly it is the case that nearly every single member of all three branches of the federal government are very experienced career politicians and yet the state of our Republic and the condition of our Freedom and Liberty are worse off now that they have been at any time since our founding.                </p>

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> I will fight to eliminate the social <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welfare%20state">welfare state</ref> and the high taxes required to pay for it, which are chasing our jobs and prosperity overseas. Simultaneously, I will seek from the Congress a very robust and permissive immigration policy to help grow our <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20middle%20class">middle class</ref>, making us more competitive with other emerging markets around the world.</p>
<p>I will deploy the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Marshals%20Service">U.S. Marshals</ref> backed up by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US%20National%20Guard">National Guard</ref> to protect Border State property owners from violent cross-border organized crime enterprises and syndicates. </p>

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Neither, although I do intend to ensure the highest level of executive and administrative transparency which will do much to resolve the propensity of some towards conspiracy theories, as well as expose potential conspiracies before they can fully develop. Since this <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%20government">transparency</ref> has been sorely lacking from our government of late, I will direct the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</ref> to fully investigate any reasonably perceived recent lapses in the executive oversight of the federal government's activities.</p>
