<p>Since current issues involving oil price increases, energy-saving and carbon-decreasing have gained public attention, the bicycle has become a popular product as everyone wants to own one. But some industrial businesspeople have pointed out a critical issue on bicycle riding, that is, personal security (safety).</p>
<p>Jack Cheng-kuan Hsieh, Chairman of KHS Mountain Bike Corp., discussed some of the dangers of cycling with <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews">Wikinews</ref></hi> Journalist <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:BrockF5">Rico Shen</ref> as part of a press conference.</p>

All the riders wanted to circle around the Taiwan or the other places but [they] often ignored several critical issues especially pre-tour preparations. Damages or accidents often caused with lack of preparations. Therefore, choosing a proper [cycling] lane, planning well, and doing necessary preventions are considered critical and must-be-done elements when riding a bicycle. In addition, proper clothing should be adapted in different weathers, and last but not least, DO NOT RIDE WHEN IT'S BAD WEATHER!
<p>In addition to Hsieh, Wikinews also interviewed Frank Feng-chou Kuo, Technical Chair of International Association of Ultra Runners. Following is an extract from his comments made to Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen:</p>
Whether a sport requires endurance or not, competitors should prepare fully before competing in any event. In most cases, accidents are often caused by the lack of preparation before an event.
<p>In general, when sporting anytime and anywhere, preparations should be made for better performance and safety, whether it involves more or less endurance or physical strength.</p>
