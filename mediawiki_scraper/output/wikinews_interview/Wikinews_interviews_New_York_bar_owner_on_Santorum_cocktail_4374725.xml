<p><hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews">Wikinews</ref></hi> interviewed one of the owners of a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</ref> bar about a popular new politically-themed cocktail drink  called Santorum. The beverage was inspired by the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Santorum_neologism">santorum neologism</ref> coined in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/advice%20columnist">advice columnist</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Dan_Savage">Dan Savage</ref>'s column <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage%20Love">Savage Love</ref></hi> in response to comments made by former <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</ref> Senator <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Rick_Santorum">Rick Santorum</ref> about <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Homosexuality">homosexuality</ref>; Savage's readers voted to define <hi rend="italic">santorum</hi> as: "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex."</p>

<p>The Pacific Standard bar is located in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn,%20New%20York">Brooklyn</ref>, New York, and is co-owned by Jonathan M. Stan and John-Christian G. Rauschenberg. Stan commented on the creation of the Santorum cocktail, "When he was winning in the polls, I thought, 'OK, I'll do a Santorum'." Regarding how long the beverage will be made available, Stan remarked to <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Brooklyn%20Paper">The Brooklyn Paper</ref></hi>, "We'll keep it around until he’s irrelevant. I hope he’s there the whole way".</p>
<p>The main ingredients of the Santorum drink include <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vodka">vodka</ref> of an orange citrus variety, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baileys%20Irish%20Cream">Baileys Irish Cream</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angostura%20bitters">Angostura bitters</ref>. It is served in a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cocktail%20glass">cocktail glass</ref> and topped with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godiva%20chocolate">Godiva chocolate</ref> flakes. The beverage is priced at <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">US$</ref>8.00, and upon an order for it, the bartender will recount for the customer the definition of the santorum neologism.</p>
<p>Troy Patterson of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate%20Magazine">Slate Magazine</ref></hi> ventured over to Pacific Standard to sample the new santorum cocktail at the bar. After tasting the beverage, Patterson observed, "My Santorum was sweet but balanced, with a subtle citrus pucker".</p>
<hi rend="bold">[The santorum neologism is] offensive beyond, you know, anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate, and the mainstream media laughs about it.</hi>

<p>In a 2003 interview with the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Associated_Press">Associated Press</ref>, Rick Santorum compared legalizing <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/same-sex%20marriage%20in%20the%20United%20States">same-sex marriage in the United States</ref> to supporting <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bestiality">bestiality</ref>. Readers of the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage%20Love">Savage Love</ref></hi> advice column selected a new definition for the Senator’s last name, and Savage created a website SpreadingSantorum.com to promulgate the spread of the phenomenon. The term became a prominent result in searches online, and gained dominance on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web%20search%20engine">Web search engines</ref> including <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Google">Google</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing">Bing</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Yahoo!">Yahoo!</ref>.</p>
<p>Rick Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon; he was quoted by <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Canadian%20Press">The Canadian Press</ref></hi> on his assessment of Google's response: "To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle. I suspect that's not true." Santorum criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon in a 2011 radio interview, saying, "It's offensive beyond, you know, anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate, and the mainstream media laughs about it."</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> What inspired you to create a cocktail after the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Santorum_neologism">santorum neologism</ref>?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">John Rauschenberg</hi>: Santorum the person has been in the news throughout the primary
season, and we thought it would be interesting to try to create a delicious drink that mimicked the appearance of the Dan Savage meaning of "santorum."</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> How did you first hear about the definition of the santorum neologism that grew out of the contest from the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage%20Love">Savage Love</ref></hi> advice column?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: We don't really remember. It's been around forever. Probably read about it somewhere.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> What are your thoughts about <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Rick_Santorum">Rick Santorum</ref>’s views on gay rights?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: It's not for us to take a stand on any political issues. We'll leave that to the professionals.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Do you think it was an appropriate form of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satire">satire</ref> for <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Dan_Savage">Dan Savage</ref> to popularize the definition of the santorum neologism created in his advice column?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: We thought it was funny. Whether it is appropriate or not is another thing we leave to the pros to decide.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> When was the Santorum cocktail first created?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: A few months ago.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> What ingredients go in the Santorum cocktail?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: Bailey's, orange vodka, bitters, and chocolate flakes.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> How is the Santorum drink made?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: The ingredients are shaken and/or poured into a cocktail glass. See the pictures.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Your Santorum cocktail creation has already received media coverage from publications including: <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Brooklyn%20Paper">The Brooklyn Paper</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezebel">Jezebel</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic">Metro.us</hi>, <hi rend="italic">EDGE on the Net</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instinct%20Magazine">Instinct Magazine</ref></hi>. Did you think when you created it that the Santorum cocktail would receive this news coverage?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: Not at all. We were just trying to come up with a topical and funny new cocktail for our customers to laugh about and enjoy.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> What culinary dishes would you recommend that go well with the Santorum cocktail?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: You'd probably be having the cocktail at dessert time, so something sweet: ice cream or pie.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Is the drink popular? How many times do you suppose you’ve served it at your establishment since its creation?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: The drink was mildly popular for the last few months, but of course has become a great deal more popular since getting all this publicity. We have no way to estimate how many times we've served it overall, but we're now pouring around ten a night.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> What are some reactions of your patrons after seeing the availability of Santorum as a cocktail?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: Most people find it amusing. Some people want to demonstrate their bravery and ability to overcome their mental blocks by drinking one. A lot of people think it's a really appealing mix of ingredients.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Has anyone come into your facility specifically because they have heard they can order the Santorum cocktail and wish to try it?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: Yes, especially recently.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Has the availability of the Santorum cocktail at your pub prompted any interesting political discussions amongst your staff and customers?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: Nothing more serious than the usual light political banter. Given our location and clientele, most of our customers are of a similar mind politically and there isn't much disagreement.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> How long do you plan on making the Santorum cocktail available at your bar?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: As long as Santorum stays relevant in the news and customers are interested in ordering it.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Have you heard any feedback from Rick Santorum or the Santorum campaign about the Santorum cocktail?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: No.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Were you at all worried about legal repercussions from creating a cocktail inspired by the santorum neologism?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>:  Not at all. There's nothing legally wrong with it.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Have you created any other drinks named after politicians?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: No.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> What are your thoughts about the satirical definition for the neologism "romney" ("to defecate in terror") created by Jack Shepler inspired by an incident involving <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamus%20(dog)">Mitt Romney’s family dog</ref>?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: We don't really have any.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Do you think you might create a new cocktail based on this "romney" neologism?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>:  Not based on that definition. If we ever came up with a "romney" cocktail it'd probably be something different. Maybe something incredibly bland.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> Comedy hosts <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon%20Stewart">Jon Stewart</ref> of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Daily%20Show">The Daily Show</ref></hi> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen%20Colbert">Stephen Colbert</ref> of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Colbert%20Report">The Colbert Report</ref></hi> have each reported on the santorum neologism repeatedly on their satirical news programs. If asked to do so, would you be willing to appear on these programs to mix up a special Santorum cocktail for the host?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JR</hi>: Absolutely.</p>
