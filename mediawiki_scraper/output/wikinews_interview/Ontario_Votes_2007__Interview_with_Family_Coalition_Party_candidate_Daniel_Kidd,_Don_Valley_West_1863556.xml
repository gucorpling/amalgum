Interview
<p><hi rend="bold">Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process? Why did you choose to run in this constituency?</hi></p>
I am running in this election because I believe strongly in the need for Christian ethics to inform the political decisions of our society. By running in this campaign, I seek to bring about a better future for Ontarians. A strong family, built on a strong marriage between a man and a woman, is the most important unit in our society and we must strive to protect this foundational institution.
I chose this riding because there was already a candidate in my home riding and I am seeking to give Ontario voters a choice to have a principled voice in legislature.
<p><hi rend="bold">What should be the first order of business in the 39th Legislative Assembly?</hi></p>
I would make every effort to raise the issue of the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death, and strengthening the family in our society.
<p><hi rend="bold">How can the province lead the way in stimulating job creation?</hi></p>
As a province, we should be reducing the level of tax burden on our businesses and encourage the free market system.  Also we should reduce the red tape necessary to recognize the credentials of immigrants which would provide a boost to our technology sector.
<p><hi rend="bold">What are your views on the mixed member proportional representation (MMP) referendum?</hi></p>
I strongly support MMP.  It provides a electoral system where the power is not concentrated with a party that did not receive a corresponding level of voter support.  With MMP the legislature will truly represent the views of Ontarians as a whole and not just the those who voted for the political party in power.
<p><hi rend="bold">What role, if any, does "new media" play in your campaign, and the campaign of your party? (websites, blogs, Facebook, YouTube videos, etc) Do you view it as beneficial, or a challenge?</hi></p>
We do our best to use e-mail and web-based means of communication...
