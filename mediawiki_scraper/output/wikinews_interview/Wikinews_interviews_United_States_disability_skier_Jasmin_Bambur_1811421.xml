<p>Recently, <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> spent time with with <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Paralympics">Paralympic</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Para-alpine_skiing">skier</ref> Jasmin Bambur who was at <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Copper_Mountain_(Colorado)">Copper Mountain</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Colorado">Colorado</ref> for the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/International_Paralympic_Committee">IPC</ref> Nor-Am Cup.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  We're interviewing Jasmin Bambur. He is a guy. He's from <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Serbia">Serbia</ref>, right?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Jasmin Bambur:</hi> Yes, ma'am, I am from Serbia but I race for <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US">US</ref> Paralympic.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  How did a Serb end up racing for the USA?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Jasmin Bambur:</hi> It's very simple. You just get married to a fine American lady and she give you citizenship and you ski fast and you get on the team. That's very simple.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Why do the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">Australians</ref> love you so?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Jasmin Bambur:</hi> We're a very small community, as ski racers, and we're always great friends. So we kind of hang out together and help each other out. And then in the end, depends who wins, either hate them or love them.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  They said you're some sort of professional racquetball player or something?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Jasmin Bambur:</hi> It's actually <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/team%20handball">team handball</ref>. It's a sport [where] you have seven players like <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Rugby">rugby</ref>. And yes, I played it professionally until I was 18 in Europe. And when war started in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kosovo">Kosovo</ref>, I moved to the United States and that's how I end up here.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  You weren't always a sit skier?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Jasmin Bambur:</hi> I am a sit skier now but actually the reason I am a sit skier is I had a car accident in 2000. I fell asleep driving. Driving and sleeping don't go together. I don't know why.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Yeah, that's a difficult lesson to learn. So how have you been doing at this event?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Jasmin Bambur:</hi> Skiing? I've been skiing for about ten years, racing about four. And so far it's going great.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  You won a medal, at this thing, right? One of these days?  </p>
<hi rend="bold">Jasmin Bambur:</hi> I won two medals in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super%20G">Super G</ref>, two third places, and yesterday I got second place in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slalom">slalom</ref>.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  And what's your favourite one?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Jasmin Bambur:</hi> Favourite is Super G.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Because you go fast?</p>
<hi rend="bold">Jasmin Bambur:</hi> Yes, fast and very little turning. So that's my pick[?].
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Thank you very, very much.</p>
<hi rend="bold">Jasmin Bambur:</hi> No problem.
