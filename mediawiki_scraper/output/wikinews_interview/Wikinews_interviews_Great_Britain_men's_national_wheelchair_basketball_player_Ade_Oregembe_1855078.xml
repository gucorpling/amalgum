<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nigeria">Nigerian-born</ref> Oregembe, one of twenty-four children, contracted <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polio">polio</ref> when an infant.  He started playing basketball after a random person suggested he take up the sport. Oregembe stated he'd never previously seriously considered any other sport.  His <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wheelchair_basketball">wheelchair basketball</ref> journey has taken him to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</ref> (to play in their local league) and around the world with the Great Britain national team.</p>
<p>Oregembe was asked about two of the big <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Paralympics">Paralympic</ref> stories:  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar%20Pistorius">Oscar Pistorius</ref>, and  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4.5%20point%20player#Beyond_4.5">5 point players</ref> —able-bodied competitors— competing in their sport at the Paralympics.  He did not support Pistorius's inclusion in the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Olympics">Olympics</ref>, nor inclusion of able-bodied athletes in wheelchair basketball at the Paralympics.</p>
<p>While the United Kingdom has a reputation for sport-related racism, Oregembe said he had not experienced much of it on the courts.  Elsewhere though,  it was a different issue as he had experienced racism both to his face and behind his back, noting it was a particular problem in Spain.</p>
<p>Oregembe's Great Britain side kicks off their <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%20Summer%20Paralymics">London campaign</ref> on August 30 against the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</ref> men's national wheelchair basketball team.</p>
