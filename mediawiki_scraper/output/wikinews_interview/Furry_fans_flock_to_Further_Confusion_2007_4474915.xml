Cell phones, cigarette lighters and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lightstick">glowsticks</ref> are raised in tribute as <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle%20of%20Life">Circle of Life</ref></hi> begins playing. Soon cheers drown out the song as the multicoloured performers appear on stage. A somewhat unusual introduction; but this is no ordinary show, and these are no ordinary attendees. This is <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further%20Confusion">Further Confusion</ref>, the second largest <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/furry%20convention">furry convention</ref> in the world.</p>
<figure><caption>Two fursuiters get with the convention's theme</caption></figure>
<p>The volunteer organizers have something to cheer about, too; <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/furry%20fandom">Furry fans</ref> have gathered from far and wide at the DoubleTree Hotel to indulge their love of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphics</ref>, and Further Confusion's 9th year is its largest, with a paid attendance of 2061. Their gains mirror those of <ref target="//en.wikifur.com/wiki/Midwest%20FurFest">Midwest FurFest</ref>, a similar convention held in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaumburg,%20Illinois">Schaumburg, Illinois</ref> which grew 35% last November.</p>
<p>Both events feature art shows and auctions, live puppetry performance, masquerades, variety shows, games and parades, as well as panels that range from science and technology to society, sex and spirituality. Filling out the schedule, the hotel walls are lined with announcements of public and private room parties for separate groups. At night, the disco floor fills with dancing cats, dogs, and dragons.</p>
<p>For some, dressing up plays a large part of the convention - almost 300 brought a full costume. There are few professional mascots here, though, and only one or two of the costumes would be recognized by even the most avid cartoon-watcher. Instead, each act is planned and performed by other attendees, wearing "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fursuit">fursuits</ref>" of their own design. Many play off the year's secret-agent theme — "Fur Your Eyes Only".</p>
<figure><caption>Some attendees are very young</caption></figure>
<p>Other fans seem content to restrict themselves to small accessories — perhaps some combination of paws, ears, or tail. Each fur bears a 3"x2" badge detailing their personal character, or "<ref target="//en.wikifur.com/wiki/Fursona">fursona</ref>". Often these characters are better-known than the people who play them.</p>
<figure><caption>Not all costumes are furry, as shown by these <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats%20(musical)">Cats</ref></hi> fans</caption></figure>
<p>It may seem lighthearted, even frivolous, but these conventions are becoming big business. Furry fans spent over $180,000 for lodging during the five days (Jan 18-22) of Further Confusion, and another $50,000 at the art auction. Attendees also purchase all manner of merchandise from attending dealers and artists, from on-the-spot art commissions and comic books of all ratings to prints, sculptures, and plush toys - even their very own fluffy tail.</p>
<p>Of course, any business has risk, and conventions can drain wallets when the sums just don't add up. The first furry con, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConFurence">ConFurence</ref> in Southern California, ran successfully for over a decade, but cost its new organizer an estimated $60,000 in its last four years due to falling attendance before folding in 2003.</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphic%20Arts%20and%20Education">Anthropomorphic Arts and Education</ref> board member <ref target="//en.wikifur.com/wiki/WhiteFire">Peter Torkelson</ref> says that won't happen to Further Confusion. Indeed, the convention ran a healthy surplus of almost $30,000 on $125,000 revenue last year, allowing it to pay off the last of its old debts and save for the future. As Torkelson explains: "The idea is if for some reason, say an earthquake happens, and it cripples the revenue stream, the convention will be able to survive into the next year. It does help our staff to know that we have [a reserve]."</p>
<figure><caption>Furry fandom attracts businesses to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrocon">Anthrocon</ref>, held in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</ref> since 1999</caption></figure>
<p>The reserve also gives AAE the financial flexibility to fund charities throughout the year, a big part of its <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)">501(c)(3)</ref> mandate. Over the nine years of the convention, attendees have raised over $60,000 for a variety of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/animal%20sanctuary">animal sanctuaries</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wildlife%20refuge">wildlife refuges</ref>, and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic%20Book%20Legal%20Defense%20Fund">Comic Book Legal Defense Fund</ref>.</p>
<p>Further Confusion's hopes for the future are high. Chairwoman Laura Cherry noted that, unlike previous years, the board has "gone all out" for next year's tenth anniversary, booking as many rooms as the hotel could offer. The host for 2009 has yet to be decided, but for many fans the question was not whether the current hotel will reach a limit, but when - and where - the convention will find a new home.</p>
