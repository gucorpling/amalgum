<p>While nearly all coverage of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008">2008 Presidential election</ref> has focused on the Democratic and Republican candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third-party candidates. These prospects represent a variety of views that may not be acknowledged by the major party platforms.</p>
<p>Wikinews has reached out to these candidates throughout the campaign. We now interview the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Prohibition_Party">Prohibition Party</ref> Presidential nominee <hi rend="bold"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene%20Amondson">Gene Amondson</ref></hi>, a preacher, artist and prohibition activist.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Why do you want to be President?</hi></p>
With one out of nine <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African%20Americans">blacks</ref> between twenty and thirty-four in prison, Prohibition will come again for the fourth time.
<p><hi rend="bold">Have you ever run for political office before? (President, senate, congress, city councilor, school trustee... etc.) Have you ever been a member of a political party, other than the one you're currently in?</hi></p>
I grew up <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party">Republican</ref>; my brother was [a] state Senator.
<p><hi rend="bold">What skills or ideas do you bring from this position, or previous positions, that will benefit the Oval Office?</hi></p>
I run because no one else will help America with its number one problem: where is the church? That had one Sunday set aside each year to get kids to take a pledge – never to drink (that was 60 years ago).
<p><hi rend="bold">Campaigning for the American presidency is one of the most expensive exercises in the world. How do you deal with the cost and fundraising?</hi></p>
If we could cut off the money that goes to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%20Dobson">Dobson</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union%20Gospel%20Vision">Union Gospel Vision</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%20Vision">World Vision</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy%20Graham">Graham</ref>, America could save our children from drunk parents. <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ohio">Ohio</ref> has a quarter of a million children abused each year by a drunk parent.
[Even] with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MADD">MADD</ref> Mothers and millions of dollars, drunk driving has not gone down in ten years.
<p><hi rend="bold">What are you/were you looking for in a running mate?</hi></p>
I have <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy%20Pletten">a running mate</ref>, but would like <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Newt_Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</ref>.
<hi rend="bold">Third party people do not win but we say wise things</hi>
<p style="font-size:smaller;line-height:1em;text-align: right">—<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene%20Amondson">Gene Amondson</ref></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Can you win the 2008 Presidential election?</hi></p>
Third party people do not win but we say wise things.
<p><hi rend="bold">If you can't make it into the Oval Office, whom would you prefer seeing taking the presidency?</hi></p>
We need <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/John_McCain">McCain</ref> to get good <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US_Supreme_Court">Supreme Court</ref> judges, not the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party">Democrats</ref>. <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Jewish">Jewish</ref> people must be wise like, Mayor <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed%20Koch">Ed Koch</ref>. I have to vote Republican, or kiss <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israel">Israel</ref> goodbye. Of the three front runners, only McCain will help Israel.
<p><hi rend="bold">What should the American people keep in mind, when heading to the polls this November?</hi></p>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Liberal</ref> Democrats win because they promise everything, like: America can give you everything; you do not even have to work; let anyone come across our borders; eat, drink and be merry.
<p><hi rend="bold">Anything else you want to add?</hi></p>
We are America's third oldest party, [we have been around for] 137 years. Your kids need you sober. You booze you lose. Like crime and drugs: keep selling alcohol. America's greatest years were the fourteen years of prohibition: our prisons and mental institutions [were] emptied. If you had a dog that bit every third person what would you do?
You would shoot that dog. Alcohol has no taste....I[f] I don't like you sober, I won't like [you] with a few beers. Responsible drinking – responsible smoking – dumb and dumber.
We need your help [contact me] at <ref target="http://www.geneamondson.com">http://www.geneamondson.com</ref> [or call] 206-463-6333.
