<p><hi rend="bold">Friday, May 4, 2007</hi></p>
<p>"Pakistan was un-affected by <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Taliban">Talibans</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</ref> (in my opinion) until the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US">US</ref> flushed them out of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</ref>. So <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September%2011,%202001%20attacks">9/11</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force">WTC</ref> and the post WTC attacks by the ISAF (read American, for the locals) forces have led to the present condition in NWFP. At least that is the way the people there see it," wrote <ref target="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews:Request_an_interview#Riaz_A_Hakeem">Riaz A Hakeem</ref> in one of a series of email exchanges with <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi>.</p>
<p>Mr. Hakeem, 58, left the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-West%20Frontier%20Province">North-West Frontier Province</ref> (NWFP) at the age of 25 and became a naturalized citizen of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">U.S.</ref> Now a businessman who is active in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Texas">Texas</ref> politics, he shares some views as a person who is in touch with his family and friends who remain in the region. He travelled throughout portions of Pakistan at the end of last year.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What is the current situation in the NWFP?</hi></p>
<p>The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun%20people">Pashtun people</ref> are or were renowned for their hospitality. Many westerners commented on it. Some with suspicion NOT willing to believe some people so poor could be so generous. It was almost a character flaw. One could travel without fear of personal danger as long as you followed local protocols.</p>
<p>That was the sort of mind set among the people. An ageless paradigm of self satisfaction: this is enshrined in the code of the Pashtuns way of life. </p>
<p>The Islamic radicalism is in reality nothing but the Taliban movement. Not all Pashtuns are Taliban (obviously), but most Taliban are Pashtun. Of these, most belong to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally%20Administered%20Tribal%20Areas">FATA</ref>. Of these, most were affected by their cousins from Afghanistan coming over. Mingled with them were Arab-Afghans, Uzbeks and some Tajiks and even Chechens. Some of these married within the tribes and formed a bond with the locals. Marriage bonds go back in history. </p>
<p>This Talibanization shows itself in the content of the Friday sermons at the mosque. Now it shows in the popularity of growing beards, especially since the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttahida%20Majlis-e-Amal">MMA</ref> - the coalition of religious political party's - won power. More recently in their showdown with the Pakistan army in North and South Waziristan - where according to my sources, people prefer going to the Taliban for justice rather than the older system of Maliks and Political Agents. The latter are known as corrupt. In Pakistan, in general, people are sick of the amount of corruption. </p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannu">Bannu</ref>, from where hails the Chief Minister of the NWFP, Mr. Durrani, is now in Taliban control in the sense that there is a parallel government that they have established which is functioning quite well and is popular among the people.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Has Taliban influence caused a stricter intrepretation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia">Sharia law</ref> in the NWFP?</hi></p>
<p>Yes. The Maliks, or tribal elders, consider themselves quite conservatively religious. Even so, they had a laid back attitude towards enforcement of religious doctrine. </p>
<p>The Taliban emulated the Saudi system of having a department concerned with citizens’ morals (even the name is the same: the department for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice) and this department has, as in Saudi Arabia, an enforcement police, called <hi rend="italic">mutawwa'in</hi>, a morals law-enforcement agency. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Is there a shift from tribal elders to clerics, as the main interpreters of law?</hi></p>
<p>There has been a movement in that direction, but it has started a power struggle between the clerics who traditionally have been at the lowest strata of the social structure. Now when they have seen a bigger role for themselves, first from the Taliban in Afghanistan – but also the government of the MMA in the NWFP, who are nothing more than glorified clerics themselves, only a little smarter in exploiting religion politically. </p>
<p>The MMA is largely non-Pashtun, which is a source of discontent in that they stand in the way of Pashtun nationalism, such as it is, because it only rears its head when non-Pashtuns start to usurp power over what the Pashtun consider their turf.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">The deal made between Pakistan's central government and the North and South Waziristan provinces, where tribal leadership was given the pivotal role in dealing with militants, has been criticized as a failure. What caused this initiative to fail?</hi></p>
<p>First off, I don't agree with the premise of the question, that the "deal" is a "failure" - for the following reasons: </p>
In the first place the Pakistan army (govt - same difference) did not have many options. This was the least worst option they had.
And most importantly, I have said this before, this area is literally in a time warp - which means they proceed at (what seems to us in the west) a glacial pace. I will give an example from the folklore:<p><hi rend="italic">The story goes that a Pashtun had to repay (badal) an enemy for a crime against his family and he waited patiently for 20 years (some say 50 years), after this time, he exacted his revenge - but soon after was depressed because he wondered "Did I act too hastily?"</hi></p>So one part of Pashtunwali is to "pay back" - (Badal: literally to exchange) which most people translate as revenge. Yes that is the form that is most visible, but badal is also played out in the exchange of gifts at wedding and other celebrations, and in the exchange of favors like in politics. The rules can be arcane, unwritten and hard to follow -- who did what to whom, when, and so on, and what is the proper recompense -- this same give and take would occur in a peace process pursued by the Tribal Maliks, who rule by consensus. There is no actual leader in the western sense, because all the Maliks, in fact all the others are de facto, so many co-equals is a mind set, a paradigm foreign to the uninitiated, as the concept of consensual gay sex is to the Wazir in Waziristan.
The agreement has not failed, because it has not been given enough time, in Wazir time reference, not American time presidential election cycle controlled. I do not have a crystal ball, but if I did, I would see NATO troops in Afghanistan long after Iraq is over. Afghanistan can be a success ONLY if we accept one thing, the time warp these people live in -- by my reckoning its still 1700 CE over there.
<p><hi rend="bold">Is the Talibanization of Pakistan partly due to a perception of corruption among the system of Maliks and Political Agents?</hi></p>
<p>The corruption is in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services%20Intelligence">ISI</ref>, the Pak army and the Pak system of Political Agents (PA) assigned to these tribal zones (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally%20Administered%20Tribal%20Areas">FATA</ref> &amp; PATA). </p>
<p>These PA have budgets that are much like the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</ref> in that they are a single line item in the national budget, there is no accountability of where or how the PA spends the money. If one followed the IRS rules and looked at the lifestyles of the PA and compared them with their income, you would soon understand what was going on. </p>
<p>Musharraf critics are a larger issue. Republicans have coddled Pakistan with the belief that "as long as they are pro America" then democracy in Pakistan will come in due course. Democrats have, I think, insisted Democracy first, and then we can discuss the other issues later.</p>
<p>The Talibanization of Pakistan has more to do with graduates of "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiwind">Raiwind</ref>", a place near Lahore, where the "Tablighi Jamaat" conducts brainwashing camps. It was graduates of this place, in my opinion, that are responsible for Britain's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings">7/7 attacks</ref> as an example.</p>
<p>Corruption amongst the Maliks is self limiting because of the egalitarian society they live in and because of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption%20amongst%20the%20Maliks%20is%20self%20limiting%20because%20of%20the%20egalitarian%20society%20they%20live%20&amp;%20because%20of%20Pashtunwali">Pashtunwali</ref>.  </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What is your view on Musharraf suspending judge <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Protests_in_Pakistan_as_Chief_Justice_appears_before_judges'_panel">Iftikhar Chaudhry</ref>?</hi></p>
<p>I believe, and this is widely held belief, that Musharraf has no constituency of his own for his power base. He wanted legitimization from the Supreme Court, and Mr Choudhry as Chief Justice (their system is not like ours) would not give it. </p>
<p>So Musharraf has had to hang on to his Army Chief of Staff position to get his power from the Army. If some one else were Chief of Staff, that person could refuse to support Musharraf.</p>
<p>The Justice favorable to the general is Justice Iqbal, who was not the next in line for Chief Justice. The next in line is a Hindu. That presented problems of its own for Musharraf. So when the Hindu judge went for a trip to India, Iqbal became the "available" senior most Supreme Court judge, and hence the haste and lack of decorum with which Justice Chaudhry was removed.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What is the prevailing sentiment regarding Pakistani government efforts in the provinces and the international effort in Afghanistan to combat Taliban and affiliated militants?</hi></p>
<p>In my dealings and inquires, <hi rend="bold">one</hi> thing stood out like a sore thumb - the conspiracy theories vis-à-vis anything having to do with America. I mentioned to one of my close friends that events that were previously ascribed as acts of God were now considered acts of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</ref>. Some even believed that the Earthquake in the northern areas was because of some sort of underground secret "bomb" used by the CIA. Lack of evidence is further proof that the CIA did it. I was flabbergasted, and started to give this kind of thinking as an example in speaking to "educated" Pakistani's - and among these, those that did agree that the earthquake was NOT the work of the CIA, they would start giving other examples, notably the Blow up of the plane carrying Zia ul Haq an ex President of Pakistan, in which the US Ambassador also perished. When I would point this out, the response would be that that is the sort of thing they do to take away suspicion from themselves.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the impression I came away with is, there is NO war of civilizations going on. What is going on is a war between literacy and illiteracy.</p>
<p>Taliban are not visible in the areas I visited, but the militants handiwork clearly is - as elsewhere, the common criminals are taking advantage of this situation, and crime is up significantly. One new crime is Cell phone "snatching" - it's easy and nobody wants to pursue it. If some one is using a Razr phone, he can expect to be hit soon if he uses it in public. So people have two cell phones, one fancy to show off, and one for use in public places. </p>
<p>Insofar as "foreign" militants are captured and identified, that is to say non-Pashtun (including non Afghan Pashtun or Pak Pashtun) - then the people are obviously in agreement with the government that these people don't belong here and need to go. </p>
<p>The problem is this: the foreigners are usually in the FATA and have been there since the Soviet war times. Many of them have taken local wives and now have a family. The local have accepted them into their family. Now for the Pak govt to ask them to kick them out, the locals are thinking what am I doing to my grandchildren's father, etc. Again the edicts of Pashtunwali also play a role.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What is the relationship, if any, between the Taliban and Al Qaeda?</hi></p>
<p>Al Qaeda is mostly composed of Arabs, they do not trust any one else. While they might use others as couriers or in lowly position as servants, for second rate Al Qaeda officials, the Top guys ONLY deal with Arabs and are served by Arabs. </p>
<p>The Taliban are mostly Pashtun tribesmen. Mostly they are graduates of madrassa's. Mostly illiterate by any world standards. The better educated among them will know how to speak a few words of English, such as their Information minister. There might be one or two notable exceptions of which I am not aware. </p>
<p>However, while Al Qaeda does not trust the Taliban, the Taliban look up to Al Qaeda top leadership. We saw this situation in Iraq where initially Al Zarqawi had no direct link with Qaeda but was keen to form one. It would be conjecture on my part to state that in the end he did indeed succeed in forming that connection. In the press at least that impression was prevalent.</p>
<p>So the lines of interest proceed ONE way, like one way traffic. Extremist want to be affiliated with Qaeda, in my opinion, while the latter does not, so as to maintain its hideout. </p>
<p>The Qaeda supply lines are hampered, new recruits would have to be Arabs, and they would have to travel a long way through tight Pakistani security to reach here, or suffer hardship over a long and arduous land route through Balochistan and the Tribal area's - NOT all of which are accommodating. </p>
<p>So as is becoming clear, Qaeda is having trouble replacing people they loose meaning those that were captured or died. They only trust Arabs, and that also a certain type of Arabs, (not all Arabs are the same, not all Arabic is the same - for example they would never trust a Syrian, in fact Qaeda folks consider Syrian brand of Islam an apostasy - but that is another story). </p>
<p>Whatever remains of the Qaeda, are not in a position to set up training camps, since they are in a survival mode. The Taliban resurgence helps them get a little warm and fuzzy in this survival mode, since they feel a little bit more secure with their partners-in-arms doing some evil stuff, blowing up people and causing mayhem.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What makes the North-West Frontier Province competent to administer money sent as foreign aid?</hi></p>
<p>This is the central question. Much like California has taken a separate initiative on stem cell research – as an analogy – the NWFP is central to the war on terror, not Pakistan. </p>
<p>The NWFP was central to the fight and aid to the Afghans during the Soviet occupation, not Pakistan. </p>
<p>This small distinction is lost on Washington, and it is the main reason, in my opinion, why so much of the Aid was "lost in transit" was because the Punjabi army officers could not bring themselves to dispense such large sums to an ethnic group which it considers anti-Pakistani. </p>
<p>All the FATA is contiguous to the NWFP.  The Taliban and Al-Qaeda are holed up somewhere either in the FATA, or across the Durand Line in Afghanistan; the Durand Line has never been recognized by the locals as an international boundary. Even today, the Pashtun travel from Peshawar to Kabul by road with out a passport or visa, and it has been like that for eons.</p>
<p>The present governor of the NWFP belongs to the Orakzai tribe (he spells his name Aorakzai) and it is my opinion that that he was picked partly because he belongs to one of the FATA as well as he is a retired General of the Pak Army. </p>
<p>The Frontier Constabulary (FC) is a force which primarily recruits from the FATA. All or most of its forces are from the various tribes. In the eyes of the tribes this is a bona fide force and service with the FC is considered an honorable thing. The US has already allocated some funds for increasing recruitment, but far less than what it would take to counter the Taliban and far less than what the economic need is. The US spends a thousand times more on a battalions sent to monitor activity over there. Plus why endanger the lives of our troops and spread our forces thin when a more effective job can be done by the FC. The FC has over history shown that they will attack and use force against the tribes that create trouble. There have been no instances of insubordination or mutiny.</p>
<p>Even the US Embassy is protected by a contingent of the FC! That goes to show their trustworthiness and discipline.</p>
<p>The "tribal" Pashtuns in the FATA are not educated or trained and hence not employable right now. I propose that we fund directly the Director of Emigrants, Mr. Azhar Arbab in Islamabad, to set up training facilities in Concrete laying, iron work, pipe work, welding etc, which would then qualify these tribesmen to obtain jobs in the Gulf. As such we would remove them from the scene altogether. They would not be available in the labor pool to the Taliban or anyone else. I might add here, that a number of these individuals have very high innate intelligence, which is one reason they make formidable foes. </p>
<p>Now the central reason why the NWFP ought to do this is because they are themselves most affected by the scourge of Talibanization. They are highly motivated in carrying out these policies because it is to their own benefit. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">How many men does the FC field currently?</hi></p>
<p>The FC currently has about 23,000 men in total.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">How much do they get paid?</hi></p>
<p>They are paid the equivalent of $60 per month per person -Pak Rupees 3665, where Rs61= $1.
They do have some fringe benefits but life is very spartan for these soldiers. </p>
<p>What the US could get in return is a huge bang for a buck, no pun intended. </p>
<p>I think we ought to double the number of these soldiers with one proviso that the FC maintains its high standards of recruits.</p>
<p>Compare this with our costs in the War against Terror; just Halliburton’s bills will have you reeling. I think that it would be foolish, NOT to do this. </p>
<p>The Frontier Constabulary is an Institution with a long and glorious history within the Frontier Province.</p>
<p>The recruits come strictly from the tribes of the various FATA and so they are very familiar with the people, the bad guys the terrain.</p>
<p>They speak the Pashto dialect of the locals. The Pashto language has many dialects, and you can tell where someone is from based on which dialect he speaks. So if you do not speak the correct dialect, you are immediately identified as an outsider. This is one reason why these tribes are impossible to penetrate, there are other reasons as well, that are beyond the scope of the current discussion.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">How can the FC help prevent attacks like the suicide bombing attempt on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftab%20Ahmad%20Khan%20Sherpao">Sherpao</ref> in Charsadda last weekend?</hi></p>
<p>In essence your question is how can <hi rend="italic">anyone</hi> prevent a suicide attack?
And frankly if I knew the answer to that I think the US military - and several other groups - would be knocking on my door. I think the Israeli Army has had the most experience with this sort of thing. The suicide bombing as a tactical weapon was invented by the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, and even today in terms of statistics they use it in far greater numbers.</p>
<p>So to summarize neither the FC nor anyone else can prevent a suicide bombing. We could attempt to improve our intelligence to find out about an imminent attack, but so far these have not been very successful in Pakistan.</p>
<p>In the Lal Masjid Case the government avoided a suicide killing by negotiating with those two Mullah brothers - but I don't know if that counts. But it does make for an interesting story. Both Washington, DC and Islamabad now have Madams threatening to publish the list of their clients unless they are given protection. Who would have thunk?</p>
<p>Going back to your question: In my opinion what ought to be done is to make a <hi rend="bold">Policy</hi> change, and address the issues that are producing these suicide bombers, that is the only way to stop this phenomenon. </p>
<p>In this part of the world this is relatively new because prior to 9/11, suicide bombing was unheard of. Moreover it is not the FC's job to provide security to the Minister of the Interior, that is the job of the Police force, because this Ministry is equivalent to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>You don't expect Border patrol to provide body guard duty to the Secretary of the department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>I am making these analogies so the American readers would relate to what is happening, and understand the difference in nomenclature. --<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:RHakeem">RHakeem</ref> 20:13, 3 May 2007 (UTC)</p>
