<p><hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> on Sunday interviewed <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepa%20Malik">Deepa Malik</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/India">India</ref>'s first female <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Paralympics">Paralympic</ref> medalist, who won the silver medal in the Women's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shot%20put">Shot Put</ref> F53 event finals, at the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Paralympics">2016 Summer Paralympics</ref> being held in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Brazil">Brazil</ref>.</p>
<p>Malik lost the gold medal to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bahrain">Bahrain</ref>'s Fatema Nedham, who had the best throw 4.76 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metre">metres</ref>, setting a new regional record in paralympic women's shot put.</p>
<p>Arriving in Rio, Malik had initial trouble due to the airline losing her luggage; it didn't all arrive until three days later: clothes, opening ceremony outfit and equipment including competition belts.</p>
<p>In early August there was a possibly that Malik might lose her spot on the Indian team going to Rio, with fellow female para athlete Karam Jyoti challenging Malik's selection and the Sport's Authority of Indian's selection process at the High Court of Delhi. The high court ruled against the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Both of these events occurred against the wider backdrop of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic%20Committee%20of%20India">Paralympic Committee of India</ref> being suspended by the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/International_Paralympic_Committee">International Paralympic Committee</ref>.  The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports%20Authority%20of%20India">Sports Authority of India</ref> took final authority over the Paralympic Committee of India for sending a team to Rio, with agreement from the International Paralympic Committee; this arrangement allowed India to compete under their own flag at the 2016 Summer Paralympics.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>   Congratulations on your result.</p>
<hi rend="bold">Deepa Malik</hi>: Thank you so much.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Even though you are currently waiting in terms of the end result of the protest.</p>
<hi rend="bold">DM</hi>:  Absolutely, but I'm happy with my performance, I'm happy that I could improve and I could prove myself, there were a lot of questions back home on my selection and on my hard work. My single-minded focus that I had put into this journey of being a Paralympian. Well, I am just so anxious about the results.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  So how much did the court case and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM">KLM</ref> losing your luggage impact on your preparations and your result today?</p>
<hi rend="bold">DM</hi>:  Yes, but I'm happy that my husband was my coach here, and, so, I had huge moral support in terms of keeping my mind and everything in peace. Most of the equipment was available in the gym, we had to alter the training a bit like the throw days couldn't happen, so we instead exercised. No, I think that is what sports teaches you, you can't live on excuses, I never lived on excuses.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  You work around things.</p>
<hi rend="bold">DM</hi>:  Yes, that's what we do, that's what a sportsman is suppose to do, rise again, and then fall and rise, and run, and I did exactly that.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  What message should other Indian women take away from your participation and result in Rio?</p>
<hi rend="bold">DM</hi>:  This is going to be the first female medal that India would have ever won in Paralympics and as it is I'm working aggressively towards transforming this entire concept of empowerment for the women, especially the women in disabilities in my country. So I'm really happy that this medal give my voice more value, more strength, and I'll be able to impact even more, though on the ninth of September the Prime Minister's jury has awarded me with the award of Women Transforming India, I'm so happy that within three days of getting that award, I have added another feather to it and proved that yes this journey of ability beyond disability. And not just disability, this is a universal message that if women put their minds to their dreams they can balance it; age, gender, disability, is all a state of mind. If you put your passion and hard work, you can get it, and in the Indian scenario were they say infrastructure is a challenge, women participation that are taboo, religiously and psychologically, disabilities taken as a curse, dependability[?] increases because of lack of infrastructure, well, time to get rid of the excuses. We have to start erasing the excuses and believe your own self and that's the message I'm carrying with all the activities that I do whether it is car rallying, motorbiking or swimming across a river, every record or every unique activity that I've undertaken and just below paralysis has been aimed at changing the stereotypical image of a women and also a women in disability.  
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Will you and your daughter both be trying to represent India at the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2020_Summer_Paralympics">2020 Games</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</ref>?</p>
<hi rend="bold">DM</hi>:  I'm very sure about myself, but my daughter, though, she's a Paralympian, yes, which again was considered a huge taboo in my society that oh my god both the mother and the daughter both have a physical disability, what is going to happen to these two, but we did good and she is working as a youth council representative in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</ref> countries, for the Paralympics specially, and her work though her foundation called Wheeling Happiness has earned her the young leader award from the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II">Queen of England</ref>, so I guess her focus is now shifting to more on community service and empowering others and not just herself. And she is leaving on first of October to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough%20University">Loughborough</ref> to do her PhD doctorate programme in disability sports psychology, I'm very sure Loughborough is going to give her a huge amount of sports [inaudible] but how much time she going to decide to devote to sports and studies is her decision entirely. That's her dream, her journey. 
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  How helpful was the Sports Authority of India in preparing and supporting your Rio ambitions? </p>
<hi rend="bold">DM</hi>:  I think 100 per cent, because the biggest challenge we have back home is a customised training, or the infrastructure for that matter, so we were given the ability and the funds to train the way <hi rend="italic">we</hi> wanted to train, and the funds were huge which were given to us, out accommodation, food, diet, physical therapist, psychologist, trainer, gym, everything was paid for, and customised, you want it and they give it. So I guess this was easy financially this time, because every expenses was taken care of, my husband could also take a sabbatical from his job and join my journey, and having him twenty-four seven and coaching me because he himself is an athlete, and have the best diet and counselling. I think it's worked wonders, so I give shout out and a huge applaud.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  How important was it for you to have a carer in Rio?</p>
<hi rend="bold">DM</hi>:  Yes, again we really have to appreciate the sports authority of India and also Paralympic Committee of India, which is going to start to function post-Rio in India. They were very very quick, they were very very adamant in giving the wheelchair people escorts.  And I need help twenty four seven, I'm just below paralysed so it was really huge, emotionally, mentally, psychically training-wise, every way I think the situation was perfect.
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Thank you for your time.</p>
<hi rend="bold">DM</hi>:  Thank you.
