Interview
<p><hi rend="bold">Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process? Why did you choose to run in this constituency?</hi></p>
I chose to involve myself in the political process when approached by a person locally who was keenly interested in respect for life, from conception to natural death, the preservation of the traditional family and freedom to act in accordance with one’s conscience in addition to the individual’s right to speak out against actions and activities that one is not in agreement with.
<p><hi rend="bold">Which of your competitors do you expect to pose the biggest challenge to your candidacy? Why?</hi></p>
My stance is not in opposition to any party it is in support of the principles of life, freedom of speech and the preservation of traditional marriage thus, the traditional family, which is the heartbeat of our nation.
<p><hi rend="bold">What makes you the most desirable of all candidates running in the riding?</hi></p>
I may not be the most desirable candidate, however I have gained considerable support for having the ‘courage’ to stand up and speak for the unborn and for values that contribute to a strong and healthy society. My entire career life has been spent working with people in the medical, sales and teaching fields in an administrative, managerial and front-line worker capacity. This intimate association with people of all ages and from all walks of life has deepened my sensitivity to the needs and concerns of members of society. I care!
<p><hi rend="bold">What do you feel are the three most important issues to voters in your riding? Are these the same top three issues that are most important to you? What would you do to address these issues?</hi></p>
The voters in my riding are passionately against abortion, they believe that same-sex marriage is an abomination and that the family is the nucleus of a strong and healthy society.
Health care delivery is a concern. The FCP will not use public funds for abortion, euthanasia and sex-change operations. The FCP supports expansion of programs for midwives (in teams with doctors), nurse practitioners and physician-assistants for salaried service, in rural areas and in those communities where the local Hospital Board deems it necessary.
The FCP Will insist that there be no cover-up of information related to the transmission of viruses, the link between abortion and breast cancer and the inadequacy of condoms against some viruses.
The Family Coalition party would create a responsible free enterprise climate, with government intervention limited to the enforcement of the entrepreneur’s responsibilities in such areas as work safety and protection.
It would reform the school system to prepare young people for assuming the challenge of change and responsibility for innovation, to create a vibrant economy in Ontario. We will help the private sector to create jobs by reducing taxes to stimulate investment and increase the buying power of the average citizen.
People must keep in mind a quote from my own mother when speaking to a grade eight graduating class years ago: The world owes you nothing if you contribute nothing.
The Family Coalition Party will require a person’s juvenile record to be released upon the first adult conviction and will require a person who is convicted of a violent offence for which he/she has been previously convicted to serve the balance of the previous unserved sentence. In addition the maximum sentence for the current conviction will be doubled, without possibility for parole.
<p>We believe that no person living below the poverty line should pay taxes.</p>
The Family Coalition Party will restore freedom of speech of pro-life individuals or groups, including their freedom to demonstrate peacefully in front of hospitals, abortion clinics or any other place of their choice. In addition, The Family Coalition Party will urge the federal government to restore full legal protection to all human beings, from the moment of conception to natural death.
<p><hi rend="bold">What should be the first order of business in the 39th Legislative Assembly?</hi></p>
The first order of business in the 39th Legislative Assembly should be, in accordance with the wishes of the people from across Canada as demonstrated in a recent pole, to put an end to abortion. The public is also concerned with job loss and crime in our streets.
<p><hi rend="bold">Are the property taxes in your riding at a fair level for the amount of services received in the municipality?</hi></p>
The Family Coalition Party would cut taxes by reducing the budgets of all government Agencies, Boards and Commissions by 10% the first year and initiate a review the second year with a view of eliminating as many of them as possible.
<p><hi rend="bold">How can the province lead the way in stimulating job creation?</hi></p>
The decision to index support payment programs to inflation was a positive move made by the 38th Legislative Assembly, but left most recipients still short of what they need to live. The health tax was a heavy burden placed on low income members of society.
<p>The FPTP system - now used in Ontario- is intrinsically unfair, as the results of an election are heavily influenced by the polls, trends, personalities of the leaders, which affect the delicate balance identifying, in public opinion, the perceived winner. Once the voting has concluded, there is no attempt to assign the seats in the legislature according to the plurality of the votes received.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What are your views on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed%20member%20proportional%20representation">mixed member proportional representation</ref> (MMP) referendum?</hi></p>
The (MMP) Mixed Member Proportional system tries to correct the unfairness by using 39 ‘party list’ seats to balance the seat assignment according to the plurality received in the election. One advantage of this system is that it is more adaptable to the needs of the province. We ( and our future generations) will have to make sure that these changes are not done for political purposes or for the benefit of some interest group.
<p><hi rend="bold">What role, if any, does “new media” play in your campaign, and the campaign of your party? (websites, blogs, Facebook, YouTube videos, etc) Do you view it as beneficial, or a challenge?</hi></p>
The new media is an effective way of communicating information instantaneously and pervasively.
<p><hi rend="bold">Of the decisions made by Ontario's 38th Legislative Assembly, which was the most beneficial to your this electoral district? To the province as a whole? Which was least beneficial, or even harmful, to your this riding? To the province as a whole?</hi></p>
