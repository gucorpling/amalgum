<segment id="1" parent="1001" relname="preparation">4. Discussion</segment>
<segment id="2" parent="1002" relname="preparation">Consistent with our broad hypothesis , migrant workers , especially non-ESC-born and recently arrived migrants , experienced higher job insecurity than Australia-born workers .</segment>
<segment id="3" parent="1003" relname="preparation">These disparities gradually decreased</segment>
<segment id="4" parent="1004" relname="preparation">as years since arrival in Australia increased ,</segment>
<segment id="5" parent="1006" relname="attribution">becoming similar to Australia-born workers after 11+ years post-arrival ,</segment>
<segment id="6" parent="1006" relname="span">with a notable exception regarding highly educated migrants ,</segment>
<segment id="7" parent="6" relname="purpose">for whom disparities persisted .</segment>
<segment id="8" parent="1004" relname="joint">Importantly , the migrant status – job insecurity relationships in our study were not confounded by gender , age , educational attainment , or occupational skill level .</segment>
<segment id="9" parent="1004" relname="joint">However , migrant status – job insecurity relationships were modified by educational attainment ,</segment>
<segment id="10" parent="1004" relname="joint">and the disparities in job insecurity between non-ESC-born migrants and Australia-born workers increased with increasing educational attainment , contrary to expectation .</segment>
<segment id="11" parent="1012" relname="span">There are a limited number of previous studies</segment>
<segment id="12" parent="1013" relname="span">directly comparing job insecurity between migrant workers and native workers ,</segment>
<segment id="13" parent="14" relname="attribution">with most of them reporting</segment>
<segment id="14" parent="1014" relname="span">that migrant workers experienced higher job insecurity .</segment>
<segment id="15" parent="16" relname="attribution">For example , Kim-Godwin and Bechtel showed</segment>
<segment id="16" parent="1016" relname="span">that migrant farmworkers reported high job insecurity in the US ,</segment>
<segment id="17" parent="18" relname="attribution">and Font , Moncada , Llorens , and Benavides reported</segment>
<segment id="18" parent="1017" relname="span">that migrant workers experienced higher job insecurity in Spain .</segment>
<segment id="19" parent="1004" relname="joint">Null results were also reported .</segment>
<segment id="20" parent="1021" relname="span">An Australian study</segment>
<segment id="21" parent="1022" relname="span">restricted to skilled migrants found no significant difference in job insecurity</segment>
<segment id="22" parent="21" relname="elaboration">compared to Australia-born workers ,</segment>
<segment id="23" parent="24" relname="attribution">and Torá et al. also reported</segment>
<segment id="24" parent="1023" relname="span">that migrant workers showed no significant difference in job insecurity compared to Spanish-born workers .</segment>
<segment id="25" parent="1025" relname="span">In addition to differences between countries , inconsistencies in the results of our study</segment>
<segment id="26" parent="25" relname="elaboration">compared to previous studies may have been due to differences in the samples , job stressor measurements , and analytical methods .</segment>
<segment id="27" parent="1027" relname="span">For example , some studies looked at job insecurity in specific occupational groups , such as farmworkers ,</segment>
<segment id="28" parent="27" relname="manner">without comparison to reference groups .</segment>
<segment id="29" parent="1029" relname="contrast">Some studies compared migrants to native-born workers ,</segment>
<segment id="30" parent="1030" relname="span">but did not study migrant subgroups</segment>
<segment id="31" parent="30" relname="elaboration">based on language proficiency or time since arrival in the host country .</segment>
<segment id="32" parent="1031" relname="joint">Finally , job insecurity measures vary between studies .</segment>
<segment id="33" parent="1033" relname="span">Job insecurity in McGuinness and Wooden was measured by the percent chance of involuntary job loss , re-employment prospects , and intention to quit .</segment>
<segment id="34" parent="1035" relname="span">Calculation methods for job insecurity may also have differed ;</segment>
<segment id="35" parent="1036" relname="span">some studies used binary job insecurity ,</segment>
<segment id="36" parent="35" relname="circumstance">while we treated job insecurity as a continuous measure .</segment>
<segment id="37" parent="1039" relname="attribution">With respect to research question one , our finding</segment>
<segment id="38" parent="1039" relname="joint">that the disparities in job insecurity were more significant among non-ESC-born migrants</segment>
<segment id="39" parent="1039" relname="joint">and decreased with increasing years post-arrival in Australia may indicate an acculturation effect .</segment>
<segment id="40" parent="1040" relname="joint">This may be explained by new migrants , especially those with low English proficiency ,</segment>
<segment id="41" parent="1041" relname="contrast">being more likely to find temporary or lower quality jobs ,</segment>
<segment id="42" parent="1042" relname="span">or having a higher risk of job loss</segment>
<segment id="43" parent="1043" relname="span">due to their low language skills , unfamiliarity with local policies , or discrimination ,</segment>
<segment id="44" parent="43" relname="elaboration">which would correlate with lower job security .</segment>
<segment id="45" parent="1046" relname="attribution">With respect to research question two , we found</segment>
<segment id="46" parent="1046" relname="span">that only educational level was a significant effect</segment>
<segment id="47" parent="46" relname="elaboration">modifier of migrant status – job insecurity relationships .</segment>
<segment id="48" parent="1047" relname="joint">Language difficulties may be more notable among newly arrived , low-educated migrants ,</segment>
<segment id="49" parent="1049" relname="preparation">and this may partly explain the result</segment>
<segment id="50" parent="1050" relname="span">that migrant workers with high school or lower educational attainment had the highest levels of job insecurity in the first five years since arrival .</segment>
<segment id="51" parent="1051" relname="span">Over time , these people may have improved chances of finding better jobs with better job security .</segment>
<segment id="52" parent="1054" relname="attribution">Further , we observed an unexpected finding</segment>
<segment id="53" parent="1054" relname="span">that the disparities in job insecurity persisted among highly educated non-ESC-born migrants even 11+ years post-arrival ,</segment>
<segment id="54" parent="53" relname="elaboration">which may be partly explained by language difficulties having persistent adverse effects on work experience among highly educated migrant workers .</segment>
<segment id="55" parent="1055" relname="span">Highly educated migrants were more likely to be employed in professional jobs ,</segment>
<segment id="56" parent="55" relname="elaboration">which require a high level of language skills .</segment>
<segment id="57" parent="1057" relname="span">Non-ESC-born migrants may have more language difficulties in a functional communication context ,</segment>
<segment id="58" parent="57" relname="elaboration">which may result in a perceived higher risk of future job loss .</segment>
<segment id="59" parent="1060" relname="span">For example , language difficulty was regarded as the primary weakness of international medical residents in hospitals ,</segment>
<segment id="60" parent="1061" relname="span">which may result in a high risk</segment>
<segment id="61" parent="60" relname="elaboration">of obtaining negative feedback and failure to register ,</segment>
<segment id="62" parent="1059" relname="joint">thereby leading to increased job insecurity .</segment>
<segment id="63" parent="1058" relname="joint">Therefore , continuing language training or language training for a specific purpose may be beneficial to highly educated migrants .</segment>
