<segment id="2" parent="1002" relname="preparation">MR .</segment>
<segment id="3" parent="1003" relname="span">SILAS Q. SCUDDAMORE was a young American of a simple and harmless disposition ,</segment>
<segment id="4" parent="1004" relname="span">which was the more to his credit</segment>
<segment id="5" parent="1005" relname="span">as he came from New England — a quarter of the New World</segment>
<segment id="6" parent="5" relname="elaboration">not precisely famous for those qualities .</segment>
<segment id="7" parent="1007" relname="preparation">Although he was exceedingly rich ,</segment>
<segment id="8" parent="1007" relname="joint">he kept a note of all his expenses in a little paper pocket-book ;</segment>
<segment id="9" parent="1009" relname="preparation">and he had chosen to study the attractions of Paris from the seventh story of what is called a furnished hotel , in the Latin Quarter .</segment>
<segment id="10" parent="1009" relname="joint">There was a great deal of habit in his penuriousness ;</segment>
<segment id="11" parent="1011" relname="span">and his virtue ,</segment>
<segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration">which was very remarkable among his associates , was principally founded upon diffidence and youth .</segment>
<segment id="13" parent="1013" relname="span">The next room to his was inhabited by a lady , very attractive in her air and very elegant in toilette ,</segment>
<segment id="14" parent="13" relname="purpose">whom , on his first arrival , he had taken for a Countess .</segment>
<segment id="15" parent="1017" relname="attribution">In course of time he had learned</segment>
<segment id="16" parent="1017" relname="sequence">that she was known by the name of Madame Zéphyrine ,</segment>
<segment id="17" parent="1017" relname="sequence">and that whatever station she occupied in life it was not that of a person of title .</segment>
<segment id="18" parent="1019" relname="span">Madame Zéphyrine , probably in the hope</segment>
<segment id="19" parent="18" relname="elaboration">of enchanting the young American ,</segment>
<segment id="20" parent="1015" relname="sequence">used to flaunt by him on the stairs with a civil inclination , a word of course , and a knock-down look out of her black eyes ,</segment>
<segment id="21" parent="1015" relname="sequence">and disappear in a rustle of silk , and with the revelation of an admirable foot and ankle .</segment>
<segment id="22" parent="1022" relname="span">But these advances , so far from encouraging Mr. Scuddamore , plunged him into the depths of depression and bashfulness .</segment>
<segment id="23" parent="1024" relname="contrast">She had come to him several times for a light ,</segment>
<segment id="24" parent="1024" relname="contrast">or to apologise for the imaginary depredations of her poodle ;</segment>
<segment id="25" parent="1025" relname="sequence">but his mouth was closed in the presence of so superior a being ,</segment>
<segment id="26" parent="1026" relname="sequence">his French promptly left him ,</segment>
<segment id="27" parent="1027" relname="span">and he could only stare and stammer</segment>
<segment id="28" parent="27" relname="circumstance">until she was gone .</segment>
<segment id="29" parent="1029" relname="span">The slenderness of their intercourse did not prevent him from throwing out insinuations of a very glorious order</segment>
<segment id="30" parent="29" relname="circumstance">when he was safely alone with a few males .</segment>
<segment id="31" parent="1031" relname="span">The room on the other side of the American ’s —</segment>
<segment id="32" parent="1032" relname="span">for there were three rooms on a floor in the hotel</segment>
<segment id="33" parent="32" relname="elaboration">— was tenanted by an old English physician of rather doubtful reputation .</segment>
<segment id="34" parent="1034" relname="span">Dr. Noel ,</segment>
<segment id="35" parent="1035" relname="span">for that was his name , had been forced to leave London ,</segment>
<segment id="36" parent="1036" relname="joint">where he enjoyed a large and increasing practice ;</segment>
<segment id="37" parent="38" relname="attribution">and it was hinted</segment>
<segment id="38" parent="1037" relname="span">that the police had been the instigators of this change of scene .</segment>
<segment id="39" parent="1040" relname="span">At least he ,</segment>
<segment id="40" parent="39" relname="elaboration">who had made something of a figure in earlier life , now dwelt in the Latin Quarter in great simplicity and solitude ,</segment>
<segment id="41" parent="1041" relname="span">and devoted much of his time</segment>
<segment id="42" parent="41" relname="purpose">to study .</segment>
<segment id="43" parent="1043" relname="joint">Mr. Scuddamore had made his acquaintance ,</segment>
<segment id="44" parent="1043" relname="joint">and the pair would now and then dine together frugally in a restaurant across the street .</segment>
<segment id="45" parent="1045" relname="joint">Silas Q. Scuddamore had many little vices of the more respectable order ,</segment>
<segment id="46" parent="1046" relname="span">and was not restrained by delicacy</segment>
<segment id="47" parent="46" relname="elaboration">from indulging them in many rather doubtful ways .</segment>
<segment id="48" parent="1048" relname="preparation">Chief among his foibles stood curiosity .</segment>
<segment id="49" parent="1048" relname="joint">He was a born gossip ;</segment>
<segment id="50" parent="1051" relname="span">and life , and especially those parts of it</segment>
<segment id="51" parent="1052" relname="same_unit">in which he had no experience ,</segment>
<segment id="52" parent="1052" relname="same_unit">interested him to the degree of passion .</segment>
<segment id="53" parent="1053" relname="span">He was a pert , invincible questioner ,</segment>
<segment id="54" parent="1054" relname="span">pushing his inquiries with equal pertinacity and indiscretion ;</segment>
<segment id="55" parent="1055" relname="span">he had been observed ,</segment>
<segment id="56" parent="1056" relname="span">when he took a letter to the post ,</segment>
<segment id="57" parent="1057" relname="span">to weigh it in his hand ,</segment>
<segment id="58" parent="1058" relname="joint">to turn it over and over ,</segment>
<segment id="59" parent="1059" relname="joint">and to study the address with care ;</segment>
<segment id="60" parent="1060" relname="span">and when he found a flaw in the partition between his room and Madame Zéphyrine ’s ,</segment>
<segment id="61" parent="1061" relname="span">instead of filling it up ,</segment>
<segment id="62" parent="1062" relname="joint">he enlarged and improved the opening ,</segment>
<segment id="63" parent="1062" relname="joint">and made use of it as a spy-hole on his neighbour ’s affairs .</segment>
<segment id="64" parent="1064" relname="span">One day , in the end of March ,</segment>
<segment id="65" parent="1065" relname="same_unit">his curiosity growing</segment>
<segment id="66" parent="1067" relname="circumstance">as it was indulged ,</segment>
<segment id="67" parent="1067" relname="span">he enlarged the hole a little further ,</segment>
<segment id="68" parent="67" relname="purpose">so that he might command another corner of the room .</segment>
<segment id="69" parent="1069" relname="span">That evening ,</segment>
<segment id="70" parent="1070" relname="span">when he went as usual</segment>
<segment id="71" parent="1071" relname="joint">to inspect Madame Zéphyrine ’s movements ,</segment>
<segment id="72" parent="1072" relname="sequence">he was astonished to find the aperture obscured in an odd manner on the other side ,</segment>
<segment id="73" parent="1073" relname="span">and still more abashed</segment>
<segment id="74" parent="1074" relname="sequence">when the obstacle was suddenly withdrawn</segment>
<segment id="75" parent="1074" relname="sequence">and a titter of laughter reached his ears .</segment>
<segment id="76" parent="1076" relname="joint">Some of the plaster had evidently betrayed the secret of his spy-hole ,</segment>
<segment id="77" parent="1076" relname="joint">and his neighbour had been returning the compliment in kind .</segment>
<segment id="78" parent="1078" relname="span">Mr. Scuddamore was moved to a very acute feeling of annoyance ;</segment>
<segment id="79" parent="1079" relname="span">he condemned Madame Zéphyrine unmercifully ;</segment>
<segment id="80" parent="1080" relname="contrast">he even blamed himself ;</segment>
<segment id="81" parent="1081" relname="same_unit">but</segment>
<segment id="82" parent="1083" relname="circumstance">when he found , next day ,</segment>
<segment id="83" parent="1084" relname="span">that she had taken no means</segment>
<segment id="84" parent="83" relname="purpose">to baulk him of his favourite pastime ,</segment>
<segment id="85" parent="1085" relname="sequence">he continued to profit by her carelessness ,</segment>
<segment id="86" parent="1085" relname="sequence">and gratify his idle curiosity .</segment>
<segment id="87" parent="1087" relname="span">That next day Madame Zéphyrine received a long visit from a tall , loosely-built man of fifty or upwards ,</segment>
<segment id="88" parent="87" relname="elaboration">whom Silas had not hitherto seen .</segment>
<segment id="89" parent="1090" relname="span">His tweed suit and coloured shirt , no less than his shaggy side-whiskers ,</segment>
<segment id="90" parent="89" relname="elaboration">identified him as a Britisher ,</segment>
<segment id="91" parent="1089" relname="joint">and his dull grey eye affected Silas with a sense of cold .</segment>
<segment id="92" parent="1092" relname="span">He kept screwing his mouth from side to side and round and round during the whole colloquy ,</segment>
<segment id="93" parent="92" relname="elaboration">which was carried on in whispers .</segment>
<segment id="94" parent="1094" relname="span">More than once it seemed to the young New Englander</segment>
<segment id="95" parent="1095" relname="contrast">as if their gestures indicated his own apartment ;</segment>
<segment id="96" parent="1096" relname="span">but the only thing</segment>
<segment id="97" parent="1097" relname="span">definite he could gather by the most scrupulous attention was this remark</segment>
<segment id="98" parent="1098" relname="span">made by the Englishman in a somewhat higher key ,</segment>
<segment id="99" parent="98" relname="manner">as if in answer to some reluctance or opposition .</segment>
<segment id="100" parent="1099" relname="joint">“ I have studied his taste to a nicety ,</segment>
<segment id="101" parent="102" relname="attribution">and I tell you again and again you are the only woman of the sort</segment>
<segment id="102" parent="1100" relname="span">that I can lay my hands on . ”</segment>
