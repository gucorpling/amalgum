About	RB
one	CD

petroleum-based	JJ
PMF	NN
is	VBZ
consumed	VBN
annually	RB
in	IN
the	DT

However	RB
,	,
petroleum-based	JJ
PMF	NN
is	VBZ
not	RB
easily	RB
degraded	VBN
in	IN
farmland	NN
,	,
and	CC
its	PRP$
bio-degradation	NN
rate	NN
is	VBZ
very	RB
low	JJ
even	RB
after	IN

Furthermore	RB

often	RB
cause	VBP
