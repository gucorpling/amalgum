Introduction B-SENT

Research B-SENT
on O
adult-learned O
second O
language O
( O

has O
provided O
considerable O
insight O

the O
neurocognitive O
mechanisms O

that O

despite O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
difficulties O
in O
acquiring O

it O

it O

substantial O
periods O
( O

of O

following O
L2 O

are O
not O
uncommon O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
may O
even O
be O
the O
norm O
[ O

Such B-SENT
a O
scenario O
may O
be O
found O
in O
different O
situations O
, O
including O

-DOCSTART- X

when O
one O
studies O
a O

in O
a O
classroom O
and O
then O
stops O
taking O
classes O
[ O

[ O

and O

-DOCSTART- X

when O
one O
is O
immersed O
in O
a O
foreign O
language O
setting O
and O
then O
moves O
away O

In B-SENT
the O
present O
study O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
we O
examine O
the O
outcomes O
of O
such O
a O
period O
of O

on O
the O
neurocognition O
of O

Overall B-SENT

the O
results O
of O
the O
six O

been O

taken O
to O
suggest O
the O
following O
. O

A B-SENT
period O
of O
limited O

generally O
leads O
to O
attrition O

Such B-SENT
loss O
has O

been O
observed O
after O
as O
little O
as O
a O
few O
months O

Although B-SENT
attrition O
may O
take O
place O
within O

some O

that O
it O

Higher B-SENT
levels O
of O

Finally B-SENT
, O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
some O
cases O
a O

only O
for O
some O
abilities O

2015 O
, O
an O

was O
started O
to O
set O
up O
a O
Dutch O
speaking O

-DOCSTART- X

DH+Lib O
community O
in O
the O
Netherlands O
and O
Belgium O
, O
based O
on O
the O

of O

, O

‘ O

meet O
’ O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


At B-SENT
the O
initial O
meeting O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
most O
participants O
were O
there O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
digital O
humanities O
and O
were O
not O

-DOCSTART- X

( O
yet O
) O
in O
the O
situation O
where O
they O
were O
able O
to O
offer O
expertise O
on O
the O
subject O
. O

On B-SENT
the O
administrative O
level O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
the O
directors O
of O
the O
libraries O
participating O
in O
the O
consortium O
of O
Dutch O
academic O
libraries O
( O
UKB O
) O
also O
expressed O
the O
wish O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
librarians O
become O
more O
fluent O
in O
DH O
. O

A B-SENT
year O
later O
, O
the O
National O
Library O
of O
the O
Netherlands O
( O
Koninklijke O
Bibliotheek O

-DOCSTART- X

) O
, O
and O
the O
University O
Library O
of O
the O
Vrije O
Universiteit O
Amsterdam O
again O
concluded O
that O
librarians O
at O
their O
institutes O
who O
wanted O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

get O
involved O
in O
DH O
needed O
more O
training O
to O
adequately O
support O
researchers O
and O
students O
in O
this O
field O
. O

Therefore B-SENT
both O
institutes O
joined O

-DOCSTART- X

forces O
to O
develop O
a O
set O
of O
clinics O
on O
DH O
for O
librarians O
. O

The B-SENT
two O
institutes O
were O
later O
joined O
by O
the O
Leiden O

-DOCSTART- X

University O
Libraries O
. O

We B-SENT
see O
this O
as O
the O
ideal O
opportunity O
to O
provide O
these O
educative O
sessions O
not O
only O
to O
our O
own O
librarians O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
but O
also O
to O
the O
academic O
librarians O
of O
other O
Dutch O
research O
libraries O
. O

In B-SENT
essence O
, O
we O
want O
to O
teach O
our O

-DOCSTART- X

country O
’s O
librarians O
the O
ins O
and O
outs O
of O
DH O
in O
order O
for O
them O
to O
take O
up O
their O
natural O
role O
of O
facilitating O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
supporting O
research O
and O
ideally O
become O
the O
research O
partner O
needed O
in O
DH O
projects O
. O

The B-SENT
aim O
of O
these O
clinics O
is O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

provide O
basic O
methodological O
competencies O
and O
technical O
skills O
in O
DH O
, O
for O
a O
diverse O
group O
of O
librarians O
, O
consisting O
of O
both O
subject O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
technical O
librarians O
with O
basic O
technical O
skills O
. O

The B-SENT
content O
of O
these O
sessions O
should O
enable O
them O
to O
provide O
services O
to O
researchers O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
students O
, O
identify O
remaining O
gaps O
in O
knowledge O
or O
skills O
that O
they O
could O
address O
by O
self-directed O
learning O
and O
( O
perhaps O
) O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
automate O
their O
daily O
library O
work O

We B-SENT
are O
not O
setting O
out O
to O
turn O
them O
into O
programmers O
or O
data O
crunchers O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

but O
want O
to O
boost O
their O
knowledge O
level O
to O
where O
they O
feel O
comfortable O
providing O
information O
about O
DH O
projects O
, O
follow O
the O
literature O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
research O
, O
follow O
online O

and O
hopefully O
take O
up O
the O
challenge O
of O
finishing O
this O
professional O
development O
by O
engaging O
with O
the O

my O

I O
could O
feel O
the O
bone O
of O
my O
skull O
and O
my O
skin O
and O
his O
hot O
palm O
, O
so O

-DOCSTART- X

dry O
and O
strong O

When B-SENT
I O
was O
a O
little O
girl O
, O
he O
did O
that O
often O
, O
and O
called O
me O
Muscles O

-DOCSTART- X


He B-SENT
had O
not O
called O
me O
Muscles O
or O
put O
his O
hand O
on O
my O
head O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

I B-SENT
could O
not O

-DOCSTART- X

help O
arching O
my O
back O
a O
little O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
push O
against O
his O
hand O
like O
a O
cat O
but O
the O
instinct O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

comes O
with O
being O
thirteen O
, O
the O
half-understood O
caution O
that O
makes O
a O
girl O
timid O
, O
or O
wild O
, O
the O
shyness O
told O
me O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
just O
walk O
. O

I B-SENT
wanted O
to O
feel O
the O
rough O
edge O
of O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
coat O
against O
my O
cheek O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

but O
I O
was O
too O
tall O
. O

I B-SENT
wanted O
to O
be O
seven O
again O
, O
and O
safe O
. O

But B-SENT
I O
still O
wanted O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

push O
against O
his O
hand O
and O
put O
my O
hand O
in O
his O
pocket O
and O
steal O
the O
leather O
palmed O
glove O
, O
that O
secret O
animal O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Instead B-SENT
I O
went O
into O
the O
church O
, O
took O
a O
Bulletin O
, O
dipped O
my O
finger O
in O
Holy O
Water O
and O
genuflected O

-DOCSTART- X


The B-SENT
inside O
of O
the O
church O
smelled O
like O
damp O
wood O
and O
furniture O
polish O
, O
not O
alive O
at O
all O
. O

My B-SENT
father O
took O

-DOCSTART- X

off O
his O
coat O
and O
draped O
it O
over O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
pew O
and O
when O
I O
came O
back O
from O
communion O
I O
stole O

-DOCSTART- X

his O
glove O
. O

The B-SENT
paper O
taste O
of O
the O
wafer O
was O
still O
in O
my O
mouth O
and O
I O
took O
a O
deep O
breath O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
leather O
. O

It B-SENT
smelled O
like O
March O
. O

We B-SENT
walked O
back O
through O
the O
school O
because O
it O
was O
drizzling O
, O
my O
father O

-DOCSTART- X

tall O
in O
his O
navy O
suit O
and O
my O
shoes O
going O
click O
on O
the O
linoleum O

There B-SENT
were O
two O
classes O
of O
each O
grade O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
starting O
at O
the O
sixth O
and O
going O
down O
to O
the O
first O
. O

The B-SENT
hall O
ended O
in O
a O
T O
and O
we O
went O

-DOCSTART- X

left O
through O
the O
gym O
, O
walked O
underneath O
the O
bleachers O
and O
stood O
next O
to O
the O
side O
door O
, O
waiting O
for O
the O
rain O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
stop O
. O

It B-SENT
was O
dark O
under O
the O
bleachers O
. O

My B-SENT
father O
was O
a O
young O
man O
, O
thirty-five O
, O
younger O
because O

-DOCSTART- X

he O
liked O
to O
be O
outside O
, O
to O
play O
softball O
on O
Saturday O
and O
to O
take O
my O
mother O
and O
me O
camping O
on O
vacation O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

He B-SENT
stood O
rocked O
back O
on O
his O
heels O
with O
his O
coat O
thrown O
over O
his O
shoulders O
and O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
pockets O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

I B-SENT
thought O
of O
bacon O
and O
eggs O
, O
toast O
with O
peach O
jam O
out O
of O
the O
jar O
. O

I B-SENT
was O
so O
hungry O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

The B-SENT
space O
under O
the O
bleachers O
was O
secret O
and O
dark O
. O

There B-SENT
were O
things O
in O
the O
shadows O
; O
a O
metal O
pail O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
a O
mop O
, O
rags O
. O

Next B-SENT
to O
the O
door O
was O
a O
tall O
wrought-iron O
candle O
holder O
— O
the O
kind O
that O
stood O

-DOCSTART- X

at O
either O
end O
of O
the O
altar O
. O

There B-SENT
was O
no O
holder O
and O
the O
end O
was O
jagged O
. O

On B-SENT
the O
floor O
was O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
wrapper O
from O
a O
French O
Chew O
. O

They B-SENT
were O
sold O
at O
eighth-grade O
basketball O
games O
on O
Friday O
nights O
. O

The B-SENT
light O
from O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
door O
made O
the O
shadows O
under O
the O
bleachers O
darker O
, O
the O
long O
space O
stretched O
far O
away O
. O

I B-SENT
heard O
the O
rain O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
the O
faint O
rustle O
of O
paper O
and O
smelled O
damp O
concrete O
. O

I B-SENT
did O
not O
go O
near O
my O
father O
but O
kept O
my O

-DOCSTART- X

hand O
in O
my O
pocket O
, O
feeling O
the O
soft O
leather O
glove O
. O

There B-SENT
was O
a O
rustling O
on O
the O
concrete O
and O
the O
drizzle O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
soft O
rain O
. O

I B-SENT
wondered O
if O
anyone O
ever O
went O
back O
under O
the O
bleachers O
, O
if O
there O
were O
crickets O
or O
mice O

-DOCSTART- X

there O
. O

The B-SENT
rustling O
might O
have O
been O
mice O
. O

I B-SENT
wished O
the O
rain O
would O
stop O
. O

I B-SENT
wanted O
to O
go O
home O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

I B-SENT
made O
noises O
with O
my O
heels O
but O
they O
were O
too O
loud O
so O
I O
stopped O
. O

Something B-SENT
else O
clicked O
and O
I O

-DOCSTART- X

tried O
to O
see O
what O
it O
was O
but O
could O
n’t O
see O
anything O
. O

It B-SENT
was O
n’t O
as O
loud O
as O
my O
heels O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


My B-SENT
father O
cleared O
his O
throat O
, O
looking O
out O
the O
door O
. O

I B-SENT
imagined O
a O
man O
down O
there O
in O
the O
dark O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

an O
escaped O
convict O
or O
a O
madman O
. O

It B-SENT
had O
nearly O
stopped O
raining O
. O

In B-SENT
fifteen O
minutes O
we O
would O
be O
home O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

my O
mother O
would O
fry O
eggs O
. O

I B-SENT
heard O
a O
noise O
like O
paper O
. O

My B-SENT
father O
heard O
it O
, O
too O
, O
but O

-DOCSTART- X

he O
pretended O
not O
to O
, O
at O
least O
he O
did O
n’t O
turn O
his O
head O
. O

And B-SENT
there O
was O
a O
heavier O
sound O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
rasp O
, O
like O
a O
box O
pulled O
over O
concrete O
. O

I B-SENT
looked O
at O
my O
father O
but O
he O
did O
n’t O
turn O
his O

-DOCSTART- X

head O

I B-SENT
wished O
he O
would O
turn O
his O
head O

There B-SENT
was O
a O
click O
again O
and O
the O
rustle O
, O
and O
I O

-DOCSTART- X

could O
not O
think O
of O
what O
it O
could O
be O
. O

I B-SENT
had O
no O
explanation O
for O
the O
particular O
combination O
of O
sounds O

No B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

doubt O
there O
was O
, O
some O
two O
things O
that O
happened O
to O
be O
making O
noises O
at O
the O

time O

Once B-SENT
in O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

fever O
I O
heard O
thousands O
of O
birds O
outside O
my O
window O
and O
I O
was O
terrified O
that O
they O
would O
fling O
themselves O
through O
the O
glass O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
attack O
me O
, O
but O
it O
was O
only O
the O

guided O
by O
his O
own O

He B-SENT
dwelt O

No B-SENT

that O

The B-SENT
day O
began O
as O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

usually O
did O
when O
my O
father O
was O
expected O
home O
from O
his O
travels O
, O
the O
house O
festooned O
with O
flowers O
and O
stocked O
with O

We B-SENT
stood O
by O
the O
gate O
, O
washed O
and O
perfumed O
and O
arrayed O
in O
our O
brightest O
clothes O
, O
my O

twisting O

her O

, O
my O

Jom B-SENT
, O

in O

the O

moaned O
gently O
to O
himself O
, O
while O
I O
stood O
nervously O
rubbing O
the O
heel O
of O
one O
sandal O
on O
the O
flagstones O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

We B-SENT
scanned O
the O
deep O
blue O
valley O
for O
the O
first O
sign O
of O
the O
company O
, O
but O
before O
we O
saw O
them O
we O

-DOCSTART- X

heard O
the O
children O
shouting O
: O
“ O
A O
yellow O
man O
! O
” O

A B-SENT
yellow O
man O
! O

We B-SENT
glanced O
at O
one O
another O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

confusion O
. O

My B-SENT
mother O
bit O
her O
lower O
lip O
; O
Jom O
gave O
a O
groan O
of O
alarm O
. O

At B-SENT
first O
I O
thought O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

children O
meant O
my O
father O
, O
whose O
golden O
skin O
, O
the O
color O
of O
the O
night-monkey O
’s O
pelt O
, O
was O
a O
rarity O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
islands O
; O
but O
certainly O
the O
children O
of O
Tyom O
were O
familiar O
with O
my O
father O
, O
and O
would O
never O
have O
greeted O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

council-member O
with O
such O
ill-mannered O
yells O
. O

Then B-SENT
I O
remembered O
the O
only O
“ O
yellow O
man O
” O
I O
had O
ever O
seen O
, O
an O

-DOCSTART- X

Olondrian O
wizard O
and O
doctor O
who O
had O
visited O
Tyom O
in O
my O
childhood O
, O
who O
wore O
two O
pieces O
of O
glass O
on O
his O
eyes O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
attached O
to O
his O
ears O
with O
wires O
, O
and O
roamed O
the O
hills O
of O
Tinimavet O
, O
cutting O
bits O
off O
the O
trees O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


I B-SENT
have O
since O
learned O
that O
that O
doctor O
wrote O
a O
well-received O
treatise O
, O
On O
the O
Medicinal O
Properties O
of O
the O
Juice O
of O
the O

Young O

died O
a O
respected O
man O
in O
his O
native O
city O
of O
Deinivel O
; O
but O
at O
the O
time O
I O
felt O

-DOCSTART- X

certain O
he O
had O
returned O
with O
his O
sack O
of O
tree-cuttings O
. O

“ B-SENT
There O
they O

” O
said O
Pavit O

the O

-DOCSTART- X

house-servant O

in O

And B-SENT
there O
they O
were O
: O
a O
chain O
of O
riders O
weaving O
among O
the O
trees O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


My B-SENT
father O
’s O
plaited O
umbrella O
appeared O
, O
his O
still O
, O
imposing O
figure O
, O
and O
beside O
him O
another O
man O
, O
tall O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

lean O
, O
astride O
an O
island O
mule O
. O

The B-SENT
hectic O
screams O
of O
the O
children O
preceded O
the O
company O
into O
the O
village O
, O
so O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
they O
advanced O
like O
a O
festival O
, O
drawing O
people O
out O
of O
their O
houses O
. O

As B-SENT
they O
approached O
I O
saw O
that O
my O

-DOCSTART- X

father O
’s O
face O
was O
shining O
with O
pride O
, O
and O
his O
bearing O
had O
in O
it O
a O
new O
hauteur O
, O
like O
that O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
old O
island O
kings O
. O

The B-SENT
man O
who O
rode O
beside O
him O
, O
looking O
uncomfortable O
with O
his O
long O
legs O
, O
kept O
his O

-DOCSTART- X

gaze O
lowered O
and O
fixed O
between O
the O
ears O
of O
his O
plodding O
mule O
. O

He B-SENT
was O
not O
yellow O
, O
but O
very O
pale O
brown O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
the O
color O
of O
raw O
cashews O
; O
he O
had O
silver O
hair O
, O
worn O
cropped O
close O
to O
the O
skull O
so O
that O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

resembled O
a O
cap O
. O

He B-SENT
was O
not O
the O
leaf-collecting O
doctor O
, O
but O
an O
altogether O
strange O
man O
, O
with O
silver O
eyebrows O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

his O
smooth O
face O
and O
long O
fine-knuckled O
hands O
. O

As B-SENT
he O
dismounted O
in O
front O
of O
the O
house O
I O
heard O
my O
mother O
whispering O

-DOCSTART- X

: O
“ O
Protect O

My B-SENT
father O
dismounted O
from O
his O
mule O
and O
strutted O
toward O
us O
, O
grinning O

I B-SENT
thought O
I O
caught O
an O
odor O
off O
him O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
of O
fish O

sea-sickness O

We B-SENT
knelt O
and O
stared O
down O
at O
the O
bald O
ground O
, O
murmuring O
ritual O
greetings O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
until O
he O
touched O
the O
tops O
of O
our O
heads O
with O
the O
palm O
of O
his O
fleshy O
hand O
. O

Then B-SENT
we O
stood O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

unable O
to O
keep O
from O
staring O
at O
the O
stranger O

who O
faced O
us O
awkwardly O

half-smiling O

taller O

Tropical B-SENT
cyclones O
are O
sustained O
by O
a O
form O
of O
energy O
called O
latent O
heat O
, O
which O
is O
released O
by O
moisture O
evaporated O

-DOCSTART- X

from O
the O
ocean O
that O
condenses O
to O
form O
rain O
. O

As B-SENT
tropical O
cyclones O
make O
landfall O
, O
this O
energy O
source O
is O
cut-off O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

they O
rapidly O
lose O
strength O
as O
they O
move O
over O
land O
. O

Yes B-SENT
, O
the O
Cyclone O
is O
almost O
certain O
to O
lose O
strength O
as O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
surges O
over O
land O
. O

Cyclones B-SENT
gather O
their O
strength O
through O
scraping O
moisture O
and O
heat O
from O
warm O
ocean O
water O
that O
it O
is O

-DOCSTART- X

not O
the O
case O
over O
land O
. O

In B-SENT
the O
mean O
time O
, O
much O
stronger O
friction O
over O
land O
quickly O
reduces O
their O
strength O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Yes B-SENT
. O

All B-SENT
tropical O
cyclones O
lose O
strength O
once O
they O
make O
landfall O
. O

However B-SENT
, O
they O
can O
remain O
dangerous O
storms O
due O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

very O
heavy O
rains O
and O
subsequent O
landslides O
, O
and O
river O
flooding O
. O

Phailin B-SENT
's O
winds O
will O
rapidly O
weaken O
as O
it O
pushes O
inland O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Once B-SENT
Cyclone O
Phailin O
comes O
on O
shore O
it O
will O
immediately O
begin O
to O
lose O
strength O
. O

However B-SENT
, O
and O
this O
is O
important O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
it O
still O
will O
contain O
lots O
of O

Is B-SENT
the O
Indian O

well O

deal O
with O
this O

I B-SENT
have O
not O
followed O
that O
aspect O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
societal O
response O
for O
the O
present O
storm O
. O

However B-SENT
, O
historically O
, O
there O
have O
been O
several O
events O
that O
should O
cause O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

societal O
response O
. O

Hopefully B-SENT
, O
we O
all O
learn O
from O
past O
mistakes O
. O

The B-SENT
history O
of O
strong O
cyclones O
and O
death O
in O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

region O
is O
notable O
, O
with O
at O
least O
5 O
large O
cyclone O
events O
in O
the O
past O
35 O
years O
with O
10,000 O
and O
as O
many O

-DOCSTART- X

as O
300,000 O
people O
killed O
, O
millions O
left O
homeless O
and O
estimated O
damages O
as O
high O
as O
US$ O
10 O
billion O
. O

I B-SENT
do O
n't O

-DOCSTART- X

have O
enough O
information O
to O
answer O
this O
question O
, O
one O
way O
or O
the O
other O
. O

From B-SENT
all O
the O
press O
reports O
that O
I O

-DOCSTART- X

have O
read O
, O
the O
Indian O
government O
appears O
to O
have O
taken O
the O
threat O
of O
Cyclone O
Phailin O
very O
seriously O
indeed O
. O

The B-SENT
government O

-DOCSTART- X

has O
been O
much O
more O
pro-active O
in O
preparing O
for O
this O
cyclone O
than O
in O
the O
past O
. O

The B-SENT
forecasts O
of O
cyclone O
track O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

intensity O
have O
been O
fairly O
accurate O
. O

Mandatory B-SENT
mass O
evacuations O
have O
been O
carried O
out O
, O
which O
is O
essential O
to O
minimize O
loss O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

life O
in O
these O
situations O
. O

Unfortunately B-SENT
, O
extensive O
property O
damage O
is O
bound O
to O
occur O
even O
with O
the O
best O
preparation O
. O

My B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

knowledge O
of O
the O
responsiveness O
of O
the O
Indian O
government O
to O
this O
storm O
is O
purely O
from O
the O
cyber O
space O
. O

I B-SENT
heard O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

they O
orchestrated O
the O
largest O
people O
evacuation O
to O
a O
natural O
disaster O
in O
Indian O
history O
. O

This B-SENT
shall O
be O
applauded O
given O
the O
size O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
strength O
of O
Phailin O
. O

I B-SENT
visited O
the O
damaged O
area O
of O
the O
1999 O
storm O
near O
Bhubaneshwar O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2012 O

and O
summer O

on O

[ O

sponsored O
by O
the O
Indian O

Given B-SENT
the O

-DOCSTART- X

living O
standard O
and O
residence O
of O
people O
living O
near O
the O
coastal O
areas O
in O
this O
region O
, O
the O
evacuation O
is O
certainly O
necessary O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

essential O
to O
save O
lives O
. O

I B-SENT
cannot O
comment O
directly O
on O
how O
the O
Indian O
government O
was O
prepared O
for O
this O
cyclone O
. O

However B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

, O
the O
news O
reports O
( O
BBC O
etc. O
) O
were O
very O
encouraging O
in O
that O
the O
authorities O
were O
reportedly O
making O
strenuous O
efforts O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

evacuate O
the O
population O
from O
near O
the O
coast O
and O
areas O
that O
are O
prone O
to O
flooding O
. O

Water B-SENT
is O
the O
main O
killer O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

these O
storms O
. O

From B-SENT
all O
reports O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
, O
the O

was O
well O
prepared O
for O
this O

For B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

this O
question O
I O
do O

make O

own O
original O
content O
, O
and O
, O
yep O

that O

-DOCSTART- X

's O
what O
we O
wanted O

How B-SENT
did O

meet O
? O

We B-SENT

In B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

this O
private O
, O
tiny-tiny O
private O
school O
of O

, O
and O
we O
went O
off O
to O
college O
together O
in O
Arizona O
; O

and B-SENT
... O
( O
how O
do O

-DOCSTART- X

I O
best O
explain O
this O
? O
) O

Basically B-SENT
, O
she O
came O
up O
with O
a O
few O
class O
projects O
, O
and O
I O
came O
up O

-DOCSTART- X

with O
a O
few O
class O
projects O
; O

we B-SENT
started O
working O
with O
a O
few O
of O
our O
friends O
, O
and O
colleagues O
and O
whatnot O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Those B-SENT
included O
Drew O
Cass O
, O
Devin O
Thurlow O
, O
people O
like O
that O
. O

She B-SENT
had O
several O
ideas O
, O
and O
she O
used O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

draw O
a O
lot O
in O
the O
sketchbook O
, O
she O
used O
to O
have O
this O
thick O
sketchbook O
that O
she O
used O
to O
carry O
around O
with O

-DOCSTART- X

her O
everywhere O
, O
where O
she O
'd O
draw O
these O
different O
characters O
and O
whatnot O
; O

and B-SENT
she O
was O
always O
really O
shy O
to O
show O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
off O
to O
people O
, O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
help O
her O
show O
that O
stuff O
, O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
bring O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

out O
to O
the O
world O
. O

I B-SENT
was O
a O
writer O
, O
and O
she O
always O
liked O
my O
writings O
, O
so O
I O
was O
like O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
let O
's O
just O
get O
both O
of O
our O
things O
together O
, O
and O
let O
's O
get O
this O
done O
. O

And B-SENT
for O
me O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
what O
I O
want O
the O
purpose O
to O
be O
, O
is O
to O
inspire O
people O
. O

To B-SENT
bring O
a O
little O
more O
light O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
world O
is O
what O
I O
want O
, O
out O
of O
all O
of O
this O
. O

And B-SENT
what O
was O
the O
verse O
that O
we O
have O

-DOCSTART- X

? O

First B-SENT
Corinthians O

? O

Yes B-SENT
. O

Yeah B-SENT
, O
exactly O
. O

We B-SENT
just O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
bring O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
like O
she O
said O
, O
bring O
light O
into O
the O
entertainment O
and O
into O
the O
media O
industry O
, O
specifically O
is O
what O
we O
do O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Yeah B-SENT
. O

-DOCSTART- X

The B-SENT
future O
of O
the O
peace O
process O
in O
Israel O

" B-SENT
The O
future O
is O

The O
problem O
is O
how O
long O
will O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
take O

as O
one O
of O
the O

of O
the O
modern O
peace O

-DOCSTART- X

do O
you O
still O

there O

The B-SENT

The B-SENT

is O
how O
long O
will O
it O
take O

how O
many O
victims O
will O
it O
call O

Why B-SENT
do O
I O
say O
peace O

-DOCSTART- X

? O

Because B-SENT
when O
you O
look O
historically O
, O
at O
the O
development O
of O
humanity O
, O
most O
of O
our O
lives O
we O
are O
living O
on O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
land O
. O

The B-SENT
history O
is O
written O
with O
red O
ink O
. O

The B-SENT
reason O
for O
it O
is O
because O
people O
were O
fighting O
for O

-DOCSTART- X

our O
land O
, O
either O
defending O
it O
or O
extending O
it O
, O
because O
that O
was O
the O
main O
source O
. O

The B-SENT
land O
, O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

natural O
resources O
, O
the O
markets O
, O
all O
these O
go O
together O
. O

The B-SENT
minute O
the O
land O
was O
replaced O
by O
science O
, O
what O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
there O
to O
fight O
about O
? O

Armies B-SENT
cannot O
conquer O
science O
. O

Customs B-SENT
cannot O
check O
what O
a O
scientist O
has O
in O
his O
mind O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
they O
can O
see O
what O
he O
has O
in O
his O
pocket O
but O
not O
what O
he O
has O
in O
his O
mind O
so O
it O
’s O

-DOCSTART- X

uncontrolled O
; O
it O
means O
that O
borders O
are O
n’t O
important O
and O
distances O
are O
n’t O
important O
. O

How B-SENT
do O
you O
approach O
the O
difficult O

-DOCSTART- X

challenge O
of O
talking O
to O
the O
Palestinians O
when O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
they O
do O
n’t O
want O
Israel O
to O
exist O
. O

How B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

do O
you O
come O
to O
an O
understanding O
to O
make O
peace O
possible O
? O

Well B-SENT
, O
what O
is O
the O
problem O
? O

I B-SENT
mean O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
the O
problem O
national O
, O
say O
between O
Jews O
and O
Arabs O
; O
or O
is O
it O
a O
matter O
of O
generations O
between O
an O
old O

-DOCSTART- X

age O
and O
a O
new O
age O
? O

You B-SENT
see O
, O
the O
terrorists O
are O
protesting O
against O
modernity O
. O

They B-SENT
think O
that O
modernity O
may O

-DOCSTART- X

endanger O
their O
tradition O
. O

They B-SENT
are O
simply O
afraid O
and O
hate O
modernity O
. O

They B-SENT
consider O
modernity O
as O
their O
enemy O
, O
but O
then O

-DOCSTART- X

they O
have O
two O
problems O
. O

First B-SENT
of O
all O
, O
can O
they O
exist O
on O
tradition O
? O

They B-SENT
cannot O
. O

Sooner B-SENT
or O
later O

-DOCSTART- X

they O
will O
have O
to O
enter O
the O
new O
age O
. O

All B-SENT
the O
talks O
about O
nationalities O
, O
etcetera O
, O
well O
, O
the O
new O

-DOCSTART- X

age O
has O
very O
little O
patience O
for O
history O
. O

History B-SENT
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
irrelevant O
. O

How B-SENT
do O
you O
feel O
about O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
? O

Well B-SENT
, O
I O
distinguish O
between O
two O
histories O
, O
the O
spiritual O
and O
the O
material O
. O

Or B-SENT
the O
history O
of O
events O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
the O
history O
of O
values O
. O

The B-SENT
history O

he O
said O
. O

The B-SENT
report O
says O
the O
decline O
in O

intake O

-DOCSTART- X

appears O
to O
be O
due O
to O
changes O
in O
the O
dairy O

where O
chlorine-containing O

replaced O
iodine-containing O

Iodine B-SENT

four O

-DOCSTART- X

Another B-SENT
contributory O
factor O
has O
been O
the O
decreasing O

The B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

report O
states O

Professor B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

says O
iodine O
is O
added O
to O
only O
10 O

the O
1830s O
to O
serve O
as O
the O
national O
capital O
of O
the O
modern O
Greek O
State O
. O

The B-SENT
city O
regained O
its O
importance O
in O
Greek O

, O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
by O

had O
evolved O
into O
a O
very O
attractive O

harking O
to O
the O
nation O

buildings O
, O

. O

The B-SENT
city O
also O
expanded O
outward O
through O
rash O
development O
, O
particularly O

-DOCSTART- X

towards O
the O
west O
, O
as O
its O
population O
grew O
by O

1990s O
, O
the O
city O

The B-SENT
restoration O
of O

The B-SENT

because O
