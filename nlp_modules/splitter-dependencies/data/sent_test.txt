as O

, O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

were O

that O
this O
was O
not O

Where B-SENT
our O

were O
decorated O

We B-SENT

that O

why O

I B-SENT

in O

, O
we O

that O
was O

that O
held O

Besides B-SENT
, O
Steven O
had O
some O
really O
good O
stuff O
: O

that O

-DOCSTART- X

stained O
your O

bright O
red O
— O
well O
, O
technically O
, O
not O
your O
teeth O
, O
just O
the O
plaque O
, O
but O
the O
result O

-DOCSTART- X

was O
often O
the O
same O
. O

It B-SENT
took O
a O
few O
days O
good O
brushing O
to O
get O
it O
off O
. O

Well B-SENT
, O
most O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
anyway O
. O

He B-SENT
had O
effervescent O
tablets O
that O
turned O
the O
canteen O
drinking O
water O
into O
that O
exact O
same O
pink O
mixture O
that O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

dentist O
gave O
you O
to O
rinse O
your O
mouth O
out O
after O
scraping O
around O
inside O
, O
and O
guaranteed O
to O
make O
the O
other O
kids O
splutter O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
spit O
it O
out O
when O
the O
taste O
slowly O
percolated O
through O
and O
met O
the O
memory O
of O
their O
last O
checkup O
. O

Then B-SENT
there O

-DOCSTART- X

was O
the O
event O
that O
became O
the O
rite O
of O
passage O
into O
our O
group O
of O
misfits O
and O
outcasts O
: O
making O
a O
mould O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

your O

It B-SENT
was O
inevitable O
that O
one O
of O
us O
, O
seeing O
the O
plaster O
casts O
on O
the O
shelf O
by O
Steven O
’s O

-DOCSTART- X

bed O
would O
ask O
how O
they O
were O
done O
. O

It B-SENT
was O
just O
as O
inevitable O
that O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
, O
Steven O
would O

-DOCSTART- X

be O
mixing O
up O
various O
powders O
and O
liquids O
, O
and O
pouring O
them O
into O
a O
horse-shoe O
shaped O
contraption O
. O

It B-SENT
was O
n’t O
dangerous O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

At B-SENT
least O
, O
I O
suppose O
so O
. O

It B-SENT
was O
vaguely O
uncomfortable O
, O
and O
appeared O
sufficiently O
disturbing O
that O
we O
all O
volunteered O

-DOCSTART- X

each O
other O
in O
turn O
until O
, O
at O
last O
, O
Andy O
said O
he O
was O
game O
. O

And B-SENT
we O
were O
off O
. O

The B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

hardest O
part O
was O
probably O
to O
overcome O
the O
gagging O
reflex O
that O
set O
in O
when O
you O
bit O
down O
into O
the O
acrid O
resin O
jelly O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
it O
flowed O
out O
and O
up O
and O
around O
, O
over O
teeth O
, O
gums O
and O
tongue O
. O

Your B-SENT
nose O
filled O
with O
what O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
imagined O
were O
fumes O
from O
the O
warm O
paste O
. O

And B-SENT
you O
seemed O
to O
be O
suddenly O
drowning O
in O
your O
own O
saliva O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Things B-SENT
generally O
got O
better O
when O
Steven O
reminded O
you O
that O
you O
could O
actually O
breathe O
, O
and O
swallow O
, O
normally O
. O

He B-SENT

I B-SENT
think O
that O
a O

very O
important O
to O
a O

so O
I O
thought O

here O

a O
