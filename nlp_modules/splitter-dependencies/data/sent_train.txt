Introduction O

Tenured B-SENT
and O
tenure-track O
university O
faculty O
play O
a O
special O
role O
in O
determining O
the O
speed O
and O
direction O
of O
scientific O
progress O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

both O
directly O
through O
their O
research O
and O
indirectly O
through O
their O
training O
of O
new O
researchers O
. O

Past B-SENT
studies O
establish O
that O
each O
of O
these O

-DOCSTART- X

efforts O
is O
strongly O
and O
positively O
influenced O
through O
various O
forms O
of O
faculty O
diversity O
, O
including O
ethnic O
, O
racial O
, O
and O
gender O
diversity O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

As B-SENT
an O
example O
, O
research O
shows O
that O
greater O
diversity O
within O
a O
community O
or O
group O
can O
lead O
to O
improved O
critical O
thinking O

-DOCSTART- X

[ O
1 O
] O
and O
more O
creative O
solutions O
to O
complex O
tasks O
[ O
2 O
, O
3 O
] O
by O
pairing O
together O
individuals O
with O
unique O

-DOCSTART- X

skillsets O
and O
perspectives O
that O
complement O
and O
often O
augment O
the O
abilities O
of O
their O
peers O
. O

Additionally B-SENT
, O
diversity O
has O
been O
shown O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

produce O
more O
supportive O
social O
climates O
and O
effective O
learning O
environments O
[ O
4 O
] O
, O
which O
can O
facilitate O
the O
mentoring O
of O
young O
scientists O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Despite B-SENT
these O
positive O
effects O
, O
however O
, O
quantifying O
the O
impact O
of O
diversity O
in O
science O
remains O
exceedingly O
difficult O
, O
due O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

large O
part O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
comprehensive O
data O
about O
the O
scientific O
workforce O
. O

Measuring B-SENT
the O
composition O
and O
dynamics O
of O
a O
scientific O

-DOCSTART- X

workforce O
, O
particularly O
in O
a O
rapidly O
expanding O
field O
like O
computer O
science O
, O
is O
a O
crucial O
first O
step O
toward O
understanding O
how O
scholarly O

-DOCSTART- X

research O
is O
conducted O
and O
how O
it O
might O
be O
enhanced O
. O

For B-SENT
many O
scientific O
fields O
, O
however O
, O
there O
is O
no O
central O

-DOCSTART- X

listing O
of O
all O
tenure-track O
faculty O
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
define O
a O
rigorous O
sample O
frame O
for O
analysis O
. O

Further B-SENT
, O
rates O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
adoption O
of O
services O
like O
GoogleScholar O
and O
ResearchGate O
vary O
within O
, O
and O
across O
disciplines O
. O

For B-SENT
instance O
, O
gender O
representation O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

computing O
is O
an O
important O
issue O
with O
broad O
implications O
[ O
5 O
] O
, O
but O
without O
a O
full O
census O
of O
computing O
faculty O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
degree O
of O
inequality O
and O
its O
possible O
sources O
are O
difficult O
to O
establish O
[ O
6 O
] O
. O

Some B-SENT
disciplines O
, O
like O
political O

-DOCSTART- X

science O
, O
are O
organized O
around O
a O
single O
professional O
society O
, O
whose O
membership O
roll O
approximates O
a O
full O
census O
[ O
7 O
] O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Most B-SENT
fields O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
including O
computer O
science O
, O
lack O
a O
single O
all-encompassing O
organization O
and O
membership O
information O
is O

-DOCSTART- X

instead O
distributed O
across O
many O
disjoint O
lists O
, O
such O
as O
web-based O
faculty O
directories O
for O
individual O
departments O
. O

Because B-SENT
assembling O
such O
a O
full O

-DOCSTART- X

census O
is O
difficult O
, O
past O
studies O
have O
tended O
to O
avoid O
this O
task O
and O
have O
instead O
used O
samples O
of O
researchers O
[ O

-DOCSTART- X

– O

] O
, O
usually O
specific O
to O
a O
particular O
field O
[ O
12 O

16 O
] O
, O
and O
often O
focused O
on O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

scientific O
elite O
[ O
17 O
, O
18 O
] O
. O

Although B-SENT
useful O
, O
such O
samples O
are O
not O
representative O
of O
the O
scientific O
workforce O
as O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
whole O
and O
thus O
have O
limited O
generalizability O
. O

One B-SENT
of O
the O
largest O
census O

this O

is O
only O
a O

snapshot O
of O
an O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
hence O
offers O
few O
insights O
into O
the O
changing O
composition O

trends O
within O
these O
academic O

In B-SENT
some O

the O
misinterpretation O

only O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
high-level O

of O
a O

which O
can O
make O
it O
difficult O
to O

[ O

] O
. O

For B-SENT
example O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
differences O

the O

Introduction B-SENT

Enjambment B-SENT
takes O
place O
when O
a O
syntactic O
unit O
is O
broken O
up O
across O
two O
lines O
of O
poetry O
( O

, O
giving O
rise O
to O
different O
stylistic O
effects O
( O
e.g. O
increased O
emphasis O
on O
elements O
of O
the O
broken-up O
phrase O

, O
or O

However B-SENT
, O
a O
larger-scale O
study O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
identify O
enjambment O
across O
hundreds O

not O
previously O

Given B-SENT
that O
need O
, O
we O
have O
developed O
software O
, O
based O
on O
Natural O
Language O
Processing O
, O
that O
automatically O

-DOCSTART- X

identifies O
enjambment O
in O
Spanish O
, O
and O
applied O
it O
to O
a O
corpus O
of O

What B-SENT
is O
the O
interest O
of O
such O
large-scale O
automatic O
analyses O
of O
enjambment O
? O

First B-SENT
, O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
literature O
shows O
a O
debate O
about O
which O
specific O
syntactic O
units O
can O
be O
considered O
to O
trigger O
enjambment O
, O
if O
split O
across O
two O

-DOCSTART- X

lines O
, O
and O
whether O
lexical O
and O
syntactic O
criteria O
are O
sufficient O
to O
identify O
enjambment O
. O

Second B-SENT
, O
the O
stylistic O
effects O
that O
enjambment O

-DOCSTART- X

permits O
are O
also O
an O
object O
of O
current O
research O
( O
Martínez O

, O

) O
. O

Systematically B-SENT
collecting O
large O
amounts O
of O
enjambment O

-DOCSTART- X

examples O
provides O
helpful O
evidence O
to O
assess O
scholars O
’ O
current O
claims O
, O
and O
may O
stimulate O
novel O
analyses O
. O

Finally B-SENT
, O
our O
study O

-DOCSTART- X

complements O
Navarro O

( O
2016 O
) O
automatic O
metrical O
analyses O
of O
Spanish O
Golden O

, O

a O

our O
corpus O
and O

are O
described O
, O
followed O
by O
an O
evaluation O
of O
the O

Finally B-SENT
, O
findings O
on O
enjambment O
in O

our O

Enjambment B-SENT

However B-SENT
, O
this O

has O
been O
broken O

if B-SENT

The B-SENT
fact O
that O
these O

, O
offers O
an O
opportunity O
to O
those O
who O
would O
use O
them O
for O

Since B-SENT

We B-SENT
live O
in O
an O
epistemic O
environment O
that O
is O
heavily O
and O
deliberately O
polluted O
by O
agents O
who O
use O
mimicry O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
other O
methods O
as O
a O
means O
of O
inflating O
their O
pretense O

This B-SENT
fact O
, O
together O
with O
the O
fact O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

such O
deception O
is O
widely O
known O
to O
occur O
, O
reduces O
ordinary O
people O
’s O
trust O
in O
expert O
authority O
and O
diminishes O
their O
capacity O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

distinguish O

For B-SENT
instance O
, O
those O
with O
an O
interest O
in O
deceiving O
the O
general O
public O
may O
set O
up O

-DOCSTART- X

parallel O
institutions O
that O
ostensibly O
guarantee O

taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
ways O
in O
which O
these O

ensure O
that O

There B-SENT
are O
some O
egregious O
examples O
of O
this O
practice O
in O
the O
field O
of O

For B-SENT
example O
, O
a O
small O
number O
of O
doctors O
set O
up O
the O
American O
College O
of O
Pediatricians O
( O
ACPeds O
) O
to O
advocate O

-DOCSTART- X

socially O
conservative O
viewpoints O
related O
to O

. O

Such B-SENT
an O
organization O
is O
surely O
permissible O
, O
but O
it O
has O
had O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

unfortunate O
( O
and O
likely O
intended O
) O
effect O
of O
muddying O
debates O
in O
the O
public O
forum O
by O
misleading O
people O
into O
thinking O
that O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

college O
speaks O
for O
the O
pediatric O
profession O
at O

beliefs O
for O
the O
consensus O

among O

has O
a O
much O

positive O
view O

a O
wider O
range O

its O

the O
impression O

for O
the O

introduces O
an O
epistemic O

A B-SENT

collaborative O
efforts O

When B-SENT
the O

the O

effect O
was O
just O
the O
opposite O

Once B-SENT

this O

the O

At B-SENT

the O

Introduction B-SENT

A B-SENT
fundamental O
tenet O
of O
linguistic O
science O
is O
that O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
word O
has O
a O
purely O
arbitrary O
connection O
to O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

word O
's O
meaning O
[ O
1 O
] O
, O
[ O
2 O
] O
. O

Thus B-SENT
, O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
word O
dog O
in O
English O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
connected O
to O
the O
concept O
‘ O
dog O
’ O
by O
historical O
accident O
and O
not O
by O
any O
natural O
connection O
; O
roughly O
the O
same O

-DOCSTART- X

concept O
is O
just O
as O
well O
denoted O
in O
French O
by O
chien O
, O
in O
German O
by O
hund O
, O
and O
in O
Japanese O
by O
inu O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

But B-SENT
it O
is O
not O
that O
a O
word O
can O
have O
just O
any O
vocal O
sound O
. O

While B-SENT
the O
possibility O
space O
for O
sound O

-DOCSTART- X

systems O
of O
the O
world O
's O
language O
is O
enormous O
, O
any O
given O
language O
makes O
use O
of O
only O
a O
restricted O
portion O
of O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

possible O
sounds O
[ O
3 O
] O
, O
[ O
4 O
] O
. O

It B-SENT
follows O
from O
these O
two O
basic O
principles O
– O
the O
‘ O
arbitrariness O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
the O
sign O
’ O
, O
and O
the O
‘ O
selectiveness O
of O
particular O
sound O
systems O
’ O
– O
that O
the O
words O
that O
exist O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
world O
's O
languages O
should O
sound O
quite O
different O
from O
each O
other O
, O
and O
that O
the O
likelihood O
that O
there O
are O
universal O
words O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
extremely O
small O
. O

But B-SENT
in O
this O
study O
we O
present O
a O
striking O
exception O
to O
this O
otherwise O
robust O
rule O
. O

From B-SENT
a O

-DOCSTART- X

systematic O
comparison O
of O
10 O
spoken O
languages O
from O
5 O
continents O
we O
find O
evidence O
suggesting O
that O
a O
word O
like O
‘ O
Huh O
? O
’ O

-DOCSTART- X

– O
used O
as O
a O
‘ O
repair O
initiator O
’ O
when O
, O
for O
example O
, O
one O
has O
not O
clearly O
heard O
what O
someone O
just O

-DOCSTART- X

said O
[ O
5 O
] O
, O
[ O
6 O
] O
– O
is O
a O
universal O
word O
. O

There B-SENT
are O
two O
distinct O
claims O
being O
made O

-DOCSTART- X

here O
: O
1. O
that O
Huh O
? O
is O
universal O
, O
and O
2. O
that O
Huh O
? O
is O
a O
word O
. O

In B-SENT
support O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
first O
claim O
, O
we O
show O
that O
the O
similarities O
in O
form O
and O
function O
of O
an O
interjection O
with O
the O
specific O
function O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

repair O
initiation O
are O
very O
much O
greater O
across O
languages O
than O
chance O
coincidence O
would O
admit O
. O

In B-SENT
fact O
the O
variation O
in O
form O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

unrelated O
languages O
across O
the O
globe O
is O
about O
the O
same O
as O
the O
variation O
we O
find O
in O
the O
way O
any O
regular O
word O
( O

-DOCSTART- X

e.g. O
, O
dog O
) O
is O
pronounced O
across O
dialects O
of O
English O
. O

In B-SENT
support O
of O
the O
second O
claim O
, O
we O
show O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

Huh O
? O
meets O
the O
criteria O
of O
a O
word O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
being O
a O
conventional O
lexical O
sign O
which O
must O
be O
learnt O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Thus B-SENT
, O
in O
contrast O
to O
what O
has O
been O
presumed O
for O
interjections O
in O
general O
[ O
7 O
] O
, O
[ O
8 O
] O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
for O
huh O
? O
in O
particular O
[ O
9 O
] O
, O
[ O
10 O
] O
, O
we O
find O
that O
this O
item O
is O
linguistic O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
nature O
rather O
than O
being O
a O
mere O
grunt O
or O
non-lexical O
sound O
. O

We B-SENT
show O
that O
the O
form O
is O
locally O
calibrated O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

ways O
that O
show O
it O
fitting O
within O
different O
language O
systems O
. O

Huh B-SENT
? O
may O
be O
a O
non-prototypical O
word O
, O
but O
it O
is O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
word O
. O

Finally B-SENT
, O
we O
address O
the O
question O
of O
why O
all O
languages O
should O
have O
such O
a O
word O
and O
why O
its O

-DOCSTART- X

form O
should O
be O
so O
similar O
across O
languages O
. O

We B-SENT
observe O
that O
this O
item O
fulfils O
a O
crucial O
need O
shared O
by O
all O
languages O

-DOCSTART- X

– O
the O
efficient O
signalling O
of O
problems O
of O
hearing O
and O
understanding O
– O
and O
we O
propose O
that O
its O
form O
is O
constrained O
by O
selective O

-DOCSTART- X

pressures O
in O
a O
conversational O
environment O
that O
is O
essentially O
the O
same O
in O
all O
languages O
. O

way O
to O
study O
a O

is O
by O

-DOCSTART- X

examining O

Therefore B-SENT
we O
collected O

4. B-SENT
Discussion O
. O

We B-SENT
hypothesized O
that O
the O
children O
, O
who O
were O
over O
the O
age O
of O
six O
at O
the O
time O
of O
collection O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
would O
have O
adult-like O
SI O
interpretations O
. O

We B-SENT
expected O
that O
the O
use O
of O
a O
training O
session O
and O
then O
the O
format O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
question O
would O
guide O
participants O
towards O
evaluating O
pragmatic O
felicity O
over O
providing O
truth O
value O
judgments O
, O
and O
would O
result O
in O
adult-like O
interpretations O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Further B-SENT
, O
we O
posited O
that O
if O
our O
initial O
hypothesis O
was O
not O
supported O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
there O
was O
some O
non-adult-like O

-DOCSTART- X

performance O
, O
that O
there O
would O
be O
significant O
variability O
among O
the O
conditions O
, O
with O
cardinal O
numbers O
having O
the O
highest O
performance O
and O
some O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
weakest O
. O

On B-SENT
the O
surface O
, O
it O
does O
seem O
as O
if O
there O
is O
variability O
and O
perhaps O
a O
larger O
sample O
size O

-DOCSTART- X

or O
more O
items O
could O
lead O
to O
a O
significant O
finding O
( O

, O
but O
at O
least O
for O
this O
study O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
the O
only O
significant O
finding O
was O
the O
difference O
between O
cardinal O

Significant B-SENT

were O
not O

This B-SENT

is O
limited O

Future B-SENT

In B-SENT
a O

it O
is O

if O
additional O

The B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X


In B-SENT
the O
current O
study O
, O
the O

because O
they O

It B-SENT
is O
possible O
that O
these O

This B-SENT

Additional B-SENT

Upon B-SENT

it O

Further B-SENT

1. B-SENT
Introduction O

Mutation-based B-SENT
testing O
[ O
1 O
] O
is O
a O
test O
technique O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

involves O
artificially O
introducing O
errors O
into O
a O
System O
Under O
Test O
( O
SUT O
) O
. O

A B-SENT
mutant O
is O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
system O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
which O
a O
change O
has O
been O
done O
that O
, O
in O
most O
cases O
, O
will O
lead O
to O
a O
behaviour O
different O
than O
expected O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

The B-SENT
different O
mutants O
are O
generated O
automatically O
by O
the O
application O
of O
mutation O
operators O
. O

In B-SENT
the O
state O
of O
the O
art O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

we O
have O
found O
mutation O
operators O
, O
both O
general O
purpose O
and O
specific O
to O
different O
technologies O
, O
languages O
and O
paradigms O
[ O

] O
. O

However B-SENT
, O
these O
operators O
are O
not O
adequate O
when O
trying O
to O
test O
software O
features O
associated O
with O
specific O
domains O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


In B-SENT
this O
article O
, O
we O
propose O
mutation O
operators O
specific O
to O
the O
domain O
of O
Geographic O
Information O
Systems O
( O
GIS O
) O
applications O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


These B-SENT
operators O
reproduce O
programming O
errors O
that O
are O
litely O
to O
occur O
during O
the O
development O
of O
this O
type O
of O
applications O
. O

In B-SENT
addition O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
we O
present O
the O
implementation O
of O
these O
operators O
and O
as O
proof O
of O
concept O
we O
apply O
these O
operators O
to O
two O
real-world O
GIS O

-DOCSTART- X

applications O
and O
we O
generate O
the O
mutants O
. O

2. B-SENT
Mutation O
Operators O
for O
GIS O

As B-SENT
a O
previous O
step O
to O
designing O
the O
mutation O
operators O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
main O
technologies O
used O
specifically O
in O
the O
development O
of O
GIS O
, O
and O
we O
identified O
typical O
errors O
a O
programmer O

-DOCSTART- X

can O
introduce O
during O
the O
development O
. O

These B-SENT
errors O
were O
formalized O
into O
mutation O
operators O
. O

In B-SENT
order O
to O
apply O
these O
operators O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
SUT O
, O
we O
rely O
on O
Java O
reflection O
and O
aspect-oriented O
programming O
. O

Reflection B-SENT
allows O
us O
to O
obtain O
the O
list O
of O
classes O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
methods O
of O
the O
SUT O
, O
so O
the O
user O
can O
decide O
the O
methods O
to O
wish O
the O
operators O
will O
be O
applied O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Later B-SENT
, O
we O
capture O
information O
about O
the O
methods O
of O
the O
SUT O
to O
be O
mutated O
, O
together O
with O
the O
information O
of O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

mutation O
operators O
that O
were O
already O
defined O
. O

From B-SENT
these O
data O
, O
we O
generate O
the O
mutation O
operator O
, O
in O
the O
form O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

on O
aspect O
, O
which O
will O
then O
be O
possible O
to O
interweave O
with O
the O
SUT O
which O
generates O
a O
mutant O
of O
the O
SUT O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Next B-SENT
, O
we O
describe O
the O
definition O
of O
two O
operators O
and O
two O
cases O
of O
application O
on O
real-world O
GIS O
applications O
. O

ChangeCoordSys B-SENT

( O
Listing O

: O

It B-SENT
exchanges O
the O
coordinate O
system O
of O
a O

, O
so O
it O
does O
not O
match O
the O
coordinate O

-DOCSTART- X

system O
that O
is O
being O
used O
in O
the O
user O
interface O
. O

It B-SENT
simulates O
the O
error O
of O
not O
checking O
that O
the O
coordinate O
system O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
correct O
. O

The B-SENT
error O
is O
introduced O
by O
directly O
modifying O
the O
coordinate O
system O
of O
geometry O
when O
recovering O
the O
wrapping O

the O

Listing B-SENT

A O

ChangeCoordSys O
Operator O

This B-SENT
operator O
was O
applied O
to O
a O
mobile O
technology O

-DOCSTART- X

GIS O
application O
. O

This B-SENT
application O
allows O
registering O
places O
of O
interest O
for O
the O
user O
. O

These B-SENT
areas O
of O
interest O
are O
called O
Geofences O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

A B-SENT
Geofence O
is O
determined O
by O
a O
geographical O
location O
expressed O
in O
terms O
of O
latitude O
, O
longitude O
, O
and O
a O
radius O
around O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
location O
. O

By B-SENT
creating O
a O
Geofence O
with O
an O
erroneous O
location O
from O
its O
central O
location O
, O
the O
device O
will O
receive O
incorrect O

To B-SENT
test O
this O
operator O
it O
was O
applied O
to O
a O
land O

. O

The B-SENT
objective O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
land O
reparcelling O
is O
to O
reunify O
the O

of O
an O

we O
can O
find O
both O
generic O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

specific O
mutation O
operators O
. O

However B-SENT
, O
these O
are O
not O
adequate O
to O
cover O
errors O
in O
particular O
domains O
. O

We B-SENT
have O
defined O
new O

-DOCSTART- X

operators O
specific O
to O
the O
GIS O
domain O
and O
a O
way O
to O
apply O
them O
to O
a O
SUT O

In B-SENT
addition O
, O
we O
have O

-DOCSTART- X

tested O
the O
operators O
defined O
in O
two O
GIS O
applications O
. O

As B-SENT
future O
work O
, O
we O
intend O
to O
extend O
this O
approach O
to O
other O

-DOCSTART- X

domains O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
use O
the O

as O
the O

limb O

To B-SENT
test O
if O
the O
postural O
differences O
observed O
in O
this O
study O
produced O
changes O
in O
limb O

we O

measured O
the O

However B-SENT

we O

Maybe B-SENT
this O

that O
a O
recent O

failed O
to O
find O
differences O

, O
suggesting O
that O
simple O

morphological O
correlates O

be O
used O
with O
caution O

Interestingly B-SENT
, O
femur O

tended O
to O
be O
greater O
in O
the O

both O

signifcant O

Longer B-SENT
limbs O
are O
expected O
to O
experience O
larger O
bending O
and O
torsional O
moments O
, O
so O
the O
fact O
that O
experimental O

-DOCSTART- X

animals O
had O
longer O
femora O
suggests O
that O
limb O
verticalization O
reduces O
these O

by O
orienting O
the O

more O

If B-SENT
this O
were O
the O
case O

it O
would O
support O
the O
idea O
that O
non-avian O
theropods O
have O

Thus B-SENT

our O

This B-SENT

One B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

caveat O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
our O
approach O
uses O
tail O
reduction O
as O
the O
mechanism O
for O
CoM O
displacement O
despite O
it O
has O
been O

-DOCSTART- X

recently O
shown O
that O
the O
evolutionary O
change O
in O
CoM O
position O
was O
driven O
instead O
by O
forelimb O
enlargement O
[ O
8 O
] O
. O

Nonetheless B-SENT
, O

-DOCSTART- X

this O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
tail O
reduction O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
CoM O
displacement O
, O
but O
that O
it O
was O
not O
the O
most O

-DOCSTART- X

important O
factor O
. O

Ideally B-SENT
we O
would O
have O
increased O
tail O
mass O
and O
reduced O
pectoral O
limb O
mass O
but O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
this O
is O

-DOCSTART- X

not O
experimentally O
feasible O
. O

We B-SENT
argue O
that O
our O
experimental O
approach O
, O
although O
not O
perfect O
, O
was O
effective O
in O
displacing O
the O
CoM O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
recreating O
locomotor O
patterns O
expected O
in O
non-avian O
theropods O
. O

Thus B-SENT
, O
we O
expect O
that O
careful O
phenotypic O
manipulation O
of O
extant O
birds O
can O

-DOCSTART- X

open O
new O
avenues O
of O
experimental O
investigation O

In B-SENT

, O
they O
wanted O

To B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

investigate O
this O
, O
Daniel O
experimented O
by O
puncturing O
the O
wall O
of O
a O
pipe O
with O
a O
small O
open O
ended O
straw O
and O
noted O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
height O
to O
which O
the O
fluid O
rose O
up O
the O
straw O
was O
related O
to O
fluid O
's O
pressure O
in O
the O
pipe O
. O

Soon B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

physicians O
all O
over O
Europe O
were O
measuring O
patients O
' O
blood O
pressure O
by O
sticking O
point-ended O
glass O
tubes O
directly O
into O
their O
arteries O
. O

It B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

was O
not O
until O
about O
170 O
years O
later O
, O
in O
1896 O
that O
an O
Italian O
doctor O
discovered O
a O
less O
painful O
method O
which O
is O

-DOCSTART- X

still O
in O
use O
today O
. O

However B-SENT
, O
Bernoulli O
's O
method O
of O
measuring O
pressure O
is O
still O
used O
today O
in O
modern O
aircraft O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

measure O
the O
speed O
of O
the O
air O
passing O
the O

that O
is O
its O
air O
speed O
. O

Taking B-SENT
his O
discoveries O
further O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

Daniel O
Bernoulli O
now O
returned O
to O
his O
earlier O
work O
on O
Conservation O
of O
Energy O
. O

It B-SENT
was O
known O
that O
a O
moving O
body O
exchanges O

-DOCSTART- X

its O
kinetic O
energy O
for O
potential O
energy O
when O
it O
gains O
height O
. O

Daniel B-SENT
realised O
that O
in O
a O
similar O
way O
, O
a O
moving O

-DOCSTART- X

fluid O
exchanges O
its O
kinetic O
energy O
for O
pressure O
. O

Mathematically B-SENT
this O
law O
is O
now O
written O
: O
½ O
ρ O
u O
2 O
+ O
P O

-DOCSTART- X

= O
constant O
where O
P O
is O
pressure O
, O
ρ O
is O
the O
density O
of O
the O
fluid O
and O
u O
is O
its O
velocity O
. O

A B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

consequence O
of O
this O
law O
is O
that O
if O
the O
velocity O
increases O
then O
the O
pressure O
falls O
. O

This B-SENT
is O
exploited O
by O
the O
wing O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
an O
aeroplane O
which O
is O
designed O
to O
create O
an O
area O
above O
its O
surface O
where O
the O
air O
velocity O
increases O
. O

The B-SENT
pressure O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
this O
area O
is O
lower O
than O
that O
under O
the O
wing O
, O
so O
the O
wing O
is O
pushed O
upwards O
by O
the O
relatively O
higher O

The B-SENT

Biography B-SENT

According B-SENT
to O
hagiography O
, O
Theodorus O
was O

-DOCSTART- X

born O
into O
a O
wealthy O
Christian O
family O
and O
was O
well O
educated O
from O
a O
young O
age O
. O

Early B-SENT
in O
life O
he O
denied O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

excesses O
of O
his O
parents O
, O
and O
at O
the O
age O
of O
fourteen O
joined O
a O
monastery O
in O
the O
diocese O
of O
Sne O
, O
near O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
modern O
town O
of O
Esna O
, O
Egypt O
. O

A B-SENT
brother O
from O
Theodorus O
’ O
monastery O
stayed O
with O
Pachomius O
in O
Tabennese O
while O
traveling O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
preached O
of O
the O
virtues O
of O
the O
Koinonia O
upon O
his O
return O
to O
Sne O
. O

Praying B-SENT
and O
weeping O
, O
Theodorus O
became O
determined O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
his O
destiny O
lay O
with O
Pachomius O
. O

Although B-SENT
initially O
denied O
passage O
to O
Tabennese O
by O
a O
Pachomian O
monk O
due O
to O
his O
wealthy O

-DOCSTART- X

background O
, O
Theodorus O
opted O
to O
follow O
the O
visiting O
monk O
, O
and O
his O
persistence O
( O
and O
lack O
of O
obedience O
) O
paid O
off O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

He B-SENT
was O
welcomed O
by O
Pachomius O
upon O
his O
arrival O
, O
and O
quickly O
integrated O
into O
the O
community O
at O
Tabennese O
around O
328 O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Quickly B-SENT
becoming O
a O
favorite O
of O
Pachomius O
, O
Theodorus O
lived O
an O
enviably O
ascetic O
life O
in O
the O
monastery O
, O
and O
took O
on O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

title O
of O
the O
" O
brothers O
’ O
comforter O
" O
. O

Theodorus B-SENT
asserted O
his O
influence O
openly O
( O
which O
resulted O
in O
reprimands O
from O
Pachomius O

-DOCSTART- X

) O
and O
generally O
maintained O
himself O
as O
a O
prominent O
figure O
at O
Tabennese O
for O
several O
years O
, O
despite O
never O
being O
given O
a O
position O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
power O
in O
the O
monastic O
hierarchy O
. O

Finally B-SENT
, O
Pachomius O
called O
on O
him O
to O
preach O
to O
the O
brothers O
despite O
his O
youth O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
and O
eventually O
appointed O
him O
steward O
of O
Tabennese O
after O
several O
new O
monasteries O
had O
been O
built O
. O

Retiring B-SENT
to O
the O
monastery O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

Phbow O
, O
Pachomius O
gave O
Theodorus O
complete O
control O
over O
Tabennese O
, O
though O
recalled O
him O
from O
the O
position O
after O
witnessing O
several O
monks O
under O

-DOCSTART- X

Theodorus O
’ O
watch O
violating O
the O
monastic O
rules O
without O
reprimand O
. O

Having B-SENT
failed O
to O
prove O
his O
governing O
ability O
and O
once O
more O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
position O
no O
higher O
than O
when O
he O
had O
entered O
the O
monastery O
, O
Theodorus O
became O
a O
personal O
assistant O
to O
Pachomius O
and O
remained O

-DOCSTART- X

relatively O
quiet O
for O
some O
years O
. O

Despite B-SENT
his O
clear O
potential O
and O
popularity O
, O
Pachomius O
refused O
to O
grant O
Theodorus O
any O
kind O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

authority O
; O
though O
the O
old O
man O
's O
failing O
health O
soon O
changed O
things O
forever O
. O

After B-SENT
Theodorus O
had O
been O
assisting O
Pachomius O
at O

-DOCSTART- X

Tabennese O
for O
several O
years O
following O
his O
demotion O
, O
Pachomius O
became O
very O
ill O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
death O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Pachomius B-SENT
had O
not O
named O
a O
successor O
, O
and O
several O
brothers O
pleaded O
with O
Theodorus O
to O
assert O
himself O
as O
head O
of O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

Koinonia O
when O
the O
sickly O
man O
died O
. O

Despite B-SENT
the O
assertion O
that O
Theodorus O
apparently O
did O
not O
want O
the O
rank O
of O
a O
father O

-DOCSTART- X

or O
this O
world O
's O
glory O
, O
he O
consented O
. O

Unfortunately B-SENT
for O
the O
would-be O
leader O
, O
Pachomius O
recovered O
, O
and O
upon O
hearing O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
Theodorus O
’ O
decision O
, O
exiled O
the O
ambitious O
young O
man O
. O

After B-SENT
living O
a O
life O
of O
constant O
weeping O
and O
prayer O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

solitude O
, O
Pachomius O
forgave O
Theodorus O
and O
allowed O
him O
to O
live O
among O
the O
brothers O
once O
more O
. O

Normalcy B-SENT
returned O
, O
though O
never O

-DOCSTART- X

again O
would O
Pachomius O
fully O
trust O
his O
former O
protégé O
. O

In B-SENT
348 O
Pachomius O
died O
, O
naming O
the O
brother O
Petronios O
as O
his O
successor O

-DOCSTART- X

rather O
than O
the O
clearly O
qualified O
Theodorus O
. O

The B-SENT
death O
of O
Petronios O
later O
that O
year O
would O
leave O
Apa O
Horsiesios O
in O
charge O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
the O
popular O
Theodorus O
would O
retreat O
to O
the O
distant O
monastery O
of O
Phnoum O
. O

Although B-SENT
it O
seems O
Theodorus O
practiced O
complete O
submission O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
new O
leader O
of O
the O
Koinonia O
, O
problems O
soon O
arose O
in O
several O
Pachomian O
monasteries O
that O
viewed O
Horsiesios O
as O
a O
weak O
leader O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Refusing B-SENT
to O
work O
or O
communicate O
and O
demanding O
a O
new O
leader O
, O
many O
of O
the O
elder O
monks O
completely O
abandoned O
any O
notion O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
obedience O
to O
Horsiesios O
. O

The B-SENT
federation O
of O
monasteries O
was O
falling O
apart O
, O
and O
Theodorus O
rushed O
to O
Tabennese O
to O
placate O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

rebels O
. O

Soon B-SENT
after O
his O
arrival O
, O
Theodorus O
was O
the O
new O
de O
facto O
leader O
, O
though O
he O
claimed O
to O
be O
only O

-DOCSTART- X

acting O
on O
behalf O
of O
Horsiesios O
. O

For B-SENT
eighteen O
years O
Theodorus O
administered O
from O
Pachomius O
’ O
old O
headquarters O
in O
Phbow O
, O
using O
techniques O

-DOCSTART- X

far O
more O
assertive O
than O
his O
predecessors O
, O
such O
as O
constantly O
shuffling O
the O
offices O
and O
locations O
of O
the O
most O
ambitious O
monks O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Yet B-SENT
in O
spite O
of O
this O
somewhat O
unstable O
shifting O
, O
the O
Koinonia O
was O
ruled O
peacefully O
for O
nearly O
two O
decades O
, O
at O
which O

-DOCSTART- X

point O
Theodorus O
predicted O
he O
would O
soon O
die O
. O

Within B-SENT
a O
few O
months O
his O
prediction O
came O
true O
, O
and O
Apa O
Horsiesios O
once O

-DOCSTART- X

more O
took O
his O
place O
as O
the O
head O

When B-SENT
Tyler O
was O
very O
young O
, O
his O
grandmother O
was O
his O
favorite O
person O
in O
the O
world O
because O
, O
unlike O
his O

, O

-DOCSTART- X

who O
believed O
that O

the O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
his O

Santa O
Claus O

the O
Easter O

His B-SENT
parents O
were O
always O
too O
busy O
and O
often O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
little O
too O
serious O
, O
but O
his O
grandmother O
had O
a O
sense O
of O
peace O
about O
her O
, O
a O
lightness O
that O
lifted O
his O

-DOCSTART- X

spirit O

A B-SENT
few O
times O
, O
when O
Tyler O

parents O
were O
away O
, O
she O
took O
him O
with O
her O
to O
church O

-DOCSTART- X


He B-SENT
remembered O
liking O
the O
singing O
and O
the O
colorful O
windows O
, O
and O
how O
safe O
he O
felt O
there O
, O
in O
that O
large O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

empty O
space O
, O
sitting O
on O
a O
hard O
bench O
next O

her O
warmth O

When B-SENT
she O
died O
, O
grief O
overwhelmed O
Tyler O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


But B-SENT
like O
most O
adults O
, O
when O
he O
grew O
older O
he O
could O
only O
recall O
the O
intensity O
of O
that O
love O
in O
childhood O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

an O
abstract O
way O
. O

He B-SENT
made O
the O
common O
error O
of O
identifying O
maturity O
with O
worth O
, O
and O
assumed O
that O
the O
love O
he O

-DOCSTART- X

had O
for O
her O
as O
a O
young O
child O
must O
have O
been O
lacking O
in O
strength O
and O
depth O
. O

For B-SENT
many O
years O
after O
her O

-DOCSTART- X

death O
, O
however O
, O
Tyler O
was O
tortured O
by O
the O
memory O
of O
a O
certain O
visit O
from O
her O
. O

He B-SENT
was O
five O
or O

-DOCSTART- X

so O
, O
and O
they O
were O
playing O
some O
board O
game O
at O
the O
kitchen O
table O
. O

As B-SENT
he O
swung O
his O
legs O
in O
his O

-DOCSTART- X

excitement O
, O
he O
kicked O
her O
repeatedly O
in O
the O
shins O
. O

She B-SENT
asked O
him O
to O
stop O
, O
and O
he O
refused O
, O
giggling O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

When B-SENT
she O
finally O
frowned O
at O
him O
and O
threatened O
to O
stop O
playing O
if O
he O
did O
n’t O
stop O
he O
told O
her O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

go O
to O
Hell O
. O

In B-SENT
Tyler O
’s O
mind O
he O
could O
see O
her O
face O
grow O
taut O
, O
lose O
color O
, O
and O
then O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
for O
the O
only O
time O
he O
could O
remember O
, O
she O
began O
to O
cry O
. O

He B-SENT
also O
remembered O
his O
own O
utter O
confusion O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

His B-SENT
parents O
did O
not O
have O
much O
use O
for O
religion O
and O
so O
for O
him O
Hell O
was O
a O
word O
without O
much O
mystery O

-DOCSTART- X

or O
power O
. O

At B-SENT
that O
time O
he O
knew O
only O
vaguely O
that O
Hell O
was O
a O
place O
you O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
like O
the O
dark O
basement O
or O
the O
even O
darker O
attic O
. O

He B-SENT
remembered O
feeling O
resentful O
that O
she O
was O
crying O
and O
he O

-DOCSTART- X

did O
not O
even O
understand O
why O
. O

Tyler B-SENT
felt O
the O
guilt O
of O
this O
memory O
even O
in O
his O
teenage O
years O
. O

For B-SENT
him O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
summed O
up O
all O
his O
insecurities O
and O
fears O
about O
his O
own O
cruelty O
, O
ignorance O
, O
and O
the O
possibility O
that O
he O
was O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
in O
reality O
, O
not O
a O
good O
person O
. O

The B-SENT
fact O
that O
he O
had O
caused O
someone O
who O
loved O
him O
such O
pain O

-DOCSTART- X

with O
so O
little O
effort O
and O
understanding O
troubled O
him O
deeply O
. O

One B-SENT
day O
Tyler O
looked O
through O
an O
old O
family O
photo O
album O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
in O
it O
was O
a O
picture O
of O
the O
kitchen O
in O
the O
house O
they O
used O
to O
live O
in O
. O

He B-SENT
was O
surprised O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
discover O
that O
the O
small O
kitchen O
contained O
a O
central O
island O
, O
and O
had O
no O
space O
for O
the O
table O
in O
his O
memory O

-DOCSTART- X

at O
all O
. O

With B-SENT
the O
discovery O
of O
that O
single O
error O
in O
his O
memory O
came O
a O
cascade O
of O
other O
revelations O
. O

Now B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

he O
remembered O
that O
they O
always O
ate O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
, O
and O
when O
they O
did O
play O
board O
games O
, O
it O
was O

-DOCSTART- X

always O
on O
the O
coffee O
table O
in O
the O
living O
room O
. O

The B-SENT
memory O
that O
had O
caused O
him O
such O
pain O
over O
the O
years O

-DOCSTART- X

could O
not O
possibly O
have O
occurred O
. O

Somehow B-SENT
, O
he O
must O
have O
manufactured O
the O
whole O
scene O
in O
his O
imagination O
. O

It B-SENT
was O

-DOCSTART- X

not O
very O
hard O
to O
explain O
what O
really O
happened O
, O
he O
thought O
. O

The B-SENT
death O
of O
his O
grandmother O
had O
probably O
caused O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

him O
feelings O
of O
abandonment O
and O
guilt O
. O

In B-SENT
his O
confusion O
he O
had O
taken O
elements O
from O
storybooks O
and O
imagined O
out O
of O
nothing O

-DOCSTART- X

this O
memory O
to O
punish O
himself O
. O

This B-SENT
was O
the O
sort O
of O
fantasy O
that O
could O
have O
occurred O
to O
any O
young O
child O
who O

-DOCSTART- X

lost O
an O
important O
relative O
. O

With B-SENT
that O
realization O
, O
the O
image O
of O
his O
grandmother O
crying O
faded O
in O
his O
memory O
and O
became O

-DOCSTART- X

less O
and O
less O
believable O
. O

Tyler B-SENT
thought O
he O
was O
very O
lucky O
to O
have O
discovered O
the O
single O
error O
in O
his O
false O
memory O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
which O
enabled O
him O
to O
reason O
his O
way O
into O
distinguishing O
between O
reality O
and O
fantasy O
. O

He B-SENT
felt O
that O
it O
was O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

coming-of-age O
moment O
. O

Nonetheless B-SENT
, O
he O
admitted O
to O
himself O
that O
he O
was O
a O
little O
sad O
also O
at O
the O
discovery O
. O

For B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

however O
imaginary O
that O
memory O
was O
, O
it O
was O
also O
a O
part O
of O
his O
love O
for O
his O
grandmother O
. O

When B-SENT
that O
memory O

-DOCSTART- X

lost O
its O
compelling O
aura O
of O
truth O
, O
it O
was O
like O
another O
part O
of O
her O
died O
with O
it O
. O

He B-SENT
had O
no O

-DOCSTART- X

name O
for O
the O
emptiness O
that O
remained O
. O

-DOCSTART- X

Everyone B-SENT

the O

of O
a O
once O

Imperial O

An B-SENT

whose O
costly O

would O
for O

-DOCSTART- X

many O
years O
to O
come O
echo O
into O
every O

And B-SENT
with O
those O
mistakes O
would O
come O
death O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

billions O
of O
innocent O

A B-SENT
starfighter O
hurtled O
through O
the O

the O

desperate O

way O

Jacques B-SENT
Chalmers O
was O
not O
alone O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

his O
frustration O
with O
the O
current O
situation O
, O
but O
he O
was O
doubtless O
one O
of O
the O
most O
panicked O
. O

He B-SENT
tried O
to O
steady O

-DOCSTART- X

himself O
as O
he O
began O
cycling O
once O
again O
through O
the O

options O
for O
his O

His B-SENT
anxiety O

-DOCSTART- X

continued O
to O
grow O
with O
each O
passing O
second O
, O
every O
change O
of O
the O
screen O
doing O
nothing O

it O

He B-SENT
stopped O

-DOCSTART- X

midway O
through O
the O
calibration O
and O
glanced O
out O
of O
his O

The B-SENT
scene O
was O
the O

as O
it O
had O
been O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

few O
moments O
ago O
and O
it O
brought O
him O
no O

He B-SENT

In B-SENT
his O

-DOCSTART- X

he O
had O
never O
seen O
anything O

not O
even O
in O

The B-SENT
enormous O
forms O
of O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

loomed O
like O
giants O
atop O
a O

, O
staring O
down O

Then B-SENT
there O
were O
the O

themselves O
: O
hundreds O

swarming O
about O

At B-SENT
the O

shone O

the O

saw O
unwonted O
ripples O
tipped O

-DOCSTART- X

with O
yellow O

as O

Silent B-SENT

sparkling O

baleful O
, O
those O
moon-cursed O
waters O
hurried O
I O
knew O
not O
whither O
; O

-DOCSTART- X

whilst O
from O
the O
embowered O
banks O
white O
lotos-blossoms O
fluttered O
one O
by O
one O
in O
the O
opiate O
night-wind O
and O
dropped O
despairingly O
into O
the O
stream O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
swirling O
away O
horribly O
under O
the O

carven O

And B-SENT
as O
I O
ran O
along O

crushing O

maddened O
ever O

the O

I O
saw O
that O
the O

had O
no O
end O

-DOCSTART- X

under O
that O
moon O

for O
where O
by O

the O

there O
stretched O
now O
only O
new O

the O
lips O

whispered O

bade O
me O
follow O

-DOCSTART- X

nor O
did O
I O
cease O
my O
steps O
till O
the O
stream O
became O
a O
river O
, O
and O
joined O
amidst O
marshes O
of O
swaying O
reeds O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

beaches O
of O
gleaming O
sand O
the O
shore O
of O
a O
vast O
and O
nameless O
sea O

Upon B-SENT
that O
sea O
the O
hateful O
moon O
shone O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
over O
its O
unvocal O
waves O
weird O
perfumes O
breeded O

And B-SENT
as O
I O
saw O
therein O
the O
lotos-faces O
vanish O
, O
I O
longed O
for O

-DOCSTART- X

nets O
that O
I O
might O
capture O
them O
and O
learn O
from O
them O
the O
secrets O
which O
the O

had O
brought O
upon O
the O
night O

-DOCSTART- X


But B-SENT
when O
that O
moon O
went O
over O
to O
the O
west O
and O
the O
still O
tide O
ebbed O
from O
the O
sullen O
shore O
, O
I O
saw O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
that O
light O
old O
spires O
that O
the O
waves O
almost O
uncovered O
, O
and O
white O
columns O
gay O
with O
festoons O
of O
green O
seaweed O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


And B-SENT
knowing O
that O
to O
this O
sunken O
place O
all O
the O
dead O
had O
come O
, O
I O
trembled O
and O
did O
not O
wish O

-DOCSTART- X

speak O
with O
the O
lotos-faces O

Yet B-SENT

I O
saw O
afar O
out O
in O
the O
sea O
a O
black O
condor O
descend O
from O
the O
sky O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
seek O
rest O
on O
a O
vast O
reef O
, O
I O
would O
fain O
have O
questioned O
him O
, O
and O
asked O
him O
of O
those O
whom O

-DOCSTART- X

I O
had O
known O
when O
they O
were O
alive O
. O

This B-SENT
I O
would O
have O
asked O
him O
had O
he O
not O
been O
so O
far O
away O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
but O
he O
was O
very O
far O
, O
and O
could O
not O
be O
seen O
at O
all O
when O
he O
drew O
nigh O
that O
gigantic O
reef O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

So B-SENT
I O
watched O
the O
tide O
go O
out O
under O
that O
sinking O
moon O
, O
and O
saw O
gleaming O
the O
spires O
, O
the O
towers O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
and O
the O
roofs O
of O
that O
dead O
, O
dripping O
city O

And B-SENT
as O
I O
watched O
, O
my O
nostrils O
tried O
to O
close O

-DOCSTART- X

against O
the O
perfume-conquering O

of O
the O

all O

I O

lay O

In B-SENT

“ O

She B-SENT
stayed O

I O
held O

We B-SENT

bound O

misfortune O

Mine B-SENT
was O
developmental O

His B-SENT
was O

left O

nearsightedness O

acne O

and O
( O

a O

His B-SENT

never O

I B-SENT

to O

the O
worst O

-DOCSTART- X


I B-SENT
could O

could O

he O
was O

might O

I B-SENT

But B-SENT
that O

had O
been O
cut O
out O

along O

I B-SENT
was O

Every B-SENT

Maybe B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

I O

Then B-SENT
again O

-DOCSTART- X

Pag O

had O

a O

In B-SENT
the O

Back B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

the O
way O
I O
’ve O
decided O
to O
present O
the O
title O
of O
this O
book O
. O

Most B-SENT
versions O
in O
English O
are O
called O
The O
Chemical O

-DOCSTART- X

Wedding O
of O
Christian O
Rosencreutz O
, O
which O
suggests O
( O
and O
most O
people O
who O
’ve O
heard O
of O
it O
suppose O
) O
that O
the O
wedding O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
Christian O
’s O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
not O
; O
Christian O
Rosencreutz O
is O
the O
purported O
author O
of O
a O
book O
called O
The O
Chemical O
Wedding O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

The B-SENT
actual O
author O
is O
Johann O
Valentin O
Andreae O
, O
whose O
name O
did O
n’t O
appear O
on O
the O
book O
originally O
, O
thus O
ensuring O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
confusion O
. O

I B-SENT
’ll O
call O
it O
herein O
( O
as O
everyone O
mostly O
does O
) O
simply O
The O
Chemical O
Wedding O
. O

Though B-SENT
its O

-DOCSTART- X

original O
readers O
would O
have O
had O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
context O
for O
the O
truly O
bizarre O
and O
surprising O
events O
it O
tells O
of O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
’s O
possible O
that O
The O
Chemical O
Wedding O
is O
now O
more O
enjoyable O
without O
knowing O
that O
context O
, O
and O
experiencing O
the O
book O
unmediated O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

You B-SENT
might O
therefore O
wish O
to O
start O
right O
in O
on O
the O
first O
page O
of O
text O
that O
follows O
and O
only O
then O
return O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
this O
introduction O
. O

Consider B-SENT
a O
similar O
case O
: O
a O
little O
book O
published O
in O
1934 O
by O
the O
Surrealist O
artist O
Max O
Ernst O

-DOCSTART- X

called O
Une O
Semaine O
de O
Bonté O
. O

It B-SENT
was O
made O
entirely O
of O
collaged O

out O
of O

The B-SENT
First O
Day O

-DOCSTART- X


It B-SENT
was O
just O
before O
Easter O
Sunday O
, O
1 O
and O
I O
was O
sitting O
at O
my O
table O
. O

I B-SENT
’d O
said O
my O
prayers O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
talking O
a O
long O
time O
as O
usual O
with O
my O
Maker O
and O
thinking O
about O
some O
of O
the O
great O
mysteries O
the O
Father O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

Lights O
had O
revealed O
to O
me O
. O

Now B-SENT
I O
was O
ready O
to O
make O
and O
to O
bake O
– O
only O
in O
my O
heart O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

actually O
– O
a O
small O
, O
perfect O
unleavened O
wafer O
to O
eat O
with O
my O
beloved O
Paschal O
Lamb O
. O

All B-SENT
of O
a O
sudden O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

terrible O
wind O
blew O
up O
, O
so O
strong O
that O
I O
thought O
the O
hill O
my O
little O
house O
was O
built O
on O
would O
be O
blown O

-DOCSTART- X

apart O
– O
but O
I O
’d O
seen O
the O
Devil O
do O
things O
as O
bad O
as O
this O
before O
( O
the O
Devil O
had O
often O
tried O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
harm O
me O
) O
, O
so O
I O
took O
heart O
and O
went O
on O
meditating O
. O

Till B-SENT
I O
felt O
somebody O
touch O
me O
on O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
back O
. O

This B-SENT
frightened O
me O
so O
that O
I O
did O
n’t O
dare O
turn O
. O

I B-SENT
tried O
to O
stay O
as O
brave O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

calm O
as O
a O
human O
being O
could O
under O
the O
circumstances O
. O

I B-SENT
felt O
my O
coat O
tugged O
at O
, O
and O
tugged O
again O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
at O
last O
I O
looked O
around O
. O

A B-SENT
woman O
stood O
there O
, O
so O
bright O
and O
beautiful O
, O
in O
a O
sky-colored O
robe O

-DOCSTART- X

– O

1 B-SENT
Christian O
’s O
story O
begins O
just O
before O
Easter O
, O
like O
Dante O
’s O
Divine O
Comedy O
. O

It B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

can O
be O
seen O
as O
an O
allegory O
of O
Christ O
’s O
death O
and O
resurrection O
, O
though O
this O
idea O
produces O
some O
puzzles O
. O

The B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

birds O
sang O
so O
beautifully O
, O
the O
young O
deer O
skipped O
so O
happily O
, O
that O
it O
gladdened O
my O
old O
heart O
, O
and O
I O

-DOCSTART- X

could O
n't O
help O
singing O
too O
... O

THE B-SENT
FOURTH O
DAY O

I B-SENT
was O
awake O
and O
lying O
in O
bed O
next O
morning O
, O
looking O
idly O

-DOCSTART- X

at O
the O
wonderful O
images O
and O
inscriptions O
all O
around O
my O
room O
, O
when O
suddenly O
I O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
trumpets O
, O
as O

-DOCSTART- X

if O
a O
procession O
were O
already O
underway O
. O

My B-SENT
page O
jumped O
out O
of O
bed O
as O
if O
crazed O
, O
looking O
more O
dead O
than O

-DOCSTART- X

alive O
, O
and O
you O
can O
imagine O
how O
I O
felt O
when O
he O
cried O
, O
“ O
They O
're O
already O
being O
presented O
to O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

king O
! O
" O

I B-SENT
could O
only O
groan O
in O
frustration O
and O
curse O
my O
lazy O
bones O
. O

I B-SENT
got O
dressed O
, O
but O
my O

-DOCSTART- X

page O
was O
quicker O
than O
I O
was O
and O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
chamber O
to O
see O
what O
was O
what O
. O

He B-SENT
soon O
came O

-DOCSTART- X

back O
and O
gave O
me O
the O
good O
news O
that O
I O
actually O
had O
n’t O
overslept O
; O
all O
I O
’d O
done O
was O
miss O
breakfast O

-DOCSTART- X

: O
they O
had O
n’t O
wanted O
to O
wake O
an O
old O
man O
who O
needed O
his O
rest O
. O

But B-SENT
now O
I O
had O
to O
get O

-DOCSTART- X

ready O
to O
go O
with O
him O
to O
the O
lion O
fountain O
, O
where O
most O
of O
the O
others O
were O
gathered O
. O

Such B-SENT
a O
relief O

-DOCSTART- X

! O

My B-SENT
spirits O
recovered O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
had O
got O
into O
my O
habit O
, O
I O
followed O
him O
to O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

garden O
I O
have O
already O
told O
about O
. O

I B-SENT
found O
that O
the O
lion O
, O
in O
place O
of O
his O
sword O
, O
now O
held O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
rather O
large O
plaque O
. O

Examining B-SENT
this O
, O
I O
could O
tell O
that O
it O
had O
been O
taken O
from O
those O
ancient O
monuments O
I O

-DOCSTART- X

’d O
seen O
and O
put O
here O
for O
some O
special O
reason O
. O

The B-SENT
inscription O
on O
it O
was O
fading O
away O
, O
so O
I O
should O

-DOCSTART- X

set O
it O
down O
here O
as O
it O
was O
then O
, O
and O
ask O
my O
readers O
to O
ponder O
it O
: O

I O
try O

We B-SENT
collected O

in O

got O
the O

between O
the O

and O
the O

We B-SENT
infected O
the O
ants O
by O
preparing O
a O

of O
the O

Afterwards B-SENT
, O

-DOCSTART- X

each O

dried O

put O

After B-SENT

we O
took O

For B-SENT
this O
we O
basically O
put O

either O

without O

a O

-DOCSTART- X


And B-SENT
afterwards O
either O
infected O
them O
or O
not O

Then O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
we O
count O
every O
day O
how O
many O
ants O
died O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

This B-SENT
gives O
us O
the O
data O
to O
do O
a O
so-called O
survival O
analysis O
. O

We B-SENT
measured O
the O
ROS-concentration O
in O
the O
bodies O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

ants O
after O
they O
ingested O
the O
food O
with O
the O

By B-SENT
adding O
certain O

The B-SENT
detrimental O
effect O
of O
ROS O

was O
easy O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
measure O

We B-SENT
mixed O
different O

ROS O

the O

plated O
them O
out O

with O
an O

A B-SENT
day O

we O
counted O
how O

still O
alive O

How B-SENT
reliable O

-DOCSTART- X

do O
you O
consider O
your O
results O

The B-SENT
results O
we O
got O
are O
very O

We B-SENT
had O
a O

colonies O

wherever O

we O

the O

does O

-DOCSTART- X

n't O

For B-SENT
how O

have O
you O
been O

involved O

Over B-SENT
50 O
years O

I B-SENT
am O
61 O
now O
so O
I O
really O
started O
when O
I O

-DOCSTART- X

was O
about O
10 O
years O
old O
even O
though O
I O
had O
seen O
and O
worked O
with O
some O
basic O
tricks O
a O
few O
years O
earlier O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


I B-SENT
remember O
going O
into O
Hollywood O
Magic O
and O
wanting O
that O
big O
red O
box O
with O
the O
dragons O
on O
it O
and O
I O
did O
n't O

-DOCSTART- X

even O
know O
what O
it O
did O
. O

The B-SENT
magician O
behind O
the O
counter O
was O
wise O
enough O
not O
to O
sell O
it O
to O
me O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

but O
instead O
sold O
me O
two O
books O
which O
I O
still O
own O

That B-SENT
started O
me O
out O
on O

I O
have O
amassed O
quite O
a O
few O
since O
then O

Do B-SENT
you O
think O
magic O
is O
alive O
as O
a O
viable O
form O
of O
entertainment O
today O
? O

Absolutely B-SENT
. O

There B-SENT
are O
more O
magicians O
working O

-DOCSTART- X

today O
than O
ever O
before O
. O

There B-SENT
will O
always O
be O
an O
audience O
for O
good O
magicians O
doing O
good O
magic O
. O

Has B-SENT
the O
internet O

-DOCSTART- X

helped O
or O
hurt O
magic O
? O

Both B-SENT
. O

I B-SENT
think O
it O
has O
helped O
draw O
younger O
people O
to O
magic O
as O
a O
hobby O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

but O
I O
think O
it O
has O
hurt O
the O
ability O
of O
young O
magicians O
to O
think O
because O
so O
many O
rely O
on O
the O
internet O
for O

-DOCSTART- X

everything O
and O
they O
are O
n't O
reading O
the O
books O
. O

We B-SENT
have O
to O
have O
knowledge O
of O
the O
history O
of O
magic O
and O
what O

-DOCSTART- X

has O
been O
done O
before O
. O

Moreover B-SENT
, O
seeing O
someone O
perform O
on O
the O
internet O
takes O
away O
the O
use O
of O
our O
senses O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

originality O
and O
imagination O
that O
reading O
and O
thinking O
about O
magic O
can O
produce O
. O

Anyone B-SENT
can O
become O
a O
monkey O
; O
it O
takes O
serious O

-DOCSTART- X

study O

Do B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

for O
an O
interview O
in O
his O
MIT O
office O
in O
Cambridge O
, O
Massachusetts O
. O

On B-SENT
NATO O

I B-SENT
just O
wanted O
to O
know O
if O
you O

-DOCSTART- X

had O
any O
thoughts O
on O
recent O
NATO O
actions O
and O
the O
protests O
coming O
up O
at O
the O
60th O
NATO O
conference O
, O
I O
know O
you O

-DOCSTART- X

’re O
speaking O
at O
the O
counter-conference O
. O

Could B-SENT
be O
I O
give O
so O
many O
talks O
I O
ca O
n’t O
remember O
. O

On B-SENT
the O
NATO O

-DOCSTART- X

conference O
, O
well O
I O
mean O
the O
obvious O
question O
is O
why O
should O
NATO O
exist O
? O

In B-SENT
fact O
you O
can O
ask O
questions O
about O

-DOCSTART- X

why O
it O
should O
ever O
have O
existed O
, O
but O
now O
why O
should O
it O
exist O
. O

I B-SENT
mean O
the O
theory O
was O
, O
whether O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
defensive O
alliance O
against O
potential O
Soviet O
aggression O
, O
that O
’s O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

basic O
doctrine O
. O

Well B-SENT
there O
’s O
no O
defense O
against O
Soviet O
aggression O
, O
so O
whether O
you O
believe O
that O
doctrine O
or O
not O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

’s O
gone O
. O

When B-SENT
the O
Soviet O
Union O
collapsed O
there O
had O
been O
an O
agreement O
, O
a O
recent O
agreement O
, O
between O
Gorbachev O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
U.S O
government O
and O
the O
first O
Bush O
administration O
. O

The B-SENT
agreement O
was O
that O
Gorbachev O
agreed O
to O
a O
quite O
remarkable O
concession O
: O

-DOCSTART- X

he O
agreed O
to O
let O
a O
united O
Germany O
join O
the O
NATO O
military O
alliance O
. O

Now B-SENT
it O
is O
remarkable O
in O
the O
light O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

history O
, O
the O
history O
of O
the O
past O
century O
, O
Germany O
alone O
had O
virtually O
destroyed O
Russia O
, O
twice O
, O
and O
Germany O
backed O

-DOCSTART- X

by O
a O
hostile O
military O
alliance O
, O
centered O
in O
the O
most O
phenomenal O
military O
power O
in O
history O
, O
that O
’s O
a O
real O
threat O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Nevertheless B-SENT
he O
agreed O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
quid O
pro O
quo O
, O
namely O
that O
NATO O
should O
not O
expand O
to O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

east O
, O
so O
Russia O
would O
at O
least O
have O
a O
kind O
of O
security O
zone O
. O

And B-SENT
George O
Bush O
and O
James O
Baker O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

secretary O
of O
state O
, O
agreed O
that O
NATO O
would O
not O
expand O
one O
inch O
to O
the O
east O
. O

Gorbachev B-SENT
also O
proposed O
a O
nuclear O

-DOCSTART- X

free O
weapons O
zone O
in O
the O
region O
, O
but O
the O
U.S O
would O
n’t O
consider O
that O
. O

Okay B-SENT
, O
so O
that O
was O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

basis O
on O
which O
then O
shortly O
after O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
collapsed O
. O

Well B-SENT
, O
Clinton O
came O
into O
office O
what O
did O
he O
do O

-DOCSTART- X

? O

Well B-SENT
one O
of O
the O
first O
things O
he O
did O
was O
to O
back O
down O
on O
the O
promise O
of O
not O
expanding O
NATO O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
east O
. O

Well B-SENT
that O
’s O
a O
significant O
threat O
to O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
, O
to O
Russia O
now O
that O
there O
was O
no O

-DOCSTART- X

longer O
any O
Soviet O
Union O
, O
it O
was O
a O
significant O
threat O
to O
Russia O
and O
not O
surprisingly O
they O
responded O
by O
beefing O
up O
their O

-DOCSTART- X

offensive O
capacity O
, O
not O
much O
but O
some O
. O

So B-SENT
they O
rescinded O
their O
pledge O
not O
to O
use O
nuclear O
weapons O
on O
first O
strike O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
NATO O
had O
never O
rescinded O
it O
, O
but O
they O
had O
and O
started O
some O
remilitarization O
. O

With B-SENT
Bush O
, O
the O
aggressive O
militarism O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
the O
Bush O
administration O
, O
as O
predicted O
, O
induced O
Russia O
to O
extend O
further O
its O
offensive O
military O
capacity O
; O
it O
’s O
still O

-DOCSTART- X

going O
on O
right O
now O
. O

When B-SENT
Bush O
proposed O
the O
missile O
defense O
systems O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
, O
Poland O
and O
Czechoslovakia O
, O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

was O
a O
real O
provocation O
to O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
. O

I B-SENT
mean O
that O
was O
discussed O
in O
U.S O
arms O
control O
journals O
, O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

they O
would O
have O
to O
regard O
as O
a O
potential O
threat O
to O
their O
strategic O
deterrent O
, O
meaning O
as O
a O
first O
strike O
weapon O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


And B-SENT
the O
claim O
was O
that O
it O
had O
to O
do O
with O
Iranian O
missiles O
, O
but O
forget O
about O
that O
. O

Take B-SENT
say O
on O

-DOCSTART- X

Obama O
, O
Obama O
’s O
national O
security O
advisor O
James O
Jones O
former O
Marine O
commandant O
is O
on O
record O
of O
favoring O
expansion O
of O
NATO O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
south O
and O
the O
east O
, O
further O
expansion O
of O
NATO O
, O
and O
also O
making O
it O
an O
intervention O
force O
. O

And B-SENT
the O

-DOCSTART- X

head O
of O
NATO O
, O
Hoop O
Scheffer O
, O
he O
has O
explained O
that O
NATO O
must O
take O
on O
responsibility O
for O
ensuring O
the O
security O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

pipelines O
and O
sea O
lanes O
, O
that O
is O
NATO O
must O
be O
a O
guarantor O
of O
energy O
supplies O
for O
the O
West O
. O

Well B-SENT
that O

-DOCSTART- X

’s O
kind O
of O
an O
unending O
war O
, O
so O
do O
we O
want O
NATO O
to O
exist O
, O
do O
we O
want O
there O
to O
be O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
Western O
military O
alliance O
that O
carries O
out O
these O
activities O
, O
with O
no O
pretense O
of O
defense O
? O

Well B-SENT
I O
think O
that O
’s O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
pretty O
good O
question O
; O
I O
do O
n’t O
see O
why O
it O
should O
, O
I O
mean O
there O
happens O
to O
be O
no O
other O

-DOCSTART- X

military O
alliance O
remotely O
comparable O
— O
if O
there O
happened O
to O
be O
one O
I O
’d O
be O
opposed O
to O
that O
too O
. O

So B-SENT
I O

-DOCSTART- X

think O
the O
first O
question O
is O
, O
what O
is O
this O
all O
about O
, O
why O
should O
we O
even O
be O
debating O
NATO O
, O
is O

-DOCSTART- X

there O
any O
reason O
why O
it O
should O
exist O
? O

Labor B-SENT
actions O
as O
a O
revival O
of O
the O
Left O

We B-SENT
’ve O
seen O
mass O
strikes O

-DOCSTART- X

all O
around O
the O
world O
, O
in O
countries O
that O
we O
would O
n’t O
expect O
it O
. O

Do B-SENT
you O
think O
this O
is O
a O
revival O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
the O
Left O
in O
the O
West O
? O

Or B-SENT
do O
you O
think O
it O
’s O
nothing O
? O

It B-SENT
’s O
really O
hard O
to O
tell O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

I B-SENT
mean O
there O
’s O
certainly O
signs O
of O
it O
, O
and O
in O
the O
United O
States O
too O
, O
in O
fact O
we O
had O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
sit O
down O
strike O
in O
the O
United O
States O
not O
long O
ago O
, O
which O
is O
a O
very O
militant O
labor O
action O
. O

Sit B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

I B-SENT
was O
amazed O

really O
excited O
. O

I B-SENT
think O
to O
say O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

was O
unexpected O
is O
inaccurate O
, O
because O
it O
implies O
that O
there O
was O
a O
well-founded O
expectation O
of O
something O
. O

The B-SENT
technology O
that O
Frank O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
his O
colleagues O
are O
using O
to O
explore O
the O
ice O
is O
so O
important O
because O
, O
given O
our O
lack O
of O
data O
, O
we O

-DOCSTART- X

have O
no O
reasonable O
expectation O
of O
what O
it O
should O

what O
it O
should O

you O

I B-SENT
would O
love O

But B-SENT
I O
am O
also O
happy O
to O
not O

as O

-DOCSTART- X

more O
animals O

What B-SENT
I O
want O
to O
do O
with O
the O

requires O
new O
material O
preserved O

ways O

-DOCSTART- X

it O

my O

understanding O

would O

formulate O
more O

better O
questions O

-DOCSTART- X

about O
the O

ship O

and O
if O

they O

These B-SENT

are O
shrouded O

Some B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

of O
the O
most O
intriguing O

are O
chemical O

do O
they O

is O

they O
are O
all O
preserved O
in O

( O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
kind O
of O

. O

The B-SENT
formalin O
is O
great O
for O
preserving O
structures O
, O
but O
for O
anemones O
, O
it O
prevents O

-DOCSTART- X

study O
of O
DNA O
or O

This B-SENT
means O
we O

is O

that O
when O

conduct O

and O
figure O

what O
these O

have O

do O
( O

that O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Just B-SENT
knowing O
a O
whole O

is O

very O
useful O
, O
even O
if O
that O
animal O
is O
as O

-DOCSTART- X

special O
as O
these O
clearly O
are O
- O

we B-SENT
need O
to O
know O
what O
about O
them O
is O
different O
and O
thus O
related O
to O
living O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

this O
strange O
way O

The B-SENT
only O
way O
to O
get O
at O
what O
's O
different O
is O
to O
make O

This B-SENT

it O

By B-SENT
comparing O
my O
observations O
to O
what O
my O

had O
found O

I O
figured O
out O
what O

three O

It B-SENT

We B-SENT

I B-SENT

also O

Why B-SENT
did O
you O

I B-SENT
think O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

one O
of O
the O
most O
empowering O
things O

-DOCSTART- X

? O

I B-SENT
think O
that O
building O
a O
universal O
how-to O
manual O
would O
be O
a O
tremendous O
gift O
for O
the O
world O
. O

Knowledge B-SENT
is O
power O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
wikiHow O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
make O
all O
of O
us O
a O
bit O
more O
powerful O
. O

I B-SENT
've O
been O
interested O
in O
building O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
comprehensive O
how-to O
manual O
long O
before O
I O
first O
envisioned O
wikiHow O
. O

My B-SENT
first O
attempt O
at O
building O
this O
resource O
was O
a O
website O

-DOCSTART- X

I O
used O
to O
run O
called O
eHow O
. O

eHow B-SENT
was O
and O
continues O
to O
be O
the O
largest O
and O
how O

in O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

world O
. O

eHow B-SENT
contains O
copyrighted O
content O
run O
on O
proprietary O

. O

When B-SENT
I O
ran O
eHow O
, O
the O
content O
was O
professionally O
produced O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
edited O
. O

This B-SENT
business O
model O
worked O
for O
producing O
content O
on O
topics O
that O
appeal O
to O
advertisers O
in O
languages O
like O
English O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

have O
large O
advertising O
markets O
. O

However B-SENT
, O
paying O
people O
to O
write O
and O
edit O
articles O
ultimately O
means O
that O
you O
have O
to O
make O

-DOCSTART- X

one O
of O
two O
sacrifices O
. O

You B-SENT
either O

do O
n't O

or O
2 O
) O
you O
sacrifice O
on O

produce O

that O
does O
n't O
cost O
much O
to O

-DOCSTART- X


I B-SENT
was O
n't O
interested O
in O
making O
either O
of O
these O
sacrifices O
, O
as O
I O
think O
the O
world O
's O
how O
to O
manual O
needs O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
be O
high O
quality O
AND O
comprehensive O
. O

So B-SENT
ultimately O
I O
decided O
that O
eHow O
's O
model O
would O
not O
build O
the O
resource O
I O

-DOCSTART- X

envisioned O
. O

When B-SENT
I O
discovered O
Wikipedia O
, O
I O
recognized O
that O
the O
wiki O
model O
had O
the O
potential O
to O
build O
the O
how-to O
resource O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
world O
really O
needs O
. O

So B-SENT
I O
decided O
to O
sell O
eHow O
and O
use O
the O
proceeds O
to O
build O
wikiHow O
. O

Why B-SENT

you O

In B-SENT
my O
opinion O

should O
be O

you O
only O

they O

I B-SENT
believe O
that O

been O
a O
key O
element O
of O
our O
success O
thus O
far O

-DOCSTART- X

My B-SENT
hope O
is O
that O
over O

will O
demand O
this O
of O
any O

they O
invest O

a O

that O

That B-SENT

Why B-SENT
do O
you O

the O

so O
little O

Sports B-SENT

the O

largely O
reaffirm O
existing O

It B-SENT

the O

-DOCSTART- X

belief O
that O

, O
rather O
than O
changes O
, O
existing O

Paralympic B-SENT
sport O
brings O
attention O
to O
athletes O

-DOCSTART- X

who O
are O
typically O
overlooked O
in O
American O
society O
because O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
population O
does O
not O
want O
to O
identify O
with O

who O

-DOCSTART- X

are O
disabled O
. O

Although B-SENT
disability O
is O
not O
contagious O
, O
interest O
in O
disabled O
sports O
might O
put O
into O
question O
the O
masculinity O
of O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

males O
following O
it O
. O

Disabled B-SENT
athletes O
also O
challenge O
existing O

of O

by O
displaying O
dedication O
, O
hard O
work O
and O
perseverance O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

different O

those O

Even B-SENT
though O

less O
strong O
than O
the O
one O
provided O

by O
the O

, O
many O
social O

more O

-DOCSTART- X

What B-SENT
do O
you O
think O
the O
impact O
will O
be O
for O
the O
Paralympic O
movement O
will O
be O
with O
the O
Games O
being O
televised O
live O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
the O
United O
States O
for O
first O
time O
? O

The B-SENT
impact O
depends O
on O
a O
number O
of O
aspects O
. O

One B-SENT
of O
them O
is O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
channels O
that O
NBC O
as O
the O
broadcasting O
rights O
owner O
for O
the O
United O
States O
will O
use O
to O
air O
the O
Paralympic O
Games O
on O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Will B-SENT
they O
be O
shown O
nationally O
or O
regionally O
, O
on O
NBC O
or O
on O
any O
of O
the O
company O
’s O
multiple O
cable O
networks O

-DOCSTART- X

? O

A B-SENT
second O
aspect O
is O
the O
parts O
or O
hours O
of O
the O
day O
the O
Paralympics O
will O
be O
shown O
. O

Remember B-SENT
that O
there O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
a O
nine-hour O
difference O
between O
Sochi O
and O
New O
York O
, O
and O
a O
12-hour O
difference O
between O
Sochi O
and O
the O
US O
West O
Coast O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

So B-SENT
daytime O
events O
will O
be O
shown O
live O
in O
the O
United O
States O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
, O
and O
evening O

-DOCSTART- X

prime-time O
events O
will O
be O
shown O
— O
indeed O
live O
— O
in O
the O
morning O
U.S. O
time O
. O

So B-SENT
showing O
the O
Paralympics O
live O
on O

-DOCSTART- X

United O
States O
television O
might O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
less O
glamorous O
than O
it O
appears O
. O

A B-SENT
third O
important O
factor O
is O
the O
way O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
event O
will O
be O
mediated O
: O
will O
NBC O
have O
its O
best O
sports O

the O
event O

? O

Will B-SENT
they O
treat O
and O
announce O
the O
competitions O
as O
they O
do O
all O
others O
— O
for O
better O
and O
worse O
? O

Will B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

they O
take O
it O
as O
an O
opportunity O
to O
educate O
viewers O
about O
disability O
and O
diversity O
while O
showing O
superb O
athletic O
performances O
without O
engaging O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
discourse O
of O
pity O
? O

All B-SENT
in O
all O
, O
I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
terrific O
opportunity O
to O
improve O
sports O
coverage O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
multitude O
of O
aspects O
; O
but O
we O
will O
have O
to O
wait O
until O

to O
assess O
to O

extent O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

one O
? O

It B-SENT
's O
quite O
a O
large O
Canadian O
tournament O
, O
and O
so O
we O
went O
as O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
Gliders O
team O
. O

So B-SENT
we O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
as O
many O
international O
games O
as O
possible O
. O

Cause B-SENT
that O
's O
one O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
our O
problems O
really O
, O
to O
compete O
. O

It B-SENT
costs O
us O
so O
much O
money O
to O
for O
us O
to O
travel O
overseas O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
compete O
internationally O
. O

And B-SENT
so O
we O
can O
compete O
against O
each O
other O
all O
the O
time O
within O
Australia O
but O
we O
really O
need O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
be O
able O
to O
... O

It B-SENT
's O
not O
the O
same O
. O

No B-SENT
, O
it O
's O
really O
not O
, O
so O
it O
's O

-DOCSTART- X

really O
important O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
as O
a O
many O
international O
trips O
throughout O
the O
year O
to O
continue O
our O
improvement O
. O

Also B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

see O
where O
all O
the O
other O
teams O
are O
at O
as O
well O
. O

But B-SENT
yes O
, O
Spitfire O
was O
good O
. O

We B-SENT
took O
quite O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
few O
new O
girls O
over O
there O
back O
then O
in O
2005 O
, O
leading O
into O
the O
World O
Cup O
in O
the O
Netherlands O
. O

Was B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

that O
the O
one O
where O
you O
were O
the O
captain O
of O
the O
team O
, O
in O
2005 O
? O

Or B-SENT
was O
that O
a O
later O
one O

-DOCSTART- X

? O

No B-SENT
, O
I O
captained O
in O
2010 O
. O

So B-SENT
2009 O
, O
2010 O
World O
Cup O
. O

And B-SENT
then O
I O
had O
a O
bit O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
some O
time O
off O
in O
2011 O
. O

The B-SENT
Gliders O
have O
never O
won O
the O
World O
Championship O
. O

We B-SENT
always O
seem O
to O
have O

-DOCSTART- X

just O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
chill O
out O
at O
the O
World O
Cup O
. O

I B-SENT
do O
n't O
know O
why O
. O

It B-SENT
's O

-DOCSTART- X

really O
strange O
occurrence O
, O
over O
the O
years O
. O

2002 B-SENT
World O
Cup O
, O
we O
won O
bronze O
. O

Then B-SENT
in O
2006 O
we O
ended O

-DOCSTART- X

up O
fourth O
. O

It B-SENT
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
World O
Cups O
we O
've O
played O
actually O
. O

And B-SENT
then O
in O
2010 O
we O

-DOCSTART- X

just O
... O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
happened O
. O

We B-SENT
just O
did O
n't O
play O
as O
well O
as O
we O
thought O
we O
would O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Came B-SENT
fourth O
. O

But B-SENT
you O
know O
what O
? O

Fired B-SENT
us O
up O
for O
the O
actual O
Paralympics O
. O

So B-SENT
the O
World O
Cup O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
... O
it O
's O
good O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
well O
at O
the O
World O
Cup O
, O
to O
be O
placed O
, O
but O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
also O
means O
that O
you O
get O
a O
really O
good O
opportunity O
to O
know O
where O
you O
're O
at O
in O
that O
two O
year O
gap O

-DOCSTART- X

between O
the O
Paralympics O
. O

So B-SENT
you O
can O
come O
back O
home O
and O
revisit O
what O
you O
need O
to O
do O
and O
, O
you O
know O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
where O
the O
team O
's O
at O
. O

And B-SENT
all O
that O
sort O
of O
stuff O
. O

Unfortunately B-SENT
, O
they O
are O
talking O
about O
moving O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
so O
it O
will O
be O
on O
the O
year O
before O
the O
Paralympics O
. O

Oh B-SENT
really O
. O

The B-SENT
competition O
from O
the O
[ O
FIFA O

-DOCSTART- X

] O
World O
Cup O
and O
all O
. O

Right B-SENT
. O

Well B-SENT
, O
that O
would O
be O
sad O
. O

2007 O

You B-SENT
have O
received O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

good O
deal O
of O
attention O
recently O
. O

Even B-SENT
though O
I O
m O
not O
Michael O

or O
somebody O
, O
when O
people O
come O
up O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

me O
and O
introduce O

' O
Hey O

-DOCSTART- X

Hey O

my O

and O
they O

It B-SENT

a O
funny O
phenomenon O
. O

What B-SENT
goes O
through O

-DOCSTART- X

your O
head O
when O
that O
happens O
? O

I B-SENT
understand O
it O
. O

I B-SENT
've O
gone O
to O
readings O
and O
concerts O
. O

I B-SENT
look O
at O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
as O
human O
interaction O
. O

Over B-SENT
the O
years O
I O
have O
performed O
in O
32 O
countries O
and O
40 O
states O
. O

I B-SENT
've O
been O

-DOCSTART- X

doing O
this O
professionally O
since O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
, O
and O
before O
that O
since O
I O
was O
sixteen O
doing O
little O
tidbit O
poetry O

-DOCSTART- X

readings O
in O
coffeehouses O
. O

The B-SENT
band O
I O
started O
in O
1993 O
, O
Spoken O
Motion O
, O
received O
a O
lot O
of O
recognition O
as O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

spoken O

band O
born O
out O
of O
the O
New O

spoken O

scene O
. O

I B-SENT
worked O
with O
some O
great O
musicians O
and O
performed O

-DOCSTART- X

around O
the O
world O
. O

I B-SENT
remember O
signing O
my O
first O
autograph O
to O
a O
kid O
when O
I O
was O
25 O
years O
old O
. O

As B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

time O
went O
on O
, O
I O
came O
out O
with O
books O
and O
CDs O
, O
and O
I O
became O
used O
to O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

To B-SENT
me O
, O
the O
ultimate O
feeling O
of O
success O
as O
an O
artist O
, O
is O
to O
move O
somebody O
enough O
where O
they O
thank O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
. O

When B-SENT
someone O
comes O
up O
and O
says O
, O
' O
Frank O
, O
thank O
you O
, O
your O
work O
is O
great O
. O
" O

-DOCSTART- X


You B-SENT
have O
a O
long O
career O
in O
poetry O
, O
but O
as O
of O
late O
the O
attention O
you O
have O
garnered O
is O
for O
the O
Mets-inspired O

-DOCSTART- X

work O
. O

How B-SENT
do O
you O
feel O
about O
having O
a O
lot O
of O
your O
work O
overshadowed O
by O
the O
Mets O
work O
? O

It B-SENT
's O

-DOCSTART- X

ironic O
. O

Some B-SENT
of O
the O
greatest O
poetry O
has O
been O
born O
out O
of O
failure O
and O
the O
depths O
of O
adversity O
in O
the O
human O

-DOCSTART- X

experience O
. O

Walt B-SENT
Whitman O
, O
the O
first O
great O
American O
poet O
, O
wrote O
about O
the O
Civil O
War O
. O

He B-SENT
went O
looking O
for O

-DOCSTART- X

his O
brother O
, O
George O
Whitman O
, O
after O
he O
a O
telegram O
telling O
him O
his O
brother O
was O
injured O
in O
the O
South O
. O

When B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

he O
started O
out O
his O
poems O
were O
about O
beating O
drums O
, O
and O
blow O
, O
bugle O
, O
blow O
. O

Real B-SENT
patriotic O
. O

Then B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

he O
started O
to O
see O
the O
real O
horrors O
of O
war O
. O

He B-SENT
was O
able O
to O
tap O
into O
the O
human O
condition O
and O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

situation O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Eventually B-SENT
when O
he O
found O
his O
brother O
he O
had O
resolution O
. O

I B-SENT
experienced O
that O
kind O
of O
adversity O

-DOCSTART- X

during O
9/11 O
being O
a O
civilian O
volunteer O
. O

I B-SENT
loaded O
ferry O
boats O
in O
Jersey O
City O
across O
the O
river O
to O
deliver O
goods O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

Ground O
Zero O
. O

I B-SENT
turned O
to O
Whitman O
to O
find O
some O
understanding O
of O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
world O
right O
now O
. O

When B-SENT
I O
wrote O
my O

I B-SENT

baseball O
is O
just O

you O
do O

you O

a O

? O

Writers B-SENT
will O
occasionally O
write O
their O

we O
come O
up O

we O

We B-SENT

No B-SENT
, O
not O

We B-SENT
are O
a O
little O
less O

We B-SENT
tend O
to O

target O
the O

more O

anything O

We B-SENT
’ll O

the O

portrayal O

as O
much O

-DOCSTART- X

as O
we O

We B-SENT
’ll O
attack O

much O

-DOCSTART- X

as O
Britney O
. O

In B-SENT
an O
interview O
with O
Terry O
Gross O
, O
Stephen O
Colbert O
said O
of O
his O
time O
at O
Second O
City O
that O
they O

-DOCSTART- X

had O
decided O
on O
not O
doing O
political O
humor O
and O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
hackneyed O
political O
humor O
such O
as O
Ted O
Kennedy O
drinking O
jokes O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

They B-SENT
felt O
it O
was O
overdone O
, O
mean-spirited O
and O
not O
funny O
. O

Do B-SENT
your O
writers O
have O
similar O
rules O
of O
thumb O
? O

-DOCSTART- X


We B-SENT
do O
n’t O
have O
any O
rules O
or O
known O
lines O
we O
wo O
n’t O
cross O
. O

We B-SENT
have O
an O
understanding O
based O
upon O
having O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
same O
writers O
in O
the O
back O
room O
for O
years O
, O
and O
those O
writers O
training O
the O
new O
writers O
as O
they O
come O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

There B-SENT
is O
an O
understanding O
in O
the O
room O
. O

If B-SENT
it O
makes O
the O
room O
laugh O
, O
it O
probably O
ends O
up O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
paper O
. O

One B-SENT
example O
is O
we O
ran O
an O
article O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
back O
that O
was O
, O
" O
No O
Jennifer O

" O
. O

That B-SENT
was O
our O
reaction O
to O
all O
of O
the O
J-Lo O
stuff O
. O

We B-SENT
were O
n’t O
going O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

touch O
on O
her O
dress O
, O
or O
who O
she O
was O
dating O
. O

Just B-SENT
the O
fact O
that O
those O
were O
the O
lead O
stories O
for O

-DOCSTART- X

so O
many O
days O
, O
in O
everything O
from O
US O
Weekly O
to O
Time O
Magazine O
. O

I B-SENT
think O
it O
’s O
important O
we O
have O
an O

-DOCSTART- X

original O
take O
on O
those O
things O
. O

I B-SENT
think O
it O
’s O
similar O
to O
what O
Colbert O
said O
to O
Terry O
Gross O
. O

We B-SENT
do O

-DOCSTART- X

n’t O
want O
to O
just O
traffic O
in O
the O
same O
24 O
hour O
news O
cycle O
. O

There B-SENT
’s O
a O
24 O
hour O
comedy O
news O
cycle O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
exists O
on O
all O
the O
late O
night O
talk O
shows O
. O

The B-SENT
Onion O
has O
a O
different O
creative O
process O
where O
we O
are O
not O

-DOCSTART- X

trying O
to O
hit O
everything O
in O
the O
24 O
hours O
and O
on O
the O
same O
notes O
. O

We B-SENT
want O
an O
original O
take O
. O

If B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

we O
choose O
to O
do O
something O
on O
J-Lo O
, O
it O
’s O
going O
to O
be O
something O
like O
that O
, O
something O
less O
obvious O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


When B-SENT
you O
are O
going O
through O
the O
headlines O
, O
is O
it O
just O
you O
guys O
sitting O
around O
trying O
to O
crack O
each O
other O
up O

-DOCSTART- X

? O

It B-SENT
’s O
the O
least O
amount O
of O
fun O
possible O
. O

Nah B-SENT
, O
I O
’m O
kidding O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
actually O
more O
businesslike O

-DOCSTART- X

than O
you O
’d O
imagine O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
very O
much O
like O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
make O
the O
room O
laugh O
, O
but O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

room O
has O
been O
a O
sort O
of O
captive O
audience O
for O
many O
many O
years O
now O
, O
so O
it O
takes O
a O
lot O
to O
make O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
room O
laugh O
. O

The B-SENT
best O
analogy O
I O
’ve O
heard O
is O
when O
Rob O
Siegel O
, O
former O
editor-in-chief O
, O
likened O
it O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

wine O
tasting O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
this O
quiet O
experience O
where O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
soak O
in O
what O
the O
joke O
is O
, O
have O

-DOCSTART- X

we O
done O
anything O
like O
this O
, O
is O
it O
a O
unique O
take O
, O
what O
are O
other O
people O
doing O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
sort O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
like O
, O
" O
Hmmm O
... O
that O
’s O
hilarious O
. O
That O
’s O
really O
really O
funny O
" O
rather O
than O
people O
falling O
off O

-DOCSTART- X

their O
chairs O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
more O
subdued O
than O
I O
think O
what O
most O
people O
would O
expect O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
more O
analytical O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

clinical O
? O

Not B-SENT
all O
the O
time O
, O
but O
it O
ca O
n’t O
be O
a O
laugh O
a O
minute O
. O

Yeah B-SENT
, O
what O
you O

-DOCSTART- X

see O
on O
Studio O
60 O
and O
30 O
Rock O
, O
those O
are O
scripted O
writers O
rooms O
. O

Everything B-SENT
is O
funny O
there O
. O

There B-SENT
's O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
lot O
of O
unfunny O
jokes O
that O
are O
told O
in O
a O
back O
room O
, O
that O
's O
why O
they O
stay O
and O
die O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
back O
room O
and O
do O
n’t O
go O
out O
in O
The O
Onion O
. O

If B-SENT
someone O
is O
continually O
telling O
unfunny O
jokes O
, O
do O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
eventually O
fire O
them O
? O

That B-SENT
’s O
why O
we O
are O
on O
the O
10th O
floor O
to O
make O
sure O
they O
die O
when O
they O

-DOCSTART- X

get O
kicked O
out O
. O

It B-SENT
can O
be O
a O
real O
mess O
on O
Broadway O
. O

By B-SENT
the O
time O
you O
get O
to O
be O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

writer O
for O
The O
Onion O
, O
though O
, O
the O
odds O
are O
you O
are O
going O
to O
succeed O
because O
we O
make O
it O
pretty O
challenging O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

You B-SENT
go O
through O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O

You B-SENT
will O
already O
have O
demonstrated O
a O
pretty O
long O
successful O
record O
of O
writing O
stuff O

-DOCSTART- X

for O
us O
before O
you O
will O
be O
in O
that O
room O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
. O

But B-SENT
if O
somebody O
wakes O
up O
one O
morning O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
suddenly O
no O
longer O
is O
funny O
, O
then O
yeah O
, O
head O
first O
, O
out O
the O
door O
as O
quickly O
as O

At B-SENT
the O

Interview B-SENT

Aner B-SENT
Shalev O

What B-SENT
are O
you O
going O
to O
talk O
about O
here O
in O
Levico O
? O

I B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

called O
it O
Character O
, O
walks O
and O
words O
. O

There B-SENT
is O
a O
whole O
topic O
which O
is O
called O
asymptotic O
groups O
theory O
. O

There B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

are O
groups O
which O
express O
the O
symmetry O
of O
some O
structures O
. O

Studying B-SENT
groups O
is O
a O
bit O
like O
studying O
symmetry O
. O

It B-SENT
's O

-DOCSTART- X

very O
beautiful O
I O
think O
. O

And B-SENT
then O
when O
you O
do O
it O
in O
an O
asymptotic O
way O
is O
like O
you O
do O
n't O
look O

-DOCSTART- X

at O
the O
small O
details O
. O

It B-SENT
's O
like O
from O
the O
sky O
. O

You B-SENT
look O
at O
the O
general O
patterns O
. O

And B-SENT
there O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
another O
topic O
which O
is O
very O
important O
in O
mathematics O
which O
is O
called O
representation O
theory O
. O

So B-SENT
I O
will O
mainly O
talk O
about O

-DOCSTART- X

how O
to O
use O
a O
representation O
theory O
to O
solve O
all O
kind O
of O
problems O
and O
conjectures O
in O
asymptotic O
groups O
theory O
. O

Why B-SENT
did O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
choose O
to O
study O
mathematics O
? O

First B-SENT
of O
all O
because O
it O
was O
beautiful O
. O

When B-SENT
I O
was O
ten O
my O
father O
already O

-DOCSTART- X

showed O
me O
some O
stuff O
in O
mathematics O
and O
the O
beauty O
and O
the O
imagination O
was O
quite O
apparent O
. O

I B-SENT
also O
like O
the O
freedom O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
mathematics O
. O

If B-SENT
you O
study O
physics O
or O
chemistry O
then O
you O
should O
describe O
the O
real O
world O
. O

But B-SENT
in O
mathematics O
you O

-DOCSTART- X

can O
build O
your O
own O
structures O
. O

You B-SENT
can O
walk O
in O
worlds O
created O
by O
the O
imagination O
of O
people O
. O

You B-SENT
're O
not O

-DOCSTART- X

committed O
to O
the O
real O
world O
. O

It B-SENT
's O
almost O
like O
God O
to O
some O
extent O
. O

You B-SENT
can O
create O
worlds O
, O
you O

-DOCSTART- X

can O
study O
them O
. O

I B-SENT
think O
it O
's O
a O
combination O
of O
the O
beauty O
, O
of O
the O
imagination O
, O
of O
the O
freedom O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Many B-SENT
people O
, O
and O
many O
students O
, O
dislike O
math O
. O

Why B-SENT
do O
you O
think O
it O
is O
so O
? O

First B-SENT
of O

-DOCSTART- X

all O
I O
think O
maybe O
they O
have O
bad O
teachers O
, O
which O
is O
a O
problem O
. O

You B-SENT
have O
to O
have O
very O
good O
teachers O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
mathematics O
if O
you O
really O
want O
to O
enjoy O
and O
to O
succeed O
in O
it O
. O

Probably B-SENT
some O
people O
mainly O
think O
about O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

scientific O
part O
of O
it O
– O
you O
have O
to O
be O
accurate O
- O
and O
they O
see O
less O
these O
elements O
of O
the O
freedom O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
the O
imagination O
, O
and O
creation O
. O

Maybe B-SENT
they O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
precise O
nature O
of O
mathematics O
. O

Also B-SENT
when O
I O

-DOCSTART- X

talk O
mathematics O
I O
notice O
the O
language O
is O
very O
important O
in O
mathematics O
and O
I O
actually O
notice O
that O
many O
times O
people O
fail O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

mathematics O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
write O
a O
composition O
. O

They B-SENT
have O
ideas O
but O
they O
can O
not O
formulate O
them O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
the O
right O
way O
. O

Actually B-SENT
I O
find O
many O
connections O
between O
mathematics O
and O
literature O
because O
almost O
all O
the O
thing O
I O
told O

-DOCSTART- X

about O
mathematics O
are O
also O
seen O
in O
literature O
and O
in O
writing O
because O
when O
you O
write O
you O
can O
describe O
the O
real O
world O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

but O
you O
can O
also O
create O
worlds O
of O
fiction O
. O

So B-SENT
you O
have O
imagination O
, O
you O
have O
total O
freedom O
, O
you O
can O

-DOCSTART- X

invent O
characters O
, O
you O
can O
invent O
all O
kind O
of O
development O
and O
surprises O
and O
this O
kind O
of O
end O
of O
story O
or O
another O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Also B-SENT
the O
language O
is O
important O
in O
writing O
and O
in O
literature O
. O

So B-SENT
in O
a O
way O
people O
often O
do O
n't O
know O

-DOCSTART- X

how O
to O
combine O
the O
two O
fields O
. O

It B-SENT
could O
look O
like O
almost O
the O
opposite O
: O
literature O
is O
kind O
of O
arts O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

mathematics O
is O
science O
but O
they O
also O
see O
a O
lot O
in O
common O
and O
there O
where O
mathematician O
who O
were O
writers O
. O

For B-SENT
example O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
most O
famous O
is O
Lewis O
Carrol O
, O
author O
of O
Alice O
in O
Wonderland O
. O

You B-SENT
're O
not O
only O
a O
mathematician O
. O

You B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

also O
wrote O
two O
collections O
of O
short O
stories O
and O
a O
novel O
. O

Why B-SENT
did O
you O
begin O
to O
write O
? O

When B-SENT
I O
was O

-DOCSTART- X

quite O
young O
I O
was O
interested O
in O
psychoanalysis O
and O
in O
dreams O
. O

I B-SENT
was O
trying O
to O
interpret O
my O
dreams O
. O

I B-SENT
started O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
write O
down O
my O
dreams O
. O

And B-SENT
then O
I O
noticed O
that O
I O
cheat O
a O
little O
bit O
when O
I O
write O
them O
down O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Sometimes B-SENT
I O
make O
them O
more O
pretty O
then O
they O
were O
actually O
. O

So B-SENT
instead O
of O
documenting O
the O
dreams O
it O
gradually O
became O

-DOCSTART- X

also O
like O
adding O
creational O
elements O
, O
and O
I O
think O
that O
somehow O
through O
writing O
my O
dreams O
I O
gradually O
came O
to O
writing O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

also O
poems O
, O
but O
mainly O
stories O
. O

I B-SENT
'm O
a O
little O
bit O
inspired O
by O
dreams O
but O
when O
eventually O
I O
started O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

write O
more O
seriously O
I O
was O
more O
interested O
in O
structure O
which O
also O
.. O
a O
bit O
like O
mathematics O
in O
a O
way O
.. O
for O

-DOCSTART- X

example O
my O
first O
book O
is O
called O
Opus O
1 O
.. O
a O
collection O
of O
four O

first O

part O
is O
called O
Legato O
and O
the O
second O
part O
was O
called O
Staccato O

In B-SENT
the O

part O
the O
sentences O
are O
very O
long O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
without O

almost O
like O

In B-SENT
the O
staccato O

it O

a O
lot O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
break O

very O
very O
short O

It B-SENT
was O
a O

experimenting O
connections O

the O

In B-SENT
the O

I O
made O
another O

It B-SENT

a O

-DOCSTART- X

I O

there O

no O

to O
the O

There B-SENT
are O
seventy O
beginning O
of O
stories O
without O

-DOCSTART- X

ends O
. O

In B-SENT
the O
novel O
Dark O
Matters O
I O
think O
what O
interested O
me O
in O
the O
structure O
was O
two O
thing O
: O
simple O
narrative O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
email O
. O

It B-SENT
keeps O
changing O
between O
narrative O
and O
email O
. O

Another B-SENT
thing O
was O
two O
different O
time O
scapes O
: O
one O
goes O

-DOCSTART- X

very O
slow O
and O
one O
goes O
very O
fast O
and O
they O
almost O
kind O
of O
meet O
in O
the O
end O
. O

It B-SENT
's O
a O
little O

-DOCSTART- X

bit O
like O
Achilles O
and O
the O
turtle O
. O

... B-SENT
love O
story O
and O
romance O
and O
surprises O
and O
tragedies O
and O
all O
this O
but O
also O

-DOCSTART- X

this O
structure O
interested O
me O
a O
lot O

Why B-SENT
did O
you O
choose O
this O
particular O
structure O
? O

When B-SENT
I O
tell O
stories O
I O
do O

-DOCSTART- X

n't O
like O
that O
everything O
will O
be O
clear O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

I B-SENT
like O
that O
something O
will O
be O
a O
bit O
of O
secret O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
or O
even O
unreliable O
narrator O
: O
someone O
tells O
something O
and O
first O
you O
trust O
him O
but O
then O
you O
read O
more O
and O
you O

-DOCSTART- X

become O
thrilled O
by O
everything O
. O

I B-SENT
think O
by O
using O
emails O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
which O
are O
more O
the O
voice O
of O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

woman O
Eva O
and O
narrative O
which O
is O
more O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
man O
Adam O
, O
I O
kind O
of O
confront O
them O
, O
their O

-DOCSTART- X

different O
perspective O
and O
then O
kind O
somehow O
you O
can O
see O
the O
distortions O
in O
the O
way O
the O

is O
told O
. O

I B-SENT
think O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
in O
this O
kind O
of O

there O
is O
a O
very O
gradual O
clarification O

in O
1999 O

It B-SENT
is O
really O
two O
missions O
in O
one O
. O

The B-SENT
primary O
science O
goal O
of O
the O
mission O
was O
to O
collect O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
sample O
from O
a O

, O
a O

called O

( O
pronounced O

" O
— O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

discoverer O
was O
German O
, O
I O
believe O
) O
. O

This B-SENT
is O
the O
first O
US O
" O
sample O

" O
mission O
since O
Apollo O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
the O
first O
ever O
from O
beyond O
the O
moon O
. O

This B-SENT
gives O
a O
little O
context O
. O

By B-SENT
" O
sample O
return O
" O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

course O
I O
mean O
a O
mission O
that O
brings O
back O
extraterrestrial O
material O
. O

I B-SENT
should O
have O
said O
above O
that O
this O
is O
the O
first O

-DOCSTART- X

" O
solid O
" O
sample O
return O
mission O
— O

Genesis B-SENT
brought O
back O
a O
sample O
from O
the O
Sun O
almost O
two O
years O
ago O
, O
but O

-DOCSTART- X

Stardust O
is O
also O
bringing O
back O
the O
first O
solid O
samples O
from O
the O
local O
interstellar O
medium O
— O

basically B-SENT
this O
is O
a O
sample O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
Galaxy O
. O

This B-SENT
is O
absolutely O
unprecedented O
, O
and O
we O
're O
obviously O
incredibly O
excited O
. O

I B-SENT
should O
mention O
parenthetically O
that O
there O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
a O
fantastic O
launch O
video O
— O
taken O
from O
the O
POV O
of O
the O

on O
the O
JPL O
Stardust O
website O
— O
highly O
recommended O

-DOCSTART- X

— O
best O
I O
've O
ever O
seen O
— O
all O
the O
way O
from O
the O
launch O
pad O
, O
too O
. O

Basically B-SENT
interplanetary O
trajectory O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Absolutely B-SENT
great O
. O

Is B-SENT
the O
video O
available O
to O
the O
public O
? O

Yes B-SENT
[ O
see O
below O
] O
. O

OK B-SENT
, O
I O
digress O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

The B-SENT
first O
challenge O
that O
we O
have O
before O
can O
do O
any O
kind O
of O
analysis O
of O
these O
interstellar O
dust O
particles O
is O
simply O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
find O
them O
. O

This B-SENT
is O
a O
big O
challenge O
because O
they O
are O
very O
small O
( O
order O
of O
micron O
in O
size O
) O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
are O
somewhere O
( O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
) O
on O
a O
HUGE O
collector O
— O
at O
least O
on O
the O
scale O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
particle O
size O
— O
about O
a O
tenth O
of O
a O
square O
meter O
. O

So B-SENT
... O

We B-SENT
're O
right O
now O
using O
an O
automated O

-DOCSTART- X

microscope O
that O
we O
developed O
several O
years O

question O

The B-SENT
short O
answer O
is O
that O
we O

The B-SENT
long O
answer O
is O
a O
bit O
more O
complicated O
. O

Here B-SENT
's O
what O
we O
know O

The B-SENT

caused O

by O

fact O
that O

respect O

. O

Markus B-SENT
Landgraf O
has O

-DOCSTART- X

estimated O
the O
number O
of O
interstellar O
dust O
particles O
that O
should O
have O
been O
captured O
by O

during O
two O
periods O

phase O

in O
which O
the O
spacecraft O
was O
moving O
with O
this O

He B-SENT
estimated O
that O
there O
should O

-DOCSTART- X

be O
around O
45 O
particles O
, O
but O
this O
number O
is O
very O
uncertain O
— O
I O
would O
n't O
be O
surprised O
if O
it O
is O
quite O

-DOCSTART- X

different O
from O
that O
. O

That B-SENT
was O
the O
long O
answer O
! O

One B-SENT
thing O
that O
I O
should O
say O
... O
is O
that O
like O
all O

-DOCSTART- X

research O
, O
the O
outcome O
of O
what O
we O
are O
doing O
is O
highly O
uncertain O

wonderful O
quote O

If O
we O

we O

it O

? O
" O

How B-SENT
big O
would O
the O

be O
? O

We B-SENT
expect O
that O
the O

they O
will O

-DOCSTART- X

be O
looking O
not O
for O
the O
particles O

for O
the O

Why B-SENT
very O

Beat O

While B-SENT
it O

( O

-DOCSTART- X

leading O

a O

product O
of O

To B-SENT
explain O
: O

Remember B-SENT
when O

a O

won O

-DOCSTART- X

Anne B-SENT

Did B-SENT

you O

I B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

bet O
they O
have O

I B-SENT
bet O
lots O

But B-SENT
to O
ensure O
that O
Bobby O
maintains O
a O
favorable O
batting O
average O

-DOCSTART- X

( O
and O
therefore O
looks O
good O
/ O
stays O
happy O
on O
the O

) O
, O
the O
producers O
ask O
what O
chefs O
intend O
to O
cook O

-DOCSTART- X

as O
their O
signature O
dish O
in O
the O
audition O
process O
, O
and O
then O
only O
pick O
challengers O
who O
either O
a) O
, O
are O
going O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

cook O
something O
that O
's O
already O
in O
Bobby O

( O
how O
many O

, O

-DOCSTART- X

or O
b) O
, O
are O
going O

something O
unique O

but O
it O

an O

( O
or O
just O
plain O

-DOCSTART- X

version O
of O
that O
unique O

Given B-SENT
that O
when O
confronted O
with O
a O

unfamiliar O
to O
him O
, O
Bobby O
always O
prepares O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

straightforward O
version O
, O
Bobby O

earnest O
dish O
will O
usually O
win O
out O
over O
the O

of O
WHUT O
put O
out O
by O
the O
challenger O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Do B-SENT
n’t O
take O
my O
word O
for O
it O
, O
just O
watch O
the O
show O
. O

Usually B-SENT
when O
the O
challenger O
announces O
their O
dish O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
think O
to O
yourself O
, O
“ O
oh O
Bobby O
’s O
screwed O
on O
this O
one O
, O
” O
but O
then O
immediately O
they O
cut O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
interview O
where O
a O
smiling O
, O
imbecilic O
contender O
says O
, O
“ O
My O
version O
of O

[ O
some O

-DOCSTART- X

ingredient O
or O
technique O
that O
does O

” O

And B-SENT
then O
they O
are O
oh-so-surprised O
at O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
the O

when O
their O
inane O
concoction O
gets O
clobbered O
by O
Mr. O

BTW B-SENT
if O
you O
’re O
still O
doubtful O
, O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

producers O
HAVE O
to O
know O
the O
secret O

against O

more O

because O

in O

who O

-DOCSTART- X

know O
how O
it O

supposed O
to O
be O
cooked O
( O
and O
also O
importantly O
, O
know O
that O
it O

not O
supposed O
to O
be O

-DOCSTART- X

cooked O
in O
whatever O
godforsaken O
manner O
than O
the O

plans O
) O
. O

One B-SENT
final O
thing O
: O

Though B-SENT
I O
’m O
inclined O
to O
believe O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
Bobby O
does O
n’t O
actually O
know O
what O
the O
signature O
dish O
will O
be O
( O
even O
though O
the O
producers O
do O
) O
, O
I O

-DOCSTART- X

would O
n’t O
be O
too O
terribly O
surprised O
if O
one O
of O
his O
assistants O
or O
sous-chefs O
has O
been O
told O
the O
dish O
and O
has O
“ O

-DOCSTART- X

seeded O
” O
Bobby O
’s O
pantry O
with O
ideas O
. O

I B-SENT
’m O
sure O
it O
’s O
always O
well-stocked O
, O
but O
c’m O
on O
... O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

ca O
n’t O
hold O
more O
than O
a O
fraction O
of O
what O
’s O
in O
the O
supermarket O
. O

So B-SENT
when O
Bobby O
looks O
and O
sees O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

bottle O
of O
, O
say O
, O
pomegranate O
molasses O
that O
’s O
not O
normally O
there O
, O
that O
’s O
his O
clue O
. O

“ B-SENT
Oh O
yeah O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
a O
gastrique O
would O
work O
really O
well O
here O
. O
” O

This B-SENT
might O
seem O
a O
bit O
shady O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n’t O

-DOCSTART- X

conflict O
directly O
with O
anything O
the O
show O
tells O
you O
about O
how O
it O
works O
. O

And B-SENT
that O
, O
my O
friends O
, O
is O
“ O

-DOCSTART- X

reality O
” O
TV O
. O

The B-SENT
producers O
most O
definitely O
know O
. O

How B-SENT
else O
do O
they O
always O
find O
judges O
that O
are O
experts O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
type O
of O
cuisine O
to O
judge O
the O
competition O
? O

While B-SENT
I O
do O
think O
Bobby O
Flay O
is O
actually O
that O
good O
( O
regardless O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
how O
cocky O
he O
can O
appear O
) O
, O
I O
do O
agree O
with O
you O
that O
the O
competitor O
tends O
to O
be O
their O
own O

-DOCSTART- X

worst O
enemy O
. O

I B-SENT
feel O
like O
they O
always O
go O
overboard O
with O
their O
dish O
to O
try O
and O
wow O
the O
judges O
that O
they O

-DOCSTART- X

forget O
they O
simply O
just O
need O
to O
beat O
Bobby O
’s O
dish O
. O

Bobby B-SENT
takes O
the O
dish O
and O
just O
makes O
sure O
all O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

flavors O
and O
textures O
are O
there O
while O
the O
competitor O
tries O
to O
make O
the O
dish O
more O
unique O
and O
their O
own O
. O

It B-SENT
rarely O

-DOCSTART- X

works O
. O

I B-SENT
've O
always O
thought O
of O
Bobby O
Flay O
as O
an O
arrogant O
douche O
, O
but O
the O
tiramisu O
episode O
of O
BBF O
confirmed O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
he O
is O
a O
douche O
. O

In B-SENT
the O
middle O
of O
the O
tiramisu O
challenge O
, O
he O
decided O
to O
make O
4 O
cheeseburgers O
from O

-DOCSTART- X

scratch O
just O
for O
fun O
to O
eat O
during O
. O

Fuck B-SENT
that O
. O

That B-SENT
was O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
the O
challenger O
pastry O
chef O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


so B-SENT
happy O
Amanda O
won O
though O
! O

love B-SENT
when O
I O
see O
people O
/ O
places O
from O
Austin O
on O
FN O
:) O

From B-SENT
binge O
watching O

-DOCSTART- X

this O
show O
the O
past O
week O
, O
it O
’s O
clear O
that O
Bobby O
has O
advance O
knowledge O
of O
what O
he O
might O
face O
. O

Recall B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

that O
Iron O
Chef O
also O
was O
n’t O
a O
total O
surprise O
as O
to O
the O
featured O
ingredient O
. O

PS B-SENT
- O
Good O
analysis O
from O
OP O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Bobby B-SENT
has O
never O
made O
anything O
that O
the O
competition O
challenges O
him O
too O
. O

He B-SENT
just O
makes O
a O
completely O
different O
dish O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

calls O
it O
a O
Southwest O
version O
of O
whatever O
he O
was O
supposed O
to O
make O
. O

bobby B-SENT
flay O
is O
an O
iron O
chef O
for O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

reason O
. O

he B-SENT
is O
going O
up O
against O
mostly O
home O
cooks O
or O
restaurant O
chefs O
. O

while B-SENT
i O
do O
agree O
that O
they O
do O

-DOCSTART- X

selective O
casting O
, O
which O
all O
shows O
do O
anyways O
for O
entertainment O
purposes O
, O
i O
do O
believe O
that O
he O
is O
that O
good O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


The B-SENT
producers O
know O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
're O
actively O
try O
and O
push O
the O
scales O
against O
Bobby O
. O

They B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

want O
the O
competetors O
to O
cook O
their O
own O
signature O
dish O
because O
that O
's O
interesting O
- O
it O
's O
the O
premise O
of O
the O
show O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

The B-SENT
best O
that O
some O
" O
average O
" O
chef O
has O
to O
offer O
vs O
some O
side O
dish O
produced O
by O
a O
master O
chef O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

When B-SENT
you O
're O
a O
celebrity O
chef O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
really O
have O
a O
single O
singular O
dish O
. O

You B-SENT
can O
cook O

-DOCSTART- X

everything O
, O
and O
maybe O
specialize O
in O
a O
few O
fields O
. O

So B-SENT
when O
master O
chefs O
go O
against O
Bobby O
, O
they O
can O
just O

-DOCSTART- X

whip O
out O
something O
they O
know O
they O
're O
probably O
better O
than O
him O
at O
. O

a O

-DOCSTART- X

reminded O
me O
of O
this O
, O
and O
thought O
you O

might O
get O

I B-SENT

and O
a O

of O

back O

-DOCSTART- X

an O
emergency O
call O

The B-SENT
owner O
of O
one O
of O
the O
businesses O
I O
support O
had O
purchased O
a O
new O
phone O
and O
needed O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

know O
how O
to O
transfer O
important O
data O
to O
it O
from O
her O
old O
phone O
. O

I B-SENT
order O
a O
taxi O
, O
grab O
my O
laptop O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
head O
out O
. O

It B-SENT
turned O
out O
the O
" O
important O

" O
was O
her O
Candy O
Crush O

, O
but O
she O
did O

-DOCSTART- X

n't O
let O
me O
know O
this O
until O
I O
arrived O
. O

I B-SENT
tried O
to O
make O
light O
of O
it O
- O
I O
was O
n't O
particularly O

-DOCSTART- X

amused O
at O
having O
my O
evening O
interrupted O
for O
this O
- O
and O
deadly O
serious O
, O
she O
snapped O
back O
that O
it O
was O
important O
because O

-DOCSTART- X

she O
was O
trying O
to O
give O
up O
smoking O
and O
she O
needed O
it O
to O
relax O
during O
work O
breaks O
. O

I B-SENT
looked O
up O
how O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
do O
it O
( O
via O
Facebook O
account O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
; O
she O
had O
never O
logged O
in O
on O
the O
old O
phone O

-DOCSTART- X

) O
, O
transferred O
the O
data O
over O
and O
charged O
her O
double O
time O
for O
the O
post-5pm O
call O
out O
. O

If B-SENT
they O
're O
paying O

-DOCSTART- X

emergency O
rates O
, O
I O
'd O
take O
a O
trivial O
job O
as O
a O
freebie O
compared O
to O
the O
usual O

. O

Those B-SENT
tend O
to O

come O

-DOCSTART- X

Yeah B-SENT
, O
the O
rates O
stopped O
me O
from O
being O
pissed O
off O
with O
her O
. O

Also B-SENT
grabbed O
a O
takeaway O
( O

for O

-DOCSTART- X

our O
American O

on O
the O

Gave B-SENT

I O

got O

You B-SENT
mean O

-DOCSTART- X

exactly O
as O
much O
as O
you O
charge O

Our B-SENT

raised O
our O

recently O
by O
30 O
% O
and O
lost O
3 O
- O
7 O

-DOCSTART- X

% O
of O
our O

we O
were O
" O
too O
expensive O

. O

We B-SENT
're O
now O
charging O
hourly O
for O
the O
miscellaneous O
things O

-DOCSTART- X

clients O
brought O
to O
us O
vs O
per O
project O
completed O
and O
the O
tiny O
little O
shitty O
projects O
we O
're O
doiong O
now O
has O
decreased O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Yep B-SENT
, O
it O
's O
far O
wiser O
to O
be O
slightly O
over O
market O
rates O
when O
contracting O
. O

You B-SENT
do O
n't O
want O
the O
people O

-DOCSTART- X

barely O
willing O
to O
pay O
market O
rates O
as O
customers O
, O
they O
are O
often O
unreasonably O
demanding O
and O
see O
normal O
rates O
as O
crazy O
high O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

The B-SENT
people O
who O
wo O
n't O
mind O
paying O
a O
little O
more O
can O
usually O
afford O
it O
fine O
, O
do O
n't O
fret O
over O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
, O
and O
tend O
to O
treat O
you O
better O
. O

It B-SENT
's O
slightly O
uncomfortable O
to O
have O
conversations O
about O
new O
prices O
, O
but O

-DOCSTART- X

if O
you O
want O
to O
work O
less O
for O
more O
and O
be O
treated O
a O
little O
better O
- O
it O
's O
worth O

Woah B-SENT

I O

bored O

sharing O
the O

Though B-SENT
I O

shit O
I O
saw O
was O
a O
tired O

8 O
year O
old O
geek O
of O
a O
son O
in O
to O
have O
some O
fun O
. O

The B-SENT
parents O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
more O
discouraging O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
him O
. O

He B-SENT
was O
excitedly O
bouncing O
around O
the O
room O
pointing O
out O
things O
that O
he O
thought O
were O
clues O
clues O
while O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

parents O
dismissed O
every O
idea O
he O
had O
and O
told O
him O
to O
stop O
getting O
so O
excited O
. O

The B-SENT
parents O
took O
charge O
and O
proceeded O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
ignore O
the O
obvious O
clues O
he O
was O
pointing O
out O
and O
spent O
most O
of O
the O
time O
pursuing O
dead O

Sad B-SENT
part O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
his O
instincts O
were O
more O
often O
than O
not O
correct O
but O
his O
parents O
just O
did O
n't O
listen O
and O
refused O
to O
let O
him O

-DOCSTART- X

explore O
and O
try O
stuff O
out O
. O

Hopefully B-SENT
his O
curiosity O
and O
enthusiasm O
survives O
them O

I B-SENT
feel O
like O
if O
it O
were O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

my O
power O
in O
any O
way O
, O
that O
kid O
would O
have O
led O
his O

right O
through O
the O

If B-SENT
I O

-DOCSTART- X

were O
the O

every O

-DOCSTART- X

clue O
the O
kid O
noticed O

made O
sure O
the O
parents O
knew O
the O
kid O
was O
right O

They B-SENT
probably O
wo O

and O
he O

-DOCSTART- X

will O
develop O
chronic O

Me B-SENT
irl O

That B-SENT
would O
seem O

what O

That B-SENT

This B-SENT

the O

the O

My B-SENT
parents O
always O
did O
that O

that O

I O

you O

or O
take O
their O

That B-SENT
s O

infuriating O
because O
the O

OH B-SENT

two O

there O

I B-SENT

Says B-SENT
he O

he O

not O

I B-SENT
hand O

to O

Over B-SENT

we O

this O

is O
constantly O

The B-SENT
big O
day O
rolls O
around O

he O

-DOCSTART- X

arrives O

this O

Everybody B-SENT
in O
the O

talking O

him O

he O

we O

So B-SENT
he O

-DOCSTART- X

the O

they O
get O

we O

that O
they O

eventually O

Everybody B-SENT
crowds O

this O

Ron O

AND B-SENT
I O

DEAD O

-DOCSTART- X

CMV B-SENT
: O
We O
should O
keep O
assuming O
others O
’ O
gender O
and O
pronouns O
, O
but O
be O
respectful O
if O
corrected O

Democratic B-SENT
society O
operates O
according O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
“ O
majority O
rule O
, O
minority O

” O

We B-SENT
should O
strive O
for O
equality O
, O
but O
also O
practicality O
. O

Thus B-SENT
, O

-DOCSTART- X

our O
current O
gender O
system O
should O
only O
be O
tweaked O
, O
not O
radically O
changed O
. O

Societal B-SENT
norms O
are O
set O
by O
the O
majority O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Since B-SENT
most O
people O
are O
cisgender O
( O
and O
heterosexual O
) O
, O
norms O
reflect O
that O
. O

This B-SENT
is O
n’t O
inherently O
an O
issue O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


It B-SENT
’s O
only O
when O
we O
do O
n’t O
tolerate O
deviation O
from O
norms O
that O
it O
becomes O
a O
problem O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
neither O
necessary O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
possible O
, O
nor O
desirable O
to O
erase O
all O
gender O
norms O
, O
since O
they O
are O
willingly O
followed O
by O
most O
. O

The B-SENT
vast O

-DOCSTART- X

majority O
of O
people O
, O
cis O
or O
trans O
, O
identify O
as O
male O
or O
female O
, O
and O
have O
an O
appearance O
that O
matches O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


This B-SENT
makes O
our O
binary O
gender O
assumption O
norms O
useful O
. O

Most B-SENT
people O
want O
their O
gender O
assumed O
off O
appearance O
or O
else O
do O
n’t O

-DOCSTART- X

care O
; O
it O
’s O
only O
a O
very O
few O
whose O
appearance O
does O
n’t O
match O
gender O
, O
or O
identify O
as O
a O
non-binary O
gender O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Society B-SENT
already O
accommodates O
situations O
like O
this O
. O

We B-SENT
provide O
wheelchair O
ramps O
, O
nut-free O
foods O
, O
and O
gender O
neutral O
bathrooms O
on O

-DOCSTART- X

top O
of O
the O
stairs O
, O
PB&J O
, O
and O
gendered O
bathrooms O
that O
most O
people O
use O
. O

You B-SENT
might O
have O
to O
ask O
someone O

-DOCSTART- X

or O
travel O
a O
bit O
more O
to O
be O
accommodated O
, O
but O
society O
has O
deemed O
this O
small O
extra O
effort O
acceptable O
, O
because O
very O

-DOCSTART- X

few O
people O
need O
to O
be O
accommodated O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
thus O
reasonable O
to O
expect O
the O
individual O
to O
request O
certain O
pronouns O
if O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

’s O
important O
to O
them O
. O

Society B-SENT
recognizes O
disabilities O
, O
allergies O
, O
and O
even O
hard O
to O
pronounce O
names O
as O
legitimate O
. O

The B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

root O
issue O
is O
that O
non-conforming O
genders O
are O
n’t O
always O
recognized O
as O
legitimate O
, O
and O
harassment O
of O
the O
group O
occurs O
. O

No B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

one O
says O
to O
a O
person O
who O
says O
they O
have O
an O
allergy O
“ O
Really O
? O
You O
do O
n’t O
look O
like O
you O
have O

-DOCSTART- X

an O
allergy O
? O
” O

We B-SENT
all O
need O
to O
be O
educated O
and O
tolerant O
towards O
other O
pronouns O
and O
genders O
, O
and O
not O
tolerate O

-DOCSTART- X

harassment O
of O
this O
group O
. O

Basically B-SENT
, O
recognize O
your O
assumptions O
are O
n’t O
always O
correct O
, O
and O
be O
gracious O
if O
you O
’re O

-DOCSTART- X

wrong O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
and O
effort O
to O
make O
everyone O
ask O
or O
introduce O
pronouns O
or O
gender O
, O
because O

-DOCSTART- X

most O
people O
do O
n’t O
care O
. O

You B-SENT
should O
feel O
free O
to O
do O
this O
if O
you O
want O
to O
, O
but O
otherwise O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
have O
to O
live O
with O
reasonable O
assumptions O
. O

This B-SENT
solution O
is O
much O
more O
practical O
, O
and O
much O
more O
likely O
to O
be O

-DOCSTART- X

implemented O
and O
accepted O
by O
everyone O
. O

In B-SENT
essence O
, O
make O
an O
assumption O
, O
if O
you O
find O
out O
otherwise O
, O
go O
with O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
. O

This B-SENT
is O
n’t O
difficult O
or O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

As B-SENT
far O
as O
ethics O
and O
economics O
are O
concerned O
, O
this O

-DOCSTART- X

solution O
is O
the O
best O
one O
. O

CMV B-SENT
, O
I O
’d O
be O
glad O
to O
discuss O
parts O
of O
the O
solution O
you O
take O
issue O

-DOCSTART- X

with O
in O
more O
detail O

I B-SENT
generally O
agree O
with O
this O
, O
but O
it O
is O
context O
sensitive O
. O

If B-SENT
you O
are O
at O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

venue O
where O
you O
are O
asked O
to O
introduce O
yourself O
and O
your O
pronouns O
, O
it O
is O
churlish O
to O
refuse O
to O
do O
so O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

AND O
in O
that O
context O
it O
’s O
best O
to O
ask O
rather O
that O
assume O
. O

Since B-SENT
that O
kind O
of O
venue O
is O
fairly O
rare O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
it O
is O
not O
an O
unusual O
burden O
to O
‘ O
go O
with O
the O
flow O
’ O
. O

I B-SENT
organize O
events O
professionally O
, O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

have O
never O
included O
as O
part O
of O
introductions O
. O

The B-SENT
number O
of O
people O
who O
are O
uncomfortable O
with O
the O
practice O
exceeds O
the O
number O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
people O
who O
prefer O
asking O
. O

In B-SENT
issues O
of O
human O
decency O
‘ O
majority O
rules O
’ O
is O
not O
the O
rule O
of O
thumb O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

But B-SENT
I O
do O
think O
asking O
for O
pronouns O
/ O
not O
assuming O
gender O
will O
remain O
a O
fairly O
fringe O
activity O
that O
you O
find O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
a O
few O
colleges O
, O
churches O
, O
support O
groups O
and O
therapy O
contexts O
and O
not O
much O
outside O
of O
that O
. O

I B-SENT
would O

-DOCSTART- X

agree O
wholeheartedly O
that O
in O
certain O
contexts O
, O
this O
makes O
sense O
. O

I B-SENT
think O
the O
key O
is O
that O
you O
’d O
be O
informed O

-DOCSTART- X

about O
it O
, O
like O
if O
you O
’re O
going O
to O
an O
LBGT O
or O
transgender O
event O
, O
obviously O
you O
might O
want O
to O
be O

-DOCSTART- X

more O
careful O
. O

If B-SENT
everyone O
is O
expected O
to O
introduce O
their O
pronouns O
in O
the O
venue O
, O
then O
you O
may O
as O
well O
follow O

-DOCSTART- X

suit O
. O

As B-SENT
I O
’ve O
said O
, O
though O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
think O
it O
would O
be O
best O
to O
apply O
this O
idea O

-DOCSTART- X

society-wide O
though O
. O

Exactly B-SENT
. O

There B-SENT
’s O
a O
time O
and O
a O
place O
for O
everything O
and O
a O
majority O
of O
people O
use O
pronouns O

-DOCSTART- X

based O
on O
their O
assigned O
gender O
. O

Gender B-SENT
dysphoria O
is O
not O
a O

thing O
but O
knowing O
when O
you O
will O
encounter O
a O
higher O

-DOCSTART- X

concentration O
of O

should O
be O

a O

I B-SENT

where O

you O
’re O

The B-SENT
only O

reason O

it O

Your B-SENT
Sammy O

because O
there O
are O
so O
many O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

them O

everyone O

it O

Now B-SENT
imagine O
if O

That B-SENT

You B-SENT
ca O
n't O

-DOCSTART- X

keep O
printing O

else O
the O

will O
deteriorate O

But B-SENT
the O
gov't O
keeps O
issuing O

-DOCSTART- X

we O
still O
look O

$ O

it O

right O

Eventually B-SENT

there O
could O

a O
time O

-DOCSTART- X

when O
we O
look O

This B-SENT

what O
happened O

Zimbabwe O

-DOCSTART- X

where O
a O
billion O

transaction O
might O
happen O

a O
loaf O

They B-SENT
printed O
so O
much O

( O

proper O

-DOCSTART- X

secure O

that O
it O
just O
became O

So B-SENT
they O
started O
to O
just O
increase O
the O
numbers O
on O

-DOCSTART- X

their O
currency O
so O
you O
can O
actually O
pay O
for O
something O

the O
gov't O
theoretically O
owes O
its O
population O
money O
, O
they O
issue O

-DOCSTART- X

paper O
as O
a O
certificate O
of O
this O
. O

You B-SENT
might O
not O
have O
physically O
went O
to O
the O
bank O

traded O
something O
in O
return O

-DOCSTART- X

for O
paper O
but O
you O
did O
something O
that O
warranted O
the O
earning O

that O

. O

If B-SENT
you O
work O
for O
a O
company O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

they O
pay O
you O
that O
money O
because O
it O
has O
value O
and O
you O
can O
buy O
things O
with O
it O
. O

The B-SENT
only O
reason O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

has O
value O
is O
because O
the O
US O
gov't O
says O
it O
does O
. O

You B-SENT
can O
pay O
gov't-related O
fees O
and O
bills O
with O
the O
money O

-DOCSTART- X

they O
issue O
and O
because O
the O
gov't O
is O
well-secured O
, O
people O
accept O
it O
. O

If B-SENT
our O
gov't O
was O
unstable O
, O
no O
one O

-DOCSTART- X

would O
trust O
the O
dollars O
they O
slept O
under O

warmth O
because O
the O
gov't O
could O
just O
come O
out O

say O
, O
' O
Sorry O

-DOCSTART- X

we O
're O
not O
paying O
you O

back O
' O
. O

Well B-SENT
what O
would O
they O
be O
paying O
back O
? O

To B-SENT
whom O
are O
they O

-DOCSTART- X

paying O
back O

It B-SENT
used O
to O
be O
gold O

But B-SENT
as O
we O
grew O
as O
a O
planet O
, O
we O
ran O
out O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
gold O
to O
back O
every O
dollar O
with O
and O
it O
just O
became O
a O
nightmare O
to O
handle O
. O

Enter B-SENT
, O
fiat O
currency O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
piece O
of O
paper O
that O
means O
nothing O
except O
what O
the O
gov't O
says O
it O
means O
. O

People B-SENT
used O
to O
go O
to O
banks O

-DOCSTART- X

with O
gold O
and O
receive O
' O
money O
' O
for O
it O
. O

The B-SENT
banks O
would O
literally O
hold O
their O
gold O
and O
give O
them O
an O

-DOCSTART- X

certificate O
that O
says O
they O
own O
a O
claim O
of O
gold O
in O
their O
vaults O
. O

If B-SENT
ANYONE O
brought O
that O
certificate O
to O
the O
bank O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
they O
could O
expect O
to O
receive O
gold O
for O
it O
. O

That B-SENT
's O
what O
gave O
it O
value O
. O

You B-SENT
could O
say O
you O

-DOCSTART- X

want O
that O
farmer O
's O
potatoes O
and O
he O
can O
go O
get O
$ O
1 O
of O
gold O
from O
the O
bankers O
at O
his O
convenience O
or O

-DOCSTART- X

he O
could O
hold O
onto O
it O
and O
use O
it O
just O
like O
the O
person O
did O
before O
him O
-- O
' O
trade O
' O
it O
for O

-DOCSTART- X

something O
else O
like O
new O
shoes O
. O

Why B-SENT
? O

Because B-SENT
everyone O
liked O
gold O
and O
everyone O
believed O
gold O
had O
value O
. O

Eventually B-SENT
, O

-DOCSTART- X

this O
took O
off O
and O
people O
stopped O
trading O
for O
things O
and O
we O
developed O
currency O
with O
quantitative O
values O
that O
allowed O
for O
easy O
exchanges O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
take O
place O
. O

So B-SENT
you O
might O
think O
, O
' O
Well O
, O
now O
that O
there O
is O
n't O

behind O

-DOCSTART- X

how O

statements O

a. B-SENT
He O
refers O
to O
digging O
a O
tunnel O
under O
the O
city O

b. B-SENT
Using O
these O
to O
release O
Boo O

-DOCSTART- X

into O
" O
The O
Wild O
" O

c. B-SENT
And O
he O
has O
previously O
discarded O
ideas O
involving O
an O
enormous O
slingshot O
and O
a O
gigantic O
wooden O
horse O

-DOCSTART- X


Why B-SENT
would O
tunnels O
be O
necessary O
? O

Why B-SENT
all O
the O
planning O
in O
the O
first O
place O
? O

Why B-SENT
not O
just O
stuff O
Boo O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
trunk O
of O
his O
car O
, O
drive O
her O
out O
of O
city O
limits O
, O
and O
set O
her O
loose O
? O

Because B-SENT
he O
ca O

-DOCSTART- X

n't O
. O

And B-SENT
what O
are O
all O
these O
things O
good O
at O
doing O
? O

Getting B-SENT
past O

. O

And B-SENT
walls O
, O
especially O
ones O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
ca O
n't O
get O

usually O
there O
for O
a O
reason O
. O

But B-SENT
what O
reason O
? O

We B-SENT
've O
seen O
gigantic O

-DOCSTART- X

monsters O
in O
both O
movies O
, O
so O
the O
most O
likely O
reason O
seems O
to O
be O
that O
there O
are O
things O
out O
there O
that O
put O

-DOCSTART- X

even O
these O
kaiju O
to O
shame O
, O
or O
else O
they O
could O
simply O
march O
outside O
and O
kill O
whatever O
is O
threatening O
Monster O
civilization O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


But B-SENT
even O
this O
presents O
a O
problem O
, O
because O
then O
the O
Monsters O
could O
still O
periodically O
leave O
the O
city O
like O
Attack O
on O
Titan O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Yet B-SENT
Mike O
's O
apparent O
refusal O
to O
consider O
going O
through O
any O
possible O
gates O
aside O
from O
an O
ridiculously O
overkill O
idea O
suggests O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

if O
any O
gates O
do O
exist O
, O
they O
are O
tightly O
sealed O
against O
all O
but O
the O
most O
extreme O
of O
circumstances O
. O

Why B-SENT
would O

-DOCSTART- X

they O
be O
sealed O
if O
the O
Monsters O
could O
leave O
? O

The B-SENT
simplest O
explanation O
for O
this O
is O
that O
the O
very O
environment O
is O
hostile O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
the O
Monsters O
. O

What B-SENT
kind O
of O
environment O
could O
" O
The O
Wild O
" O
be O
? O

A B-SENT
never-ending O
wasteland O
like O
the O
Glowing O

-DOCSTART- X

Sea O
? O

A B-SENT
land O
that O
has O
already O
mutated O
some O

into O
Lovecraftian O
horrors O
that O
stalk O
the O
land O
looking O
for O
lesser O
life O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
consume O
? O

Could B-SENT
this O
land O
be O
related O
to O
some O
event O
that O
caused O
Monster O
civilization O
to O
reject O
other O
forms O
of O
energy O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
favor O
of O
relatively O
safe O
, O
non-volatile O
scream O
energy O
? O

What B-SENT
if O
the O
world O
surrounding O
Monstropolis O
is O
the O
human O
world O
? O

-DOCSTART- X


The B-SENT
only O
thing O
the O
monsters O
seem O
to O
be O
scared O
of O
is O
a O
human O
child O
, O
believing O
them O
to O
be O
toxic O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

deadly O
. O

Maybe B-SENT
they O
found O
a O
way O
to O
keep O
their O
city O
hidden O
from O
humans O
since O
they O
are O
scared O
of O
us O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
door O
system O
is O
n't O
actually O
taking O
them O
to O
another O
dimension O
but O
somewhere O
else O
on O
the O
same O
planet O
... O

That B-SENT
makes O

-DOCSTART- X

more O
sense O
, O
why O
would O
monsters O
be O
afraid O
of O
monsters O
? O

They B-SENT
would O
n't O
... O
IF O
whatever O
was O
outside O
was O
like O

-DOCSTART- X

them O
. O

Which B-SENT
raises O
the O
question O
: O
what O
do O
monsters O
consider O
monsters O
? O

Humans B-SENT

It B-SENT
seems O
unlikely O
, O
since O
if O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

were O
the O
case O
, O
they O
could O
simply O
talk O
to O
the O
humans O
who O
could O
then O
work O
with O
them O
to O
provide O
any O
number O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
energy O
solutions O
that O
do O
n't O
involve O
screams O
. O

Plus B-SENT
, O
despite O
the O
tech O
we O
've O
seen O

use O
, O
we O

-DOCSTART- X

've O
never O
seen O
them O
use O
any O
cloaking O
tech O
( O
something O
that O
would O
no O
doubt O
come O
in O
useful O
for O
scarers O
) O
for O

-DOCSTART- X

something O
even O
monster-sized O
, O
let O
alone O
something O
that O
could O
hide O
an O
entire O
city O

And B-SENT
do O
n't O
forget O
that O
they O
talk O
about O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
two O
worlds O
as O
if O
they O
actually O
ARE O
two O
different O
worlds O
. O

If B-SENT
they O
were O
on O
the O
same O

, O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

would O
make O
much O
more O
sense O
to O
talk O
about O
borders O
and O
being O
outside O
the O
boundaries O

that O

I B-SENT
read O

stated O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

pandas O
being O
notoriously O
poor O

is O
a O
myth O
. O

It B-SENT
's O
just O
that O
getting O
any O
species O
in O
captivity O
to O
reproduce O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
a O
challenge O
, O
so O
that O
's O
why O
getting O
pandas O
in O
captivity O
to O

is O
a O
challenge O
too O
. O

And B-SENT
in O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
wild O
they O
would O
reproduce O
just O
fine O
, O
the O
largest O
threat O
to O
their O
reproduction O
is O
the O
narrowing O
of O
their O
ecosystems O
by O

-DOCSTART- X

humans O
, O
not O
their O
poor O

It B-SENT

Polygraph B-SENT

other O
deception O

First B-SENT
, O
this O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
not O
me O
telling O
you O
how O
to O
beat O
polygraph O
( O
poly O
. O
) O

When B-SENT
taking O
the O
test O
, O
it O
is O
common O

-DOCSTART- X

for O
the O
examiner O
to O
ask O
if O
you O
have O
researched O
how O
to O
pass O
the O
poly O
deceptively O
. O

So B-SENT
, O
if O
you O
read O

-DOCSTART- X

this O
, O
understand O
that O
I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
to O
beat O
the O
test O
. O

It B-SENT
is O
also O
worth O

-DOCSTART- X

mentioning O
that O
doing O
something O
like O
that O
is O
, O
generally O
, O
a O
bad O
idea O
. O

Second B-SENT
, O
let O
’s O
just O
get O
something O

-DOCSTART- X

out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

A B-SENT
polygraph O
is O
not O
admissible O
in O
criminal O
court O
, O
and O
for O
good O
reason O
. O

It B-SENT
is O

-DOCSTART- X

not O
going O
to O
give O
us O
specific O
information O
. O

There B-SENT
have O
been O
people O
who O
have O
lied O
and O
not O
shown O
deception O
. O

There B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

are O
some O
people O
who O
showed O
deception O
, O
who O
were O
not O
necessarily O
lying O
. O

Having B-SENT
said O
that O
, O
it O
is O
still O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

great O
tool O
for O
verifying O
truthfulness O
, O
and O
I O
’m O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
using O
it O
in O
this O
kind O
of O
a O
process O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

Hopefully B-SENT
I O
can O
explain O
to O
you O
why O
that O
happens O
here O
. O

All B-SENT
of O
these O
Deception O
Detection O
Devices O
( O
DDD O
) O

-DOCSTART- X

work O
on O
a O
basic O
principal O
. O

Your B-SENT
body O
has O
involuntary O
and O
automatic O
responses O
to O
lying O
. O

Basically B-SENT
, O
you O
are O
afraid O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
getting O
caught O
. O

No B-SENT
matter O
how O
little O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
bit O
of O
everyone O
that O
hopes O
we O
do O
n’t O

-DOCSTART- X

get O
caught O
. O

The B-SENT
fact O
that O
you O
’re O
hooked O
up O
to O
the O
machine O
really O
tends O
to O
amplify O
this O
. O

These B-SENT
machines O

-DOCSTART- X

are O
actually O
fear O
detectors O
. O

They B-SENT
measure O
your O
body O
’s O
reaction O
to O
fear O
, O
like O
your O
heart O
rate O
increasing O
or O
changing O

-DOCSTART- X

just O
to O
name O
one O
. O

So B-SENT
how O
does O
a O
truthful O
person O
show O
deception O
? O

Let B-SENT
me O
show O
you O
. O

20 B-SENT
years O

-DOCSTART- X

ago O
, O
an O
applicant O
… O
let O
’s O
call O
him O
Joe O
… O
was O
out O
with O
friends O
at O
a O
bar O
. O

While B-SENT
there O

-DOCSTART- X

he O
was O
approached O
by O
a O
prostitute O
who O
offered O
him O
her O
services O
. O

Joe B-SENT
, O
being O
the O
fine O
and O
upstanding O
individual O
he O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
, O
turned O
her O
down O
. O

On B-SENT
his O
background O
paperwork O
he O
indicated O
that O
he O
had O
never O
paid O
anyone O
for O
sex O
and O

-DOCSTART- X

he O
has O
never O
sought O
to O
pay O
anyone O
for O
sex O
… O

both B-SENT
are O
true O
. O

However B-SENT
, O
Joe O
has O
a O
flash O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
thought O
from O
that O
night O
when O
the O
examiner O
asks O
him O
if O
he O
has O
paid O
for O
sex O
. O

His B-SENT
body O
, O
automatically O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
is O
afraid O
that O
he O
should O
have O
said O
something O
. O

The B-SENT
machine O
will O
pick O
that O
reaction O
up O
. O

The B-SENT
reason O
this O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
n't O
scientific O
is O
because O
just O
because O
it O
shows O
deception O
on O
a O
particular O
subject O
, O
does O
n't O
mean O
you O
’re O
lying O

-DOCSTART- X

… O

it B-SENT
means O
that O
there O
is O
usually O
more O
to O
that O
story O
. O

To B-SENT
combat O
this O
, O
before O
you O
take O
the O
poly O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
will O
talk O
with O
the O
examiner O
and O
go O
over O
every O
question O
that O
is O
on O
the O
exam O
. O

That B-SENT
way O
you O
can O

-DOCSTART- X

address O
any O
gray O
areas O
. O

You B-SENT
may O
have O
answered O
a O
question O
in O
your O
background O
with O
a O
“ O
no O
” O
answer O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

but O
there O
is O
a O
“ O
comma O
, O
but O
” O
to O
it O
though O
… O
if O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
. O

Make B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

sure O
that O
you O
address O
any O
of O
these O
areas O
with O
the O
background O
investigator O
and O
with O
the O
polygraph O
examiner O
before O
taking O
the O
test O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

That B-SENT
way O
, O
you O
’ll O
feel O
that O
it O
’s O
been O
addressed O
and O
it O
is O
much O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

non-issue O
. O

Third B-SENT
, O
please O
know O
that O
common O
sense O
is O
still O
very O
much O
on O
the O
table O
. O

Have B-SENT
you O
seen O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

scene O
from O
Ocean O
’s O
Eleven O
where O
the O
“ O
smart O
guy O
” O
is O
undergoing O
a O
polygraph O
so O
he O
can O
get O
the O
casino O

-DOCSTART- X

job O
? O

They B-SENT
put O
a O
thumb O
tack O
in O
his O
shoe O
so O
that O
when O
he O
could O
poke O
his O
foot O
on O
the O
truthful O

-DOCSTART- X

answers O
and O
not O
on O
the O
lies O
. O

That B-SENT
way O
he O
was O
consistent O
through O
the O
exam O
. O

He B-SENT
was O
always O
stressed O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


The B-SENT
examiner O
even O
makes O
the O
comment O
that O
“ O
man O
to O
look O
at O
him O
, O
I O
would O
swear O
he O
’s O
being O
deceptive O

-DOCSTART- X

. O
” O

Well B-SENT
, O
first O
… O
the O
thumb O
tack O
trick O
does O
n't O
work O
… O

do B-SENT
n’t O
try O
it O
. O

You B-SENT
’ll O

-DOCSTART- X

end O
up O
with O
a O
hurt O
foot O
, O
and O
deception O
everywhere O
. O

Second B-SENT
, O
the O
human O
element O
will O
be O
sure O
to O
include O

-DOCSTART- X

any O
potential O
signs O
of O
deception O
. O

Again B-SENT
, O
it O
is O
generally O
a O
bad O
idea O
to O
try O
and O
determine O
how O
to O
beat O

-DOCSTART- X

this O
test O
. O

Do B-SENT
n’t O
do O
it O
, O
just O
be O
honest O
through O
the O
process O
. O

Each B-SENT
step O
is O
there O
for O
a O

-DOCSTART- X

reason O
. O

Finally B-SENT
, O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
you O
should O
know O
that O
everyone O
is O
intimidated O
by O
this O
step O
in O
the O
process O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

You B-SENT
do O
n’t O
need O
to O
worry O
about O
nervousness O
tripping O
the O
machine O
or O
giving O
you O
a O
false O
indication O
of O
deception O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


If B-SENT
it O
did O
that O
just O
because O
people O
were O
nervous O
, O
then O
no O
one O
would O
ever O
pass O
these O
tests O
. O

The B-SENT
poly O

-DOCSTART- X

tends O
to O
be O
the O
part O
of O
the O
process O
that O
everyone O
dreads O
… O
and O
that O
really O
should O
n't O
be O
the O
case O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


You B-SENT
have O
already O
answered O
every O
question O
during O
your O
background O
investigation O
that O
they O
are O
going O
to O
ask O
you O
on O
the O
polygraph O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Be B-SENT
honest O
and O
thorough O
during O
that O
portion O
of O
the O
process O
and O
you O
’ll O
be O
fine O
. O

I B-SENT
hope O
this O
has O
illuminated O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
polygraph O
a O
bit O
. O

It B-SENT
’s O
one O
of O
the O
more O
intimidating O
portions O
of O
the O
process O
, O
I O
understand O
this O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


It B-SENT
should O
be O
the O
easiest O
part O
though O
. O

You B-SENT
've O
already O
answered O
these O
questions O
, O
some O
of O
them O
several O
times O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


This B-SENT
should O
just O
be O
about O
verifying O
what O
we O
already O
know O
. O

Thank B-SENT
you O
for O
taking O
the O
time O
to O
read O
this O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

should O
you O
have O
any O
questions O
feel O
free O
to O
PM O
me O
. O

I B-SENT
’m O
also O
taking O
requests O
for O
the O
next O
edition O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

this O
series O
. O

I B-SENT
was O
leaning O
towards O
interviews O
, O
but O
that O
may O
require O
some O
separation O
as O
there O
are O
several O
formats O
you O

-DOCSTART- X

’ll O
see O
in O
this O
kind O
of O
a O
process O
. O

I B-SENT
've O
also O
seen O
questions O
about O
the O
psychological O
evals O
before O
too O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


-DOCSTART- X

How B-SENT
do O
you O
guys O
interpret O
the O
importance O
of O
racial O
issues O
seen O
in O
America O
? O

Hey B-SENT
, O
guys O
! O

As B-SENT
an O
American O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
we O
obviously O
learn O
about O
US O
history O
to O
a O
much O
greater O
extent O
than O
I O
imagine O
any O
of O
you O
guys O
would O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

school O
. O

Along B-SENT
with O
knowing O
our O
history O
, O
we O
also O
have O
grown O
up O
in O
the O
culture O
that O
’s O
resulted O
from O
nearly O

-DOCSTART- X

250 O
years O
of O
our O
country O
’s O
existence O
and O
from O
far O
more O
many O
years O
before O
our O
revolution O
. O

Naturally B-SENT
, O
we O
see O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
racial O
issues O
and O
tensions O
occurring O
today O
as O
a O
very O
logical O
conclusion O
, O
personal O
to O
each O
individual O
, O
and O
as O
intense O

-DOCSTART- X

in O
the O
realm O
of O
politics O
. O

So B-SENT
, O
my O
questions O
are O
: O

(1) B-SENT
How O
do O
different O
European O
countries O
feel O
/ O
interpret O

-DOCSTART- X

our O
seemingly O
, O
from O
an O
outsider O
’s O
point O
of O
view O
, O
obsession O
with O
race O
? O

Do B-SENT
many O
people O
not O
understand O
why O

-DOCSTART- X

? O

(2) B-SENT
Do O
many O
people O
from O
your O
country O
not O
know O
anything O
about O
our O
very O
important O
domestic O
historical O
events O
/ O
movements O
( O

-DOCSTART- X

e.g. O
our O
kind O
of O
slavery O
, O
the O
Civil O
War O
, O
the O
Reconstruction O
Era O
, O
the O
Golden O
Age O
of O
Racism O
in O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

1920s O

the O

and O

-DOCSTART- X

Matter O
+ O
criminal O

) O
? O

(3) B-SENT
What O
are O
your O
guys O
’ O
general O
thoughts O
when O
you O
hear O

-DOCSTART- X

about O
our O
outrage O
over O
a O
racial O
issue O
today O
? O

US B-SENT
society O
does O
seem O
quite O
obsessed O
with O
race O
, O
and O
while O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

very O
concept O
of O
dividing O
people O
into O
races O
is O
repulsive O
to O
me O
, O
I O
understand O
why O
this O
is O
a O
big O
deal O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
US O
- O
and O
I O
understand O
why O
European O
views O
on O
the O
issue O
are O
usually O
too O
simplistic O
. O

I B-SENT
'm O
pretty O
sure O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
most O
people O
here O
only O
have O
a O
very O
vague O
idea O
of O
US O
history O
in O
this O
regard O
. O

Slavery B-SENT
is O
widely O
known O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
so O
is O
the O
KKK O
( O
albeit O
superficially O
) O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
quite O
sure O
most O
people O
have O
no O
idea O
what O

-DOCSTART- X

Jim O
Crow O
laws O
are O
, O
or O
that O
official O
segregation O
continued O
into O
the O
1960s O
, O
and O
most O
other O
race-related O
history O
. O

It B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

definitely O
looks O
to O
me O
like O
American O
society O
as O
a O
whole O
is O
n't O
doing O
a O
good O
job O
of O
moving O
past O
these O
issues O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
and O
that O
the O
racial O
division O
is O
even O
encouraged O
at O
some O
level O
, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
as O
presumption O
as O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

preach O
solutions O
, O
having O
never O
lived O
in O
the O
US O
, O
let O
alone O
as O
a O
racial O
minority O
. O

I B-SENT
find O
it O
annoying O

-DOCSTART- X

when O
Americans O
try O
to O
apply O
US O
racial O
concepts O
to O
Europe O
, O
and O
thus O
make O
absurd O
statements O
, O
so O
it O
's O
only O

-DOCSTART- X

fair O
for O
me O
to O
admit O
my O
limited O
understanding O
of O
the O
subject O
, O
even O
if O
I O
consider O
myself O
to O
know O
US O
history O

-DOCSTART- X

better O
than O
90 O
% O
of O
Europeans O

" B-SENT

to O
the O

not O

-DOCSTART- X

on O
singing O

If B-SENT
you O
want O
a O
ring O

-DOCSTART- X

... O
I O
believe O
you O
have O
to O
use O
a O
strong O

dominant O

Try B-SENT
an O
EE O
vowel O
in O
the O
comfortable O
area O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
your O

Like B-SENT
right O

so B-SENT
instead O

If B-SENT

it O
'll O
just O
come O

-DOCSTART- X

I O
guess O
( O
if O
you O
have O

Wo B-SENT

happen O

you O

you O

-DOCSTART- X


Are B-SENT
you O
referring O
to O
the O
slight O
ping O
in O
certain O
people O
's O
voices O
that O
give O
it O
a O
clarity O

you O
talking O
about O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
slight O
' O
oomph O
' O
in O
certain O
people O
's O
voices O
? O

Either B-SENT
way O
, O
yeah O
i O
think O
it O
is O
a O
pretty O

-DOCSTART- X

decent O
sounding O
voice O
. O

You B-SENT
mentioned O
that O
your O
teacher O
is O
asking O
you O
to O
open O
the O
throat O
and O
i O
would O
like O
to O

-DOCSTART- X

know O
what O
he O
/ O
she O
said O
to O
instruct O
you O
to O
open O
the O
throat O
. O

What B-SENT
i O
am O
noticing O
is O
that O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

vowel O
is O
tending O
towards O
the O
' O
pushed O
' O
and O
spread O
side O
possibly O
from O
a O
slight O
over O
emphasis O
on O
the O
opening O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
throat O
. O

Here B-SENT
is O
the O
key O
, O
you O
need O
to O
both O
have O
an O
open O
/ O
relaxed O
throat O
with O
a O
clear O

-DOCSTART- X

sound O
. O

A B-SENT
clear O
sound O
being O
a O
sound O
with O
clarity O
and O
focus O
or O
some O
would O
term O
to O
as O
' O
ping O
' O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

One B-SENT
way O
you O
can O
do O
it O
is O
pretty O
simple O
. O

Simply B-SENT
do O
2 O
sets O
of O
scales O
on O
the O
same O
key O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

The B-SENT
do O
- O
mi O
- O
re O
- O
fa O
- O
mi O
- O
so O
- O
fa O
- O
re O
- O
mi O
- O
do O

-DOCSTART- X

- O
re O
- O
ti O
- O
do O
( O
the O
one O
you O
do O
on O
the O
recording O
) O
. O

Do B-SENT
it O
twice O
. O

First B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

on O
a O
hum O
/ O
ng O
sound O
and O
then O
on O
the O
second O
scale O
open O
the O
vowel O
in O
either O
an O
' O
EE O
' O

-DOCSTART- X

or O
an O
' O
Ah O
' O
. O

Do B-SENT
either O
the O
hum O
or O
the O
' O
ng O
' O
. O

Whichever B-SENT
is O
more O
comfortable O
for O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
. O

The B-SENT
' O
ng O
' O
is O
basically O
a O
sustained O
' O
ng O
' O
pronunciation O
as O
in O
the O
word O
' O
sing O
' O

-DOCSTART- X

or O
' O
ring O
' O
. O

Some B-SENT
also O
would O
call O
this O
an O
open O
hum O
. O

Then B-SENT
on O
the O
hum O
/ O
ng O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

try O
to O
find O
a O
clear O
buzzing O
sensation O
in O
the O
front O
of O
your O
face O
and O
at O
the O
lips O
if O
you O
are O
doing O

-DOCSTART- X

a O
hum O
. O

Do B-SENT
not O
force O
the O
sensation O
, O
focus O
on O
simply O
humming O
and O
the O
sensation O
should O
materialize O
by O
itself O
. O

-DOCSTART- X


Then B-SENT
simply O
try O
to O
keep O
this O
same O
clarity O
or O
' O
buzz O
' O
when O
you O
open O
the O
mouth O
into O
the O
EE O
/ O

-DOCSTART- X

AH O
vowel O
. O

You B-SENT
may O
need O
to O
record O
yourself O
while O
doing O
this O
. O

Many B-SENT
a O
times O
i O
have O
notice O
that O
people O

-DOCSTART- X

can O
produce O
a O
relatively O
focused O
and O
clean O
hum O
/ O
ng O
. O

But B-SENT
when O
they O
open O
the O
mouth O
to O
produce O
a O
vowel O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
the O
tone O
quality O
drastically O
changes O
into O
something O
way O
less O
focused O
and O
clear O
. O

So B-SENT
when O
you O
record O
yourself O
, O
see O

-DOCSTART- X

if O
you O
can O
produce O
the O
cleanest O
most O
' O
forward O
' O
sound O
on O
the O
hum O
/ O
ng O
and O
see O
that O
if O
you O

-DOCSTART- X

open O
to O
the O
vowel O
, O
does O
the O
tone O
quality O
drastically O
change O
. O

The B-SENT
goal O
is O
to O
keep O
the O
tone O
quality O
relatively O

-DOCSTART- X

consistent O
. O

Remember B-SENT
that O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
keep O
the O
same O
clarity O
and O
focus O
, O
different O
people O
sound O
different O
when O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

open O
the O
hum O
depending O
on O
the O
physiology O
of O
the O
vocal O
tract O
and O
cords O
. O

So B-SENT
it O
is O
more O
important O
to O
focus O

-DOCSTART- X

on O
the O
forward O
clarity O
so O
as O
to O
not O
make O
the O
sound O
overly O
nasal O
or O
squeezed O
. O

Hope B-SENT
this O
helped O

I B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

a O

social O

help O
new O

find O
their O

and O
help O
maintain O
a O
wide O

-DOCSTART- X

support O

If B-SENT
you O

n't O
feel O

you O
need O
those O

then O
stay O
friendly O
with O
people O
but O
do O
n't O
feel O

-DOCSTART- X

the O
need O
to O
attend O

Maybe B-SENT
go O
to O
the O
particularly O
big O

and O
a O
thing O
or O
two O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

the O

your O

and O
call O

Well B-SENT
at O

I O
've O

I B-SENT
just O
straight O

-DOCSTART- X

up O
tell O
them O
I O
'm O
going O
home O
if O
asked O

ignore O
the O

I B-SENT
feel O

everybody O

know O
me O
last O

and O
I O
'm O
a O
pleasant O
enough O

there O
was O
no O

there O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
tbh O
I O
think O
everyone O
is O
okay O
with O
it O
. O

I B-SENT
'm O
not O
particularly O
special O
so O
I O
doubt O
I O
'm O
missed O

-DOCSTART- X

that O
much O
lol O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
quilty O
. O

The B-SENT
big O
events O
I O
might O
go O
to O
like O
end O
of O

-DOCSTART- X

summer O
BBQ O
, O
but O
like O
coffee O

lunch O
and O
happy O

( O
I O
hate O

) O
I O
MIA O
and O
everyone O
seems O

-DOCSTART- X

cool O
with O
it O
. O

Weird B-SENT
, O
I O
do O
n't O
remember O
writing O
this O
post O
... O

I B-SENT
'm O
the O

way O
! O

You B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

are O
n't O
under O
any O
obligation O
to O
attend O
social O
events O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
completely O
write O
them O
off O
either O
. O

No B-SENT
one O

-DOCSTART- X

goes O
to O
every O

find O
a O

that O
fits O
with O
your O

see O
if O
you O
can O
make O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

to O
one O
a O

or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

I B-SENT
went O
into O
my O
program O
thinking O
of O
the O
degree O
as O
the O
end O

-DOCSTART- X

goal O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
more O
to O
gain O
from O
graduate O
school O
than O
more O
letters O
after O
your O

Socializing B-SENT

-DOCSTART- X

can O
help O
you O

more O
out O

have O

and O
will O

These B-SENT
are O
also O
people O
who O
can O
let O

-DOCSTART- X

you O
know O
about O

that O
will O
enhance O

Overall B-SENT
you O
have O
to O
find O
a O
balance O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

works O
for O
you O
but O
a O
PhD O
comes O
with O
a O
huge O
opportunity O
cost O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life O
regardless O
, O
so O

-DOCSTART- X

it O
might O
be O
worth O
it O
to O
look O
at O
these O
events O
and O
your O
peers O
as O
part O
of O
what O
you O
're O
getting O
out O

-DOCSTART- X

of O
your O

-DOCSTART- X

We B-SENT
know O
shit-all O
about O
space O

I B-SENT
think O
any O
discussion O
about O
space O
or O
aliens O
is O
pointless O
until O
people O
start O
discussing O
nasa O

-DOCSTART- X

fakery O
but O
it O
appears O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
into O
it O
. O

Logically B-SENT
, O
in O
a O
incredibly O

-DOCSTART- X

vast O
universe O
, O
it O
makes O
sense O
that O
humans O
are O
n't O
the O
only O
sentient O
beings O
out O
there O
. O

The B-SENT
problem O
with O
this O

-DOCSTART- X

is O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
's O
what O
we O

It B-SENT

because O
we O

all O
our O

and O

-DOCSTART- X

information O
from O
a O
small O

of O

these O

I B-SENT
watched O
' O
The O
Martian O
' O
a O
few O

-DOCSTART- X

days O

, O
how O
much O
of O
it O
actually O
corresponds O
to O
the O

of O

When B-SENT

an O

all O
created O
in O

-DOCSTART- X

a O

One B-SENT
thing O
we O
do O
know O
is O
that O
they O
can O
simulate O
the O
appearance O
of O
weightlessness O
since O
at O

-DOCSTART- X

1995 O

Just B-SENT
watch O

During B-SENT
Apollo O

a O

video O
of O
astronauts O
supposedly O
in O

taking O
a O

yet O
the O
video O
( O
that O
goes O
on O
recording O

-DOCSTART- X

after O
they O

reveals O
that O
they O
used O
cardboard O

create O
the O
illusion O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

they O
were O

The B-SENT

different O

how O

There B-SENT

abundant O

that O
they O

the O

-DOCSTART- X

Why B-SENT
? O

There B-SENT
are O
videos O
where O
women O

weird O
puffy O

Last B-SENT

my O

from O

invited O

us O
over O

On B-SENT
the O

over O

my O

reiterated O
many O
times O
to O
me O
just O
how O
important O
it O

-DOCSTART- X

was O
to O
make O
a O
good O

I B-SENT
scoffed O
and O
arrogantly O
informed O
my O
silly O
wife O
that O
I O
always O
make O
good O
impressions O

-DOCSTART- X

. O

My B-SENT
wife O

boss O
is O
a O
single O
lady O
in O
her O

, O
so O
it O
was O
just O
the O
three O
of O
us O

-DOCSTART- X

We B-SENT
chitchatted O
over O
drinks O

and O
seemed O
to O
really O
be O
hitting O

off O
. O

She B-SENT
laughed O
at O
my O
well-timed O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
perfectly-appropriate O
jokes O
and O
my O
wife O
seemed O
pleased O

Soon B-SENT
she O
brought O
out O
the O
main O
course O
, O
a O
nice O
big O
juicy O

-DOCSTART- X

steak O
for O
each O
of O
us O

As B-SENT
I O
began O
to O
cut O
into O
my O
steak O
, O
I O
was O
discouraged O
to O
discover O
how O

-DOCSTART- X

under O
cooked O
this O
steak O
was O
. O

Now B-SENT
, O
I O
've O
had O
my O
fair O
share O
of O
rare O
steak O

I B-SENT
prefer O
medium O

-DOCSTART- X

, O
but O
I O
can O
handle O
rare O

This B-SENT
was O
several O

on O

a O

of O

I O
sat O

fidgeting O

my O

worrying O
about O
how O
I O
was O
going O

Claim B-SENT

vegan-ism O

No B-SENT
, O
I O
'd O
already O

Just B-SENT

our O

herself O

I B-SENT

had O
to O
be O

realizing O
that O

I B-SENT
committed O

I B-SENT
grabbed O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

with O
my O

gently O
shook O
off O
the O
juice O
and O
executed O
a O
perfect O
throw O
right O
through O
the O
center O
of O
the O

-DOCSTART- X

open O

Here B-SENT
's O
the O

FU O

The B-SENT
window O
was O

It B-SENT
was O

That B-SENT
is O

until O
my O
mostly O
raw O
slab O
of O

slammed O
up O

-DOCSTART- X

against O
it O
and O
slowly O
slid O
down O
leaving O
a O
trail O
of O
bloody O
juice O
in O
its O
wake O
. O

My B-SENT
wife O
- O
who's O

-DOCSTART- X

was O
a O

and O
was O
unaware O
of O
my O

turned O
, O
jaw O
dropped O
, O
and O
stared O
at O
me O

-DOCSTART- X

like O
I O

This B-SENT

the O

I B-SENT
just O

Rather B-SENT

Cinnamon B-SENT
basil O
really O
does O
smell O
like O
the O
sweet O
spice O
, O

-DOCSTART- X

and O
it O
also O
has O
unusually O
beautiful O

There B-SENT
are O
perennial O
basils O

so O
it O
's O
often O
easiest O
to O

the O
seeds O
indoors O
instead O
of O
risking O
that O

-DOCSTART- X

they O
