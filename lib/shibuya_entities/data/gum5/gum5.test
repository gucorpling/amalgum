Introduction .
0,1 abstract

Personal experiences of discrimination and bias have been the focus of much social science research . [ 1 - 3 ]
0,6 abstract|3,4 abstract|5,6 abstract|8,15 abstract|11,15 abstract|12,14 abstract|17,18 abstract|19,20 abstract

Sociologists have explored the adverse consequences of discrimination [ 3 – 5 ] ;
0,1 person|3,8 abstract|7,8 abstract|9,10 abstract|11,12 abstract

psychologists have examined the mental processes that underpin conscious and unconscious biases [ 6 ] ;
0,1 person|3,6 abstract|8,12 abstract|13,14 abstract

neuroscientists have examined the neurobiological underpinnings of discrimination [ 7 – 9 ] ;
0,1 person|3,8 event|7,8 abstract|9,10 abstract|11,12 abstract

and evolutionary theorists have explored the various ways that in-group / out-group biases emerged across the history of our species . [ 10 ]
1,3 person|5,8 abstract|9,13 abstract|15,20 abstract|18,20 person|22,23 abstract

In many respects , researchers already possess a wealth of knowledge concerning the origins and consequences of discrimination and bias . [ 11 ]
4,5 person|7,11 abstract|12,20 abstract|15,20 abstract|17,18 abstract|19,20 abstract|22,23 abstract

What also should not be lost in discussion of discrimination is the growing push to implement social policy aimed at reducing the occurrence of discriminatory practices .
7,10 abstract|9,10 abstract|11,26 abstract|16,18 abstract|21,26 event|24,26 abstract

Mandatory diversity trainings in professional settings , for example , are intended to reduce bias in the workplace by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members . [ 12 ]

Indeed , the implementation of certain policies is rooted in the assumption that discrimination and biases are , at least to some appreciable amount , present in modern society .
2,7 abstract|5,7 abstract|10,12 abstract|13,14 abstract|15,16 abstract|21,24 quantity|27,29 abstract

Even so , estimates of the prevalence of perceived discrimination remains rare ( see [ 13 – 14 ] ) .
3,10 quantity|5,10 abstract|8,10 abstract|15,16 abstract|17,18 abstract

At least one prior study by Kessler and colleagues [ 15 ] , however , using measures of perceived discrimination in a large American sample , reported that approximately 33 % of respondents reported some form of discrimination ( see also , Gibbons et al. [ 4 ] ) .
2,9 abstract|6,7 person|8,9 person|10,11 abstract|16,25 quantity|18,25 abstract|21,25 person|28,33 person|32,33 person|34,38 abstract|37,38 abstract|42,43 person|44,45 person|46,47 abstract

The current study seeks to build on this research by estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large , nationally representative sample of adults from the United States .

Additionally , the analysis address the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiences .

Reason for discrimination .
0,3 abstract|2,3 abstract

All respondents who indicated they were discriminated against — specifically , those who responded with sometimes or often to the perceived discrimination measure described above — were asked the following question :
0,2 person|4,5 person|11,25 person|19,23 abstract|21,22 abstract|28,31 abstract

“ What do you think was the main reason for these experiences ? ”
1,13 abstract|3,4 person|6,12 abstract|10,12 abstract

Respondents were allowed to choose one response from 11 categories .
0,1 person|5,7 abstract|8,10 abstract

For the present analysis , these responses were recoded into nine mutually exclusive categories capturing the following options :
1,4 abstract|5,7 abstract|10,14 abstract|15,18 abstract

race / ancestry / skin color ;
0,1 abstract|2,3 abstract|4,6 abstract|4,5 object|5,6 abstract

sexual orientation ;
0,2 abstract

education or income ;
0,1 abstract|2,3 abstract

physical disability ;
0,2 abstract

and other .
1,2 abstract

The following categories from the original questionnaire were collapsed into one category for the analysis : race ; ancestry or national origin ; and shade of skin color .

Additionally , because this question was only asked of respondents who reported prior discrimination experiences , the built-in skip pattern resulted in a large number of cases scored as missing ( legitimate skip ) .

Respondent race .
0,2 abstract|0,1 person

Because a race variable is not available from the Wave 4 interviews , we use the racial category reported by the respondent during the Wave 1 interview .
1,4 abstract|2,3 abstract|8,12 event|9,11 event|13,14 person|15,18 abstract|20,22 person|23,27 event|24,26 event

Wave 1 race — rather than , say , Wave 3 race — was used to preserve case counts .
0,3 abstract|0,2 event|9,12 abstract|9,11 event|17,19 quantity|17,18 abstract

The logic is that ( nearly ) all Wave 4 respondents appeared in the Wave 1 sample , but not all would have been interviewed at Wave 3 due to differential patterns of temporary attrition .

Respondents were asked to indicate their race from among the following categories : White ; Black or African American ; Hispanic ; American Indian or Native American ; and Asian or Pacific Islander .
0,1 person|5,7 abstract|5,6 person|9,12 abstract|13,33 abstract|13,14 abstract|15,16 abstract|17,19 abstract|20,21 abstract|22,24 abstract|25,27 abstract|29,30 abstract|31,33 abstract

Respondents were provided the opportunity to select more than one race , and those who did were asked a follow-up question regarding which category best described their racial background .
0,1 person|3,11 abstract|7,11 abstract|13,16 person|18,29 abstract|22,24 abstract|26,29 abstract|26,27 person

In the current study , those respondents who indicated more than one race were coded as “ mixed race ” .

Demographic variables .
0,2 abstract

To provide information on the analytical sample as a whole , two additional demographic variables are included .
2,10 abstract|4,10 abstract|11,15 abstract

First , age is a continuous measure created by subtracting the year of the respondents ' birth ( obtained from Wave 1 ) from the year of the interview at Wave 4 .
2,3 abstract|4,7 abstract|10,17 time|13,17 event|14,16 person|20,22 event|24,32 time|27,32 event|30,32 event

Second , sex was dichotomously coded based on the self-reported sex of the respondent at Wave 4 ( 0 = female and 1 = male ) .

Analytical plan .
0,2 abstract

Our exploratory study included three basic steps .
0,3 abstract|0,1 person|4,7 abstract

First , summary statistics of the study variables and racial categories were produced .
2,11 quantity|5,8 abstract|6,7 abstract|9,11 abstract

Second , we examined the relative proportions of the two discrimination experience measures across each racial category .
2,3 person|4,17 quantity|8,13 quantity|10,12 abstract|10,11 abstract|14,17 abstract

Finally , we assessed the distribution of reported reasons for discrimination across the racial categories .
2,3 person|4,15 abstract|7,15 abstract|7,9 abstract|10,15 abstract|12,15 abstract

In order to examine potential bivariate associations , the adjusted F statistic ( design-based F ) was employed as it corrects for a complex sample design such as that used in the Add Health . [ 21 ]
4,7 abstract|8,12 abstract|13,15 abstract|19,20 abstract|22,26 abstract|24,25 abstract|31,34 organization|36,37 abstract

More specifically , when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata the conventional Pearson χ2 statistic test of independence is converted into “ an F statistic with noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second-order Rao and Scott ( 1981 [ 22 ] , 1984 [ 23 ] ) correction ” . [ 24 ]
4,8 event|5,8 abstract|6,7 abstract|9,16 abstract|13,14 abstract|15,16 abstract|16,24 abstract|23,24 abstract|28,36 abstract|32,36 quantity|35,36 abstract|38,55 abstract|40,41 person|42,43 person|44,45 time|46,47 abstract|49,50 time|51,52 abstract|58,59 abstract

The p-value associated with the design-based F is thus more accurate ( than the associated with the χ2 statistic ) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data .
0,2 quantity|4,7 abstract|16,19 abstract|21,23 abstract|24,25 abstract|28,34 abstract|32,34 abstract

This final step also included an examination of the relative distribution of racial categories across the various reported reasons for discrimination .
0,3 event|5,21 abstract|8,21 abstract|12,14 abstract|15,21 abstract|20,21 abstract

As noted earlier , all analyses were weighted according to the survey weight provided by the Add Health research staff and standard errors were corrected for the clustering and stratification that defined the sampling strategy .

Eegimaa is a Jóola language spoken in the Basse Casamance area of Southern Senegal by a population estimated to be between 7,000 ( Bassène , 2007 ) and 11,200 speakers ( Lewis , Simons , &amp; Fennig , 2014 ) .

For example , the name Kusiilay 1 ‘ the language of Essil ’ , is the name given by speakers of Kujireray to the Eegimaa language , because Essil , of which Bajjat was a district , is the village which has a border with their village .

Academic life and work

Jespersen was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to 1925 , and served as Rector of the university in 1920 – 21 .

His early work focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics , but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language development .

He advanced the theories of Rank and Nexus in Danish in two papers : Sprogets logik ( 1913 ) and De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser ( 1921 ) .

Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax , and differentiates between primaries , secondaries , and tertiaries ; e.g. in " well honed phrase , " " phrase " is a primary , this being defined by a secondary , " honed " , which again is defined by a tertiary " well " .

The term Nexus is applied to sentences , structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation , in which two concepts are expressed in one unit ; e.g. , it rained , he ran indoors .
0,3 abstract|6,7 abstract|8,12 abstract|11,12 abstract|13,16 abstract|15,16 abstract|19,21 abstract|24,26 abstract|32,33 person

This term is qualified by a further concept called a junction which represents one idea , expressed by means of two or more elements , whereas a nexus combines two ideas .

Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles ( 1909 – 1949 ) , concentrated on morphology and syntax , and Growth and Structure of the English Language ( 1905 ) is a comprehensive view of English by someone with another native language , and still in print , over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publication .

There are precedents of independent governors dealing effectively with the legislature , and indeed a wise third-party governor can have greater effectiveness than a major party governor .

This needs more discussion obviously : we chose public domain because the texts we use are public domain and we did n't want to add new restrictions , especially not non-commercial , since already our recordings are being used for a number of commercialish projects ( I ca n't recall any specific project names , but some pay-education sites use LV stuff ) .
