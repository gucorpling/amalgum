Introduction
0,1 abstract

Research on adult-learned second language ( L2 ) has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar [ 1 ] – [ 11 ] .

Of interest here , studies suggest that , despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar , adult learners can approximate native-like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [ 12 ] – [ 15 ] .

However , it is not enough to have attained such native-like levels .
9,12 abstract

Crucially , it is also desirable to retain them , even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2 .
8,9 abstract|12,22 abstract|15,17 abstract|18,22 abstract|20,22 abstract

In fact , substantial periods ( months to years ) of limited or no exposure following L2 training are not uncommon , and may even be the norm [ 16 ] .
3,15 time|3,5 time|6,9 time|11,15 abstract|16,18 abstract|16,17 abstract|26,28 abstract|28,31 abstract

Such a scenario may be found in different situations , including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [ 19 ] .

In the present study , we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar : that is , whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / or less native-like neural processes ( “ use it or lose it ” [ 20 ] ) , no such changes , or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / or more native-like processing may be observed .

Additionally , we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training , in particular between classroom-like and immersion-like contexts .

Previous Research
0,2 abstract

We are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] , all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral ( performance ) outcomes .

( Note that we do not consider case studies , purely observational data , or research on L2s acquired by children ; for a comprehensive review , see [ 16 ] ) .
3,4 person|7,9 abstract|10,13 abstract|15,18 abstract|17,18 abstract|20,21 person|23,26 abstract|28,31 abstract

The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] or lexical abilities [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .

These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [ 21 ] , with only one longitudinal study testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [ 24 ] .

Across the studies , the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] or mixed classroom and immersion training [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .

The training lasted varying lengths of time , apparently usually in the range of a few years , and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels ( though not directly measured , except by [ 24 ] ) prior to the period of limited exposure .

Overall , the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following .
2,8 abstract|5,8 abstract|13,15 event

A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition ( loss ) of L2 performance or knowledge [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .

Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month [ 23 ] or 6 month delay [ 21 ] , as well as after 2 years [ 18 ] , though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years , and not earlier [ 17 ] .

Although attrition may take place within the first few years , some studies suggest that it then appears to level off , with no further losses occurring [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
1,2 event|6,10 time|11,13 abstract|15,16 event|23,26 event|27,30 abstract|31,34 abstract

Higher levels of proficiency ( or exposure ) may be associated with less attrition [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] or even with no observed losses [ 21 ] .
0,4 abstract|6,7 abstract|12,14 event|14,17 abstract|18,21 abstract|22,25 abstract|26,29 abstract|32,35 event|35,38 abstract

Moreover , one study found no changes at all in performance , across proficiency levels , after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure [ 22 ] .
2,4 abstract|5,11 abstract|10,11 abstract|13,15 abstract|17,25 time|23,25 abstract|25,28 abstract

Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed : after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [ 24 ] , and in another study after 2 years , though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension [ 18 ] .
3,5 abstract|5,9 abstract|8,9 abstract|14,19 time|17,19 abstract|20,22 abstract|25,34 person|28,34 abstract|28,29 abstract|32,34 abstract|34,37 abstract|40,42 abstract|43,45 time|49,51 abstract|54,58 abstract|58,61 abstract

It remains unclear what might explain such gains , which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [ 24 ] , or to factors related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training [ 18 ] .

In 2015 , an initiative was started to set up a Dutch speaking DH+Lib community in the Netherlands and Belgium , based on the example of the American communal space of librarians , archivists , LIS graduate students , and information specialists to discuss topics ‘ Where the Digital Humanities and Libraries meet ’ .

At the initial meeting it became apparent that most participants were there to learn more about digital humanities and were not ( yet ) in the situation where they were able to offer expertise on the subject .
1,4 event|4,5 abstract|7,37 abstract|8,10 person|16,18 abstract|25,37 abstract|28,29 person|33,37 abstract|35,37 abstract

On the administrative level , the directors of the libraries participating in the consortium of Dutch academic libraries ( UKB ) also expressed the wish that librarians become more fluent in DH .
1,4 abstract|5,10 person|8,10 organization|12,18 organization|15,18 organization|19,20 organization|23,25 abstract|26,27 person|31,32 abstract

A year later , the National Library of the Netherlands ( Koninklijke Bibliotheek ) , and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field .

Therefore both institutes joined forces to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians .

In essence , we want to teach our country ’s librarians the ins and outs of DH in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner needed in DH projects .

The aim of these clinics is to provide basic methodological competencies and technical skills in DH , for a diverse group of librarians , consisting of both subject and technical librarians with basic technical skills .

The content of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students , identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self-directed learning and ( perhaps ) to automate their daily library work .

We are not setting out to turn them into programmers or data crunchers , but want to boost their knowledge level to where they feel comfortable providing information about DH projects , follow the literature and research , follow online tutorials and hopefully take up the challenge of finishing this professional development by engaging with the DH community .

In order to design this curriculum we follow a four step approach with a Working Out Loud - principle ( Williams , 2010 ) :

Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h , as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength ?
0,2 event|3,4 abstract|9,13 quantity|15,16 event|18,19 place|20,21 event|24,25 abstract

Yes , all tropical cyclones are driven by high heat content waters .
2,5 event|8,12 substance

Once a storm moves over any appreciably sized piece of land , the moisture source is removed and the storm begins to dissipate .
1,3 event|5,11 place|12,15 abstract|13,14 abstract|18,20 event

As of the last advisory , T C Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland , headed on a northwest track .
2,5 event|6,9 event|10,16 abstract|12,16 quantity|23,26 abstract

That is a Category 3 storm .
0,1 event|2,6 event

The forecast is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours .
0,2 abstract|4,23 event|8,9 abstract|10,13 event|14,16 time|17,20 event|21,23 time

However , there will be very heavy rains and flooding along its path .
5,8 event|9,10 event|11,13 abstract|11,12 event

Yes , it will loose strength steadily as more and more of this swirling system moves from being over ocean to being over land .
2,24 event|2,3 event|5,6 abstract|12,15 event|19,20 place|23,24 place

This occurs for two reasons :
0,1 event|3,5 abstract

As it moves over land , it is cut off from the source of energy driving the storm [ which is ] the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface ;
0,31 abstract|1,2 event|4,5 place|6,7 event|11,15 abstract|16,18 event|22,31 abstract|25,26 substance|27,31 place|29,30 place

Increased friction - the ocean surface is much , much smoother than the land surface .
0,2 abstract|3,6 place|4,5 place|12,15 place|13,14 place

Tropical cyclones are sustained by a form of energy called latent heat , which is released by moisture evaporated from the ocean that condenses to form rain .
0,2 event|5,9 abstract|10,12 abstract|17,18 abstract|20,22 place|26,27 substance

As tropical cyclones make landfall , this energy source is cut-off and they rapidly lose strength as they move over land .
1,3 event|4,5 abstract|6,9 abstract|12,13 event|15,16 abstract|17,18 event|20,21 place

Yes , the Cyclone is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land .
2,4 event|9,10 abstract|11,12 event|14,15 place

Cyclones gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land .
0,1 event|2,4 abstract|2,3 event|5,13 event|6,7 abstract|8,9 abstract|10,13 substance|14,15 event|20,21 place

In the mean time , much stronger friction over land quickly reduces their strength .
5,10 abstract|9,10 place|12,14 abstract|12,13 event

Yes .


All tropical cyclones lose strength once they make landfall .
0,3 event|4,5 abstract|6,7 event|8,9 abstract

However , they can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides , and river flooding .
2,3 event|5,7 event|9,12 event|13,15 event|17,19 event

Phailin 's winds will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland .
0,3 abstract|0,2 event|7,8 event

Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore it will immediately begin to lose strength .
1,3 event|5,6 place|6,7 event|12,13 abstract

However , and this is important , it still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty .

7,9 event|12,15 abstract

Hopefully , we all learn from past mistakes .
2,4 person|6,8 abstract

The history of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable , with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed , millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US$ 10 billion .

I do n't have enough information to answer this question , one way or the other .
0,1 person|4,6 abstract|8,10 abstract

From all the press reports that I have read , the Indian government appears to have taken the threat of Cyclone Phailin very seriously indeed .
1,5 abstract|6,7 person|10,13 organization|17,22 abstract|20,22 event

The government has been much more pro-active in preparing for this cyclone than in the past .
0,2 organization|10,12 event|14,16 time

The forecasts of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate .
0,7 abstract|3,7 abstract

Mandatory mass evacuations have been carried out , which is essential to minimize loss of life in these situations .

I cannot comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone .

Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine which treats patients with massively diluted forms of substances that , if given to a healthy person undiluted , would cause symptoms similar to the disease .

Why very few actually Beat Bobby Flay .
1,3 person|5,7 person

While it seems suspicious that Bobby wins so many of the competitions ( leading many to think that the show is rigged ) , I have a feeling that Bobby 's record is a product of selective casting .

To explain :


Remember when Anne Burrell challenged Bobby to a cheesecake battle , and won ?
2,10 event|2,4 person|5,6 person|7,10 event|8,9 object

Anne admitted it ’s not her favorite dish , but she knows that Bobby sucks at desserts .

I bet they have .
0,1 person|2,3 person

I bet lots of people have .
0,1 person|2,5 person

But to ensure that Bobby maintains a favorable batting average ( and therefore looks good / stays happy on the show ) , the producers ask what chefs intend to cook as their signature dish in the audition process , and then only pick challengers who either a) , are going to cook something that 's already in Bobby 's wheelhouse ( how many times have we seen that happen ? ) , or b) , are going to cook something unique , but it 's an irregular ( or just plain stupid ) version of that unique thing .
4,5 person|6,10 quantity|19,21 abstract|23,25 person|26,27 object|27,28 person|32,35 object|32,33 person|36,39 abstract|44,45 person|53,54 object|58,61 place|58,60 person|63,65 time|66,67 person|80,82 object|84,85 object|86,99 object|96,99 object

Given that when confronted with a dish unfamiliar to him , Bobby always prepares a straightforward version , Bobby 's earnest dish will usually win out over the platter of WHUT put out by the challenger .
5,10 object|9,10 person|11,12 person|14,17 object|18,22 object|18,20 person|27,31 object|30,31 abstract|34,36 person

Do n’t take my word for it , just watch the show .
3,5 abstract|3,4 person|6,7 abstract|10,12 abstract

Usually when the challenger announces their dish you think to yourself , “ oh Bobby ’s screwed on this one , ” but then immediately they cut to that interview where a smiling , imbecilic contender says , “ My version of ________ has ... [ some looney goddamn ingredient or technique that does n’t belong in that dish ] . ”

2,3 person|6,11 event|9,11 abstract|12,15 object|12,13 person|18,20 person

BTW if you ’re still doubtful , the producers HAVE to know the secret in advance .
2,3 person|7,9 person|12,14 abstract|15,16 abstract

There ’s no way they ’re stopping production while a P.A. runs out to buy liver & onions .

Celebrity chefs win against Bobby more often because they are who they are , and they can cook whatever they want to .

0,2 person|7,8 person|9,11 abstract|14,15 person|17,18 person

This also illuminates why we so often see judges who themselves have a background in whatever the signature dish is .
0,1 abstract|4,5 person|8,9 person|10,11 person|12,14 abstract|16,19 object

If the producers know what the challenger is going to cook , they can bring in judges who know how it 's supposed to be cooked ( and also importantly , know that it 's not supposed to be cooked in whatever godforsaken manner than the challenger plans ) .

One final thing :
0,3 abstract

Though I ’m inclined to believe that Bobby does n’t actually know what the signature dish will be ( even though the producers do ) , I would n’t be too terribly surprised if one of his assistants or sous-chefs has been told the dish and has “ seeded ” Bobby ’s pantry with ideas .

How to Tell a Joke

Two Parts :
0,2 abstract

Getting the Material Right
0,4 abstract|1,3 abstract

Getting the Delivery Right
0,4 abstract|1,3 abstract

From one-liners to classic three-liners to the one-minute gag you tell your friends , a good joke pleases everyone .
1,2 abstract|3,5 abstract|6,9 abstract|9,10 person|11,13 person|11,12 person|14,17 event|18,19 person

Joke-telling is one of the best ways to ease tension , make a new friend , or light up a room .
0,1 event|2,7 abstract|9,10 abstract|12,15 person|19,21 place

That is , of course , if you can get a laugh .
7,8 person|10,12 abstract

Telling good jokes is an art that comes naturally to some people , but for others it takes practice and hard work .

Part 1 of 2 :
0,4 abstract|3,4 abstract

Getting the Material Right
0,4 abstract|1,3 abstract

Know your audience .
1,3 person|1,2 person

All aspects of the joke you tell , from the content to the length , need to be suited to your audience .

What ’s funny to a group of 20-year old college students may be very different from what makes your 70-year old - uncle laugh ( then again , maybe not ) .
0,11 abstract|4,11 person|16,24 abstract|18,23 person|18,19 person

Everyone ’s an individual , so there are no hard and fast rules .
0,1 person|2,4 person|9,13 abstract

But , unless you personally know the members of your audience , here are some good rules of thumb to follow :
3,4 person|6,11 person|9,11 person|9,10 person|14,19 abstract

elderly people wo n’t like crude jokes ;
0,2 person|5,7 abstract

stay away from misogynist jokes if you ’ve got an audience full of women ;
3,5 abstract|6,7 person|9,14 person

people of a specific ethnic or racial group wo n’t enjoy jokes making fun of their group ;
0,8 person|11,17 abstract|15,18 person|15,16 person

and jokes requiring specialized knowledge ( of , for example , science or old movies ) will only be appreciated by people who possess that knowledge .
1,5 abstract|3,5 abstract|11,12 abstract|13,15 abstract|21,26 person|24,26 abstract

The more you know about your audience the better you ’ll be able to tailor your jokes to them .
2,3 person|5,7 person|5,6 person|9,10 person|15,17 abstract|15,16 person|18,19 person

Choose great material .
1,3 abstract

You can find fodder lots of places — from your life , joke files online , by repurposing jokes you ’ve heard in the past , and so on .
0,1 person|3,4 object|4,7 abstract|9,11 abstract|9,10 person|12,15 object|12,14 object|17,25 event|19,20 person|23,25 time

You may want to start your own joke file .
0,1 person|5,9 object|5,6 person|7,9 object

You can write your jokes down on index cards to keep them handy or use a document file on your computer . [ 1 ]
0,1 person|3,9 object|3,5 object|3,4 person|7,9 object|11,12 object|15,21 object|15,18 object|19,20 person

The latter option may allow for easier revision .
0,3 event|6,8 abstract

Decide on a target .
2,4 abstract

Every joke has a “ target , ” which is what the joke is about .
0,2 event|3,6 abstract|10,15 abstract|11,13 event

It ’s important that the joke ’s target ( the most basic element of your material ) be suited to your audience .
4,8 abstract|4,7 event|9,16 abstract|14,16 abstract|14,15 person|20,22 person|20,21 person

Make sure it ’s a target your audience will be interested in and something they ’re likely willing to laugh at . [ 2 ]
2,3 abstract|4,6 abstract|6,8 person|6,7 person|13,14 abstract|14,15 person

For example , husbands are likely to laugh at jokes about wives and vice versa ;
3,4 person|9,12 event|11,12 person

students will typically find jokes about school and teachers humorous .
0,1 person|4,9 event|6,7 organization|8,9 person

Have a realistic but exaggerated setup .
1,6 abstract|2,3 abstract|4,5 abstract

The opening of the joke — or setup — should have a basis in the real world so your audience can relate to it , but it should also include exaggeration because this is what gives a joke its humorous edge . [ 3 ]
0,5 abstract|3,5 event|7,8 abstract|11,17 abstract|14,17 abstract|18,20 abstract|18,19 person|23,24 abstract|26,27 abstract|30,31 abstract|32,33 abstract|34,41 abstract|36,38 event|38,41 abstract|38,39 event

Think of the setup as the foundation of a story .
2,4 abstract|5,10 abstract|8,10 abstract

It ’s a fundamental part of the joke ;
0,1 abstract|2,8 abstract|6,8 event

if you do n’t lay a good foundation here , then the punchline wo n’t make sense to the audience or they wo n’t find it humorous .
1,2 person|5,8 abstract|8,9 abstract|11,13 abstract|16,17 abstract|18,20 person|21,22 person|25,26 abstract

Your setup needs to be both realistic and exaggerated in order to be funny —
0,2 abstract|0,1 person|6,9 abstract|6,7 abstract|8,9 abstract

it ’s placing these two incongruous elements side by side that makes the joke funny . [ 4 ]
3,7 abstract|12,14 event

The exaggeration can be slight or considerable —
0,2 abstract

it just depends on the individual joke .
0,1 abstract|4,7 event

Surprise with the punchline .
2,4 abstract

The ending of the joke is obviously crucial .
0,5 abstract|3,5 event

This is where the payoff comes in , what makes the joke succeed or fail .
0,1 abstract|2,7 abstract|3,5 abstract|8,15 abstract|10,12 event

If you want to make the audience laugh , your punchline needs to be surprising .
1,2 person|5,7 person|9,11 abstract|9,10 person

Some jokes also have what is called a tag or topper , which is an additional punchline .
0,2 abstract|4,11 abstract|14,17 abstract

The tag builds on the original punchline or twists back on it in a surprising way .
0,2 abstract|4,7 abstract|11,12 abstract|13,16 abstract

Make the joke your own .
1,3 event|3,5 abstract|3,4 person

Lots of jokes rehash the same ground and sometimes they retell a story countless other jokes have told .
0,3 abstract|4,7 abstract|9,10 event|11,13 abstract|13,16 abstract

For your joke to be funny , it has to surprise the audience in some way , which means it has to seem original or new .
1,3 event|1,2 person|7,8 event|11,13 person|14,16 abstract|19,20 event

One way to personalize a joke is to change the ending . [ 5 ]
0,2 abstract|4,6 event|9,11 abstract

Another option is to dress the joke up as a story about your own life .
0,2 abstract|3,15 event|5,7 event|9,15 abstract|9,11 abstract|12,15 abstract|12,13 person

This will make a familiar joke unrecognizable .
0,1 abstract|3,6 event

It may also make it particularly interesting if your audience is your friend(s) . [ 6 ]
0,1 abstract|4,5 event|7,13 abstract|8,10 person|8,9 person|11,13 person|11,12 person

Know your material .
1,3 abstract|1,2 person

Practicing your joke is crucial .
1,3 event|1,2 person

You do n’t need to have it completely memorized — in fact , you " should n’t " memorize it — but you need to be really comfortable with it , so comfortable that you can continue on with telling it even if you get nervous or sidetracked , which is very possible once you ’re in front of an audience .
0,1 person|6,7 event|13,14 person|19,20 event|22,23 person|29,30 event|34,35 person|40,41 event|43,44 person|54,55 person|59,61 person

Memorized jokes sound wooden , like they are being read off a script instead of relayed by a friend or entertainer .
0,2 abstract|6,7 abstract|11,13 object|17,19 person|20,21 person

Good jokes have a lot of details and personality , so do n’t be afraid to embellish . [ 7 ]
0,2 abstract|6,7 abstract|8,9 abstract

Try different things out and see what feels right , what sounds best .
1,3 abstract|6,9 abstract|10,13 abstract

Do n’t use a joke until you ’re completely comfortable with it .
3,5 abstract|6,7 person|11,12 abstract

Try recording your joke on a tape player and playing it back to yourself .
2,4 abstract|2,3 person|5,8 object|10,11 abstract|13,14 person

If you hear a lot of awkward pauses or “ah”s or “um”s , your joke isn ’t ready and you need to practice more . [ 8 ]
1,2 person|6,8 abstract|9,10 abstract|11,12 abstract|13,15 abstract|13,14 person|19,20 person

You can also try practicing in front of a sympathetic friend or family member once you ’re ready for a “ real ” audience .

Steps


Wash alone or with " like " clothing .
4,8 object

It ’s best to wash adults ’ overalls alone , especially men ’s .
0,1 abstract|3,9 abstract|5,8 object

However , it is okay to wash just a few items with them , like blue jeans .
2,3 abstract|5,13 abstract|7,11 object|12,13 object|15,17 object

What you do n’t want to wash with them is anything that can get twisted up with the straps , like women ’s long sleeve shirts or kids ’ blankets .
1,2 person|8,9 object|10,19 object|17,19 object|21,26 object|27,30 object

Think similar clothing , minus the twisty-ness .
1,3 object|5,7 abstract

Just do the denim and canvas stuff together .

Fasten the straps to the bib .
1,3 object|4,6 object

If you did n’t know already , the bib is the top front part with the breast pockets .
1,2 person|7,9 object

Go ahead and fasten both straps before you wash .

This will help keep them from twisting up during the wash .
4,5 object|9,11 event

Use twist ties to keep the straps fastened .

This step will reapportion years of your life in the long run .
0,2 event|6,7 person

Do n’t skip it .
3,4 event

Take the 20 seconds to use a couple twist ties on the fasteners to make sure they do n’t come loose .
1,4 time|6,10 object|11,13 object|16,17 object

If your washing machine is worth its salt , it will undo those straps in a heartbeat and tie them in a sheet bend unless you prevent it .
1,4 object|9,24 event|9,10 object|12,14 object|19,20 object|25,26 person|27,28 event

All it takes is two twist ties and a few seconds of patience .
4,7 object|8,13 time

Empty the pockets .
1,3 object

Overalls have more pockets than pants .
0,1 object|2,4 object|5,6 object

The bib has a wallet pocket and a watch pocket .
0,2 object|3,6 object|7,10 object

Kids put rocks , candy , and bugs in these .
0,1 person|2,3 object|4,5 object|7,8 object|9,10 object

Men put cell phones and small tools in them .
0,1 person|2,4 object|5,7 object|8,9 object

Women defy the laws of purse-space , so when it comes to bib pockets , the sky is the limit .
0,1 person|12,14 object

Make sure all the pockets are empty .
2,5 object

Move the strap adjusters around .
1,4 object

You ’ve probably got them just the way you like them , but if you move the adjusters up or down on the straps occasionally , the straps will last longer .
0,1 person|4,5 object|8,9 person|10,11 object|14,15 person|16,18 object|22,24 object|26,28 object

Depending on the adjusters , you may be able to leave them a little loose too .
2,4 object|5,6 person|11,12 object

The straps wear out fastest around the adjusters over the course of numerous wash and dry cycles ( not to mention being out in the elements if they are work clothes ) .
0,2 object|6,8 object|12,17 event|27,28 object

Moving them distributes the wear and tear of washing .
0,10 event|1,2 object|3,9 abstract

This is the same idea as rotating tires .
0,1 event|7,8 object

Tips
0,1 abstract

If you wash your overalls alone or in a light load , use about half the detergent called for and less water .
1,2 person|3,5 object|3,4 person|15,17 substance|21,22 substance

Leave the straps fastened and twist-tied to the bib when you throw them in the dryer .

This will cut down on some of the racket , but you 're still going to hear them .

Warnings
0,1 abstract

The paper-type twist ties will deteriorate a little , but the dryer filter screen will catch the fallout .
0,4 object|10,14 object|16,18 substance

Plastic-type twist ties will hold up in the wash , but may or may not melt in your dryer .
0,3 object|7,9 event|17,19 object|17,18 person
