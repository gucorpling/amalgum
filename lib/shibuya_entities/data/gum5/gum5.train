The viewing experience of art is a complex one , involving issues of perception , attention , memory , decision-making , affect , and emotion .

Our experience of art develops from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes ; the beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork .

When regarding an artwork , a viewer gathers information through a series fixations , interspersed by rapid movements of the eye called saccades .
2,4 object|5,7 person|8,9 abstract|10,13 abstract|12,13 event|16,21 event|19,21 object|22,23 event

The direction of saccades is determined by an interaction between the goals of the observer and the physical properties of the different elements of the scene ( e.g. colour , texture , brightness etc ) .

Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts ( see for example Brieber 2014 ; Binderman et al. , 2005 ) and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit ( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich & Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) .

1 Introduction
0,2 abstract

Tenured and tenure-track university faculty play a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress , both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers .
0,5 person|3,4 organization|6,9 abstract|11,18 abstract|16,18 abstract|22,24 abstract|22,23 person|27,32 abstract|27,28 person|30,32 person

Past studies establish that each of these efforts is strongly and positively influenced through various forms of faculty diversity , including ethnic , racial , and gender diversity .
0,2 abstract|6,8 abstract|14,28 abstract|17,19 abstract|17,18 person|21,28 abstract

As an example , research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [ 1 ] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [ 2 , 3 ] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers .
4,5 abstract|7,14 abstract|10,14 organization|17,20 abstract|20,23 abstract|24,30 abstract|28,30 abstract|31,32 abstract|33,34 abstract|38,44 person|40,42 abstract|43,44 abstract|49,54 abstract|52,54 person|52,53 person

Additionally , diversity has been shown to produce more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [ 4 ] , which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists .
2,3 abstract|8,16 abstract|8,12 abstract|13,16 place|16,19 abstract|23,28 event|26,28 person

Despite these positive effects , however , quantifying the impact of diversity in science remains exceedingly difficult , due in large part to a lack of comprehensive data about the scientific workforce .
1,4 abstract|8,14 event|11,12 abstract|13,14 abstract|23,32 quantity|26,32 abstract|29,32 person

Measuring the composition and dynamics of a scientific workforce , particularly in a rapidly expanding field like computer science , is a crucial first step toward understanding how scholarly research is conducted and how it might be enhanced .
1,9 abstract|6,9 person|12,19 object|17,19 abstract|21,25 event|28,30 abstract|34,35 abstract

For many scientific fields , however , there is no central listing of all tenure-track faculty , making it difficult to define a rigorous sample frame for analysis .
1,4 abstract|10,16 object|13,16 person|18,19 event|20,28 event|22,28 abstract|27,28 abstract

Further , rates of adoption of services like GoogleScholar and ResearchGate vary within , and across disciplines .
2,11 quantity|4,11 abstract|6,11 abstract|8,9 organization|10,11 organization|16,17 abstract

For instance , gender representation in computing is an important issue with broad implications [ 5 ] , but without a full census of computing faculty , the degree of inequality and its possible sources are difficult to establish [ 6 ] .
3,7 abstract|3,4 abstract|6,7 abstract|8,14 abstract|12,14 abstract|14,17 abstract|20,26 event|24,26 person|24,25 abstract|27,31 quantity|30,31 abstract|32,35 abstract|32,33 abstract|39,42 abstract

Some disciplines , like political science , are organized around a single professional society , whose membership roll approximates a full census [ 7 ] .
0,6 abstract|4,6 abstract|10,14 organization|15,18 person|16,17 abstract|19,22 event|22,25 abstract

Most fields , on the other hand , including computer science , lack a single all-encompassing organization and membership information is instead distributed across many disjoint lists , such as web-based faculty directories for individual departments .
0,2 abstract|9,11 abstract|13,17 organization|18,20 abstract|18,19 abstract|24,36 abstract|30,36 place|31,32 person|34,36 organization

Because assembling such a full census is difficult , past studies have tended to avoid this task and have instead used samples of researchers [ 8 – 11 ] , usually specific to a particular field [ 12 – 16 ] , and often focused on the scientific elite [ 17 , 18 ] .
2,6 event|9,11 event|15,17 abstract|21,36 object|23,24 person|25,28 abstract|25,26 abstract|27,28 abstract|33,36 abstract|36,41 abstract|37,38 abstract|39,40 abstract|46,49 person|49,54 abstract|50,51 abstract|52,53 abstract

Although useful , such samples are not representative of the scientific workforce as a whole and thus have limited generalizability .
3,5 object|9,15 person|18,20 abstract

One of the largest census efforts to date assembled , by hand , a nearly complete record of three academic fields : computer science , history , and business [ 19 ] .

This data set has shed considerable light on dramatic inequalities in faculty training , placement , and scholarly productivity [ 6 , 19 , 20 ] .

But , this data set is only a single snapshot of an evolving and expanding system and hence offers few insights into the changing composition and diversity trends within these academic fields .
2,5 abstract|7,16 object|11,16 abstract|19,32 abstract|22,32 abstract|22,25 abstract|26,28 abstract|26,27 abstract|29,32 abstract

In some fields , yearly data on faculty numbers and composition are available in aggregate .
1,3 abstract|4,11 abstract|7,9 quantity|7,8 person|10,11 abstract|14,15 abstract

In computer science , the Computing Research Association ( CRA ) documents trends in the employment of PhD recipients through the annual Taulbee survey of computing departments in North America ( cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey ) .
1,3 abstract|4,8 organization|9,10 organization|12,19 abstract|14,19 abstract|17,19 person|17,18 object|20,30 abstract|22,23 organization|25,30 organization|25,26 abstract|28,30 place|31,32 abstract

Such surveys can provide valuable insight into trends and summary statistics on the scientific workforce but suffer from two key weaknesses .
0,2 abstract|4,15 abstract|7,8 abstract|9,15 abstract|12,15 abstract|18,21 quantity

First , surveys are subject to variable response rates and the misinterpretation of questions or sample frames , which can inject bias into fine-grained analyses [ 21 , 22 ] .
2,3 abstract|6,9 quantity|10,17 abstract|13,14 abstract|15,17 abstract|21,22 abstract|23,25 abstract|25,30 abstract|26,27 abstract|28,29 abstract

Second , aggregate information provides only a high-level view of a field , which can make it difficult to investigate causality [ 23 ] .
2,4 abstract|6,12 abstract|10,12 object|16,17 abstract|18,21 abstract|20,21 abstract|21,24 abstract

For example , differences in recruitment and retention strategies across departments will be washed out by averaging , thereby masking any insights into the efficacy of individual strategies and policies .
0,2 abstract|3,11 abstract|5,9 abstract|5,6 abstract|7,8 abstract|10,11 organization|16,17 abstract|20,30 abstract|23,30 abstract|26,28 abstract|29,30 abstract

Here , we present a novel system , based on a topical web crawler , that can quickly and automatically assemble a full census of an academic field using digital data available on the public World Wide Web .
2,3 person|4,7 abstract|10,14 object|12,13 abstract|21,28 event|25,28 abstract|29,38 abstract|33,38 abstract

This system is efficient and accurate , and it can be adapted to any academic discipline and used for continuous collection .
0,2 abstract|8,9 abstract|13,16 abstract|19,21 abstract

The system is capable of collecting census data for an entire academic field in just a few hours using off-the-shelf computing hardware , a vast improvement over the roughly 1600 hours required to do this task by hand [ 19 ] .

By assembling an accurate census of an entire field from online information alone , this system will facilitate new research on the composition of academic fields by providing access to complete faculty listings , without having to rely on surveys or professional societies .
2,9 object|6,9 abstract|10,13 abstract|14,16 abstract|18,26 abstract|21,26 abstract|24,26 abstract|28,33 abstract|30,33 abstract|39,40 abstract|41,43 organization

This system can also be used longitudinally to study how the workforce ’s composition changes over time , which is particularly valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of policies meant to broaden participation or improve retention of faculty .
0,2 abstract|10,14 abstract|11,13 abstract|16,17 time|24,28 abstract|27,28 abstract|31,32 abstract|34,37 abstract|36,37 person

Finally , applied to many academic fields in parallel , the system can elucidate scientists ’ movement between different disciplines and relate those labor flows to scientific advances .
4,7 abstract|10,12 abstract|14,20 abstract|14,16 person|18,20 abstract|22,25 abstract|23,24 person|26,28 abstract

In short , many important research questions will benefit from the availability of accurate and frequently-recollected census data .

Our study is organized as follows .

Epistemic pollution
0,2 abstract

Agents can rationally choose between experts only if the criteria that distinguish genuine experts from charlatans are common sense or widely known :
0,1 person|5,6 person|8,10 abstract|12,14 person|15,16 person|17,19 abstract

if agents are to satisfy the epistemic conditions on responsibility , they must know what kinds of knowledge they must utilize to guide their selection of sources ( on pain of infinite regress ) .
1,2 person|5,10 abstract|9,10 abstract|11,12 person|14,18 abstract|18,19 person|23,27 abstract|23,24 person|26,27 abstract|31,33 abstract

In fact , many , if not all , the markers of expertise identified by philosophers enjoy widespread recognition .
3,13 abstract|12,13 abstract|15,16 person|17,19 abstract

The fact that these criteria are widely known , however , offers an opportunity to those who would use them for deception , witting or unwitting .
0,8 abstract|3,5 abstract|12,14 abstract|15,16 person|19,20 abstract|21,26 event

Since expertise must be assessed through indirect markers , to mimic the markers of expertise is to mimic expertise [ 17 ] .
1,2 abstract|6,8 abstract|11,15 abstract|14,15 abstract|18,19 abstract

We live in an epistemic environment that is heavily and deliberately polluted by agents who use mimicry and other methods as a means of inflating their pretense to expertise .
0,30 abstract|0,1 person|3,6 place|13,14 person|16,17 abstract|18,20 abstract|25,29 abstract|25,26 person|28,29 abstract

This fact , together with the fact that such deception is widely known to occur , reduces ordinary people ’s trust in expert authority and diminishes their capacity to distinguish reliable from unreliable sources .
0,2 abstract|5,15 abstract|8,10 event|17,24 abstract|17,20 person|22,24 abstract|26,34 abstract|26,27 person|30,31 abstract|32,34 abstract

For instance , those with an interest in deceiving the general public may set up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise , taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions to ensure that people are taken in .
3,21 event|3,12 person|5,12 abstract|9,12 organization|15,17 organization|20,21 abstract|25,35 abstract|29,32 organization|33,35 organization|38,39 person

There are some egregious examples of this practice in the field of health care .
2,14 abstract|6,8 event|9,14 abstract|12,14 abstract

For example , a small number of doctors set up the American College of Pediatricians ( ACPeds ) to advocate socially conservative viewpoints related to child health care .
3,8 quantity|7,8 person|10,15 organization|14,15 person|16,17 organization|20,23 abstract|25,28 abstract|25,26 person

Such an organization is surely permissible , but it has had the unfortunate ( and likely intended ) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large .
0,3 organization|8,9 organization|11,41 abstract|21,26 event|23,26 abstract|28,29 person|32,34 organization|36,41 abstract

Thus , when ACPeds issued a statement condemning gender reassignment surgery in 2016 [ 21 ] , many people mistook the organization ’s political beliefs for the consensus view among United States pediatricians — although the peak body for pediatric workers , the American Academy of Pediatrics , has a much more positive view of gender dysphoria [ 22 ] .
3,4 organization|5,7 abstract|8,11 event|8,9 abstract|12,13 time|17,19 person|20,25 abstract|20,23 organization|26,33 abstract|30,33 person|30,32 place|35,41 organization|39,41 person|42,47 organization|46,47 abstract|49,57 abstract|55,57 abstract|55,56 abstract

Insofar as the larger organization , with a broader membership base , can be expected to reflect a wider range of expert opinions and a higher degree of expertise , it is reasonable to give its views greater weight than those of the smaller organization .
2,11 organization|7,11 organization|9,10 abstract|17,23 abstract|21,23 abstract|21,22 person|24,29 quantity|28,29 abstract|30,31 event|34,45 event|35,37 abstract|35,36 organization|37,39 abstract|40,45 abstract|42,45 organization

When ACPeds allows or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession , it introduces an epistemic pollutant .
1,2 abstract|5,13 abstract|8,9 abstract|11,13 abstract|14,15 abstract|16,19 abstract

A yet more egregious example of such pollution involved collaborative efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the publishing giant Elsevier to produce publications mimicking peer-reviewed journals in the interest of promoting the companies ’ commercial products [ 23 ] .

The companies hoped to leverage the prestige of Elsevier with these fake journals to endow their promotional “ research ” with an air of reliability .
0,2 organization|5,9 abstract|8,9 organization|10,13 object|15,20 abstract|15,16 organization|21,25 abstract|24,25 abstract

When the deceit was uncovered , however , the effect was just the opposite :
1,3 abstract|8,10 abstract|12,14 abstract

the legitimacy of the published findings was not enhanced through their publication by Elsevier , but rather the legitimacy of Elsevier ’s publications — and , by extension , all academic journals — was diminished through their dissemination of deceptive and commercially interested research .

More recently , institutions of academic expertise have been subject to a large and growing outbreak of so-called predatory journals — journals that will publish almost anything for a fee .
3,7 organization|5,7 abstract|11,20 event|17,20 organization|21,22 organization|25,27 object|28,30 abstract

Once again , this phenomenon has the effect of making peer-reviewed journals appear less legitimate .
3,5 event|6,15 abstract|10,12 organization

At times , even those who work in academia may be unsure of a particular journal ’s legitimacy , and there are genuine borderline cases .
1,2 time|4,5 person|8,9 organization|13,18 abstract|13,17 organization|22,25 abstract

For example , the Frontiers contingent of journals appears legitimate — at least to me — despite the fact that authors are expected to pay a publication fee . 8
3,8 organization|4,5 organization|7,8 object|14,15 person|17,28 abstract|20,21 person|25,28 abstract|26,27 event

Yet some Frontiers journals appear to have engaged in bad behavior , whether for profit or for some other motive .
1,4 object|2,3 organization|9,11 abstract|14,15 abstract|17,20 abstract

Frontiers in Public Health controversially published articles linking vaccines and autism [ 24 ] and questioning the link between HIV and AIDS [ 25 ] .

Whether due to this behavior or not , Jeffrey Beall decided to add the publisher to his influential ( but now sadly unavailable ) list of questionable journals [ 26 ] .
3,5 abstract|8,10 person|13,15 organization|16,28 object|16,17 person|26,28 object

The controversy surrounding Beall ’s decision indicates how difficult it is to make such judgments — even for professionals .
0,2 abstract|3,6 abstract|3,5 person|9,10 event|11,15 event|13,15 abstract|18,19 person

If academics with expertise in relevant fields have difficulty assessing whether particular journals or particular publishers are legitimate , one can not reasonably expect ordinary people to make such judgments .

1,6 abstract|1,2 person|4,6 abstract|15,18 abstract|19,20 person|23,24 person

Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise , it is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions .

Epistemic pollution may stem not only from counterfeit institutions of knowledge production but also from bad behavior by legitimate institutions . 9

For example , pollution may result from attempts to game the systems put in place to track expertise .

Consider institutions with a credentialing function , such as universities , bar associations , or peer review bodies .

These institutions do not exist solely to credential experts .

They have other functions , and these functions may come into conflict , creating pressures to inflate credentials .

For example , universities have a financial incentive to inflate the expertise of their academic staff , thereby increasing their rankings , bringing in grant money , and attracting students .

Systems that assess expertise can be manipulated , and many cases of such manipulation exist — take the recent example by the University of Malaysia , which attempted to boost metrics by urging its faculty to cite one another [ 28 ] .

With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes , researchers suggest that regular practice has a significant influence on improving the performance related to basic visual skills ( Li , Polat , Scalzo , & Bavelier , 2010 ) ; on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously ( Dye & Bavelier , 2010 ; Feng , Spence , & Pratt , 2007 ) ; and on the ability to do more than one task at the same time ( Boot , Kramer , Simons , Fabiani , & Gratton , 2008 ) .

Other studies specifically investigate the use of digital games in the school context and suggest potential for digital game use to improve of student 's attention span at preschool age ( Rueda , Checa , & Cómbita , 2012 ) , to improve overall intelligence capacity of elementary school children ( Miller & Robertson , 2010 ) , and to better performance of working memory ability ( Klingberg et al. , 2005 ; Thorell , Lindqvist , Nutley , Bohlin , & Klingberg , 2009 ) .

Considering the importance of the proper functioning of attention , because of its involvement in the regulation of thoughts and emotions , maintaining the performance of this process is very important , especially in school , where the child must acquire content in an environment full of countless distractors .

4. Discussion .
1,2 abstract

We hypothesized that the children , who were over the age of six at the time of collection , would have adult-like SI interpretations .
0,1 person|3,5 person|9,13 abstract|14,18 time|17,18 event|21,24 abstract|22,23 abstract

We expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments , and would result in adult-like interpretations .
0,1 person|3,9 abstract|6,9 abstract|7,8 abstract|11,16 abstract|14,16 abstract|18,19 person|21,23 abstract|25,28 abstract|33,35 abstract

Further , we posited that if our initial hypothesis was not supported , and in fact there was some non-adult-like performance , that there would be significant variability among the conditions , with cardinal numbers having the highest performance and some the weakest .

On the surface , it does seem as if there is variability and perhaps a larger sample size or more items could lead to a significant finding ( see limitations below ) , but at least for this study , the only significant finding was the difference between cardinal numbers and some .

4.1. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS .
1,2 abstract|3,5 abstract

This study is limited in its power and generalizability .
0,2 abstract|5,9 abstract|5,7 abstract|5,6 abstract|8,9 abstract

It serves as a reminder of the work that needs to be completed for the cross-linguistic study of SI in particular and acquisition more generally .
0,1 abstract|3,8 abstract|6,8 abstract|14,19 abstract|18,19 abstract|22,23 abstract

Bantu languages are not included in studies of acquisition often enough despite the numerous languages in this linguistic grouping and the millions of people using them .
0,2 abstract|6,9 abstract|8,9 abstract|12,19 abstract|16,19 abstract|20,24 person|23,24 person|25,26 abstract

Future studies need to include more participants and more items to increase power .
0,2 abstract|5,7 person|8,10 abstract|12,13 abstract

Future studies should also include a larger age range of children to document the age at which adult-like performance emerges .
0,2 abstract|5,11 abstract|10,11 person|13,15 abstract|17,19 abstract

Related cross-cultural studies have resulted in insufficient statistical power , but interesting trends ( e.g. , Nedwick , 2014 ) .
0,3 abstract|6,9 abstract|11,13 abstract|16,17 person|18,19 time

Follow-up studies with increased stimuli and participants are needed .
0,7 abstract|3,7 abstract

In a future study , it is also important to consider if additional training in the difference between reporting on felicity and truth value judgments would impact results , or if more naturalistic experimental conditions ( e.g. , demonstrating actions using real objects instead of two-dimensional depictions ) would be beneficial .
1,4 abstract|5,6 abstract|9,51 abstract|12,25 abstract|12,25 abstract|15,25 abstract|18,21 abstract|22,25 abstract|27,28 abstract|31,35 abstract|39,40 abstract|41,43 object|45,47 object

Previous studies in this region of sub-Saharan Africa have found evidence of cultural differences in testing behavior ( Hein , Reich , Marks , Thuma , & Grigorenko , 2016 ) .

The current study is too small to make strong conclusions with regard to cultural differences and experimental methods ;
0,3 abstract|8,18 abstract|13,15 abstract|16,18 abstract

however , in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found that children responded more or less frequently based on factors such as stimuli type .
3,9 abstract|6,7 person|8,9 person|9,10 event|13,26 event|13,14 person|21,26 abstract|24,26 abstract|24,25 abstract

In the current study , the responses from two children were not included because they responded the same way to every item through the training and all test items .
1,4 abstract|5,10 abstract|8,10 person|14,15 person|16,19 abstract|20,22 abstract|23,25 abstract|26,29 abstract

More specifically , they answered “ yes ” that the puppet described the pictures well .
3,4 person|6,7 abstract|9,11 object|12,14 object

It is possible that these two children understood the task and really did believe that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions , and in this regard , are not yet adult-like in their SI interpretations .
0,1 event|4,23 event|4,7 person|8,10 abstract|15,17 object|20,23 abstract|34,37 abstract|34,35 person|35,36 abstract

This is unlikely as they said that even the first training item was said well .
0,1 event|4,5 person|8,12 abstract

It is also possible though that these two children were attempting to please the data collectors , or be polite , and that “ yes ” was in some ways a default answer to be provided when having to respond verbally in a test context .
0,1 event|6,45 event|6,9 person|13,16 person|24,25 abstract|30,33 abstract|42,45 abstract|43,44 abstract

Additional training with the methodology could improve outcomes .

The puppets used were picked specifically for this task with careful attention to their appearance .
0,2 object|7,9 abstract|10,15 abstract|13,15 abstract|13,14 object

Upon arrival at the school , however , it became clear that the children were not accustomed to playing with puppets and that the data collection would be a novel experience for them .

Further exploration with greater cardinal number ranges could also prove interesting .
0,7 abstract|3,7 abstract|4,6 abstract

Numbers through five in the participating communities are most often expressed with native Chitonga words while numbers greater than five are typically indicated using English borrowings .
0,7 abstract|2,3 abstract|4,7 organization|12,15 abstract|13,14 abstract|16,20 abstract|19,20 abstract|24,26 abstract

The cardinal numbers included in this study were only one through five in order to avoid additional item variability , but larger numbers should be included in future research .
0,3 abstract|5,7 abstract|8,12 abstract|9,10 abstract|11,12 abstract|16,19 abstract|21,23 abstract|27,29 abstract

5. Conclusion .
1,2 abstract

Albeit limited , these results provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research , but appears to be completed at a later age in this language .
3,5 abstract|7,14 abstract|9,14 abstract|9,10 abstract|12,14 person|17,20 abstract|22,24 abstract|26,28 abstract|35,41 abstract|39,41 abstract

This interesting combination of findings – expected hierarchy of difficulty , but differing age of acquisition – is an important addition to our growing cross-linguistic knowledge of SI and could be the result of language-specific differences in the use of SI lexical items or methodological differences .

1. Introduction
1,2 abstract

Based on the results of the 2011 Household Energy Consumption Survey ( HECS ) , electricity remains as the most common source of energy used by households particularly in the Philippines .

About 87 percent of 21.0 million households used electricity from March to August 2011 .

As of 2016 , the demand for electricity in the residential is leading among the different sectors .

Now that the world is in the age where lighting seems to be a daily necessity , typical homes as shown in figure 1 , consume nearly 27 percent of the energy used today : making lighting as the major source of electricity consumption .

Lighting plays a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy ; it consumes about 18 % of the total generated electricity of total energy consumption in residential sectors as shown in figure 2 [ 2 ] .

The use of correct and appropriate type of light bulb improves the efficiency of energy usage .

There are three general types of lighting that are widely used in the household nowadays : the ( light-emitting diode ) LED bulb , ( compact fluorescent light ) CFL bulb and the incandescent bulb .

But each of them has their perks and perils [ 3 ] .
1,4 object|3,4 object|5,9 abstract|5,6 object|10,11 abstract

Unfortunately , most of the time , people in the residential end up choosing a lamp based on it is price rather than its efficiency and this cause us to pay for our lighting more than necessary .

However , the main problem of CFLs is the mercury they contain .

In addition to the harmful effects of mercury is that it emits Ultraviolet ( UV ) Radiation .

Narrative and Systematic Reviews and Recommendations for the Field
0,4 abstract|5,9 abstract|7,9 abstract

Replication studies are considered by many to play a fundamental role in any scientific endeavor .
0,2 abstract|5,6 person|8,15 abstract|12,15 abstract

When using the same materials and procedures as a previous study , replication studies serve to test the reliability of the previous study ’s findings .
2,11 abstract|8,11 abstract|12,14 abstract|17,25 abstract|20,25 abstract|20,24 abstract

When altering specific methodological or participant characteristics of a previous study , they serve to test generalizability of the earlier findings under different conditions .
2,11 abstract|8,11 abstract|12,13 abstract|16,24 abstract|18,21 abstract|22,24 abstract

One indication of the importance of replication is found in the 50 or more calls for replication research in the field of second language ( L2 ) research alone ( see references for 50 calls and commentaries in Appendix S1 in the Supporting Information online ) : from Santos ( 1989 ) through Polio and Gass 1997 to very recent proposals for specific replication studies , such as Vandergrift and Cross 2017 and even a book-length treatment ( Porte , 2012 ) .

Beyond these calls , efforts to actively promote and facilitate replication studies have also emerged .
1,3 abstract|4,5 abstract|10,12 abstract

For example , the Instruments for Research into Second Languages ( IRIS ) repository ( http://www.irisdatabase.org ) was established in 2011 and holds , at the time of writing , over 3,800 materials that can be used for replication , among other purposes , in L2 research ( Marsden &amp; Mackey , 2014 ; Marsden , Mackey , &amp; Plonsky , 2016 ) .

The Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io ) , also established in 2011 , provides a web infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and has been used for large replication efforts in psychology ( e.g. , Open Science Collaboration , 2015 ) , which continue to make waves in academia ( Laws , 2016 ; Lindsay , 2015 ; Martin &amp; Clarke , 2017 ) and the general media ( Baker , 2015 ; Devlin , 2016 ) .

In some fields , a flourishing metascience , that is , the scientific study of science ( see Munafò et al. , 2017 ) , has included syntheses assessing the quantity and nature of replication efforts , for example , in education ( Makel &amp; Plucker , 2014 and in psychology ( Makel et al. , 2012 ) .

The driving force behind this battery of calls , commentaries , infrastructure , and metascience is a perceived crisis in the state of replication research .
0,15 abstract|4,15 abstract|7,8 abstract|9,10 abstract|11,12 abstract|14,15 abstract|16,25 abstract|20,25 abstract|23,25 abstract

The severe concerns underpinning the alleged crisis have several dimensions relating to : (a) the ( small ) amount of published replication research ; (b) the ( poor ) quality of replication research ; and (c) the ( lack of ) reproducibility , which refers to the extent to which findings can ( not ) be reproduced in replication attempts that have been undertaken .

These concerns speak to the very core of science , raising fundamental questions about the validity and reliability of our work .
0,2 abstract|4,9 abstract|8,9 abstract|11,21 abstract|14,21 abstract|19,21 abstract|19,20 person

Indeed , some commentators have called replication the “ gold standard ” of research evidence ( Jasny , Chin , Chong , &amp; Vignieri , 2011 , p. 1225 ) and a “ linchpin of the scientific process ” ( Let ’s replicate , 2006 , p. 330 ) .

In the field of L2 research , given the importance of replication and the 50 calls for replication in L2 research that we identified , one might expect a substantial number of published replication studies by now .

However , a perceived lack of prestige , excitement , and originality of replication plagues L2 research ( Porte , 2012 ) , as it does other disciplines ( Berez-Kroeker et al. , 2017 ; Branco , Cohen , Vossen , Ide , &amp; Calzolari , 2017 ; Chambers , 2017 ; Schmidt , 2009 ) , and these perceptions are thought to have caused , at least in part ( directly or indirectly ) , alleged low rates and a poor quality of published replication studies .
2,14 abstract|6,7 abstract|8,9 abstract|11,12 abstract|13,14 abstract|15,17 abstract|18,19 person|20,21 time|24,25 abstract|26,28 abstract|29,30 person|31,32 person|33,34 time|35,36 person|37,38 person|39,40 person|41,42 person|44,45 person|46,47 time|48,49 organization|50,51 time|52,53 person|54,55 person|58,60 abstract|76,79 abstract|80,87 abstract|84,87 abstract

However , a systematic metascience on replication research has not yet been established in the field of L2 research , leaving a poor understanding of the actual number and nature of replication studies that have been published .
0,38 abstract|2,8 abstract|6,8 abstract|14,19 abstract|21,33 abstract|25,33 abstract|31,33 abstract

The current study begins to address this gap through narrative and systematic reviews .
0,3 abstract|6,8 abstract|9,13 abstract

The narrative review considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology , given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in L2 research , and also from education , another key sister discipline .
0,3 abstract|4,8 abstract|6,8 abstract|13,14 abstract|15,16 abstract|17,18 abstract|21,28 abstract|27,28 abstract|32,34 abstract|38,39 abstract|40,44 abstract

The narrative review is organized around four broad themes : (a) the quantity of replication research , (b) the nature of replication research , (c) the relationship between initial and replication studies , and (d) the interpretation and extent of reproducibility of the findings of initial studies .
0,3 abstract|6,9 abstract|11,16 abstract|14,16 abstract|18,23 abstract|21,23 abstract|25,32 abstract|28,29 abstract|30,32 abstract|35,47 abstract|40,47 abstract|42,47 abstract|45,47 abstract

To gain insight into these issues in the context of L2 research , the systematic review provides a synthesis of L2 studies in journal articles that self-labeled as replications .
2,6 abstract|4,6 abstract|7,12 abstract|10,12 abstract|13,16 abstract|17,25 abstract|20,25 abstract|23,25 abstract|28,29 abstract

The research questions and methods of the systematic review were largely determined by the narrative review but also emerged through the design and piloting of the coding instrument .
0,9 abstract|6,9 abstract|13,16 abstract|20,28 abstract|25,28 abstract

Finally , we offer further discussion and 16 recommendations for future replication work that draw on our narrative and systematic reviews and on our experience of carrying out multisite ( Morgan-Short et al. , 2018 ) 1 and single site ( Faretta-Stutenberg &amp; Morgan-Short , 2011 ; Marsden , Williams , &amp; Liu , 2013 ; McManus &amp; Marsden , 2017 ; Morgan-Short , Heil , Botero-Moriaty , &amp; Ebert , 2012 ) replications .

We start from the widely agreed premise that testing the reproducibility of findings should have an essential role in the testing and refinement of theory , at least for hypothesis-testing epistemologies that seek to ascertain generalizability and for other epistemologies in which constructs are deemed to be definable and observable .

Thus , our overall aim is to provide conceptual clarification and an empirical base for future discussion and production of replication studies , with a view to improving the amount and quality of L2 replication research .

A Comparative Discourse Analysis of Fan Responses to Game of Thrones

It is no exaggeration to say that HBO ’s Game of Thrones is more than just a television series or a successful brand :
0,1 event|3,4 abstract|4,23 event|7,12 abstract|7,9 organization|11,12 abstract|16,19 abstract|17,18 abstract|20,23 abstract

it is a transmedia system in the sense first used by Marsha Kinder ( 1991 ) and popularized by Henry Jenkins ( 2006 ) , in which media-hopping networks of intertextualities extend the “ storyworld ” of an original production .

Now spanning six seasons and 60 episodes , with an average global viewership ( from its most recent season ) of 25.1 million viewers per episode ( Shepherd , 2016 ) , it has spawned five video games , a graphic novel adaptation , several companion books , two rap albums , a 28-city orchestral tour , a wide variety of tabletop games , toys , merchandise and mobile apps , and countless podcasts , fanfics and other fan-based creations .

Given the volume of content this represents , it is easy to forget that the television series itself is an adaptation of a book series with a pre-existing fandom .

As such , the Game of Thrones storyworld represents a remarkably rich and challenging environment for fans old and new , who must negotiate an increasingly complex network of paratexts and intertexts in order to fully engage with its narratives .

In this sense , fans of the series represent an emerging model for cultural consumption that should be carefully explored .
4,8 person|6,8 abstract|9,15 abstract|13,15 abstract

Transmedia systems , like that exemplified by Game of Thrones , are becoming increasingly prevalent ( e.g. , Star Wars , Harry Potter , The Walking Dead , the Marvel Cinematic Universe , etc ) ;
0,2 abstract|7,10 abstract|18,20 abstract|21,23 abstract|24,27 abstract|28,32 abstract

these systems demonstrate , in microcosm , the global challenge of managing the fire-hose flow of information in contemporary postdigital society .
0,2 abstract|7,21 abstract|12,17 abstract|16,17 abstract|18,21 abstract

The study of how people , as fans , access and manage information within a transmedia system provides valuable insight that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars of the media industry , but to the wider context of cultural studies , by offering findings on this new model of the fan as consumer and information-user .

One of the most dramatic plot developments in the source material ( Martin , 2000 ) was adapted to the screen in the penultimate episode of the third season , “ The Rains of Castamere ” ( Benioff & Weiss , 2013 ) .

Readers of the book series had long anticipated and dreaded the events of the “ Red Wedding ” , while fans of the show unfamiliar with Martin ’s narrative were largely taken unawares by the pivotal episode .

What results are two completely separate reviews of “ The Rains of Castamere ” which in turn document the fans ’ reactions to the episode in the form of user comment threads :

one comment thread where fans were expected to be shocked by the outcome of the episode and one comment thread where fans had hotly anticipated it .

As a pilot project , the current work takes the content of both comment threads — a corpus of approximately 5,600 comments — and analyzes each thread separately using a qualitative coding method aligned with constructivist grounded theory ( Charmaz , 2006 ) .

Together Bernoulli and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids .

In particular , they wanted to know about the relationship between the speed at which blood flows and its pressure .

To investigate this , Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid 's pressure in the pipe .

Daniel realised that in a similar way , a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure .
0,1 person|4,7 abstract|8,17 abstract|8,11 substance|12,15 abstract|12,13 substance|16,17 abstract

Mathematically this law is now written : ½ ρ u 2 + P = constant where P is pressure , ρ is the density of the fluid and u is its velocity .

A consequence of this law is that if the velocity increases then the pressure falls .

The pressure in this area is lower than that under the wing , so the wing is pushed upwards by the relatively higher pressure under the wing .

Around 4 July 1831 , Poisson declared Galois ' work " incomprehensible " , declaring that " [ Galois ' ] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor " ; however , the rejection report ends on an encouraging note : " We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion .

It is unsurprising , in the light of his character and situation at the time , that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter , and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier .

Apparently , however , Galois did not ignore Poisson 's advice , as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison , and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832 , [ 12 ] after which he was somehow talked into a duel . [ 8 ]

Some archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was a Mademoiselle Stéphanie-Félicie Poterin du Motel , [ 18 ] the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life .

0,5 abstract|2,5 abstract|4,5 person|8,10 person|12,19 abstract|17,19 abstract|17,18 person|31,32 abstract

The letters hint that Mlle. du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois , and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf .

Much more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois ' biographers ( most notably by Eric Temple Bell in Men of Mathematics ) , such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy . [ 14 ]

On the other hand , extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent ( identified by the initials " L. D.

Given the conflicting information available , the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history .
1,5 abstract|6,12 abstract|10,12 person|10,11 person|17,18 abstract

Whatever the reasons behind the duel , Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament , the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas , and three attached manuscripts .

The stories of her mature period ( 1894 – 96 ) were not only marked by her experience living near the red-light district and greater concern over the plight of women , but also by the influence of Ihara Saikaku , a 17th-century writer , whose stories she had recently discovered .

Theories
0,1 abstract

Nida has been a pioneer in the fields of translation theory and linguistics .
0,1 person|3,13 person|6,13 abstract|9,11 abstract|12,13 abstract

His Ph.D. dissertation , A Synopsis of English Syntax , was the first full-scale analysis of a major language according to the " immediate-constituent " theory .
0,3 object|0,1 person|1,2 abstract|4,9 object|7,9 abstract|7,8 abstract|11,26 abstract|16,19 abstract|21,26 abstract

His textbook Morphology : The Descriptive Analysis of Words was one of the major works of American Structuralism .
0,2 object|0,1 person|2,9 object|2,3 abstract|4,9 abstract|8,9 object|10,18 object|16,18 abstract

It remained the only thorough introduction to the field for decades and is still valuable for its many examples and exercises .
0,1 object|2,9 object|7,9 abstract|10,11 time|16,21 abstract|16,17 object

His most notable contribution to translation theory is Dynamic Equivalence , also known as Functional Equivalence .
0,7 abstract|0,1 person|5,7 abstract|8,10 abstract|14,16 abstract

For more information , see " Dynamic and formal equivalence . "
1,3 abstract|6,10 abstract

Nida also developed the componential analysis technique , which split words into their components to help determine equivalence in translation ( e.g. " bachelor " = male + unmarried ) .
0,1 person|3,7 abstract|10,11 object|12,14 abstract|12,13 object|17,20 abstract|23,24 person|26,29 person

This is , perhaps , not the best example of the technique , though it is the most well-known .
0,1 abstract|6,12 abstract|10,12 abstract|14,15 abstract

Nida 's dynamic-equivalence theory is often held in opposition to the views of philologists who maintain that an understanding of the source text ( ST ) can be achieved by assessing the inter-animation of words on the page , and that meaning is self-contained within the text ( i.e. much more focused on achieving semantic equivalence ) .
0,4 abstract|0,2 person|10,14 abstract|13,14 person|17,23 abstract|20,23 abstract|24,25 abstract|31,38 abstract|34,38 abstract|36,38 object|41,42 abstract|45,47 abstract|54,56 abstract

This theory , along with other theories of correspondence in translating , are elaborated in his essay Principles of Correspondence , where Nida begins by asserting that given that " no two languages are identical , either in the meanings given to corresponding symbols or in the ways in which symbols are arranged in phrases and sentences , it stands to reason that there can be no absolute correspondence between languages .
0,2 abstract|5,11 abstract|8,9 abstract|15,17 object|15,16 person|17,20 object|19,20 abstract|22,23 person|31,33 abstract|38,44 abstract|42,44 abstract|46,57 abstract|50,51 abstract|54,57 object|54,55 object|56,57 object|67,69 abstract|70,71 abstract

Hence , there can be no fully exact translations . "
7,9 abstract

While the impact of a translation may be close to the original , there can be no identity in detail .
1,6 event|4,6 abstract|10,12 abstract|17,20 abstract

Nida then sets forth the differences in translation , as he would account for it , within three basic factors :
0,1 person|4,8 abstract|7,8 abstract|10,11 person|14,15 abstract|17,20 abstract

The nature of the message :
0,5 abstract|3,5 abstract

in some messages the content is of primary consideration , and in others the form must be given a higher priority .
1,3 abstract|3,5 abstract|7,9 abstract|12,13 abstract|13,15 abstract|18,21 abstract

The purpose of the author and of the translator :
0,9 abstract|3,5 person|7,9 person

to give information on both form and content ;
2,3 abstract|4,8 abstract|5,6 abstract|7,8 abstract

to aim at full intelligibility of the reader so he / she may understand the full implications of the message ;
3,8 abstract|6,8 person|9,10 person|11,12 person|14,20 abstract|18,20 abstract

for imperative purposes that aim at not just understanding the translation but also at ensuring no misunderstanding of the translation .
1,3 abstract|9,11 abstract|16,20 abstract|18,20 abstract

The type of audience :
0,4 abstract|3,4 person

prospective audiences differ both in decoding ability and in potential interest .
0,2 person|5,7 abstract|9,11 abstract

Nida brings in the reminder that while there are no such things as " identical equivalents " in translating , what one must in translating seek to do is find the " closest natural equivalent " .
0,1 person|3,5 abstract|21,22 person|30,36 abstract

Here he identifies two basic orientations in translating based on two different types of equivalence :
1,2 person|3,8 abstract|10,15 abstract|14,15 abstract

Formal Equivalence ( F-E ) and Dynamic Equivalence ( D-E ) .
0,11 abstract|0,2 abstract|3,4 abstract|6,8 abstract|9,10 abstract

F-E focuses attention on the message itself , in both form and content .
0,1 abstract|2,3 abstract|4,6 abstract|6,7 abstract|9,13 abstract|10,11 abstract|12,13 abstract

Such translations then would be concerned with such correspondences as poetry to poetry , sentence to sentence , and concept to concept .
0,2 abstract|7,22 abstract|8,9 abstract|10,11 abstract|12,13 abstract|14,15 object|16,17 object|19,20 abstract|21,22 abstract

Such a formal orientation that typifies this type of structural equivalence is called a " gloss translation " in which the translator aims at reproducing as literally and meaningfully as possible the form and content of the original .
0,4 abstract|6,11 abstract|13,17 abstract|20,22 person|31,38 abstract|31,33 abstract|34,38 abstract|36,38 abstract

The principles governing an F-E translation would then be : reproduction of grammatical units ; consistency in word usage ; and meanings in terms of the source context .

Theodorus of Tabennese ( c. 314 – 368 ) , also known as Abba Theodorus and Theodore the Sanctified was the spiritual successor to Pachomius and played a crucial role in preventing the first Christian cenobitic monastic federation from collapsing after the death of its founder .

Biography

According to hagiography , Theodorus was born into a wealthy Christian family and was well educated from a young age .
2,3 abstract|4,5 person|8,12 organization|17,20 abstract

Early in life he denied the excesses of his parents , and at the age of fourteen joined a monastery in the diocese of Sne , near the modern town of Esna , Egypt .

A brother from Theodorus ’ monastery stayed with Pachomius in Tabennese while traveling and preached of the virtues of the Koinonia upon his return to Sne .

Praying and weeping , Theodorus became determined that his destiny lay with Pachomius .
4,5 person|8,10 abstract|8,9 person|12,13 person

Although initially denied passage to Tabennese by a Pachomian monk due to his wealthy background , Theodorus opted to follow the visiting monk , and his persistence ( and lack of obedience ) paid off .

He was welcomed by Pachomius upon his arrival , and quickly integrated into the community at Tabennese around 328 .
0,1 person|4,5 person|6,8 event|6,7 person|13,17 organization|16,17 place|18,19 time

Quickly becoming a favorite of Pachomius , Theodorus lived an enviably ascetic life in the monastery , and took on the title of the " brothers ’ comforter " .
5,6 person|7,8 person|9,13 abstract|14,16 place|20,29 abstract|25,27 person

Theodorus asserted his influence openly ( which resulted in reprimands from Pachomius ) and generally maintained himself as a prominent figure at Tabennese for several years , despite never being given a position of power in the monastic hierarchy .

Finally , Pachomius called on him to preach to the brothers despite his youth , and eventually appointed him steward of Tabennese after several new monasteries had been built .

Retiring to the monastery of Phbow , Pachomius gave Theodorus complete control over Tabennese , though recalled him from the position after witnessing several monks under Theodorus ’ watch violating the monastic rules without reprimand .

Having failed to prove his governing ability and once more in a position no higher than when he had entered the monastery , Theodorus became a personal assistant to Pachomius and remained relatively quiet for some years .

Despite his clear potential and popularity , Pachomius refused to grant Theodorus any kind of authority ; though the old man 's failing health soon changed things forever .

After Theodorus had been assisting Pachomius at Tabennese for several years following his demotion , Pachomius became very ill and seemed to be on the verge of death .

Pachomius had not named a successor , and several brothers pleaded with Theodorus to assert himself as head of the Koinonia when the sickly man died .

Despite the assertion that Theodorus apparently did not want the rank of a father or this world 's glory , he consented .

Unfortunately for the would-be leader , Pachomius recovered , and upon hearing of Theodorus ’ decision , exiled the ambitious young man .

After living a life of constant weeping and prayer in solitude , Pachomius forgave Theodorus and allowed him to live among the brothers once more .

In 348 Pachomius died , naming the brother Petronios as his successor rather than the clearly qualified Theodorus .

Although it seems Theodorus practiced complete submission to the new leader of the Koinonia , problems soon arose in several Pachomian monasteries that viewed Horsiesios as a weak leader .

Refusing to work or communicate and demanding a new leader , many of the elder monks completely abandoned any notion of obedience to Horsiesios .

The federation of monasteries was falling apart , and Theodorus rushed to Tabennese to placate the rebels .

For eighteen years Theodorus administered from Pachomius ’ old headquarters in Phbow , using techniques far more assertive than his predecessors , such as constantly shuffling the offices and locations of the most ambitious monks .

Introduction
0,1 abstract

I


The Chemical Wedding by Christian Rosencreutz is the way I ’ve decided to present the title of this book .
0,6 object|0,3 event|4,6 person|7,9 abstract|9,10 person|14,19 abstract|17,19 object

Most versions in English are called The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz , which suggests ( and most people who ’ve heard of it suppose ) that the wedding is Christian ’s .
0,4 object|3,4 abstract|6,12 abstract|6,9 event|10,12 person|17,24 person|23,24 abstract|27,29 event|30,32 person

It ’s not ; Christian Rosencreutz is the purported author of a book called The Chemical Wedding .
0,1 abstract|4,6 person|8,17 person|11,13 object|14,17 abstract

The actual author is Johann Valentin Andreae , whose name did n’t appear on the book originally , thus ensuring the confusion .
0,3 person|4,7 person|8,10 abstract|14,16 object|20,22 abstract

I ’ll call it herein ( as everyone mostly does ) simply The Chemical Wedding .
0,1 person|3,4 object|7,8 person|12,15 abstract

Though its original readers would have had a certain amount of context for the truly bizarre and surprising events it tells of , it ’s possible that The Chemical Wedding is now more enjoyable without knowing that context , and experiencing the book unmediated .

0,1 person|2,7 place|5,7 animal|10,19 plant|13,19 place|17,19 place

We then housed the ants in nests I made using Y-tong [ aerated concrete ] .

We then drilled a tunnel to a pot ( the foraging arena ) , where the ants got the choice between the food with medicine and the food without .

After exposing the ants to the fungus , we took pictures of each foraging arena three times per day , and counted how many ants were present on each food-source .

This gave us the data that ants choose more medicine after they have been infected .
0,1 abstract|2,3 person|3,5 abstract|6,7 animal|8,10 substance|11,12 animal

The result that healthy ants die sooner when ingesting ROS [ Reactive Oxygen Species , the group of chemicals that includes hydrogen peroxide ] but infected ants die less was obtained in another way ( as you have to ' force feed ' the ROS , as healthy ants , when given the choice , ignore that food-source . )

1,2 abstract|2,3 person|5,6 place|7,9 object|11,12 substance|13,14 substance|17,19 time

This gives us the data to do a so-called survival analysis .

By adding certain chemicals , the ROS can be measured using the emission of light of a certain wave-length .

How reliable do you consider your results to be ?
3,4 person|5,7 abstract|5,6 person

The results we got are very reliable .
0,2 abstract|2,3 person

We had a lot of colonies containing a lot of ants , and wherever possible we conducted the experiment blind .
0,1 person|5,6 place|10,11 animal|15,20 event|15,16 person|17,19 event

This means the experimenter does n't know which ants belong to which treatment , so it 's impossible to influence the results with ' observer bias ' .
0,1 abstract|2,4 person|7,9 animal|11,13 abstract|20,22 abstract|24,26 abstract|24,25 person

However , of course this is proof in just one species .

It is hard to extrapolate to other ants , as different species lead very different lives .

In fact you can ask questions about why it should ever have existed , but now why should it exist .
2,3 person|5,6 abstract|8,9 organization|18,19 organization

I mean the theory was , whether you believe it or not , that it would be a defensive alliance against potential Soviet aggression , that ’s the basic doctrine .

Well there ’s no defense against Soviet aggression , so whether you believe that doctrine or not that ’s gone .
4,8 abstract|6,8 abstract|11,12 person|13,15 abstract|17,18 abstract

When the Soviet Union collapsed there had been an agreement , a recent agreement , between Gorbachev and the U.S government and the first Bush administration .
1,4 organization|8,10 event|11,14 event|16,17 person|18,21 organization|19,20 place|22,26 organization|24,25 person

0,2 event|4,5 person|7,11 event|12,13 person|16,19 place|20,24 organization

Now it is remarkable in the light of history , the history of the past century , Germany alone had virtually destroyed Russia , twice , and Germany backed by a hostile military alliance , centered in the most phenomenal military power in history , that ’s a real threat .

Nevertheless he agreed , but there was a quid pro quo , namely that NATO should not expand to the east , so Russia would at least have a kind of security zone .
1,2 person|7,11 event|14,15 organization|19,21 place|23,24 organization|29,33 place

And George Bush and James Baker , secretary of state , agreed that NATO would not expand one inch to the east .

Gorbachev also proposed a nuclear free weapons zone in the region , but the U.S would n’t consider that .

Well one of the first things he did was to back down on the promise of not expanding NATO to the east .
1,8 abstract|6,7 person|13,22 abstract|18,19 organization|20,22 place

Well that ’s a significant threat to the Soviet Union , to Russia now that there was no longer any Soviet Union , it was a significant threat to Russia and not surprisingly they responded by beefing up their offensive capacity , not much but some .

0,1 organization|2,12 person|4,12 person|7,12 place|8,11 place|13,19 substance|20,21 abstract

The beverage was inspired by the santorum neologism coined in advice columnist Dan Savage 's column Savage Love in response to comments made by former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum about homosexuality ;

Although I am sure that being there would enhance my understanding of the animals and the system in which they live , and would help me formulate more and better questions about the anemones , ship time is expensive , especially in Antarctica , and if there are biologists whose contribution is predicated on being there , they should have priority to be there .

What we could do , however , was to study anatomy and figure out what it is , so that when we have samples preserved for studying e.g. , the genome , transcriptome , or metabolome , or conduct tests of the fluid in the burrows or in the animals themselves , we can make precise comparisons , and figure out what these animals have or do ( metabolically or chemically ) that lets them live where they live .

For our readers who are unaware of your site , could you briefly explain what wikiHow is ?
1,3 person|7,9 organization|7,8 person|11,12 person|15,16 organization

Sure .


wikiHow is a collaborative effort to build the world 's largest , highest quality how-to manual .
0,1 organization|2,16 abstract|5,16 abstract|7,16 object

Our long term goal is to produce practical instructions on almost every topic in every language .
0,4 event|0,1 organization|7,16 abstract|11,13 abstract|14,16 abstract

We 're quite far from our goals currently , but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger
0,1 organization|5,7 event|5,6 organization|10,11 organization|14,16 abstract|17,25 abstract|19,20 organization

We currently have just under 50000 articles and over 1000 featured articles .
0,1 organization|3,7 abstract|8,12 abstract

We hope that in time , we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status .
0,1 organization|2,19 event|6,7 organization|9,12 object|13,16 object|17,19 abstract

That said , we are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve .
3,4 organization|10,12 event|14,15 time

However , in terms of readership , we are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia .
5,6 person|7,8 organization|10,18 organization|17,18 organization

We get over 14 million unique visitors per month ( source : Google Analytics ) , which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast .
0,1 organization|3,9 person|12,14 organization|18,19 organization|19,24 organization|26,27 organization

[ Note : The interview took place just before the 50000 milestone was met ]
3,5 event|9,12 event

Like Wikipedia , wikiHow is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software .
1,2 organization|3,4 organization|5,7 place|10,12 object

Our community is full of volunteers from all over the world .
0,2 organization|0,1 organization|5,6 person|9,11 place

That said , we are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects :
3,4 organization|8,9 organization

We are much smaller .
0,1 organization

The English wikiHow has only 60 admins , compared to the 1000 + on English Wikipedia .
0,3 place|4,7 person|10,13 person|14,16 abstract

As a result , wikiHow is still at the size that every editor eventually gets to know other editors .
4,5 organization|8,10 abstract|11,13 person|17,19 person

We are run as a Hybrid Organization - a for-profit company focused on achieving a social good .
0,17 abstract|0,1 organization|4,7 organization|8,17 organization|14,17 abstract

This has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the non-profit structure at the Wikimedia Foundation .
0,1 abstract|3,4 abstract|5,6 abstract|9,12 abstract|13,16 organization

We show opt-out advertising to anonymous visitors rather than ask for donations .
0,1 organization|2,4 abstract|5,7 person|11,12 object

Our advertising revenue funds community meetups and has even allowed us to donate over $ 60,000 to charities such as the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons .

In addition , we 've used our revenue on things like buying carbon offsets to become carbon neutral .

1,2 place

Our community culture is focused on wikiLove and civility .
0,3 abstract|0,1 organization|6,7 abstract|8,9 abstract

As a result some folks believe wikiHow is a more humane and enjoyable place to work than other places online .
3,5 person|6,7 organization|8,16 place|17,20 place

Why did you decide to create wikiHow ?
2,3 person|6,7 organization

I think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person .
0,1 person|4,5 person|6,9 abstract|10,16 abstract|19,21 person

Imagine having detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do any activity you could imagine .
2,14 abstract|9,11 abstract|11,12 person

How much more could you accomplish as an individual if you could learn any activity ?
4,5 person|10,11 person|13,15 abstract

I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world .
0,1 person|4,8 object|10,16 object|14,16 place

Knowledge is power and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful .
0,1 abstract|2,3 abstract|4,5 organization|6,8 abstract|10,13 person

I 've been interested in building a comprehensive how-to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow .
0,1 person|7,10 object|12,13 person|15,16 organization

My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow .
0,3 event|0,1 person|5,7 object|8,10 place|10,11 person|15,16 abstract

eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world .
0,1 place|6,15 place

eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software .
0,1 place|2,4 abstract|6,8 abstract

When I ran eHow , the content was professionally produced and edited .
1,2 person|3,4 place|5,12 abstract|5,7 abstract

This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets .
0,3 abstract|6,7 abstract|8,17 abstract|12,13 person|19,22 abstract

However , paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices .
2,9 abstract|3,4 person|12,13 person|16,20 abstract

You either 1 ) sacrifice on breadth and do n't produce the topics that wo n't interest advertisers , or 2 ) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that does n't cost much to write .
0,1 person|4,18 abstract|6,7 abstract|11,13 abstract|17,18 person|22,36 abstract|22,23 person|25,26 abstract|28,29 abstract

I was n't interested in making either of these sacrifices , as I think the world 's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive .
0,1 person|6,10 abstract|12,13 person|14,20 object

So ultimately I decided that eHow 's model would not build the resource I envisioned .
2,3 person|5,8 abstract|5,7 place|11,13 object|13,14 person

When I discovered Wikipedia , I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs .
1,2 person|3,4 organization|5,6 person|8,11 abstract|16,23 object

So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow .
1,2 person|5,6 place|8,10 abstract|12,13 organization

Why did you decide to use a Creative Commons license ?
2,3 organization|6,10 abstract

We use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork ) .
0,1 organization|2,6 abstract|8,10 organization|8,9 organization|10,14 abstract|15,16 place

In my opinion , people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the " right to leave . "
1,3 abstract|1,2 person|4,5 person|11,12 abstract|13,14 person|16,21 abstract

If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction , they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere .
0,28 abstract|1,3 person|1,2 organization|4,6 organization|4,5 organization|13,14 person|16,19 abstract|20,23 abstract|25,27 abstract

This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license .
0,1 abstract|4,5 organization|6,10 abstract|11,16 abstract|18,20 abstract|18,19 organization|21,25 abstract

This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow , the company , will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community .
0,4 abstract|6,7 organization|8,10 organization|14,23 abstract|17,19 abstract|20,23 person|20,21 organization

I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far .
0,1 person|4,8 abstract|10,16 abstract|14,15 organization

My hope is that over time , internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others .
0,1 person|7,9 person|11,12 abstract|13,15 place|18,20 time|18,19 person|25,28 abstract|27,28 person

That said , when we started out I did n't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver 's license .
4,5 organization|7,8 person|14,19 abstract|20,25 object|20,21 person

As a result , we made some mistakes along the path .
4,5 organization|6,11 abstract

In retrospect , I think we probably should have selected the CC BY-SA license instead of CC-BY-SA-NC .
3,4 person|5,6 organization|10,14 abstract|16,17 abstract

At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects .
3,4 abstract|6,16 abstract|10,12 place|13,16 organization

wikiHow now has millions of visitors per month .
0,1 organization|3,8 person

How did you grow the site to the size it is today ?
2,3 person|4,6 organization|7,9 quantity|9,10 abstract|11,12 time

In December 2008 , wikiHow had over 14 million unique visitors according to Google Analytics ( Full data : http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics ) .
1,3 time|4,5 organization|6,11 person|13,15 organization

Quantcast ranks wikiHow as the 135th most popular site in the US .
0,1 organization|2,3 organization|5,9 organization|10,12 place

( http://www.quantcast.com/wikihow.com ) .


wikiHow achieved this popularity for a few reasons .
0,1 organization|2,4 abstract|5,8 abstract

First , people around the world are desperate for high quality how-to information .
0,13 abstract|9,13 abstract

People want to learn more practical skills , and for the most part the internet does n't provide enough quality information yet .
4,7 abstract|13,15 abstract|18,21 abstract

Second , we attracted millions of readers via the virtuous circle of wiki editing : We had some articles of mixed quality , and editors joined to improve those articles , which in turn attracted more readers .
0,37 abstract|2,3 organization|4,7 person|8,14 abstract|15,16 organization|17,22 abstract|24,25 person|28,30 abstract|35,37 person

We continue to depend on this same virtuous cycle : More readers , means more editors , which creates better instructions , leading again to more readers .
0,1 organization|5,9 abstract|10,12 person|14,16 person|19,21 abstract|25,27 person

It is the same virtuous circle that Wikipedia has enjoyed .

Why do you think the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US compared to other countries like Australia , the United Kingdom and even Canada ?
2,3 person|4,7 organization|12,14 place|16,18 place|19,20 place|21,24 place|26,27 place

Sports in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society .
0,5 abstract|2,5 place|7,13 abstract|12,13 abstract

It emphasizes consumerism , the belief that success always goes to people who merit it due to their abilities , dedication and qualifications , and reinforces , rather than changes , existing ideas related to gender , ethnicity and nationality .
0,1 abstract|2,3 abstract|4,23 abstract|7,8 abstract|11,12 person|14,15 abstract|17,18 person|31,40 abstract

Paralympic sport brings attention to athletes who are typically overlooked in American society because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people who are disabled .
0,2 abstract|5,6 person|11,13 abstract|17,19 person|25,26 person

Although disability is not contagious , interest in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males following it .
1,2 abstract|8,10 abstract|14,21 abstract|20,21 abstract

Disabled athletes also challenge existing relations of power by displaying dedication , hard work and perseverance in different contexts than those most sports fans are accustomed to .
0,2 person|4,8 abstract|10,11 abstract|12,14 abstract|15,16 abstract|17,19 abstract|20,21 abstract|22,24 person

Other countries , including the ones you mention , have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society .
0,2 place|4,6 place|10,13 abstract|14,18 abstract|17,18 abstract

Even though legislative support may be less strong than the one provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act , many social institutions including the media are more receptive to this form of diversity .
2,4 abstract|9,11 abstract|14,18 abstract|16,17 abstract|23,25 organization|29,33 abstract

What do you think the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be with the Games being televised live in the United States for first time ?
2,3 person|4,6 abstract|9,12 organization|15,17 event|17,27 event|21,24 place

The impact depends on a number of aspects .
0,2 abstract|4,8 abstract

One of them is the channels that NBC as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use to air the Paralympic Games on .
0,3 abstract|2,3 abstract|4,6 place|7,17 organization|10,13 organization|14,17 place|21,24 event

Will they be shown nationally or regionally , on NBC or on any of the company ’s multiple cable networks ?
1,2 event|9,10 place|14,20 place|14,17 organization

A second aspect is the parts or hours of the day the Paralympics will be shown .
0,3 abstract|4,11 abstract|11,13 event

Remember that there is a nine-hour difference between Sochi and New York , and a 12-hour difference between Sochi and the US West Coast .
4,12 time|8,9 place|10,12 place|14,24 time|18,19 place|20,24 place|21,22 place

So daytime events will be shown live in the United States in the middle of the night , and evening prime-time events will be shown — indeed live — in the morning U.S. time .
1,3 event|8,11 place|19,22 event|32,33 place

So showing the Paralympics live on United States television might turn out to be less glamorous than it appears .
1,9 event|2,4 event|6,9 abstract|6,8 place

A third important factor is the way the event will be mediated : will NBC have its best sports broadcasters following the event after having worked the Winter Olympics ?
0,4 abstract|5,7 abstract|7,9 event|14,15 organization|16,20 person|16,17 organization|21,23 event|26,29 event

Will they treat and announce the competitions as they do all others — for better and worse ?
1,2 person|5,7 event|8,9 person|10,12 event

Will they take it as an opportunity to educate viewers about disability and diversity while showing superb athletic performances without engaging in a discourse of pity ?
1,2 person|3,4 event|5,7 event|9,10 person|11,12 abstract|13,14 abstract|16,19 abstract|22,26 abstract

All in all , I think this is a terrific opportunity to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects ; but we will have to wait until after the event to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations .

How do you decide on the stories ?
2,3 person|5,7 object

We do everything backwards here .
0,1 person|2,3 abstract|4,5 organization

We start with the headline and then flesh out the story , as opposed to The New York Times , which writes the issue and then has a headline editor to make it snappy .
0,1 person|3,5 abstract|9,11 abstract|15,19 organization|22,24 abstract|27,30 person|28,29 abstract|32,33 abstract

We start with a joke .
0,1 person|3,5 abstract

We read about six hundred to eight hundred headline ideas on a Monday coming from our staff and a small group of writers outside — a contributing core .
0,1 person|2,10 object|11,13 time|15,24 person|15,17 person|15,16 person|18,24 person|25,28 person

0,1 person|2,3 object|5,7 time|8,11 quantity|14,15 time|17,19 abstract|22,26 person|27,31 person

Then we assign a headline to a specific writer to execute .
1,2 person|3,5 abstract|6,9 person

We go through a number of drafts and then have the editors pick it up and assign the photojournalism aspect of it to our graphic design team , who adds the visual aspect to it .

So you do n’t have writers coming up with a story and headline , but you will instead have a team of writers choosing the best headlines and then assign it to a particular writer who was not necessarily involved ?
1,2 person|5,6 person|9,13 abstract|15,16 person|19,23 person|24,27 abstract|30,31 abstract|32,35 person

Writers will occasionally write their own headlines , but we come up with a list of 15 or 20 headline ideas , what we think will make a good story and then we assign it based upon what people ’s writing strengths are .

0,2 person

What are you going to talk about here in Levico ?
0,10 event|2,3 person|9,10 place

I called it Character , walks and words .
0,1 person|2,3 event|3,8 abstract

There is a whole topic which is called asymptotic groups theory .
2,5 abstract|8,11 abstract|9,10 abstract

There are groups which express the symmetry of some structures .
2,3 abstract|5,10 abstract|8,10 abstract

Studying groups is a bit like studying symmetry .
0,2 event|1,2 abstract|7,8 abstract

It 's very beautiful I think .
0,1 event|4,5 person

And then when you do it in an asymptotic way is like you do n't look at the small details .
2,10 event|3,4 person|5,6 event|7,10 abstract|12,13 person|17,20 abstract

It 's like from the sky .
0,1 event|4,6 abstract

You look at the general patterns .
0,1 person|3,6 abstract

And there is another topic which is very important in mathematics which is called representation theory .
3,5 abstract|10,11 abstract|14,16 abstract

So I will mainly talk about how to use a representation theory to solve all kind of problems and conjectures in asymptotic groups theory .
1,2 person|9,12 abstract|14,20 abstract|17,18 abstract|19,20 abstract|21,24 abstract|22,23 abstract

Why did you choose to study mathematics ?
0,7 event|2,3 person|6,7 abstract

First of all because it was beautiful .
4,5 abstract

When I was ten my father already showed me some stuff in mathematics and the beauty and the imagination was quite apparent .
1,2 person|4,6 person|4,5 person|8,9 person|9,13 abstract|12,13 abstract|14,16 abstract|17,19 abstract

I also like the freedom in mathematics .
0,1 person|3,7 abstract|6,7 abstract

If you study physics or chemistry then you should describe the real world .
1,2 person|3,4 abstract|5,6 abstract|7,8 person|10,13 abstract

But in mathematics you can build your own structures .
2,3 abstract|3,4 person|6,9 abstract|6,7 person

You can walk in worlds created by the imagination of people .
0,1 person|4,11 abstract|7,11 abstract|10,11 person

You 're not committed to the real world .
0,1 person|5,8 abstract

It 's almost like God to some extent .
0,1 abstract|4,5 person

You can create worlds , you can study them .
0,1 person|3,4 abstract|5,6 person|8,9 abstract

I think it 's a combination of the beauty , of the imagination , of the freedom .
0,1 person|2,3 abstract|4,17 abstract|7,9 abstract|11,13 abstract|15,17 abstract

Many people , and many students , dislike math .
0,9 event|0,6 person|0,2 person|4,6 person|8,9 abstract

Why do you think it is so ?
2,3 person|4,5 event

First of all I think maybe they have bad teachers , which is a problem .
3,4 person|6,7 person|8,10 person|13,15 abstract

You have to have very good teachers in mathematics if you really want to enjoy and to succeed in it .
0,1 person|4,7 person|8,9 abstract|10,11 person|19,20 abstract

Probably some people mainly think about the scientific part of it – you have to be accurate - and they see less these elements of the freedom , and the imagination , and creation .
1,3 person|10,11 abstract|12,13 person|19,20 person|22,34 abstract|25,27 abstract|29,31 abstract|33,34 abstract

Maybe they do n't like the precise nature of mathematics .
1,2 person|5,10 abstract|9,10 abstract

Also when I talk mathematics I notice the language is very important in mathematics and I actually notice that many times people fail in mathematics because they do n't know how to write a composition .
2,3 person|4,5 abstract|5,6 person|7,9 abstract|13,14 abstract|15,16 person|21,22 person|24,25 abstract|26,27 person|33,35 abstract

They have ideas but they can not formulate them in the right way .
0,1 person|2,3 abstract|4,5 person|8,9 abstract|10,13 abstract

Actually I find many connections between mathematics and literature because almost all the thing I told about mathematics are also seen in literature and in writing because when you write you can describe the real world , but you can also create worlds of fiction .
1,2 person|3,9 abstract|6,7 abstract|8,9 abstract|10,14 abstract|14,15 person|17,18 abstract|22,23 abstract|25,26 abstract|28,29 person|30,31 person|33,36 abstract|38,39 person|42,45 abstract|44,45 abstract

So you have imagination , you have total freedom , you can invent characters , you can invent all kind of development and surprises and this kind of end of story or another .
1,2 person|3,4 abstract|5,6 person|7,9 abstract|10,11 person|13,14 abstract|15,16 person|18,22 event|23,24 abstract|25,31 event|30,31 abstract|32,33 event

Also the language is important in writing and in literature .
1,3 abstract|6,7 abstract|9,10 abstract

So in a way people often do n't know how to combine the two fields .
4,5 person|12,15 abstract

It could look like almost the opposite : literature is kind of arts and mathematics is science but they also see a lot in common and there where mathematician who were writers .
0,1 abstract|5,7 abstract|8,9 abstract|12,13 abstract|14,15 abstract|16,17 abstract|18,19 abstract|28,29 person|31,32 person

For example the most famous is Lewis Carrol , author of Alice in Wonderland .
6,8 person|9,14 person|11,14 object

You 're not only a mathematician .
0,1 person|4,6 person

You also wrote two collections of short stories and a novel .
0,1 person|3,8 object|9,11 object

Why did you begin to write ?
2,3 person

When I was quite young I was interested in psychoanalysis and in dreams .
1,2 person|5,6 person|9,10 abstract|12,13 abstract

I was trying to interpret my dreams .
0,1 person|5,7 abstract|5,6 person

I started to write down my dreams .
0,7 event|0,1 person|5,7 abstract|5,6 person

And then I noticed that I cheat a little bit when I write them down .
2,3 person|5,6 person|11,12 person|13,14 abstract

Sometimes I make them more pretty then they were actually .
1,2 person|3,4 abstract|7,8 abstract

So instead of documenting the dreams it gradually became also like adding creational elements , and I think that somehow through writing my dreams I gradually came to writing , also poems , but mainly stories .
4,6 abstract|6,7 event|12,14 abstract|16,17 person|22,24 abstract|22,23 person|24,25 person|31,32 abstract|35,36 abstract

I 'm a little bit inspired by dreams but when eventually I started to write more seriously I was more interested in structure which also .. a bit like mathematics in a way .. for example my first book is called Opus 1 .. a collection of four long stories with musical structures .
0,1 person|7,8 abstract|11,12 person|17,18 person|22,23 abstract|29,30 abstract|36,39 object|36,37 person|41,43 abstract|44,53 abstract|51,53 abstract

The first part is called Legato and the second part was called Staccato .
0,3 abstract|5,6 abstract|7,10 abstract|12,13 abstract

In the legato part the sentences are very long and without breaks almost like stream of consciousness .
1,4 abstract|4,6 abstract|11,12 event|14,17 abstract|16,17 abstract

In the staccato part it 's like a music : a lot of break , very very short sentences .
1,4 object|4,5 object|7,9 abstract|10,14 event|15,19 abstract

It was a bit experimenting connections between the language and the music and the psychology of people .
0,1 object|5,17 abstract|7,9 abstract|10,12 abstract|13,17 abstract|16,17 person

In the second book I made another experiment .
1,4 object|4,5 person|6,8 event

It 's a book of opening , Overtures I called it , and there is no end to the stories .
0,1 object|2,6 object|5,6 event|7,8 abstract|8,9 person|10,11 object|16,20 event|18,20 abstract

There are seventy beginning of stories without ends .
2,8 event|5,8 abstract|7,8 event

In the novel Dark Matters I think what interested me in the structure was two thing : simple narrative and email .
1,3 object|3,5 object|5,6 person|9,10 person|11,13 abstract|17,19 abstract|20,21 abstract

It keeps changing between narrative and email .
0,1 object|4,5 abstract|6,7 abstract

Another thing was two different time scapes : one goes very slow and one goes very fast and they almost kind of meet in the end .
0,2 abstract|3,7 abstract|5,7 abstract|8,9 abstract|13,14 abstract|18,19 abstract|24,26 event

It 's a little bit like Achilles and the turtle .
0,1 object|6,10 abstract|6,7 person|8,10 animal

... love story and romance and surprises and tragedies and all this but also this structure interested me a lot .
1,9 abstract|1,3 abstract|4,5 event|6,7 event|8,9 event|10,12 abstract|14,16 abstract|17,18 person

Why did you choose this particular structure ?
2,3 person|4,7 abstract

When I tell stories I do n't like that everything will be clear from the beginning .
1,2 person|3,4 abstract|4,5 person|9,10 abstract|14,16 event

I like that something will be a bit of secret , or even unreliable narrator : someone tells something and first you trust him but then you read more and you become thrilled by everything .
0,1 person|9,10 abstract|13,15 person|16,17 person|21,22 person|23,24 person|26,27 person|30,31 person|34,35 abstract

I think by using emails on the one hand which are more the voice of the woman Eva and narrative which is more the perspective of the man Adam , I kind of confront them , their different perspective and then kind somehow you can see the distortions in the way the story is told .
0,1 person|4,5 abstract|12,18 abstract|15,17 person|17,18 person|19,20 abstract|23,29 abstract|26,28 person|28,29 person|30,31 person|34,35 person|36,39 abstract|36,37 person|43,44 person|46,48 abstract|51,53 abstract

I think that in this kind of structure there is a very gradual clarification of the relationship and the forth going on .

The first challenge that we have before can do any kind of analysis of these interstellar dust particles is simply to find them .
0,3 abstract|4,5 person|9,18 abstract|14,18 object|20,23 abstract|22,23 object

This is a big challenge because they are very small ( order of micron in size ) and are somewhere ( we do n't know where ) on a HUGE collector — at least on the scale of the particle size — about a tenth of a square meter .

Warhol was close to important touchstones of the 1960s , including art , music , consumer culture , fashion , and celebrity worship , which were all buzzwords and images Wikinews observed at USI 's opening exhibit .

The Polaroid format is not what made Warhol famous , however , he is in the company of other well-known photographers who used the camera , such as Ansel Adams , Chuck Close , Walker Evans , Robert Mapplethorpe , and Helmut Newton .

According to Wilkins , Warhol was able to reproduce the Polaroid photograph and create an enlargement of it , which he then could use to commit the image to the silk screen medium by applying paint or manipulating them further .

A research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Colorado State University of the US and the University of Sheffield of the UK has analysed effects of global warming and ozone pollution over 2000 - 2050 on the worldwide production of wheat , rice , maize and soybean .

The scientists found reduction of crop yields by 2050 exceeded 10 % of 2000 levels , substantially decreasing food security , in all cases examined .

the future of ozone pollution is very different [...] leading to either offsetting or reinforcing effects [ of climate change ] on crops " .

By 2050 , undernourishment would increase by either 49 percent or by 27 percent , depending on the scenario .

The study focuses on ozone-temperature covariation : ground-level ozone increases with temperatures .

Heald said although temperature and ozone are separately known to impact crop yields , " nobody has looked at these together " .
0,1 person|3,6 abstract|3,4 substance|5,6 substance|11,13 object|11,12 plant|15,16 person|19,20 abstract

Depending on region and crops , the yields may be primarily sensitive to ozone - in the case of wheat - or heat - in the case of maize - alone , providing a local estimation of relative benefits of climate change adaptation versus ozone regulation .

Democratic society operates according to “ majority rule , minority rights . ”
0,2 abstract|6,8 abstract|6,7 person|9,11 abstract|9,10 person

We should strive for equality , but also practicality .
0,1 person|4,5 abstract|8,9 abstract

Thus , our current gender system should only be tweaked , not radically changed .
2,6 abstract|2,3 person

Societal norms are set by the majority .
0,2 abstract|5,7 person

Since most people are cisgender ( and heterosexual ) , norms reflect that .
1,9 abstract|1,3 person|10,13 abstract|10,11 abstract|12,13 abstract

It ’s neither necessary , possible , nor desirable to erase all gender norms , since they are willingly followed by most .

The vast majority of people , cis or trans , identify as male or female , and have an appearance that matches .

This makes our binary gender assumption norms useful .

Most people want their gender assumed off appearance or else do n’t care ; it ’s only a very few whose appearance does n’t match gender , or identify as a non-binary gender .

Society recognizes disabilities , allergies , and even hard to pronounce names as legitimate .

I generally agree with this , but it is context sensitive .
0,1 person|4,5 event|7,8 event|9,10 abstract

If you are at a venue where you are asked to introduce yourself and your pronouns , it is churlish to refuse to do so , AND in that context it ’s best to ask rather that assume .

1,5 abstract|3,5 abstract|6,8 abstract|6,7 person|12,15 abstract

I would agree wholeheartedly that in certain contexts , this makes sense .
0,1 person|6,8 abstract|9,10 event|11,12 abstract

I think the key is that you ’d be informed about it , like if you ’re going to an LBGT or transgender event , obviously you might want to be more careful .
0,1 person|2,4 abstract|5,12 abstract|6,7 person|11,12 event|15,16 person|19,24 event|26,27 person

If everyone is expected to introduce their pronouns in the venue , then you may as well follow suit .
1,2 person|6,8 abstract|6,7 person|9,11 place|13,14 person

As I ’ve said , though , I do n’t think it would be best to apply this idea society-wide though .
1,2 person|7,8 person|11,12 event|15,20 event|17,19 event

Exactly .


There ’s a time and a place for everything and a majority of people use pronouns based on their assigned gender .

Polygraph and other deception detection devices .
0,1 object|2,6 object|3,5 abstract|3,4 abstract

First , this is not me telling you how to beat polygraph ( poly . )
2,3 abstract|5,6 person|7,8 person|11,12 abstract|13,14 abstract

When taking the test , it is common for the examiner to ask if you have researched how to pass the poly deceptively .
2,4 abstract|5,6 event|8,23 event|9,11 person|14,15 person|20,22 abstract

So , if you read this , understand that I am not going to tell you how to beat the test .
3,4 person|5,6 abstract|9,10 person|13,21 event|15,16 person|19,21 abstract

It is also worth mentioning that doing something like that is , generally , a bad idea .
0,1 abstract|5,17 abstract|6,10 event|7,10 abstract|9,10 event|14,17 event

Second , let ’s just get something out of the way .
3,4 person|6,7 abstract

A polygraph is not admissible in criminal court , and for good reason .
0,8 abstract|0,2 abstract|6,8 place|6,7 person|11,13 abstract

It is not going to give us specific information .
0,1 abstract|6,7 person|7,9 abstract

0,12 abstract|3,4 person|10,11 abstract

There are some people who showed deception , who were not necessarily lying .
0,14 abstract|2,4 person|6,7 abstract

Having said that , it is still a great tool for verifying truthfulness , and I ’m a big fan of using it in this kind of a process .
2,3 abstract|4,5 abstract|7,13 abstract|12,13 abstract|15,16 person|17,29 person|22,23 abstract|24,29 abstract

Hopefully I can explain to you why that happens here .
1,2 person|5,6 person|7,8 abstract

All of these Deception Detection Devices ( DDD ) work on a basic principal .
0,6 object|3,5 abstract|3,4 abstract|7,8 object|11,14 abstract

Your body has involuntary and automatic responses to lying .
0,9 abstract|0,2 object|0,1 person|3,9 abstract

The fact that you ’re hooked up to the machine really tends to amplify this .
0,2 abstract|3,4 person|8,10 object|14,15 abstract

These machines are actually fear detectors .
0,2 object|4,6 object|4,5 abstract

Let me show you .

20 years ago , an applicant … let ’s call him Joe … was out with friends at a bar .

While there he was approached by a prostitute who offered him her services .

Joe , being the fine and upstanding individual he is , turned her down .
0,1 person|3,8 person|8,9 person|12,13 person

On his background paperwork he indicated that he had never paid anyone for sex and he has never sought to pay anyone for sex …
1,4 object|1,2 person|2,3 abstract|4,5 person|7,24 abstract|7,8 person|11,12 person|13,14 event|15,16 person|21,22 person|23,24 event

both are true .
0,1 abstract

However , Joe has a flash of a thought from that night when the examiner asks him if he has paid for sex .
2,3 person|4,12 abstract|7,12 abstract|10,12 time|13,15 person|16,17 person|18,19 person|22,23 event

His body , automatically , is afraid that he should have said something .
0,13 event|0,2 object|0,1 person|8,9 person|12,13 abstract

The machine will pick that reaction up .
0,7 event|0,2 object|4,6 event

The reason this is n't scientific is because just because it shows deception on a particular subject , does n't mean you ’re lying …
0,2 abstract|2,3 event|10,11 event|12,17 abstract|14,17 abstract|21,22 person

it means that there is usually more to that story .
0,1 event|8,10 abstract

To combat this , before you take the poly you will talk with the examiner and go over every question that is on the exam .
2,3 event|4,25 event|5,6 person|7,9 abstract|9,10 person|13,15 person|18,20 abstract|23,25 abstract

That way you can address any gray areas .
0,2 event|2,3 person|5,8 abstract

You may have answered a question in your background with a “ no ” answer , but there is a “ comma , but ” to it though … if you know what I mean .
0,1 person|4,9 abstract|7,9 abstract|7,8 person|10,15 abstract|19,27 abstract|26,27 abstract|30,31 person|33,34 person

Make sure that you address any of these areas with the background investigator and with the polygraph examiner before taking the test .
0,23 event|3,4 person|5,9 abstract|7,9 abstract|10,13 person|11,12 abstract|15,18 person|16,17 object|20,22 abstract

That way , you ’ll feel that it ’s been addressed and it is much more likely to be a non-issue .
0,2 event|3,4 person|7,8 abstract|12,13 abstract|19,21 abstract

Third , please know that common sense is still very much on the table .

0,1 person|5,8 object|10,11 abstract

2,3 event|5,8 event|8,17 event|15,17 abstract

Do n’t do it , just be honest through the process .
3,4 event|9,11 abstract

Each step is there for a reason .
0,2 event|5,7 abstract

Finally , and most importantly , you should know that everyone is intimidated by this step in the process .

2,8 abstract|8,9 person|12,18 abstract|16,17 abstract|18,19 person

1,2 person|6,8 object|11,18 abstract|20,30 abstract|25,30 event|28,30 object

Here is the key , you need to both have an open / relaxed throat with a clear sound .

A clear sound being a sound with clarity and focus or some would term to as ' ping ' .

The ' ng ' is basically a sustained ' ng ' pronunciation as in the word ' sing ' or ' ring ' .

Some also would call this an open hum .
0,1 person|4,5 abstract|5,8 abstract

Then on the hum / ng , try to find a clear buzzing sensation in the front of your face and at the lips if you are doing a hum .

Do not force the sensation , focus on simply humming and the sensation should materialize by itself .
3,5 abstract|9,10 event|11,13 abstract|16,17 abstract

Then simply try to keep this same clarity or ' buzz ' when you open the mouth into the EE / AH vowel .

You may need to record yourself while doing this .
0,1 person|5,6 person|8,9 event

Many a times i have notice that people can produce a relatively focused and clean hum / ng .
0,3 time|3,4 person|7,8 person|10,18 abstract

But when they open the mouth to produce a vowel , the tone quality drastically changes into something way less focused and clear .
2,3 person|4,6 object|8,10 abstract|11,14 abstract|12,13 abstract|17,23 abstract

So when you record yourself , see if you can produce the cleanest most ' forward ' sound on the hum / ng and see that if you open to the vowel , does the tone quality drastically change .
2,3 person|4,5 person|8,9 person|11,18 abstract|19,23 abstract|19,21 abstract|22,23 abstract|27,28 person|30,32 object|34,37 abstract|35,36 abstract

The goal is to keep the tone quality relatively consistent .
0,2 abstract|5,8 abstract|6,7 abstract

Remember that you are trying to keep the same clarity and focus , different people sound different when the open the hum depending on the physiology of the vocal tract and cords .
2,3 person|7,12 abstract|13,15 person|18,19 person|20,22 abstract|24,32 abstract|27,32 object

So it is more important to focus on the forward clarity so as to not make the sound overly nasal or squeezed .

How to Detect Arrogant People
3,5 person

Do you always seem to cross paths with people who are stuck on themselves , intolerant of people different from them , rude or downright arrogant ?
1,2 person|8,9 person|13,14 person|17,21 person|20,21 person

These people can be a great source of potential pain , and this article is here to help you sort the arrogant from the not-so-arrogant .

Steps


Pay attention to their conversations .
3,5 event|3,4 person

Do n't eavesdrop , but when they 're talking to you or to those around you , listen to them .
6,7 person|10,11 person|13,16 person|15,16 person|19,20 person

Is it always about them ?
4,5 person

Do they get mad or irritated if the centre of attention moves to someone else ?
1,15 event|1,2 person|7,11 abstract|13,15 person

These are good signs of arrogance .
0,1 event|5,6 abstract

Arrogance and smugness is often a reflection of limited life experience , and feeling concerned that those with greater life experience " have got something over them " .
0,1 abstract|2,3 abstract|8,11 abstract|13,27 abstract|16,21 person|26,27 person

Rather than seeking to find out more through questions and learning ( actions viewed by them as showing vulnerability ) , arrogant people tend to generalize from their limited , narrow life experiences and try to impose their small worldview on others .
8,11 abstract|12,13 abstract|15,16 person|21,23 person|27,33 abstract|27,28 person|37,40 abstract|37,38 person|41,42 person

Jealousy of your achievements or seeming lifestyle can cause another person to feel smug or arrogant about something they think they do better than you or own / have that you do n't .
0,7 abstract|2,3 person|9,11 person|18,19 person|20,21 person|24,25 person|30,31 person

Arrogant people have an extremely strong need to look good .
0,2 person|3,10 abstract

When you make them look bad - even if it is the slightest offense - they will usually be very mad at you .
0,6 event|1,2 person|3,4 person|9,10 event|15,16 person|22,23 person

This happens when you question ( or at least seem to question ) their appearance , intelligence , athletic abilities , or anything else relating to their self-image .
0,1 event|3,4 person|13,15 abstract|13,14 person|16,17 abstract|18,20 abstract|22,28 abstract|26,27 person

Challenge their worldview .
1,3 abstract|1,2 person

Do n't be aggressive –– just skeptical and curious .


If they get upset , gauge their anger .
1,2 person|6,8 abstract|6,7 person

If it 's minimal , they may be simply having a bad day .
5,6 person|10,13 event

But if they 're enraged , then they may see you as questioning their ' perfect little world . '
2,3 person|7,8 person|10,11 person|13,18 abstract|13,14 person

And having one of those is usually indicative of arrogance .
2,5 abstract|9,10 abstract

At some point or another , most people realize that the world does n't revolve around them .
6,8 person|9,17 abstract|10,12 abstract|16,17 person

Arrogant people counteract this by creating an atmosphere that revolves around them , and get angry if they 're reminded of the real world .
0,2 person|3,4 event|6,12 abstract|11,12 person|17,18 person|21,24 abstract

Ambiguity frightens arrogant people because it suggests imperfection , change and lack of certainty ( realities we all must contend with as best we can ) .
0,1 abstract|2,4 person|5,6 abstract|7,14 abstract|15,16 abstract|16,18 person|23,24 person

As such , instead of accepting that the world behaves randomly and at times totally averse to one 's preferences , the arrogant person seeks to control everything and everyone , which of course , is an impossible mission .
7,9 abstract|17,20 abstract|21,24 person

Reality hurts when it intrudes ; as such , an arrogant person is less likely than other people to self-reflect or analyse , thereby not seeing their own imperfections .
0,1 abstract|3,4 abstract|9,12 person|16,18 person|26,29 abstract|26,27 person

They may also give themselves undue credit for positive achievements instead of acknowledging the input of others or of circumstances .
0,1 person|4,5 person|8,10 abstract|13,17 abstract|16,17 person|19,20 abstract

Learn the quality of their friendships .
1,6 abstract|4,6 abstract|4,5 person

Do n't be nosy or gossipy , but if they are happy with someone one day and hateful with them the next , that 's a sign of them having a lot of fair weather friends .
9,10 person|11,20 event|13,14 person|14,16 time|19,20 person|20,22 time|23,24 abstract|28,29 person|29,36 event|30,36 person

That 's a sign of arrogance , since it is very hard to be a truly good friend to someone who 's stuck on themselves .
0,1 abstract|5,6 abstract|14,18 person|19,20 person|24,25 person

Prideful people have a strong need to look good , and being self-sufficient is an effective way to do that .
0,2 person|6,9 abstract|11,13 abstract|14,17 abstract|19,20 abstract

Since being a good friend to someone usually means helping them , they often ca n't stand the thought of a good friendship .
2,5 person|6,7 person|10,11 person|12,13 person|17,23 abstract

Ironically , arrogant people often ca n't understand why they do n't have any reliable and supportive friends .
2,4 person|9,10 person|13,18 person

How do they treat those not like themselves ?
2,3 person|4,8 person|7,8 person

In other words , how do they treat those with different beliefs , cultural backgrounds and ways of seeing the world ?
6,7 person|7,21 event|8,21 person|19,21 abstract

If it 's inherently negative , then they 're either over-zealous , ignorant of other people or what to avoid those that contradict their fantasy land that caters to them and them only .
1,2 event|7,8 person|14,16 person|20,26 person|23,26 abstract|23,24 person|29,30 person|31,32 person

Determine this based on their general personality and the people they 're interacting with .
1,2 event|4,7 abstract|4,5 person|8,14 person|10,11 person

Many times prideful people have a serious ' my-way's-the-only-way ' attitude .
0,2 time|2,4 person|5,11 abstract

This is simply a protective mechanism for their false image or their fantasy land .
0,1 abstract|7,10 abstract|7,8 person|11,14 abstract|11,12 person

What 's their personality like ?
2,4 abstract|2,3 person

Take note of how they act , talk , and use their social status .
4,5 person|11,14 abstract|11,12 person

Do they have a general sense of ' coolness ? '
1,2 person|3,9 abstract

Are they a chatterbox ?
1,2 person

Do they act like they own the place , or act like the ' big dog ? '
1,2 person|4,5 person|12,16 abstract

Are they very keen on their self-image ?
1,2 person|5,7 abstract|5,6 person

Many arrogant people have a false charm that no one seems to see through .
0,3 person|4,14 abstract

But the arrogant person is usually more than happy to show their cruel side to those that they do n't like .
1,4 person|11,14 abstract|11,12 person|15,21 person|17,18 person

When they are cruel , their friends will usually ignore it or not do anything to stop it since they 're afraid that they 'll be treated badly by their ' friend . '
0,4 event|1,2 person|5,7 person|5,6 person|10,11 event|17,18 event|19,20 person|23,24 person|29,32 person|29,30 person

Mention people you know that they do n't like .
0,9 event|1,9 person|2,3 person|5,6 person

This is n't meant to begin a conflict , but to gauge their rivalries , annoyances and enmities .
0,1 event|6,8 event|12,18 abstract

If their condemnation seems to be reasonable , they probably are n't hubristic .
1,3 abstract|1,2 person|8,9 person

If it 's harsh , they are .
1,2 abstract|5,6 person

For the most part , arrogant people see people that they do n't like as threats to their perfect little world .
5,7 person|8,14 person|10,11 person|17,21 abstract|17,18 person

The more they hate someone , the more dangerous that person is to their fantasy land .
2,3 person|4,5 person|9,11 person|13,16 abstract|13,14 person

And in turn , the bigger the threat , the harsher the criticism .
6,8 abstract|11,13 abstract

Ask around to see what they 've been saying about you .
5,6 person|10,11 person

If they have been saying bad things about you , they may simply not like you .
1,2 person|5,9 abstract|8,9 person|10,11 person|15,16 person

If they 're nice to your face , but talk bad about you behind your back like it 's their favourite hobby , then they probably have a problem with pride .
1,2 person|5,6 person|9,16 event|12,13 person|14,15 person|17,18 event|19,20 person|24,25 person|30,31 abstract

Arrogant people often subconsciously know that they do n't have any good friends .
0,2 person|6,7 person|7,13 event

They compensate for this by creating the impression that they have a lot of friends - they have a ' quantity , not quality ' mentality .
0,1 person|3,4 event|6,15 abstract|9,10 person|11,15 person|16,17 person|18,26 abstract

Then they simply insult their trophy friends when they are n't looking .

It is vital that it is done at the beginning of each ballet session , including before a performance .
0,1 abstract|3,14 abstract|4,5 event|8,14 time|11,14 event|12,13 abstract|17,19 event

When taking on ballet , it is important to stretch daily for at least 15 - 30 minutes , to give the muscles ample opportunity to warm up , reducing the risk of injury .

Always wear ballet slippers .

Properly-fitted ballet shoes should be snug , but not so tight they cut off blood flow and create numbness in the feet .
0,3 object|1,2 abstract|11,12 object|14,16 abstract|18,19 abstract|20,22 object

There are different styles and types of shoes , so ask your ballet teacher or a salesman at the store for advice , given your intentions for dancing .

Ballet is less about learning the moves and more about perfecting them .
0,1 abstract|5,7 abstract|11,12 abstract

The moves themselves are relatively straightforward , but the positing , the timing , and the elegance required takes a lifetime of practice .
0,2 abstract|2,3 abstract|8,10 event|11,13 abstract|15,17 abstract|19,23 abstract|22,23 event

For this reason , it 's always better to practice ballet in a ballet studio under the guidance of a good instructor , who will be able to correct your positioning and make sure that you 're dancing properly .
1,3 abstract|4,5 event|8,22 event|10,11 abstract|12,15 place|13,14 abstract|16,22 abstract|19,22 person|29,31 abstract|29,30 person|35,36 person

How to Grow Basil
3,4 plant

Three Methods : Starting Seeds Caring for Basil Harvesting and Using Basil
0,2 abstract|4,5 plant|7,8 plant|11,12 plant

Basil is easy to grow , and transforms ordinary meals into culinary treasures !
0,1 plant|8,10 object|11,13 object

Fresh basil not only tastes better than dried , it actually tastes different , almost as if it were not the same herb .
0,2 plant|9,10 plant|17,18 plant

This article outlines how to plant and harvest basil .
0,2 object|8,9 plant

Method 1 of 3 : Starting Seeds
0,2 abstract|6,7 plant

1 Choose the kind of basil you wish to grow .
2,6 plant|6,7 person

Basil comes in many different varieties , each of which have a unique flavor and smell .
0,1 plant|3,6 abstract|7,10 abstract|11,16 abstract

Read up on different types of basil and pick out one - or several - that appeal to you , then order the seeds or buy them at a garden store .
3,7 abstract|10,11 abstract|13,14 abstract|18,19 person|22,24 plant|26,27 plant|28,31 place

Here are a few ideas :
2,5 abstract

Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice , and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers .
0,2 plant|0,1 object|6,9 object|11,12 plant|14,19 plant

Lemon basil actually contains citral , an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit , and smells very lemony .
0,2 plant|4,5 plant|6,9 plant|11,13 plant

Purple basil is often grown for decoration , as well as its scent and flowers .
0,2 plant|11,13 abstract|11,12 plant|14,15 plant

There are perennial basils which come back year after year , like African Blue Basil ( which has pretty blue veins on its leaves ) and Thai Basil , while most other varieties are annuals , which you 'll have to plant year after year .
2,4 plant|12,15 plant|18,21 plant|22,23 plant|26,28 plant|34,35 plant|37,38 person

Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow , but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained .
0,4 plant|13,16 plant

2 Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost .
2,3 plant|10,11 event

Basil needs warm air and sun to do well , so it 's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they 'll get damaged by frost .
0,1 plant|2,6 abstract|11,12 abstract|15,20 abstract|18,19 plant|24,25 plant|29,30 event

If you live in a hot climate , you can start the seeds outside instead .
1,2 person|8,9 person|11,13 plant

To figure out when the last frost will be , consult an almanac or talk with other gardeners in your area .
6,7 event|11,13 object|16,18 person|19,21 place|19,20 person

3 Prepare seed containers .
2,4 object|2,3 plant

Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite , vermiculite , and peat .
1,2 object|3,6 object|8,9 object|12,13 substance|14,15 substance|17,18 substance

Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets .
1,3 object|6,8 abstract

Dampen the mixture with water so it 's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate .
1,3 object|4,5 substance|11,14 place|15,18 plant

4 Plant the seeds .
2,4 plant

Drop one to two seeds into each container .
4,5 plant|6,8 object

Cover them lightly with soil .
1,2 plant|4,5 substance

Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap , so they stay moist .
1,2 object|3,7 object|9,10 plant

Leave the containers in a sunny window .
1,3 object|6,7 object

Twice daily , remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water .
4,7 substance|9,11 object|13,14 substance

5 Remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge .
2,5 substance|6,8 plant

When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil , it 's time to remove the plastic wrap .
1,2 person|3,7 plant|10,12 object|18,21 object

Keep watering the sprouts twice daily , never letting the soil dry out .
2,4 plant|9,11 object

When the plants become a few inches tall and their leaves mature , it 's time to transplant them to a larger container .
1,3 plant|9,11 plant|9,10 plant|18,19 plant|20,23 object

Method 2 of 3 : Caring for Basil
0,2 abstract|7,8 plant

1 Transplant the basil plants .
2,5 plant

Once two sets of leaves have formed , basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers .
2,5 plant|8,9 plant|13,15 place|16,18 object

Basil does not tolerate frost so do n't plant too early .
0,1 plant|4,5 event

It 's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil .
5,6 plant|8,9 plant|11,16 abstract|18,20 object

To plant the basil in the garden , dig holes spaced at least 6 inches apart .
3,4 plant|5,7 place|9,10 object

Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems .
1,3 plant|4,6 object|8,9 substance|10,12 plant

Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets .
2,3 substance|4,6 plant|8,10 object

If you want to plant the basil in a container , make sure it 's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you 're growing ;
1,2 person|5,7 plant|8,10 object|13,14 object|19,23 quantity

they need to be planted 6 inches apart , since they grow quite large .
0,1 plant|10,11 plant

2 Keep the soil damp , but not soaked .
2,4 substance

Basil does best in well-drained soil , and should not be subjected to standing water .
0,1 plant|4,6 substance|13,15 substance

Water the mature basil plants once a day , in the morning , so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight .
1,5 plant|10,12 time|14,16 substance|27,29 plant

3 Pinch off flower heads .
3,5 plant

When you see flower buds , pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off .
1,2 person|3,5 plant|7,8 plant|10,13 plant|14,15 plant

Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves , as well as reducing the amount of foliage which grows .
0,2 event|0,1 plant|3,6 abstract|9,14 abstract|12,14 plant|19,23 quantity

This is called " bolting " and is more likely to happen when there 's extra sunshine .
0,1 event|15,17 substance

You 'll notice that if you leave the flowers , the plant will become lanky and the leaves wo n't be as full or tasty .
0,1 person|5,6 person|7,9 plant|10,12 plant|16,18 plant

4 Watch for pests and mold .
3,4 animal|5,6 plant

Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles
0,2 plant|5,7 animal

the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand .
5,7 animal|10,11 animal|12,14 plant

If your plants show signs of mold growth , they may not be getting adequate sunlight , or they may be too close together .
1,3 plant|1,2 person|6,8 plant|9,10 plant|15,16 substance|18,19 plant

Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space .
2,5 plant|7,10 plant|11,12 abstract

Method 3 of 3 : Harvesting and Using Basil
0,2 abstract|8,9 plant

1 Harvest and prune .


As the plant matures , pinch off the top two pairs of leaves once a stalk reaches a reasonable height .
1,3 plant|7,13 quantity|12,13 plant|14,16 plant|17,20 quantity

If you look closely , at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves that will grow outwards if the stem growing between them is cut off .
1,2 person|6,11 place|9,11 plant|12,16 plant|21,23 plant|25,26 plant

Cut close to those tiny leaves , but be sure not to damage them .
3,6 plant|13,14 plant

Pinching encourages the plant 's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves .
0,1 event|2,6 abstract|2,5 plant|10,13 plant|10,11 plant|14,15 plant

This helps the plants grow bushy .
0,1 event|2,4 plant

Do n't pinch on the lower part of the stem , or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy .
4,10 plant|12,15 plant

You want them to get bushy , so pinch from the top .
0,1 person|2,3 plant|10,12 plant

2 Enjoy the basil fresh .
2,4 plant

Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese .
2,4 plant|6,8 plant|10,11 object|12,21 object

3 Store the basil in the refrigerator .
2,4 plant|5,7 place

You 'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh , so plan on storing some in the fridge .
0,1 person|4,6 plant|17,18 plant|19,21 place

Wash the leaves , dry them well , and wrap them in paper towels .
1,3 plant|5,6 plant|10,11 plant|12,14 object

Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid .
1,2 plant|3,7 place|8,11 object

4 Freeze the basil .
2,4 plant

Freezing the leaves whole does n't work very well , but if you puree it first you can freeze it for months .
1,3 plant|12,13 person|14,15 plant|16,17 person|19,20 plant

Place the basil in a blender with a little water .
1,3 plant|4,6 object|7,10 substance

Puree it until smooth , then put it in a food storage bag and freeze until you need it .

Method Two of Two : Reducing Stress in the Chicken

Understand the hypnotic effect .
1,4 abstract

Researchers call this effect " tonic immobility " .
0,1 person|2,4 abstract|5,7 abstract

" When a chicken or another animal with this tendency becomes frightened , its heart rate lowers and it stops moving .
2,7 animal|2,4 animal|8,10 abstract|13,16 quantity|13,14 animal|18,19 animal

This may be an attempt to play dead , discouraging predators that prefer live prey .

Unlike an opossum , the chicken gives an unconvincing act , as it continues to blink and breathe in an obvious way . "
1,3 animal|4,6 animal|7,10 abstract|12,13 animal|19,22 abstract

Keep the chicken upright or on its side .

Hypnosis techniques that involve laying a chicken on its back may " succeed " by cutting off its air supply .
0,2 abstract|6,7 animal|8,10 place|8,9 animal|15,20 event|17,18 animal|18,20 substance

This can cause the chicken significant discomfort , leading to fainting or even , rarely , death .

Keep hypnosis short and infrequent .

Hours of stress , or regular exposure to stressful situations , can cause serious health problems .

Get your chickens used to humans and novelty .
1,2 person|2,3 animal|5,6 person|7,8 abstract

Even prolonged eye contact seems to have an effect .

Living in stimulating environments with new objects may also help .

Hens raise in battery cages stay " hypnotized " longer , possibly because of greater fear .

As in the real world , the first step to flirting is to get over your cold feet and jump right in !
2,5 place|6,11 event|10,11 event

Text the other person a brief message asking them about their day , asking them a specific question about work or school , or simply saying " Hi ! " .

The hardest part of flirting is to break through your initial reluctance , so if you 're having a hard time taking the plunge , just remind yourself that no matter how badly it goes , it 'll be less stressful than an equivalent real-world encounter .

There 's no reason to be nervous when it comes to IM flirting —
3,4 abstract|11,13 event|11,12 abstract

if the person you want to talk to does n't want to talk to you , s/he always has the option of simply not responding to your message , as , from your point of view , this is indistinguishable from him or her simply being away from the computer .
1,3 person|3,4 person|14,15 person|16,17 person|19,28 abstract|26,28 object|26,27 person|32,36 abstract|32,33 person|37,50 event|37,38 abstract|41,44 person|48,50 object

This being said , if you barely know someone , it can be a good idea to have an excuse for starting a conversation to avoid awkwardness .
0,1 event|5,6 person|8,9 person|10,11 abstract|13,16 abstract|18,24 abstract|22,24 abstract|26,27 abstract

Asking for help with a work or school-related problem is almost always a good bet , as is asking a question about something striking about the person .
0,9 event|2,3 abstract|5,6 place|12,15 event|19,27 abstract|25,27 person

For instance , if the person has a band-related username , you might say : " Hey , cool name . Did you see those guys when they last came to town ? "
4,6 person|7,10 abstract|11,12 person|18,20 abstract|22,23 person|24,26 person|27,28 person|31,32 place

Start small talk .
0,3 event

After your initial greeting and exchange of pleasantries , you 'll probably want to ask how the person 's doing ( just like you might in the real world ) .
1,8 event|1,2 person|9,10 person|16,18 person|23,24 person|26,29 place

Ask him or her about work or school , his / her interests , or any recent trips , for instance .
1,4 person|5,6 place|7,8 place|9,13 abstract|9,12 person|15,18 event

Rather than asking a question , you can also simply offer your comments on these things .
3,5 abstract|6,7 person|11,16 abstract|11,12 person|14,16 abstract

When s/he responds , add your own comments or ask follow-up questions and proceed from there !
1,2 person|5,8 abstract|5,6 person|10,12 abstract

Do n't pry into his or her personal life — keep things light , fun , and focused on worry-free subjects .
4,9 abstract|4,7 person|19,21 abstract

Do n't dwell too long on small talk .
6,8 event

A minute or two is great for breaking the ice , but much more can get boring fast .
0,4 time

For example , after we 've opened up by asking about this person 's interest in the band in his / her username , it 's logical and reasonable to ask about this person 's musical likes and dislikes .
4,5 person|11,23 abstract|11,14 person|14,23 abstract|16,23 organization|19,22 person|22,23 abstract|32,39 abstract|32,35 person

You can even offer your own opinions and suggestions .
0,1 person|4,9 abstract|4,5 person

For instance , you might say something like : " If you like those guys , you might want to check out this band called Manic Albatross - they 're like the Beatles , only darker . What sorts of other bands do you like ? "

1,7 abstract|5,7 person|10,11 person|13,15 person|17,18 person|20,21 person|29,30 person|31,33 abstract|36,37 person

Try to be playful and even slightly sarcastic as you respond to the statements of the person you 're talking to .
9,10 person|12,17 abstract|15,17 person

For instance , if you 're asked what you 're up to , rather than saying , " looking for people to hit on on Facebook " you might find that it 's a better idea to give a sarcastic answer like " writing the great American novel " or " drowning my sorrows " .

For instance , you 'll want to avoid making lots of jokes at your own expense .

Just one is plenty — it should n't be a recurring theme throughout your conversation .

Doing this too often can quickly turn an otherwise flirtatious conversation into one in which you appear needy and self-loathing .

1,3 person|4,6 event|5,6 abstract|14,20 event|17,20 abstract|22,23 person

It can also make him or her question your motives , leading the person to believe that you may be trying to get something out of him or her .

Method 2 of 2 : Using Grammar
6,7 abstract

Name your language .
0,3 event|1,3 abstract|1,2 person

This is the most fundamental property in all languages .
0,1 abstract|7,9 abstract

You have many names to choose from .
0,1 person|2,4 abstract

You can even use a made up word from your made up language like ' Victory ' or ' Great Language ' .
0,1 person|3,21 event|4,22 abstract|9,13 abstract|9,10 person

The choice is all yours .
0,2 event|4,5 person

Start off with the highly frequently used words such as ' and ' or ' I ' or ' one ' or ' the ' .
3,25 abstract

It is recommend that you use short words since they are commonly used .
0,1 event|3,8 event|4,5 person|6,8 abstract|9,10 abstract

An example would be ' ant ' for and or ' es ' or even ' loo ' for the word ' and ' .
0,2 abstract

Start thinking about the grammar rules .
3,6 abstract

For example if the word Bird is ' Vogelaviatiolap ' then why not make the word Birds ' Vogelaviatiolaps ' since the suffix ' s ' is added at the end for most languages at plurals .
3,5 abstract|5,6 abstract|7,10 abstract|14,16 abstract|16,17 abstract|17,20 abstract|21,23 abstract|23,26 abstract|32,34 abstract|35,36 abstract

If you want to add complication , you can add genders like most European languages like French and German .
1,2 person|5,6 abstract|7,8 person|10,11 abstract|12,19 abstract|16,17 abstract|18,19 abstract

For example , if you want the word ' horse ' to be a boy , you may want ' the horse ' to be ' Mat Fereder ' , but a ' cat ' to be a girl , you may want , ' the cat ' to be ' Fet Kamaow ' .
4,5 person|6,8 abstract|8,11 animal|16,17 person|19,23 animal|31,35 animal|40,41 person|44,48 animal

Consider basing your language on an existing language .
2,4 abstract|2,3 person|5,8 abstract

For example , in my made up language , ' Vogelaviatiolap ' means Bird .
4,8 abstract|4,5 person|9,12 abstract|13,14 abstract

If you have n't guessed , it comes from the following :
1,2 person|6,7 abstract

' Vogel ' comes from German , which means bird
0,3 abstract|5,6 abstract|9,10 abstract

' aviatio ' comes from English .
0,3 abstract|5,6 abstract

It 's uncompleted though , because the word is part of the term ' aviation '
0,1 abstract|6,8 abstract|11,13 abstract|13,16 abstract

' lap ' comes from Onomatopoeia .
0,3 abstract|5,6 abstract

It 's a completed term , but it is supposed to come from ' Flap ! '
0,1 abstract|7,8 abstract

Consider basing some of your words from other words you have invented .
4,6 abstract|4,5 person|7,9 abstract|9,10 person

For example , if you invented the word ' China ' as ' Khinssa ' , ' Drink ' as ' Bever ' , and the word ' Accident ' as ' Casnondelibreaten ' , why not make the word ' tea ' as ' Khincasnonbever ' or ' Bevernondelibreatekin ' or even ' Khinssacasnondelibreatenibever ' !
4,5 person|6,8 abstract|8,11 place|12,15 abstract|16,19 abstract|20,23 abstract|25,27 abstract|27,30 abstract|31,34 abstract|38,40 abstract|40,43 abstract|44,47 abstract|48,51 abstract|53,56 abstract

Get inspiration from existing alphabets and words .
3,7 abstract

Why not add some non Latin Characters such as ß ?
3,10 abstract

You can even make the whole language not based on the Latin Alphabet at all like Chinese !
0,1 person|4,7 abstract|10,13 abstract|16,17 abstract

You can even take some words of languages , altering them or not .
0,1 person|4,8 abstract|10,11 abstract

You can make the word ' pen ' as ' penn ' or even ' pen ' .
0,1 person|3,5 abstract|5,8 object|10,11 object|15,16 object

Using the dictionary can ensure you not missing a single word .
0,3 event|1,3 object|5,6 person

Keep track of all your
4,5 person

Remember to write down your creations !
4,6 object|4,5 person

Use your language .
1,3 abstract|1,2 person

Get used to using it yourself , and spread it to others .
4,5 abstract|5,6 person|9,10 abstract

Once you feel confident about your language , experiment and expand :
1,2 person|5,7 abstract|5,6 person

Grab a book / novel and translate it to your own language .
1,5 object|7,8 object|9,12 abstract|9,10 person

Teach your friends this new language .
1,3 person|1,2 person|3,6 abstract

As soon as your friends understand your language , communicate to them with it .
3,5 person|3,4 person|6,8 abstract|6,7 person|11,12 person|13,14 abstract

Be fluent in your own made up language and start spreading this to your friends , family and strangers !
3,8 abstract|3,4 person|11,12 abstract|13,15 person|13,14 person|16,17 person|18,19 person

Write your own poem / novel / story with your own made up language .
1,8 object|1,2 person|9,14 abstract|9,10 person

If you 're really ambitious , set a goal of helping others become fluent in the language .
1,2 person|7,17 abstract|15,17 abstract

One day , maybe you can make it the official language of a country !
4,5 person|7,8 abstract|8,14 abstract

Tips


Make sure that it is a language that while speaking , you do n't get a literal knot in your tongue !
3,4 abstract|11,12 person|19,20 person

Remember you should know how to write it .
1,2 person|7,8 abstract

For example we write it from left to right , in Arabic it 's right to left , Chinese is in columns , and so on .
2,3 person|4,5 abstract|11,12 abstract|12,13 abstract|18,19 abstract

Make sure that you and your friend(s) all follow a systematic language system .
3,7 person|3,4 person|5,6 person|9,13 abstract

In other words , make sure that you follow the same guidelines .
7,8 person|9,12 abstract

Do n't use random letters .
3,5 abstract

It should make some sense , so that it will be easier to learn and speak with [ Example : Do n't use oh as e , hello as llo , and See ya as c yah ) .
0,1 abstract|8,9 abstract|18,19 abstract

Make sure you practice saying and spelling out many basic words in your language , English examples : is , who , when , of , why , if , what , where , can , may , etc .
2,3 person|8,14 abstract|12,14 abstract|12,13 person|15,17 abstract

When starting off , follow closely to a language you like .
4,11 event|9,10 person

This will make grammar much easier to make .
0,1 event|3,4 abstract

You must avoid simply copying the grammar rules , however , as this would technically turn your language into a code .
0,1 person|3,8 event|5,8 abstract|6,8 abstract|12,13 event|16,18 abstract|16,17 person

Practice your language frequently so that you do n't forget it !
1,3 abstract|1,2 person|6,7 person|10,11 abstract

Do n't forget punctuation !
3,4 abstract

As a shortcut , and for a bit of interesting background , add connotation to various letters , preferably vowels .
12,14 event|13,14 abstract|15,17 abstract|19,20 abstract

To do this , think of various words that begin with / have a lot of a certain vowel .
2,3 event|6,8 abstract|16,19 abstract

For example : austere , acrimony , ebullient , embolden ; in this case , the vowel A might carry with it a negative meaning , whereas E would be positive .
1,2 abstract|15,17 object|17,18 object|21,22 object

Then , even if you forget your own words without the help of your dictionary , you could still make a good guess based on the composition of the letters .
4,5 person|6,9 abstract|6,7 person|13,15 object|16,17 person|25,30 abstract|28,30 abstract

Try not to make your words sound like utter and complete gibberish just add a little extra than our regular English language .
4,6 abstract|4,5 person|18,22 abstract|18,19 person

We do n't want a knot in your tongue after speaking to your friends .
0,1 person|12,14 person|12,13 person

Just put marks over the letters or make up something right on the spot , you might have to take some time on this !
0,14 event|2,3 abstract|4,6 abstract|15,16 person|23,24 event

Basing letters on objects ( pictographs ) is an easy way to start a writing system .
1,2 abstract|3,4 object|11,16 event|13,16 abstract

Try this with a group of friends .
1,2 event|3,7 person

It 's much more fun when there are other people that can understand your language .
8,10 person|13,15 abstract|13,14 person

Email or text your friends the language so that they wo n't be so confused .
3,5 person|3,4 person|5,7 abstract|9,10 person

When making a writing system , take a break about every five minutes and come back to it or all your letters will begin to look identical .
2,5 abstract|17,18 abstract|19,22 object|20,21 person

If you want to make other languages , you can use this language as a model and change some letters or sounds to create a different language .
1,2 person|5,7 abstract|8,27 event|8,9 person|11,13 abstract|14,16 abstract|18,22 abstract|24,27 abstract

This makes your first language a proto-language — a language that branches off into a family of languages .

How to Pack Your Possessions When Moving
3,5 object

Even if you ca n't wait to live in your new house , curb your enthusiasm and resist the urge to cram all your possessions any which way into boxes .
2,3 person|9,12 object|14,15 person|18,25 abstract|22,25 object|23,24 person|29,30 object

Steps


Pack one room at a time if possible , and start with items that are least often used .
1,3 object|12,13 object

Write down a list of everything you are packing , in particular if it 's valuable .
2,9 object|5,9 object|6,7 person|13,14 object

Books , CDs , expensive clothes .
0,6 object

Also , take note of which item is in which box .
5,7 object|9,11 object

Use sturdy boxes .
1,3 object

Fill the box to the brim and seal the lid .
0,10 abstract|1,3 object|8,10 object

That way , you can easily stack boxes on top of one another .
0,2 abstract|3,4 person|7,8 object|11,13 object

Tape the bottom of the box securely so that it does n't give way .
1,6 object|4,6 object|9,10 object

Never fill a box until it is so heavy that you ca n't lift it safely .
2,4 object|5,6 object|10,11 person|14,15 object

Spread the heavy items over a few boxes .
1,4 object|5,8 object

Balance boxes with lighter items like towels or soft toys .
1,2 object|3,5 object|6,10 object

Pack the lighter items on top .
1,4 object

Use bubble wrap or newspapers when packing fragile items .
1,3 object|4,5 object|7,9 object

However , newsprint may smudge so use newspaper selectively .
2,3 object|7,8 object

Clean paper can be purchased cheaply from moving supply stores .
0,2 object|7,10 place

Mark boxes .
1,2 object

Boxes should be marked " Fragile " and " This side up " to prevent mishandling .
0,1 object|15,16 abstract

Label each box clearly and which room it belongs to .
1,3 object|5,7 object|7,8 object

Write on the sides of the box as well .
2,7 object|5,7 object

Pack a separate box of essentials you may need for the first night at your new house .
1,6 object|1,4 object|5,6 object|6,7 person|10,17 abstract|14,17 place|14,15 person

Include items like toiletries , toilet paper , bottled water , snacks and a change of clothes in case you can not unpack everything in time .
1,17 object|19,20 person|23,24 object

Tips
0,1 abstract

Do n't label boxes with contents if the contents are valuable .
3,6 object|3,4 object|5,6 object|7,9 object

Instead of writing " Silver Service - Fragile " you should write something that makes it sound less theft inviting while showing the fragile nature of the contents .
9,10 person|12,13 object|15,16 object|18,20 abstract|22,28 abstract|26,28 object

Example : " Mom 's old dishes " instead of " Fine China "
0,1 abstract|2,14 abstract

Tape is cheap .
0,1 object

Use lots of it .

Close box bottoms well .
1,3 object|1,2 object

Get masking tape or packing tape and tape screws and other little things that came out of something back against it .
1,3 object|4,6 object|8,9 object|10,13 object|17,18 object|20,21 object

You 'll want to find the right screw reassemble something without having to pick it out of 100 others when you get there .
0,1 person|5,8 object|9,10 object|14,15 object|17,19 object|20,21 person|22,23 place

Do n't pack one box full of books or paperwork - you might not be able to carry it at all .
3,5 object|7,8 object|9,10 object|11,12 person|18,19 object

Fill it halfway with books , and fill it up with lighter stuff .
1,2 object|4,5 object|8,9 object|11,13 object

National superstores ( Walmart ) will let you walk the store for boxes when they are stocking the stores between 11 pm and 1 am .
0,2 place|3,4 organization|7,8 person|9,11 place|12,13 object|14,15 person|17,19 place|20,22 time|23,25 time

You can find boxes of all sizes .
0,1 person|3,7 object|5,7 quantity

Cereal , diaper and houseware boxes are a good size and durable .
0,6 object|7,10 quantity

Just take a cart and roam the store .
2,4 object|6,8 place

They do check the cart as you leave so do n't try to sneak anything past them .
0,1 person|3,5 object|6,7 person

U-haul and other nation companies offer box buy back services .
0,1 organization|2,5 organization|6,10 abstract

If you buy too many boxes you can return the unused for a full refund .
1,2 person|3,6 object|6,7 person|9,11 object|12,15 abstract

These boxes are also quite sturdy so you can re-use them or stash in your attic until you move again .
0,2 object|7,8 person|10,11 object|14,16 place|14,15 person|17,18 person

Some national companies even offer free shipping and handling so you can have some delivered or go to the local location .
0,3 organization|5,7 abstract|8,9 abstract|10,11 person|13,14 object|18,21 place

Fill empty spaces with additional paper .
1,3 abstract|4,6 object

Throw away or donate junk you do n't want to take to your new place .
4,5 object|5,6 person|12,15 place|12,13 person

Do n't pack it again ! ! !
3,4 object

Set aside an area of the house where you can put all the packed boxes .
2,15 place|5,7 place|8,9 person|11,15 object|14,15 object

Use a room that is n't used every day such as the formal dining or living room .
1,3 place|11,17 place

You wo n't be tripping over boxes and you can have a better idea of what you have and where things are .
0,1 person|6,7 object|8,9 person|11,22 abstract

Entreat assistance .

If this is a solo jump , then skip to step 6 .
1,2 event|3,6 event|10,12 abstract

Prepare for deployment .
2,3 event

After linking arms with your fellow jumper , you will need to hook your arms through their chest strap , or through both sides of the front of their harness , as far as you can , then grab onto your own strap .

1,6 object|7,9 abstract|7,8 person

The canopy must be steered away from power lines and similar obstructions ;
0,2 object|7,9 object|7,8 abstract|10,12 object

try for a large body of water if you are confident your companion can save you from drowning .
2,7 object|6,7 substance|8,9 person|11,13 person|11,12 person|15,16 person

Alternative : Lack of companions
0,1 abstract|2,5 abstract|4,5 person

If this is a solo jump , which constitutes the minority of skydivers , your only recourse is to ensure that at least one of your own chutes opens .
1,2 event|3,6 event|9,13 abstract|12,13 person|14,17 abstract|14,15 person|21,29 event|23,28 object|25,26 person

Objectively , this is not likely to help very much ; but it may improve your emotional state .
2,3 abstract|12,13 abstract|15,18 abstract|15,16 person

If you do not have any religious beliefs , or are for another reason unwilling to appeal to your patron deity , skip this step .
1,2 person|5,8 abstract|12,14 abstract|18,21 abstract|18,19 person|23,25 abstract

Contemplate .


As you approach the Earth at , or close to , terminal velocity , you may wish to contemplate your past existence , and the possibility of a future afterlife .
1,2 person|3,5 place|11,13 abstract|14,15 person|19,22 abstract|19,20 person|24,30 abstract|27,30 abstract

A strategy that might prove helpful is to consider how fortunate you are that life has been good to you so far .
0,2 abstract|11,12 person|14,15 abstract|19,20 person

Alternatively , if life has not been good to you so far , ( and considering your current situation this seems more likely ) consider how lucky you are that it will not be troubling you much longer .

How to Play Muggle Quidditch
3,5 abstract|3,4 person

In the Harry Potter series written by JK Rowling the main wizarding sport is Quidditch .
1,5 abstract|2,4 person|7,9 person|9,13 abstract|14,15 abstract

However you do n't have to have magical powers to play .
1,2 person|7,9 abstract

There are many different ways of playing Quidditch , but the most commonly used set of rules are those given by the International Quidditch Association ( which can be found here ) .
2,8 abstract|7,8 abstract|10,17 abstract|16,17 abstract|18,19 abstract|21,25 organization|23,24 abstract|30,31 place

In the past Muggle Quidditch has mainly been played at colleges in the US , but over the last few years there has been a dramatic rise in the number of community teams .
1,3 time|3,5 abstract|3,4 person|10,14 organization|12,14 place|17,21 time|24,33 event|28,33 quantity|31,33 organization

Quidditch has also spread outside of America and is now played on 5 continents .

Steps
0,1 abstract

Gather all needed materials and players ( see Things You 'll Need section below ) .
1,4 substance|5,6 person|8,13 abstract|8,12 object|9,10 person

Know that all players can play while riding a broom .
2,4 person|8,10 object

Brooms can be a hindrance however , so feel free to not use brooms .
0,1 object|3,5 abstract|13,14 object

Place the quaffle and three bludgers in the middle of the field .
1,3 object|4,6 object|7,12 place|10,12 place

Ideally the quaffle and bludgers should be slightly deflated so that they are easier to throw and catch .
1,3 object|4,5 object|11,12 object

Start the game .
1,3 event

Both teams start from the edges and attempt to obtain the quaffle and bludgers .
0,2 organization|4,6 place|10,12 object|13,14 object

Follow your duty depending what type of player you are :
1,3 abstract|1,2 person|4,8 abstract|7,8 person|8,9 person

Chasers try to score by throwing the quaffle into one of the three goal hoops .
0,1 person|6,8 object|9,15 object

Each score is worth 10 points .
0,2 event|4,6 abstract

Beaters try to peg players with their bludger .
0,1 person|4,5 person|6,8 object|6,7 person

If a player is pegged they have to stop what they 're doing and pay a penalty ; i.e. ( drop the quaffle in the case of a chaser ) and run back to and touch their goal post or alternatively sit down for 10 seconds .
1,3 person|5,6 person|10,11 person|15,17 abstract|20,23 event|21,23 object|27,29 person|36,39 object|36,37 person|44,46 time

Keepers guard the goal posts at each end and attempt to block chasers ' attempts at scoring .
0,1 person|2,8 object|6,8 place|12,17 event|12,14 person

If Keeper is close to their hoops they are safe from being hit by bludgers .
1,2 person|5,7 object|5,6 person|7,8 person|14,15 object

Seekers try to tackle the snitch ( a person ) or obtain an object attached to the snitch such as a sock or flag .
0,1 person|4,6 person|7,9 person|12,14 object|16,18 person|20,22 object|23,24 object

You can establish you own rules as to how a player catches the snitch .
0,1 person|3,6 abstract|9,11 person|12,14 abstract

A common way to play is to make the snitch a person , and give the snitch a head start to run and hide in defined boundaries .
0,3 abstract|8,10 abstract|10,12 person|15,17 person|17,20 event|25,27 place

Then the seekers search for the snitch , and attempt to tag the player .
1,3 person|5,7 person|12,14 person

Other methods , such as the method adopted in 2005 , makes the snitch a tennis ball in a sock , hanging out of the running shorts of the snitch runner .
0,2 abstract|5,7 abstract|9,10 time|12,14 abstract|14,20 object|18,20 object|24,31 object|28,31 person|29,30 object

Regardless of method , the winning seeker wins 30 points for his or her team , unlike the books , in which the snitch is worth 150 points .
2,3 abstract|4,7 person|8,10 abstract|11,15 organization|11,12 person|13,14 person|17,19 abstract|22,24 abstract|26,28 abstract

The creators of Muggle Quidditch thought that it was worth too many points so changed the value of the snitch for muggle Quidditch .
0,5 person|3,5 abstract|3,4 person|7,8 abstract|10,13 abstract|15,20 abstract|18,20 abstract|21,23 abstract|21,22 person

The snitch , generally a track runner , runs around ( usually the boundaries ) trying to evade the seekers .
0,2 person|4,7 person|12,14 place|18,20 person

The referee should ensure that rules are being followed .
0,2 person|5,6 abstract

They also keep track of the score .

Beaters can try hitting the bludgers around in the air with a shortened hockey sticks or a short bat .
0,1 person|4,6 object|8,10 place|11,15 object|16,19 object

They could also use regular-length hockey sticks to hit bludgers ( perhaps wiffle balls ) on the ground .
0,1 person|4,7 object|9,10 object|12,14 object|16,18 place

The simplest way is to just peg players by throwing dodge balls .
0,3 abstract|7,8 person|10,12 object

It may be easier to play without brooms ( but also less fun ! ) .
7,8 object

Remember that the snitch runner , if you choose to use one , is not an actual player in the game , therefore , not bound by any of the rules .
2,5 person|3,4 abstract|7,8 person|11,12 person|15,21 person|19,21 abstract|29,31 abstract

If desired , the snitch is able to do whatever he or she wants to avoid capture .

Another variation is where the referee places the snitch somewhere in the field ( in this case it 's a small ball ) .
0,2 abstract|4,6 person|7,9 object|11,13 place|15,17 abstract|17,18 object|19,22 object
