1. Introduction

Plastic mulching film ( PMF ) has been widely used in modern intensive farming in order to inhibit weed growth , increase soil temperature , reduce water evaporation , control the leaching of crop nutrients , and increase the yield .

About one million tons of petroleum-based PMF is consumed annually in the farmlands of China .

However , petroleum-based PMF is not easily degraded in farmland , and its bio-degradation rate is very low even after years of exposure to soil microbial communities .

Furthermore , wind and rain erosion often cause the entire film to break into small pieces , thus making the recycling very difficult and time-consuming .

This section explores the general lessons that can be elicited from the disparate results outlined above .

One way to attempt a global interpretation of results of this experiment is to differentiate between a user ’s general beliefs and attitudes regarding technology , and a specific perception to a particular application .

In the case of our participants , how they approached the system-specific tasks — especially in the face of difficulty or negative feedback , for example , at the hands of the error message in the map , or the unexpected navigation screen — might be indicative of their a priori attitude towards digital or mobile use in general .
