Have a successful life. Our god created us to benefit the whole humanity. If you are a student study hard and try to be the best student. If you are an employee work hard and try to be the best employee. If you are a sportsman try to be the best in your field. Whatever your work was try to be the best to benefit yourself and people around you. Do all of that to get the prize from your god not from people around you.

Don't be from people who don't believe anything or who don't care about what will happen after their death or who say simply: after I die I will know what should happen to me! Our god created us to care about our unlimited life and gave us a mind to think about our final destination.
