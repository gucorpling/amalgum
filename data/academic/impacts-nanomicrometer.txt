 1. IntroductionTight gas has attracted worldwide attention since the exploration of the large Cretaceous Balnco low-permeability gas field in the San Juan Basin in North America. Tight sandstone gas serves as an important alternative to the conventional petroleum resources and shows good resource prospect [1,2,3]. Tight sandstone gas has been discovered in more than 70 basins worldwide, which are mainly distributed in North America, Europe, and Asia. The United States and China are two main producers of tight sands gas; the United States has a tight sandstone gas reserve of 42.5 × 1012 m3 with an annual production of 1754 × 108 m3 [4,5]. The exploration of tight sandstone gas has developed rapidly in the past decades in China, and prolific tight gas reservoirs have been discovered in the Ordos Basin, Sichuan Basin, and Songliao Basin [6,7,8,9].Tight sandstone gas is generally referred to as the tight sandstone reservoirs with complex gas and water distributions, low gas saturation, and continuous accumulation characteristics [7]. The tight gas sandstone reservoir is defined as gas-bearing sandstone reservoirs with porosity <10%, in situ permeability <0.1 × 10−3 mD or absolute permeability <1.0 × 10−3 mD, gas saturation <60%, and pore-throat radius <1 μm [10,11,12].Tight sandstone gas reservoirs are characterized by inter-bedded or closely distributed source rock and reservoirs, small pore and throat radii, high water saturation, and non-tectonic controlled gas distributions [13,14,15,16]. The low gas saturation and complex gas and water distributions are the main risks for the exploration and recovery enhancement of tight sandstone gas [17,18,19,20,21]. The gas saturation varies and has a heterogeneous distribution poorly correlated with reservoir quality [22,23]. Porosity and permeability are no longer suitable for the prediction of gas enrichment zones in tight sandstone gas reservoirs. Moreover, gas saturation and distribution are determined by the gas migration and accumulation patterns [24,25,26]. Due to the nano-micrometer pore system in tight sandstone reservoirs, the capillary pressure increases evidently in tight sandstone. The buoyancy is invalid in driving gas flow and the overpressure becomes the dominant driving force for gas migration [27,28,29,30]. Spencer has emphasized that driving pressure difference decides the degrees of gas migration and accumulation in tight sandstone reservoirs [29]. The ultra-high capillary pressure generated by formation water in the pore space becomes the main resistance for the gas migration in tight sandstone reservoirs [10,21,31,32]. As the resistance is determined by the pore geometries, pore structure becomes an important factor for gas migration and accumulation [17]. The heterogeneity of gas saturation and distribution is attributable to the complex microscopic pore structure of tight sandstone reservoirs [33,34,35]. Therefore, pore structure characterization and gas migration characteristics have become the focus of current studies. Pore size, genesis, morphology, and fractal characteristics have been thoroughly investigated by various techniques including mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), low temperature N2 absorption (LTNA), and X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) [36,37,38]. Recent studies tend to characterize the full-range pore size distribution by integration of several techniques, such as NMR and MIP, LTNA and NMR, and MIP and X-CT [39,40,41]. These studies provide mature methodology and sufficient information for the pore structure of tight sandstone reservoirs. The gas flow regimes have been clearly stated by experimental and numerical simulations, including the Darcy, high-velocity non-Darcy, and low-velocity non-Darcy flows [42,43,44,45,46]. However, these results are based on the discussions of single-phase fluid flow and have differences with the gas migration process, which is rarely involved. Zeng firstly proposed the minimum migration pressure gradients by investigating the gas flow in migration in tight sandstone reservoirs and indicated that porosity and permeability influences the gas flow patterns, minimum migration pressure gradients, and gas saturation [47]. Moreover, absent evaluations in the relationships between pore structures and gas flows result in uncertainties in the intrinsic microscopic controlling factors for the gas flow in migration. Therefore, combined pore structure characterization and gas migration simulation appear to be necessary in revealing the impacts of pore structure on the gas migration and accumulation.The Upper Paleozoic Permian Daniudi gas field in the Ordos Basin was chosen as the study area for the heterogeneous reservoir qualities, complicated gas-water distribution, low gas saturation, and their poor internal relationships, which are similar to the tight gas reservoirs in the sedimentary basins in the North Sea and in North America [1,48,49,50,51,52]. In order to reveal the impacts of pore structure on the gas flow in migration and accumulation process in the tight sandstone, physical simulation experiments of gas migration and accumulation combined with X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) and casting thin section (CTS) analyses were conducted on the 13 samples collected from Shanxi and Lower Shihezi formations in the Daniudi gas field. The aims of this paper were as follows: (1) clarifying the gas flow regimes in migration and gas accumulation patterns in the tight sandstone reservoirs, (2) characterizing nano-micrometer scale pore structure of the tight sandstone reservoirs, (3) revealing the intrinsic microscopic controlling factors for gas flow and their impacts on gas migration and accumulation. 2. Geological SettingsThe Ordos Basin is an inherited craton basin located in the north of the northern China platform with an area of 25 × 104 km2. The regional structure appears as a gently western-dipping monocline, which can be divided into six first-order structural units including the Yimeng uplift, the Weibei uplift, the western margin thrust belts, the Shanbei slope, the Tianhuan depression, and the Jinxi flexure belts (Figure 1a) [53,54]. The Upper Paleozoic Permian Shanxi and Lower Shihezi formations are the major gas-bearing layers in the Ordos basin. The transitional facies of barrier coast system and deltaic and fluvial strata constitute a complete source-reservoir-cap assemblage, the coal strata and thick mudstone in the lower part of Shanxi formation act as regional source rock, the deltaic and fluvial sediments are the main reservoir bodies, and the regional continental mudstone deposited in the Upper Shihezi and Shiqianfeng formations forms the regional cap of the whole petroleum system (Figure 1b) [55,56,57].The study area, Daniudi gas field, is a typical Upper Paleozoic tight gas reservoir located in the northeastern of the Shanbei slope. The fine sandstone and pebbly medium sandstone formed in the deltaic and fluvial sediments act as the main reservoir bodies of the Shanxi and Lower Shihezi formations [58,59,60]. The high residual paleopressure in the Carboniferous and Permian source rocks that developed during the late Triassic and early Cretaceous, ranging from 5.0–20.0 MPa, provides the driving forces required for the gas migration in the same period [61]. The tight gas is characterized by low gas abundance, inter-bedded gas layers in longtitude, and planar wide gas distribution [62]. The heterogeneous gas distribution is the main risk for the exploration and development of tight gas [62,63] (Figure 1a,c).The Permian tight gas sandstone in the study area shares similar geological characteristics, including the co-existence, closely distributed, or interbedded source and reservoir rock, discontinuous reservoir sand bodies, isolated reservoirs in the same formation with low porosity and ultra-low permeability, sequences deposited in shallow marine and fluvial-deltaic environments, and the complex gas–water distributions, with the typical tight sandstone reservoirs in the Upper Jurassic Cotton valley sandstone in east Texas [52], Cretaceous Mesaverde Group in the Piceance Basin [50], and Greater Green River Basin in the Rocky Mountain Basins in America [16], Cretaceous sandstone in the eastern Albert Basin in western Canada [15], and the Dutch sector of the Southern North Sea [49]. Therefore, the same geological scenarios in the Permian tight gas sandstone reservoirs probably can be found in the tight sandstone reservoirs in North America and North Sea, and the study in the Permian tight sandstone reservoirs in the Ordos Baisn may provide insights for the further research on the tight sandstone in the sedimentary basins worldwide. 3. Methods 3.1. Sample InformationThirteen samples were collected from seven gas-producing wells (Figure 1) in the Upper Paleozoic Permian Shanxi and Lower Shihezi tight sandstone formations in the Daniudi gas field. Cylindrical samples with lengths of ~5.0 cm and diameters of ~2.5 cm were drilled perpendicularly from the fresh core in the wellbore, covering the depths of 2344.80–2804.38 m. The samples mainly consisted of lithic quartz sandstone and litharenite, followed by quartzose sandstone, which are medium-to-coarse grained. The sandstone has a low compositional maturity, with an average quartz content of 73.9%, an average rock fragment content of 19.5%, and a low average feldspar content of less than 3%. 3.2. Experimental Methods 3.2.1. Measurements of Porosity and PermeabilityThe residual hydrocarbons and salt in the samples were firstly removed using a mixed solution of alcohol and trichloromethane. Then, the samples were dried for 24 h at 120 °C before porosity and permeability measurements [64]. The helium porosity was measured by the helium porosimeter and the permeability was measured by the nitrogen permeation analyzer in the state key laboratory of the China University of Petroleum (Beijing) under a confining pressure of 1.5 MPa, following the standard SY/T 5336-2006 in China, and the information is listed in Table 1. The measuring accuracies of the porosity and permeability determined by the testing instruments were 0.01% with errors of ±0.5%, and 0.001 mD with errors of ±0.1%, respectively. 3.2.2. Physical Simulation of Gas Migration and AccumulationThe physical simulations of gas migration and accumulation were conducted on the samples using the Multiphase Core Flooding instrument in the state key laboratory of the China University of Petroleum (Beijing). The instrument is consisted of fluid intrusion system (ISCO pump), core flooding system (piston container and Hassler core holder), pressure and temperature control system including thermostat, confining pressure pump, back pressure regulator, fluid monitoring and metering system, and automatic data acquisition system (Figure 2).The core plugs were firstly evacuated and saturated with formation water with a salinity of 50 g/L. The brine-saturated core plugs were placed into the core holder with experimental temperature and confining pressure setting to 85 °C and 22 MPa, respectively, which are consistent with formation pressure and temperature. Nitrogen was employed in the experiment for its similar physical properties compared to natural gas, with a density of 1.16 g/cm3 and viscosity of 17.54 µPa·s. The pressure transient method was used in the simulation experiments. The inlet pressure was gradually increased and kept constant for a period of time in the beginning stage, and was maintained until a stable velocity of gas flow was detected in the outlet. The pressure differences and stable velocities were recorded, and the accuracies of the injection pressure and fluid flow velocity were 0.001 MPa and 0.001 mL/min, respectively, with errors of ±1%, which were determined by the pressure transducer and flow meter of the flooding instrument. With increasing injection pressure, 10–15 data points were recorded accordingly. The experiment was not stopped until there was no longer water producing in the outlet and the flow velocities of inlet and outlet were equal. 3.2.3. Pore Structure CharacterizationAfter the physical simulation, seven samples with different gas migration and accumulation characteristics were chosen. The samples were evacuated and dried for 12 h at 120 °C before the pore structure characterization analysis. Slices with thickness <3 mm were cut from the top of the core plugs and grinded into thin sections of ~0.3 mm. The thin sections impregnated by blue resin were observed by polarizing optical scope to probe the size, morphology, and fillings of the pores. A total of 10 micrographs were collected for each sample. X-CT scanning was performed on the remaining parts of the seven core plugs using the Zeiss Xradia Versa-510 micro-CT instrument in the state key laboratory of the China University of Petroleum (Beijing). The samples were placed into the micro-CT for scanning with a voltage of 120 kV, a current of 10 µA, a resolution of 2 μm, and a horizon of 5000 × 5000 × 5000 μm3. A total of 991 tomography images were collected with an exposure time of 20 s and reconstructed to three dimensional (3D) grayscale images using the Zeiss reconstruction software. A representative volume of 500 × 500 × 500 pixels were chosen from the reconstructed 3D images after noise removal using the FEI Avizo Fire 9.0.1. Threshold grayscale segmentation was then performed on the representative volume to separate the pores from rock matrix on the basis of the X-ray absorption differences in the materials with varied density according to the Law of Bill (Equation (1)), and the segmentation process is displayed in Figure 3.

Results 4.1. Gas Flow Regimes of Gas Migration in Tight Sandstone ReservoirsThe gas migration in tight sandstone reservoirs is a process in which the natural gas continuously displaces the formation water in the pores and throats under the driving of overpressure. The seepage curves revealed that gas flow in migration deviated from Darcy flow and was characterized by an evident “threshold pressure gradient”, which represented the additional pressure gradient required for overcoming the resistance and starting fluid flow (Figure 4). Two flow regimes were found in the gas migration, including a concave seepage curve with non-linear flow in low-velocity stage and linear flow in relative high-velocity stage that can be described by piecewise functions as shown in Equation (2), describing the curved segment on the gas flow curve using the power function and describing the linear segment using the linear function according to the large quantity of experimental results [68], as well as a linear flow curve disjointed to the origin with an intercept on the x-axis, which can be described by Equation (3) [69].

The linear gas flow generally had a gas flow velocity and a lower threshold pressure square gradient greater than the non-linear gas flow (Figure 4).Threshold pressure gradient has been regarded as a key parameter in characterizing the non-Darcy flow in single-phase gas flow, which is generally calculated by the application of non-Darcy equation and mathematic fitting [42,43,44,70]. For the linear gas flow, threshold pressure gradient is the intercept of the linear equation on the x-axis, and can be replaced by the value of “d” in Equation (3). When considering the non-linear gas flow, as any point on the curve follows the non-Darcy flow equation (Equation (4), which is the transformation of Equation (3), Equation (4) can be expanded into Equation (5), and the experimental values of velocity and pressure square gradient can be fitted in the form of Equation (6) according to the non-Darcy flow equation [71].

However, the physical simulation of gas migration was different from the conventional single-phase gas flow simulation. Although any point on the flow curves follows single-phase gas flow, the water saturation varied between different points, resulting in the limited application of non-Darcy equation in calculating the threshold pressure gradient. The threshold pressure gradient exhibits different physical significance from the common one, representing the minimum pressure square gradient required to displace the formation water in tight sandstone reservoirs. This issue is explained to avoid further conceptual confusion and misapplication.The apparent permeability provides an effective way to characterize two or multiphase flow in porous media for its accuracy in describing the flow characteristics of single fluid in multiphase flow and would not be affected by the other phase of fluid, which can be calculated by the apparent permeability Equation (7).

The variations of apparent permeability in the gas flow process can be divided into two segments, in which the gas apparent permeability increases steadily in the beginning stage and then becomes stable in the later stage with the continuously increasing pressure square gradient. According to the analysis of 13 samples (Figure 5), the apparent permeability had a strictly logarithmic correlation with the pressure square gradient in the semi-log coordinate. This correlation can be described by a general fitting equation (Equation (8)) according to the numerical fitting (Table 2). Accordingly, the positive real roots of the fitting equation if the apparent permeability was assumed to be zero were defined as the minimum migration pressure square gradients, representing the minimum driving forces required to start the gas migration in water-saturated tight sandstone reservoirs. The stable gas apparent permeability in the later stage indicated the formation of a main pathway for gas flow in the pore system and corresponded to a secondary large-scale gas migration in the formation scale. Therefore, we defined the minimum pressure square gradient that had a difference of 5% or less with the stable apparent permeability as the stable migration pressure square gradient. The two migration pressure square gradients had errors of ±1%, which were determined by the experiment instruments.Figure 5 shows that there were two types of apparent permeability variations in the tight sandstone reservoirs, one of which was characterized by low minimum and stable migration pressure square gradients, a rapid growth of apparent permeability, and a high stable apparent permeability, but the other one was characterized by greater migration pressure gradients, a slow-growing pattern of apparent permeability, and a lower stable apparent permeability. 4.2. Gas Accumulation Patterns in the Tight Sandstone ReservoirAs gas migrates into the pore spaces and displaces the formation water in them by overcoming the capillary pressure, the gas will accumulate in the pore space during this procedure and result in gas saturation growth. We proposed a saturation equation to calculate the gas saturation in the cylindrical samples.

However, the growth patterns varied in tight sandstone reservoirs, which can be divided into three types, namely, type I with a small entry pressure square gradient of initial saturation growth, ranging from 0.046 to 0.049 MPa2/cm, a rapid saturation growth pattern, and a high ultimate gas saturation (maximum saturation that did not grow with the continuously increasing pressure square gradient), ranging from 68 to 92%; type II that was characterized by a greater initial entry pressure square gradient of 0.047–0.081 MPa2/cm, a rapid-to-slow saturation growth pattern, and a high maximum saturation of 73–92%; and type III with a greatest initial entry pressure square gradient, ranging from 0.18 to 0.21 MPa2/cm, a slow gas growth pattern, and a lower ultimate gas saturation between 33% and 50% (Figure 6 and Table 3). 4.3. Pore Structure Characterization of the Tight Sandstone Reservoirs 4.3.1. Pore TypesThe casting thin section observation revealed the existence of primary residual intergranular pore, secondary dissolution intergranular and intragranular pores, moldic pore, and intercrystlline pore in the tight sandstone reservoirs. The plane-viewed porosity of tight sandstone was dominated by secondary porosity, which was characterized by dissolution intergranular and intragranular pores, followed by a small amount of intercrystalline pores (Figure 7). The pore types varied between different tight sandstone samples. Primary and dissolution intergranular pores dominated the pore space in the samples of S52-1 (Figure 7a) and S57-6 (Figure 7d). The pore size ranged from 10 to 100 μm. The spatial distribution of the pore system was dominated by connected and superimposed large pores (Figure 8a,b). The dissolution intergranular pores dominated the plane-viewed porosity of the samples of S8-12 (Figure 7b) and S35-6 (Figure 7e), followed by a little amount of dissolution intragranular and intercrystalline pores. The pore size ranged from hundreds of nanometers to dozens of micrometers. The connected and superimposed large pores occupied the main bodies of the pore system, but there were some sparsely distributed pores with tiny size and single color code in the spatial distribution (Figure 8c–e). For the samples of S8-14 (Figure 7c) and S31-7 (Figure 7f), the intergranular porosity reduced evidently, and dissolution intragranular and intercrystalline pores had higher porosity contributions, resulting in declines in pore size. The proportion of tiny pores with sparse and isolated spatial distribution increased (Figure 8f,g). Distinction in pore types was a dominant factor responsible for the differences in pore structures of the tight sandstone reservoirs. 4.3.2. Pore and Throat Size DistributionsThe pore and throat size distributions refer to the frequency distribution of different-sized pore and throats. The pore and throat radii obtained from pore network modelling suggested that the pores in tight sandstone reservoirs had a wide distribution between several hundreds of nanometers and several hundreds of micrometers (Figure 9a). There are many ongoing studies on the pore classification in the tight sandstone reservoirs, and the pores are generally divided by pore sizes and their quantitative proportions. International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) divided the pores into micropores (<2 nm), mesopores (2–50 nm), and macropores (>50 nm) [72]. Loucks extended the classification in siltstone and classified the pores into nanopores (1 nm−1 μm), micropores (1–62.5 μm), and mesopores (>62.5 μm) [73]. Qiao further extended the Loucks classification by combining previous studies with his studies on the tight sandstone in the Ordos Basin and divided the pores into four categories, including micropores (<2 μm), small pores (2–10 μm), mespores (10–20 μm), and macropores (>20 μm) [53]. It is apparent that the classifications of IUPAC and Loucks will result in disproportions of the mesopores, and the classification proposed by Qiao appears to be appropriate in describing the pore types in tight gas sandstone of the study area according to the thin section observations and pore size distributions. Additionally, we proposed Equation (10) to evaluate the porosity contribution of different types of pores.

The pore size distribution also varied in different tight sandstone samples. In the samples of S52-1 and S57-6, the pores distributed in the range 500 nm–200 μm and were dominated by small pores and mesopores and followed by macropores in terms of quantity. The results indicated that the macropores had a dominant porosity contribution of more than 99% in the two samples. Taking both of the quantitative proportions and porosity contributions into consideration, the reservoirs were defined as the macropore dominant type. In the samples of S35-6, S8-12, and S54-11, the proportions of small pores and micropores increased, whereas those of macropores and mesopores decreased. The average porosity contributions of macropores, mesopores, small pores, and micropores were 72.33%, 22.31%, 5.18%, and 0.074%, respectively. These reservoirs can be classified as the full pore type. For the samples of S8-14 and S31-7, the pores were dominated by small pores (61.54%) in terms of quantity, with evident reductions in macropores (3.35%) and mesopores (26.08%). The mesopores and small pores had dominant average porosity contributions of 57.77% and 22.44%, respectively. These reservoirs were regarded as the meso-small pore dominant type (Table 4).The throat radius had a continuous distribution between several hundreds of nanometers and dozens of micrometers, concentrating in 500 nm–10 μm, having three kinds of throats in existence according to the classification proposed by Qiao [53], including fine throats with radius between 500 nm and 1μm, medium throats with radius ranging from 1 and 3 μm, and coarse throat with radius greater than 3 μm (Figure 9b). The throat radius distribution varied between different tight sandstone reservoirs. In the samples S52-1 and S57-6, the throat concentrated in the range between 2 and 20 μm and was dominated by coarse throat (average 62.96%), followed by medium throat (average 30.36%), which can be defined as the coarse throat dominant reservoir in terms of quantity. In the samples S35-6, S8-12, and S54-11, the throat radii decreased to the range of 2–14 μm, and average proportions of medium and fine throats increased. The coarse, medium, and fine throats all primarily contributed to the throats. These samples could be regarded as the full throat reservoir. With regard to the samples S8-14 and S31-7, the throat radii mainly distributed in the range 2–4 μm, and fine throat dominated the throats with an average proportion of 60.06%. There were no coarse throats, and there was a relatively small amount of medium throats in the reservoirs (average 39.94%). Thus, they can be defined as the fine throat-dominant reservoir (Table 5). 4.3.3. Pore–Throat ConnectivityThe skeleton models (Figure 10) indicated that the pore network connectivity of tight sandstone was poor, with low average coordination number ranging from 0.015 to 0.109 and high pore-throat ratio between 2.60 and 4.86 (Table 6). The results revealed a positive relationship between pore size and coordination number in the tight sandstone reservoirs. Macropores were generally connected by several to tens of throats, mesopores were connected with 6–10 throats, small pores were generally connected with 4–6 throats, and micropores were partly connected by 1–2 throats or no throats (Figure 10a,b). The macropore-dominant samples S52-1 and S57-6 (Figure 10a,b) with an average coordination number of 0.096 and a pore–throat ratio of 2.62, having better connectivity when compared with the full-pore form (S35-6, S8-12, and S54-11) with a coordination number of 0.067 and a ratio of 2.87 (Figure 10c–e), and the small pore-dominant form with an average coordination number of 0.016 and a ratio of 4.78 (Figure 10f,g). The tortuosity of the seven samples are calculated according to the Tortuosity Equation (11).

The meso-small pore dominant reservoir had an higher average tortuosity of 52.09 compared with the full-pore form (S8-12, S35-6, and S54-11), with an average of 38.68, and macropore dominant form (S52-1 and S57-6), with an average of 45.93 (Table 6). 4.3.4. Pore Structure Parameters and Pore–Throat CombinationsThe detailed pore structure parameters such as average pore and throat radii, average coordination number, average pore-throat ratio, and tortuosity are listed in Table 6. On the basis of the combination of pore and throat, the micro-nanometer pore networks of the seven samples can be classified into three categories, including the macropore and coarse throat dominant type, full-pore and full-throat type, and meso-small pore and fine throat dominant type (Table 6). 5. Discussion 5.1. The Impacts of Pore Structure on Gas MigrationPorosity and permeability have been considered as the important factors influencing the gas migration and accumulation in low-permeability reservoirs. Previous publications suggest that the seepage curves and threshold pressure gradients vary regularly with the variations of permeability and porosity of low-permeability reservoirs [23,74,75], whereas some others have argued there is no regular correlations between porosity and gas flow characteristics. The results confirmed that the seepage curves deviated to the pressure square gradient axis with decreasing permeability, and that the gas flow patterns changed from linear flow to non-linear flow simultaneously (Figure 4). However, the impact of porosity was irregular. The minimum and stable migration pressure square gradients were poorly correlated with the porosity (Figure 11a) and permeability (Figure 11b) with coefficients less than 0.80, indicating that porosity and permeability were not the intrinsic controlling factors for gas migration (Figure 11).The poor correlations between porosity, permeability, and gas migration are intrinsically attributed to the heterogeneous microscopic pore structure of tight sandstone reservoirs [35,45,76,77,78]. Strong negative correlations between the two key migration pressure square gradients and average pore and throat radii (Figure 12a,b) indicated that the pore and throat radii directly controlled the gas flow in migration, and greater pore and throat radii were favorable for the gas flow in migration. The results agreed with the Washburn Equation [79], in which the pore–throat radius is one of the dominant factors controlling the capillary pressure. With increasing pore and throat radii, it became much easier for gas to migrate into the pore space and to form a stable flow steam in the pore system due to resistance reductions. Moreover, throats exhibited influences on gas migration stronger than the pores because the throats were much narrower than the pores connected to them and could determine the resistance of gas flow between pores, which was supported by the higher correlation coefficient (Figure 12a,b). Both of the two migration pressure gradients had positive correlations with pore–throat ratio (Figure 12c), suggesting that high pore–throat differences were unfavorable for the gas flow between pores due to the increases in capillary pressure differences between pore and throat spaces.The strong impacts of pore structure parameters on gas flow in migration consequently resulted in close relations between pore–throat combinations and gas migration characteristics. The gas migrated in a deviated Darcy linear flow regime with lower minimum and stable migration pressure gradients in the macropore and coarse throat dominant and full-pore and full-throat reservoirs, but had a non-linear flow regime with higher migration pressure gradients in meso-small pore and fine throat dominant reservoir (Table 7). 5.2. The Impacts of Pore Structure on Gas Accumulation 5.2.1. The Impacts of Pore Structure on the Capacity of Gas Accumulation in Tight Sandstone ReservoirsThe risking factors of tight gas exploration lay in the unpredictable relations between gas saturation, permeability, and porosity. The ultimate gas saturation, the maximum gas saturation value that derived from the simulation experiments, represented the gas storage capacity of tight sandstone reservoirs if the driving forces always met the requirements. The ultimate gas saturation had a strong positive correlation with permeability (Figure 13a) but was relatively poorly correlated with porosity, suggesting that the gas storage capacity was determined by the connected pores (Figure 13b). On the basis of the analysis method of effective and ineffective pores proposed by Zeng et al. 2017 [35], the ineffective pores with a coordination number of zero were removed and the volume fraction of connected pores in the interest area of micro-CT results, namely, the effective porosity, were calculated (Table 6). The results suggested that the gas storage capacity had a strong positive correlation with the connected effective porosity, also indicating that the existence of disconnected ineffective pores was the main factor responsible for the poor relationships between porosity and gas saturation (Figure 13b). With increasing pore and throat radii, the decreases in the difficulties of gas flow and the increases of proportion of connected pores in the pore system would result in enhancement in the gas accumulation capacity of the tight sandstone reservoirs. Therefore, great pore and throat radii were favorable for the gas storage capacities of the tight sandstone reservoirs (Figure 13c). It can be further inferred that the macropore and coarse throat dominant and the full-pore and full-throat reservoirs had better accumulation capacities than the meso-small pore and fine throat dominant form (Table 7). 5.2.2. The Control of Pore Structure on the Process of Gas AccumulationThe gas saturation grew as gas occupied more pore space with increasing pressure square gradient, but the growth pattern varied. The initial saturation growth pressure square gradient reflected the degree of gas accumulation difficulty, and its negative correlations with the average pore and throat radii confirmed that greater pore–throat radii were favorable for the gas accumulation (Figure 14). As gas saturation growth is a process in which gas accumulates in pores with different volumes, the pore size distribution was no longer suitable in evaluating the gas saturation growth process. Therefore, we proposed a method to calculate the effective porosity contributions of pores with different sizes (Equation (12)) and plot the cumulative curve of effective porosity contributions from marcopores to micropores (Figure 15a).

In the meso-small pore dominant reservoirs of S8-14, the cumulative curve of effective porosity contribution from macropores to micropores experienced a slow growth stage before it became stable (blue line in Figure 15a) and was consistent with its slow gas saturation growth pattern (green line in Figure 15b). Low porosity contribution of macropores and high contributions of mesopores and small pores would result in reductions in pore and throat radii and further lead to a greater increase of pressure square gradient required for a same incremental saturation growth, and a slower saturation growth rate. In the full-pore reservoir of S54-11, the cumulative curve experienced a rapid-slow growth pattern before it became stable (green line in Figure 15a), which was consistent with the gas saturation growth pattern (red line in Figure 15b). As the macropores, mesopores, and small pores played important roles in porosity, the gas saturation experienced a rapid growth period in the beginning stage as gas firstly migrated into macropores and mesopores and then slow down due to the capillary pressure increase caused by small pores and micropores. The small pores and micropores resulted in a larger pressure square gradient required for the same incremental saturation growth in the later stage. For the macropore-dominant reservoir of S52-1, the cumulative curve of effective porosity contribution experienced a rapid linear growth pattern (red line in Figure 15a). The same growth pattern was also found in the saturation growth curve (blue line in Figure 15b). As the dominant macropore porosity evidently decreased the incremental driving force required for the same incremental gas saturation growth, the gas saturation exhibited a rapid growth rate compared with the other two types of reservoirs. The differences in the effective porosity contributions of different pore types controlled the variations in the gas growth patterns of the tight sandstone reservoirs (Figure 15). It can be further inferred that the cumulative curves of effective porosity contributions from macropores to micropores can be employed to predict the ideal gas growth models in the tight sandstone reservoirs. 6. ConclusionsThrough the combined studies of the gas migration and accumulation simulation and pore characterization on the tight sandstone reservoirs of the Upper Paleozoic Permian in the Daniudi gas field, Ordos Basin, the conclusions can be drawn as follows:(1) There were two gas flow regimes in gas migration including the deviated Darcy linear flow and non-linear flow in tight sandstone gas reservoirs. The minimum migration pressure square gradient and the stable migration pressure gradient were identified as two key parameters in describing the gas flow states by the application of gas apparent permeability.(2) Three different gas saturation growth patterns were discovered in the process, including the rapid saturation growth model with high ultimate gas saturation, the rapid-to-slow saturation growth model with high ultimate gas saturation, and the slow saturation growth model with low ultimate gas saturation. The ultimate gas saturation directly reflected the capacity of gas accumulation in tight sandstone reservoirs.(3) The tight gas sandstone reservoirs were characterized by wide pore and throat distributions. Four pore types, including the micropore, small pore, mesopore, and macropore, and three throat types, including the fine, medium, and coarse throats, were identified in the pore system. The macropore and coarse throat dominant reservoir, full-pore and full-throat form, and the meso-small pore and fine throat dominant form were three main pore–throat combinations in tight sandstone reservoirs.(4) The unpredictable relationships between gas flow, porosity, and permeability were attributed to the complex pore structures. Average pore and throat radii were the microscopic controlling factors for the gas migration. The pore–throat ratio influenced gas migration by affecting the gas flow between pore and throat. Deviated Darcy linear flow commonly occurred in the macropore and coarse throat-dominant and full-pore and full-throat reservoirs, whereas non-linear flow generally occurred in the meso-small pore and fine throat dominant reservoir.(5) The connected effective porosity determined the gas accumulation capacity in tight sandstone reservoirs. The macropore and coarse throat dominant reservoir exhibited the highest gas accumulation potential among the three types of reservoirs. The cumulative porosity contributions of different pore types determined the gas accumulation process and were responsible for the differences in gas growth patterns. The cumulative curves of porosity contributions from macropores to micropores can be further applied to the prediction of ideal gas accumulation models in tight sandstone reservoir.
