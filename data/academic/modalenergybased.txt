 1. IntroductionHigh-rise buildings, towers, and long-span bridges need to be designed safely and reliably under the dynamic loads of earthquakes, wind, and vehicles. Modern structures have become longer and higher, and beautiful and economical designs have also become possible with the development of new materials and construction techniques. However, such modern structures are susceptible to excessive structural vibrations, which may induce problems in structural damage or even the loss of lives.Many approaches to structural vibration control (passive control, active control, hybrid control, etc.) have been proposed over the past decades. The passive control techniques generally dissipate the vibration energy of a structural system or change its dynamic characteristics. The passive control systems provide a reliable performance. However, it cannot be adapted by various load conditions. On the other hand, the active control techniques reduce the structural vibration using external control forces. The active control systems can be adapted by various external forces. However, the active control systems have several problems, such as stability and power requirements. The hybrid control techniques are control methods that combine passive and active control to improve control performance and safety. Among these, structural active control techniques using artificial neural networks (ANNs) were introduced in the mid-1990s. During this period, researchers used the learning ability of neural networks in the design of a controller to control structural vibration during earthquakes. Many researchers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] have presented active control algorithms using neural networks in civil engineering. Chen et al. [1] presented artificial neural networks to control the structural response of a 10-story San Jose apartment building to an earthquake simulated using real measured data. Ghaboussi and Joghataie [2] conducted a computer simulation on the active control of a three-story frame structure subjected to ground excitations. They used an emulator neural network to forecast the future response of the structure from the response in the previous steps. Then, a controller neural network was used to assess (train) the relation between the immediate history of the response of the structure and the actuator. Bani-Hani and Ghaboussi [3] applied an emulator neural network and a trained neuro-controller of a linear structure to active control of the nonlinear structure. Nonlinearly controlled neural networks were also used to control the response of the nonlinear structure. They then compared the effectiveness of the nonlinearly trained neuro-controller with that of the linearly trained neuro-controller and found that a trained neuro-controller can successfully control the response of nonlinear structures. Bani-Hani and Ghaboussi [4] applied the previously developed neuro-control algorithms to the benchmark problem of an active tendon system. Liut et al. [5] showed the applicability of neural network control of civil structures subjected to seismic excitations using the force-matching concept. Kim and Lee [6] proposed a new ANN learning algorithm using an objective function and sensitivity to solve the problems of the conventional ANN, which has shortcomings such as a longer learning time and the need to predetermine the desired structural response. Cho et al. [7] presented an algorithm for selecting the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer of a neural network controller based on a measure of the network performance and applied neural controllers to single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) and two-DOF systems subjected to the El Centro earthquakes. Generally, a supervised learning algorithm was adopted for ANN learning since an ANN was used to control the response of structures during the earthquakes. However, Madan [8] suggested a possible alternative approach to learning in a neural network for the active control of structures without the supervision of a teacher. Lee [9], in his dissertation, presented a neuro-controller to control the vibration of a structure using the state vectors of the structural response as inputs.In recent years, research on deep learning algorithms and optimal control problems have been actively conducted. Lewis [10] introduced the maximum principle of Pontryagin in optimal control. Jakubczyk and Sontag [11] presented mathematically controllability for discrete-time nonlinear systems using Lie algebraic approach. Mardanov and Sharifov [12] proved the Pontryagin’s maximum principle for optimal control multipoint boundary conditions. Greydanus et al. [13] led Hamiltonian neural networks (HNN) based on Hamilton mechanics, demonstrating that HNN is faster and more generalized than the baseline neural networks. Zhong et al. [14] also proposed a learning framework called Symplectic ODE-Net which encodes a generalization of the Hamiltonian dynamics. Zizouni et al. [15] adopted a magnetorheological (MR) damper as an algorithm to reduce the vibration of a reduced three-layer structure during an earthquake and controlled the MR damper using a neural network. A number of studies have been conducted on MR dampers to mitigate seismic response in civil engineering [16,17,18,19]. Fu et al. [20] conducted numerical analysis and shaking table tests on a six-story reinforced concrete frame structure using an MR damper isolation system and compared the control effect with those of a viscous damper and a friction damper. Demetriou and Nikitas [21] proposed a novel hybrid control device as an algorithm to reduce building vibration and compared the performance of a tuned mass damper (TMD), a semi-active TMD, and an active TMD. Ma et al. [22] studied numerically the performance of active vibration control on a rib-stiffened plate by using velocity feedback controllers of early actuators. Research using modal energy started from the semi-active and passive control field [23,24,25,26]. Lin [23] and Emad [24] performed studies to change a structural property (stiffness) using the modal energy transfer to reduce the response of a mechanical system subject to excitation. Benavent-Climent and Escolano-Margrit [25] performed shake table tests on RC frames with hysteretic dampers and showed that the seismic performance of RC frames with hysteretic damper was improved. Enriquez-Zarate et al. [26] performed numerical and experimental studies that analyzed the performance of a passive vibration control scheme in order to reduce the overall vibration response under movements provided by external forces using an electromagnetic actuator.In this paper, a modal-energy-based neuro-control (MENC) algorithm is proposed to reduce the structural seismic responses of a three-story nonlinear building frame. The previous vibration control algorithms using neural networks require an emulator for learning, whereas the proposed MENC algorithm does not require an emulator due to the use of the objective function and sensitivity algorithm. The MENC algorithm also adopts modal energy instead of the state vector of the structure in the learning process of neuro-control. An active mass damper (AMD) was installed in a three-story nonlinear building to simulate the control motion. The control force was exerted on the building by the AMD and was calculated by a hydraulic actuator. MATLAB/Simulink software was used to simulate the building, the AMD, and the hydraulic actuator. The El Centro earthquake was adopted to train the MENC algorithm. The six recorded earthquakes were used to verify the control capability of the proposed MENC algorithm concerning the nonlinear building during earthquakes. 2. Motion Equation of a Nonlinear Building SystemThe AMD installed on the roof of a three-story nonlinear building is used to control the dynamic response of the structure (see Figure 1). The AMD control system consists of sensors, a controller, and a hydraulic actuator. The structural response is measured by the sensors and fed back to the controller. Then the controller computes at real-time the active control force
f
 according to a control algorithm and turns it into control voltage to be exerted to drive the hydraulic actuator. The hydraulic actuator is operated by the control signal generated by the neuro-controller. Lastly, the AMD attached to the actuator applies a reaction force, caused by the inertial force of the AMD, to the structure. Therefore, actuator–structure interaction is included in the system.The differential equation of the three-story nonlinear structure with an AMD is

Multilayer PerceptronFigure 2 shows the structure of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm [28]. The MLP algorithm has three layers: the input, hidden, and output layers. The input and hidden layers have three nodes and the output layer has one node in this study. The input layer passes the inputs to the hidden layer through the activation function. Then, the inputs are weighted and transferred to the nodes of the hidden layer. The hidden layer is also transferred to the output layer through the activation function. The nodes of the hidden layer are weighted and transferred to the node of the output layer.

 4. Numerical AnalysisTo verify the effectiveness of the MENC algorithm, a three-story building was installed with the AMD (in Figure 1), which was used to reduce the response of the structure under seismic load. The structural properties and simulation parameters of the previous neuro-controller system were used to compare its capabilities [6]. The parameters of the structure and AMD system are shown in Table 1. The sampling time was 0.005 s, and the delay time was assumed to be 0.0005 s. The equation of motion was integrated at every 0.00025 s using MATLAB/Simulink software. The MENC algorithm is used to calculate the accurate control command to be exerted on the AMD system. 4.1. Training the Neuro-ControllerFor the simulation of the MENC algorithm, the input layer has three nodes: the displacement, the acceleration of the third floor, and the ground acceleration. Here, the displacement was calculated by integrating the acceleration, and the modal energy for each mode was used for training the MENC algorithm. The hidden layer has three nodes. The output layer has one node, which is the control signal. The tan-sigmoid function was used as the activation function of the hidden layer and output layer. The control signal was normalized to the maximum assumed output voltage, which was 3 volts.The weight factors for each mode were

, respectively, in the objective function (in Equation (25)). The weight factor of the first mode was determined by the largest value due to the modal participating factor. The mode shape of the building was used to calculate the modal energy. The El Centro earthquake, one of the most famous earthquakes, was selected for the training of the MENC algorithm. Considering the repetitive training time, the 10-second range with a lot of energy of the El Centro earthquake (1940) were used for the training data (see Figure 3). Training was repeated 200 times. The histories of the objective functions of the MLP and MENC algorithm are shown in Figure 4. It can be seen that the objective function of the proposed MENC algorithm converged faster than did that of the MLP algorithm. In other words, the proposed MENC algorithm is faster than the MLP algorithm in the training process. 4.2. Comparison of Control ResultsThe California, Northridge, Landers, Cape, San Simeon, and Loma Prieta earthquakes obtained from PEER Center [29] were used to verify the proposed algorithm regarding nonlinear building structures under seismic loads after training (see Figure 5). Figure 6 shows a comparison of the results of controlled response on the third floor of the building using MLP and MENC. Compared with MLP, the decreasing rate of the maximum displacement by the MENC algorithm is shown in Table 2. Comparison results of the MLP and MENC algorithms showed the maximum displacement reduction rate (54.83%) under the Landers earthquake and the minimum displacement reduction rate (16.77%) under the San Simeon earthquake. Therefore, it was found that the proposed MENC algorithm is able to effectively reduce the structural responses under unknown earthquakes than conventional MLP. 4.3. Numerical Analysis of Nonlinear Building StructuresFigure 7 shows the control signal and control force exerted on the structure by the AMD during the seismic loads, respectively.Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the responses (displacement and acceleration) to control and non-control of the nonlinear building structure by the proposed MENC algorithm in the event of the California earthquake and the Northridge earthquake, respectively. The California earthquake and the Northridge earthquake were not used in the training.The decreasing rate of the maximum responses on the seismic loads is also shown in Table 3. The decreasing rates of the maximum displacement and acceleration on the third floor were 78.12% and 88.48%, respectively. Therefore, it was found that the proposed MENC algorithm could significantly reduce the structural response under unknown seismic load if applied to the AMD system.The modal energies of the nonlinear building structures during the California and Northridge earthquakes are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11, respectively. The total energy, including the modal energy and the control energy of the building during both earthquakes, was remarkably reduced through the proposed MENC algorithm. Also, it was found that the first modal energy affected the whole structure’s energy because the first mode is dominant in this structure’s case. The total modal energy of the nonlinear building structure during the remaining four earthquakes is shown in Figure 12.Figure 13 shows the relationships between the restoring force and the displacement on the first floor of the building structure caused by the seismic loads. Figure 13 also shows the non-controlled and controlled responses caused by the seismic loads, indicating that the target structure behaved nonlinearly. Differently from linear structures which have constant stiffness, nonlinear structures need to establish the structural restoring force model to determine its stiffness at every moment [30]. If the structural displacement is greater than the structural yield displacement, the structure enters the plastic range. While nonlinear hysteretic behaviors appeared in the non-control responses, this nonlinear behavior almost entirely disappeared after control under all earthquakes. 5. ConclusionsA modal-energy-based neuro-controller (MENC) algorithm was presented to reduce structural vibration under seismic load. The applicability of the presented control algorithm was demonstrated through numerical analysis. A three-story nonlinear building was installed with an active mass damper, which was used to verify the applicability of the proposed control algorithm. The El Centro earthquake was adopted to train the modal-energy-based neuro-controller. Six recorded earthquakes obtained from PEER center [29] were employed to consider unknown earthquakes effects after training. The results of the proposed control algorithm were compared with those obtained from a non-controlled response and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The key observations and findings of this research can be summarized as follows:The proposed MENC algorithm was faster compared to the MLP algorithm in the training process to control the seismic load of an active mass damper.The proposed MENC algorithm is able to effectively reduce the structural responses under unknown earthquakes than conventional MLP.The proposed MENC algorithm was able to significantly reduce the structural response under all used seismic loads when applied to an AMD system.The structural responses and modal energy were suppressed effectively by the MENC algorithm. In addition, the first modal energy affected the whole structure’s energy because the first mode is dominant in this structure’s case.From the restoring force results, the non-controlled structural responses exhibited nonlinear hysteretic behaviors. This nonlinear behavior almost disappeared after control by the proposed MENC algorithm. Therefore, when the structure is in the nonlinear state, the proposed MENC algorithm can effectively reduce the seismic response by the control signal in real time depending on the structural responses.This algorithm should be considered in future experimental research in order to achieve more practical vibration control of nonlinear building structures under seismic loads. In addition, it is necessary to suggest the possibility of applying the proposed vibration control algorithm to other electric power systems [31] and offshore wind turbines [32].
