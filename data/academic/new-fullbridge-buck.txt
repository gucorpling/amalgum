 1. IntroductionElectronic power converters as drivers for DC motors have been recently studied [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. According to the literature on power converters, the Buck [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23], the Boost [24,25,26], and the Buck-Boost [27,28,29,30] topologies are the most used. The Buck topology received the most attention. This is, in part, due to the fact that the mathematical model of the Buck topology is linear and, compared with the Boost and the Buck-Boost topologies, the Buck topology does not have a nonminimum phase output variable [31]. As the present paper focuses on the Buck power converter as a driver for a DC motor, a review of state-of-the-art of this topic is presented below. 1.1. Related WorkThe literature reviewed has been divided into two approaches: (1) DC/DC Buck converter–DC motor systems [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20] and (2) DC/DC Buck converter–inverter–DC motor systems [21,22,23].Regarding a DC motor when it is fed by a DC/DC Buck converter, the most relevant literature is the following; Lyshevski, in [1], designed a nonlinear PI control that regulates the velocity of the motor shaft. Ahmad et al., in [2], presented a performance assessment of the PI, fuzzy PI, and LQR controls for the tracking problem. Bingöl and Paçaci reported, in [3], a virtual laboratory based on neural networks to control the angular velocity. Sira-Ramírez and Oliver-Salazar [4] used the concepts of active disturbance rejection and differential flatness to design a tracking control for two configurations of a DC/DC Buck converter connected to a DC motor. In [5], Silva-Ortigoza et al. introduced a two-stage sensorless tracking control based on flatness, whose implementation was executed via a
Σ
–
Δ
-modulator. In [6], Hoyos et al. designed a robust adaptive quasi-sliding mode regulation control, which is generated through the zero average dynamics (ZAD) technique and a fixed point inducting control (FPIC). Later, Silva-Ortigoza et al. proposed a robust hierarchical control approach based on differential flatness in [7]. Wei et al. in [8] reported a robust adaptive controller based on dynamic surface and sliding mode. A two-stage controller based on sliding mode plus PI control and flatness was reported by Silva-Ortigoza et al. in [9]. Hernández-Guzmán et al., in [10], proposed a simple control scheme by using sliding mode, to regulate the converter current, and three PI controls. These latter to regulate the converter voltage, the motor current, and the angular velocity. Moreover, via sensorless load torque estimation schemes, a passive tracking control based on the exact tracking error dynamics was proposed by Kumar and Thilagar in [11]. Khubalkar et al., in [12], presented the design and realization of standalone digital fractional order PID control for the Buck converter–DC motor system, where the dynamic particle swarm optimization (dPSO) technique is used to tune the gains and the order of the control. By using the concept of differential flatness and a derivative-free nonlinear Kalman filter, Rigatos et al., in [13], designed a control to solve the trajectory tracking problem. Another solution was proposed by Nizami et al. in [14], where a neuroadaptive backstepping tracking control was developed for the system. The dynamic analysis of the Buck converter that uses the combined ZAD-FPIC technique to control the speed of the DC motor, when different reference values are considered, was developed in [15] by Hoyos et al. Khubalkar et al., in [16], presented for the DC/DC Buck converter driving a DC motor a digital implementation of a fractional order PID control, whose parameters are tuned through the improved inertia weight dPSO technique. A flatness-based tracking control implemented in successive loops was presented by Rigatos et al. in [17]. More recently, the speed regulation problem was addressed by Yang et al. in [18], by using a robust predictive control via a discrete-time reduced-order GPI observer. Additionally, other important contributions related to the connection of a DC/DC Buck converter and a DC motor have been reported in [19,20].On the other hand, regarding a DC motor when it is fed by a DC/DC Buck converter–inverter, the literature is as follows. In [21], Silva-Ortigoza et al. developed and experimentally validated a mathematical model associated with the DC/DC Buck converter–inverter–DC motor system. Silva-Ortigoza et al. reported, in [22], a passive tracking control based on the exact tracking error dynamics. Robust tracking controls were proposed by Hernández-Márquez et al. in [23]. 1.2. Discussion of Related Work and ContributionIn accordance with the aforementioned, different approaches have been proposed for a DC motor fed by a DC/DC Buck converter when the unidirectional rotation of the motor shaft is considered [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]. This unidirectional rotation emerges because the Buck converter only delivers unipolar voltages. In this regard, when an inverter is integrated between the converter and the DC motor, bidirectional rotation of the motor shaft is achieved, giving rise to the “DC/DC Buck converter–inverter–DC motor” system [21]. Related to this system, the trajectory tracking problem has been addressed in [22,23]. Note that as such a system includes an inverter connected to the DC motor, an abrupt behavior of the voltages and currents is generated because of the hard switching of the transistors composing the inverter; consequently, the useful life of the DC motor could be reduced. One manner to attenuate the abruptness of the voltages and currents and at the same time to drive a bipolar voltage to the DC motor is through the full-bridge Buck inverter, giving rise to the new “full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor” system [32]. Thus, compared with [32], the contribution of the present paper is fourfold:The steady-state, stability, controllability, and flatness properties associated with the dynamic behavior of the “full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor” system are presented.The differential flatness property [33] linked to the mathematical model of the system under study is exploited, with the aim of obtaining the reference trajectories of the system offline so that the mathematical model can be validated when time-varying duty cycles are considered.Obtaining circuit simulation results when the input and the reference signals are introduced into the system via the SimPowerSystems toolbox of Matlab-Simulink.Obtaining experimental results when the input and the reference signals are introduced to a prototype of the system built through Matlab-Simulink along with a DS1104 board.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the generalities of the full-bridge inverter DC–motor system and some static/dynamic properties and the generation of the reference trajectories, via the flatness concept, are presented. To validate the proposed mathematical model, in Section 3, circuit simulation and experimental results are shown. Later, a discussion of the obtained results is introduced in Section 4. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 5. 2. Materials and MethodsThis section describes the key concepts of the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor system. First, the mathematical model of the system is obtained by using the circuit theory and the mathematical model of a DC motor. Second, some static and dynamic properties related to the deduced model are listed. Last, the generation of the reference trajectories is introduced. 2.1. Model of the “Full-Bridge Buck Inverter–DC Motor” SystemIn the following, the generalities of the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor system and the deduction of its corresponding mathematical model are presented. 2.1.1. Generalities of the Full-Bridge Buck Inverter–DC Motor SystemThe electronic diagram of the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor topology is drawn in Figure 1a. Such a circuit can be divided into two parts: (1) the full-bridge Buck inverter and (2) the DC motor. The full-bridge Buck inverter modulates and supplies the bipolar voltage
υ
 to the DC motor via the input signal u. This part also contains the following; a power supply E; an array of four MOSFET transistors—

Q

,


Q
¯

,

Q

, and


Q

; and a low-pass filter composed of R, C, and L (where the current i flows through). In addition, the DC motor is the actuator of the system and is made up of the elements

L
a

,

R
a

 and a variable

i
a

, corresponding to the inductance, resistance, and armature current. Here,
ω
 is the angular velocity of the shaft. Other important values of the DC motor are b,

k
m

, J, and

k
e

, which correspond to the viscous friction coefficient of the motor, the motor torque constant, the moment of inertia of the rotor, and the counterelectromotive force constant, respectively. Additionally, Figure 1b depicts the ideal configuration of the system, which will be described in the following section. 2.1.2. Mathematical Model of the Proposed “Full-Bridge Buck Inverter–DC Motor” TopologyIn Figure 1b, the ideal structure of the proposed “full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor” topology is depicted. In this figure, the transistors

Q
¯

 are replaced by switches

S
1

,

S
2

,


S
¯

1

, and


S
¯

2

, respectively. When switches

S
1

 or

S
2

 are on, the possible values of the input signal u are 1 or

−
1

. These values depend on the voltage polarity, or operating cycle, that is desired to be generated in load R. That is, for a positive voltage, or positive cycle, the switch

S
1

 will be on and the input signal u will be 1. For a negative voltage, or negative cycle, the switch

S
2

 will be on and the output signal u will be

−
1

. On the other hand, when switches

S
1

 and

S
2

 are off, the input signal u is 0. During this commutation process, the switches


S
¯

1

 and


S
¯

2

 are activated complementarily to

S
1

 and

S
2

. With the aim of easing the deduction of the mathematical model of the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor topology, different structures (associated with the positions of the inverter switches) will be analyzed. Thus, in accordance with the bipolarity of the voltage
υ
, the deduction of the mathematical model will be divided into positive and negative cycles.Positive CycleThe generation of a positive voltage, i.e., the clockwise movement of the motor shaft, is executed when the ideal circuit of Figure 1b is simplified to the circuit shown in Figure 2a. It is noteworthy that switches

S
2

 and


S
¯

2

 are in a fixed position, whereas switches

S
1

 and


S
¯

1

 work complementarily, switching their position according to the input signal u. Thus, similar to a Buck converter, the energy charging in the

L
C

 filter occurs when the input signal

u
=
1

, whereas energy discharging occurs when

u
=
0

. This behavior is summarized in Figure 2b.(i) Energy charging. In this mode of operation, a part of the energy supplied by the power supply is stored in the

L
C

 filter. Figure 2c depicts the structure of this operating mode. By using the mathematical model of a DC motor [34,35] and applying Kirchhoff’s laws to the electric circuit of Figure 2c, the following system of differential equations is obtained:

(ii) Energy discharging. Here, as the

Figure 2d shows the connection of this operating mode. By using the mathematical model of a DC motor and applying Kirchhoff’s laws, the following system associated with the circuit of Figure 2d is obtained:

Negative CycleIn generating the negative voltage, the ideal circuit of Figure 1b reduces to the one shown in Figure 3a. Here, switches

S
1

 and


S
¯

1

 are in a fixed position, whereas switches

S
2

 and


S

 work complementarily, switching their position according to the input u. Similarly to the positive cycle, there is energy charging or discharging in the

L
C

 filter. This behavior is summarized in Figure 3b.(i) Energy charging. The circuit allowing energy charging for negative cycles is shown in Figure 3c. The model related to the circuit of Figure 3c, after applying Kirchhoff’s laws and considering the mathematical model of a DC motor, is given by

Properties of the “Full-Bridge Buck Inverter–DC Motor” SystemThis section presents the most relevant static and dynamic properties of the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor system. These properties bring qualitative information about the behavior of such a system. Particularly, the steady-state, stability, controllability, and flatness properties of the system are described. 2.2.1. Steady-StateThe steady-state analysis predicts the behavior of the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor system, given by (21)–(24), when its variables and input are in equilibrium. This is,

 2.2.2. StabilityWhen analyzing the stability of a dynamic linear system two cases arise. The first is related to the zero state-response, where the output is expected to be bounded if the input is also bounded and the initial condition is equal to zero, meaning that the system is BIBO stable. The second case is about the zero-input response, where the system has no input and has nonzero initial condition. In this way, the system will be stable in the sense of Lyapunov if the output response is bounded and will be asymptotically stable if the output response approaches zero as

t
→
∞

. Both cases can be assessed through the roots of the characteristic polynomial associated with matrix
A
 of the state space model representation. Thus, if the roots of such a characteristic polynomial have negative real part then the system is completely stable.Regarding the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor system, the state space representation of its model (21)–(24) is given by

 are positive. As all system parameters associated with (21)–(24) are positive and after computing (36), it is concluded that the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor system is completely stable. 2.2.3. ControllabilityThe controllability property of a dynamic system is crucial in control theory. This property states that if an input to a system can be found such that it takes the vector state from a desired initial state to a desired final state, the system is controllable; in other case, the system is uncontrollable. With the aim of determining whether a system is controllable or not, a controllability matrix
C
 can be constructed. If matrix
C
 is of rank n, being n the dimension of the vector state, then the system is completely controllable.Regarding the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor system, represented by Equation (33), the associated controllability matrix is given by

meaning that the system is controllable.On the other hand, an important property directly linked with controllability is that of differential flatness. This latter states that if a system is differentially flat [33], then it is controllable. This, in turn, means that the vector state and the input can be differentially parameterized in terms of the flat output and a finite number of its derivatives with respect to time. Moreover, there is a relation between the differential parametrization and the steady-state behavior, as the latter can be also obtained when the time derivatives of the flat output are equating to zero.Note that the differential flatness property has been exploited during the past few years in DC/DC power converters-DC motor and DC/DC power converters-inverter-DC motor systems for different purposes. The most common ones are: (a) as a generator of time-varying reference trajectories to be used in validating mathematical models [21,25] and in passive controls [22,24,28] and (b) for control design purposes [4,5,7,9,23,29]. This paper exploits the flatness property with the intention of generating the reference trajectories for validating the obtained mathematical model, as will be presented in the following section. 2.3. Generation of Reference Trajectories via Differential FlatnessAfter finding that

det

, i.e., the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor system is differentially flat, the flat output of the overall system is found through the following mathematical statement:

This latter is processed through the sub-block conditioning circuit (CC) allowing the correct activation of the transistors.Full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor circuit. This block corresponds to the system under study and the values of its parameters were defined in (47). The sampling frequency of the four IRF640 MOSFET transistors associated with the full-bridge is 50 kHz. Additionally, the parameters of the DC motor are the same of those considered in (48). 3.2.2. Experimental ResultsWith the purpose of validating the obtained mathematical model (21)–(24), this section presents the experimental results for the system. In these experiments, and with the purpose of making a fair comparison with the simulation results, the desired trajectories for
ω
 are the same as those considered in the simulation results.Experiment 1In this experiment,

ω
∗

 is the Bézier-type trajectory defined in (49). The experimental results of the system are presented in Figure 11.Experiment 2Here,

ω

 is the sinusoidal trajectory (52). In Figure 12, the corresponding experimental results are depicted.Experiment 3In this experiment, the desired angular velocity is defined as in (53). The corresponding experimental results are shown in Figure 13.Experiment 4Lastly, Figure 14 presents the experimental result associated with Equation (54). 4. DiscussionAs the mathematical model developed herein for the full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor system was differentially flat, all system variables were parameterized in terms of the flat output. Later, by proposing and replacing

ω
∗

 into the differential parametrization of the system, the reference variables (

i
a
∗

,

i
∗

,

υ
∗

) and the input signal (

u

a
v

∗

) were found offline. This was made to compare the results of the circuit simulation with the differential parametrization results, both shown in Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8. The same thing was done in order to compare the experimental results and the differential parametrization results, both shown in Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14. Regarding these latter, a tracking error between system variables

, i and reference variables

 can be observed. Such an error appears because some dynamics were not included into the mathematical model, i.e., energy losses associated with semiconductors and parasitic resistances related to capacitor and inductors. In this sense, note that, due to these omitted dynamics and the existence of the load R, the efficiency of the Buck converter is

89.14

%

. On the other hand, if all the neglected dynamics were taken into account, then the mathematical model would be more complex and this is far beyond the scope of this paper. In brief, the obtained results depicted in Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8 and Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14 validate the good accuracy of the proposed mathematical model. 5. ConclusionsWith the aim of validating, through circuit simulations and experimental results, the proposed mathematical model of the new “full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor” system, the flatness property has been exploited. Likewise, the steady-state, stability, and controllability properties associated with the dynamic behavior of such a system have been developed.In the development of the mathematical model of the new “full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor” system, all components were considered as ideal. This was done with the intention of obtaining a non-complex mathematical model that would still enjoy relatively good accuracy. On the other hand, by applying the flatness concept to the proposed mathematical model, it was found that the flat output of the system is given by
ω
. Therefore, the vector state and the input signal were differentially parameterized, in terms of the flat output and its successive derivatives with respect to time. Thus, with the help of such a parametrization, the validation of the deduced mathematical model was carried out through circuit simulation and a built prototype of the system. The circuit simulation results (presented in Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8) and the experimental results (depicted in Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14) validates the proposed mathematical model despite the small tracking error between system variables and reference variables. It is worth mentioning that such an error could be minimized if the electronic and electric elements were considered nonideal, meaning that energy losses and parasitic resistances should be considered into the mathematical model. However, the advantages of using the model presented in this paper is its simplicity and its accuracy.Future research will be devoted to the design of feedback tracking controls and their experimental implementation on the prototype of the system that has been built.
