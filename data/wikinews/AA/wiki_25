&lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Morva"&gt;William Morva&lt;/a&gt;, who escaped from a hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ABlacksburg"&gt;Blacksburg&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ASunday"&gt;Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, is in custody. He is a suspect in the murders of hospital security guard, Derrick McFarland on Sunday, and police officer Cpl. Eric Sutphin.

&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Tech"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; has closed their campus and cancelled classes on Monday. They issued an emergency advisory at 10:30 am local time. 

William Morva, 24, was taken to a hospital after complaining of a sprained wrist and leg, and escaped early Sunday morning after wounding a police officer and killing Derrick McFarland, an unarmed security guard. Around 7:30 am, Morva shot and fatally wounded Cpl. Eric Sutphin while he was on patrol on a local trail. Virginia Tech cancelled classes after a report that Morva was seen in a campus building. The building was evacuated, but he was not found.

At 3:36 pm EDT August 21, 2006, &lt;a href="w%3AMontgomery%20County%20Police"&gt;Montgomery County Police&lt;/a&gt; reported over the police scanner that William Morva was captured and taken into custody. He was captured west of the rugby fields on the Virginia Tech campus. This has been confirmed by a statement by the Blacksburg Police..

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 

After nearly thirty years, Pano's Restaurant at 1081 Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo, New York will end a tradition of being open 24 hours a day, seven days a week by ending its overnight food service.

The tradition for Buffalonians, who are able to enjoy drinks at the bars and clubs until 4:00 a.m. will end sometime at the end of August or September, according to overnight manager Wendi Dittmar and restaurant accountant Roseanne Jones.

"We will be starting the closure of the overnight shift sometime in the next 2 weeks to a month," said Dittmar in an exclusive interview with Wikinews.

Jones told Wikinews that owner Pano Georgiadis is "just fed up" with the "destruction, the walk-outs of bills and fights that the 'drunk' people cause" in his restaurant.

Pano's opened in 1977 on the day of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20blizzard%20of%201977"&gt;blizzard of '77'&lt;/a&gt; and has "remained open for 24 hours since then", only closing for an hour at a time on the weekends to clean up and prepare the restaurant for breakfast, said Georgiadis.

♡❤Artvoice♡❤, which holds the "Best of Buffalo" competition every year where readers vote for their favorite Buffalo place, has listed Pano's as the Best of Buffalo for best brunch, best Greek restaurant, best patio and best super-cheap breakfasts for 2006. 

Dittmar also says that Georgiadis is expected to make several "public service announcements" within the next few weeks to "thank customers for their patronage."

The British soldier who was killed in southern &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; yesterday has today been named by the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;. 

Cpl Bryan Budd, of the 3rd Battalion of the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Parachute%20Regiment"&gt;Parachute Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, was killed in &lt;a href="w%3AHelmand%20province"&gt;Helmand province&lt;/a&gt; at about noon local time during a gun battle with &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; forces in the volatile area. 

"Cpl Budd died as a result of injuries sustained during the contact. Three other British soldiers received minor injuries," said an MoD spokesman. 

So far, twenty &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Great%20Britain"&gt;British armed forces personnel&lt;/a&gt; have died in Afghanistan since 2001.

Yesterday, &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence"&gt;Defence Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADes%20Browne"&gt;Des Browne&lt;/a&gt; said: "I was deeply saddened to be informed of the death today of a British soldier and the injuries of three others as they supported the &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;mission in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. I wish to express my sincere condolences to their families and friends. My thoughts are with them at this difficult time."

Charges have been laid against 11 of the 23 suspects being detained by British police for an &lt;a href="w%3AAugust%2010%2C%202006%20alleged%20transatlantic%20aircraft%20terrorist%20plot"&gt;alleged plot to blow up several trans-Atlantic airliners&lt;/a&gt;.

Eight men were charged with conspiracy to commit murder and preparing acts of terrorism, said Peter Clarke, deputy commissioner of &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard's&lt;/a&gt; anti-terrorist branch during a news conference in London, Monday. 

The eight are &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20Ahmed%20Ali"&gt;Abdullah Ahmed Ali&lt;/a&gt;, 25, &lt;a href="w%3ATanvir%20Hussain"&gt;Tanvir Hussain&lt;/a&gt;, 25, &lt;a href="w%3AUmar%20Islam"&gt;Umar Islam&lt;/a&gt;, 28, &lt;a href="w%3AArafat%20Waheed%20Khan"&gt;Arafat Waheed Khan&lt;/a&gt;, 25, &lt;a href="w%3AAssad%20Sarwar"&gt;Assad Ali Sarwar&lt;/a&gt;, 26, &lt;a href="w%3AOsman%20Adam%20Khatib"&gt;Adam Khatib&lt;/a&gt;, 19, &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20Savant"&gt;Ibrahim Savant&lt;/a&gt; 25, and &lt;a href="w%3AWaheed%20Zaman"&gt;Waheed Zaman&lt;/a&gt;, 22.

Two others were charged with failing to disclose information about potential acts of terrorism, whilst a 17-year-old is charged with possession of articles useful to a person preparing acts of terrorism under Section Five of the ♡❤Terrorism Act, 2006♡❤.

A woman was released without charges being laid leaving an additional 11 suspects in custody without charges, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ACrown%20Prosecution%20Service"&gt;Crown Prosecution Service&lt;/a&gt;.

The suspects have been in detention since August 10 when they were arrested in connection with an alleged plot to set off explosives on at least 10 flights between the United States and the United Kingdom. 

Susan Hemming, head of the CPS counter terrorism division, said the alleged plot was to "manufacture and smuggle the component parts of improvised explosive devices on to aircraft and assemble and detonate them on board".

On Sunday, between one and one and a half million people had gathered in &lt;a href="w%3ABudapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; for St Stephen's Day fireworks when a severe storm hit.

According to the Budapest Fire Department, a 30-to-40 year-old man and a 12-year-old girl died when a large tree fell on a crowd of spectators on the Buda side, while the cause of an elderly woman's death in Pest remains unclear yet. One man is still missing.

The storm brought winds of at least 100 km/h and large hail. Roof tiles were torn off, trees knocked down, and cars and windows smashed. A stage at the celebration collapsed, causing panic among the audience.

Most of the injuries were caused by falling tiles and debris from roofs. The fire services were called to 250 locations during the night and reports of damage are expected to increase during the day.

"Five minutes into the display a wind starts rolling in, about a minute later, the wind is reaching 70km/h... then the rain comes, but so hard and so large that it slaps your skin like a needle, then hail fell from the sky, people panicking and screaming and running over each other. I lost my sister and her friend, and on my way there were two disabled people in wheelchairs, people just jumping over and pushing them," Armand Versace said. 

Meteorologists say they had warned that the storm was approaching. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AFerenc%20Gyurcsany"&gt;Ferenc Gyurcsany&lt;/a&gt; has ordered an inquiry into why the event went ahead. 

The Budapest City Council security committee held an extraordinary meeting late on Sunday and the civic security directorate decided to set up a special unit to help those in need.

Australian media have reported that a passenger on board a plane from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; discovered a note warning that a bomb would explode on the &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Southern%20Airlines"&gt;China Southern Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight from &lt;a href="Guangzhou"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. The note was apparently found one hour into the journey, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Associated%20Press"&gt;AAP&lt;/a&gt; reports.

The note forced the pilot to take emergency action and return to Guangzhou. Australian passenger Jason Harper said: "They dumped all the fuel. Then all the lights went out. But no-one knew what was happening. Then we landed and there about 20 police cars and fire engines and stuff everywhere."

Authorities have confirmed Flight CZ325 from Guangzhou in China was turned around about 40 minutes into the flight. 

China Southern Airlines refused to release full details, but said a note was found, which "did reflect something of a dangerous item on board the plane ... adequate to cause the tech crew to turn around and return to Guangzhou," reports &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sunday%20Times%20%28Western%20Australia%29"&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Nine%20News"&gt;National Nine News&lt;/a&gt; said passengers were forced to leave the plane and were interviewed by authorities for two hours. No bomb was found. Passengers were later allowed back on board and resumed their journey.

&lt;a href="w%3AKingsford%20Smith%20International%20Airport"&gt;Sydney Airport&lt;/a&gt; said the plane was now due to land at 3 pm (&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;Australian time&lt;/a&gt;) today. It was not known this morning how many people were on board the plane. A spokesperson for China Southern Airlines would only say it was "fairly full".

Chinese state media say police have detained an Australian for threatening to blow up the flight, &lt;a href="w%3AXinhua"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt; news agency said. Police detained an Australian man, originally from Hong Kong, and said he had made the threat over a failed love affair.

Xinhua did not say if the man had been charged.

<h1>New Zealand man sentenced to life in prison for murder</h1>

James Junior Lawrie, 26-year-old, has been sentenced to life in prison at the &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Auckland High Court&lt;/a&gt; for a minimum of 16 years after he killed the Uptown Mini Mart owner 58-year-old Bhagubhai Vaghela on 19 June, 2005.

Vaghela was found dead at the scene by ambulance officers.

Lawrie had entered the store planning on stealing phone cards from the New North Road shop. Instead he shot Vaghela in the chest at &lt;a href="w%3APoint-blank%20range"&gt;point-blank range&lt;/a&gt; when he activated the alarm and Lawrie panicked.

Lawrie had pleaded guilty to the charges laid against him even though he could not remember most of the incident. The court was told today by the prosecutor Ross Burns that he had smoked one kilogram of &lt;a href="w%3Amethamphetamine"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; (P) two months prior, which is worth &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;1 million. The P had fuelled six previous aggravated robberies in the attempt to gain more money for his P habit. Lawrie has had 32 previous convictions of which nine were relating to violence.

Roger Chambers, Lawrie's lawyer, said: "Lawrie's late expression of remorse is genuine, in spite of a pre-sentencing report that said he had no recognition of the trauma he had caused to his victims. He pleaded guilty to some pretty horrendous crimes - and knew that any expression of remorse was likely to be laughed at. For Lawrie, prison is home."

Burns said, "Mr Vaghela had come to New Zealand to enjoy a well-deserved and planned retirement. He was a kind, considerate and gentle man who put his family first." His wife had now gone back to India where she has been ill, while the rest of the family struggle with the death. "His son had said: 'This world is a far worse place without my father being here'," the court was told by Burns.

Lawrie had shown no remorse, Burns said.

Numerous men have been charged in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; with various crimes related to a plot to arm the &lt;a href="w%3ATamil%20Tigers"&gt;Tamil Tigers&lt;/a&gt; who are listed as a terrorist organization in both countries. Some are accused of plotting to buy &lt;a href="w%3ASurface-to-air%20missile"&gt;surface-to-air missiles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAK-47"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt; rifles that would have been sent to the Tamil Tigers in &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;. Eight people, including three Canadian citizens, were charged in Brooklyn, New York yesterday with various offences. At the same time the &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; arrested a 26-year-old in Ontario in relation to the plot. He faces extradition to the United States. 

Charges against the nine include fundraising and money laundering through US bank accounts and charitable organizations for the Liberation Tigers of Talim Eelam, or Tamil Tigers, who have been fighting the Sri Lankan military in a civil war since 1983.

Two of the men allegedly tried to bribe undercover US State Department officials with $1 million in order to remove the Tigers from the official list of terrorist organizations which bars the group from raising money, obtaining weapons or lobbying. A more extensive investigation ensued involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Joint Terrorism Task Force. 

The RCMP was brought in when the FBI learned of a Canadian allegedly being involved. Ultimately, the three Canadians arrested in the United States are accused of travelling to New York to purchase the military equipment including 50 to 100 SAM missiles, assault rifles, truck mounted missiles, aerial vehicles for jamming radio transmissions and radar, submarine design software as well as flight lessons and military training.

A &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; mathematician, &lt;a href="w%3AGrigori%20Perelman"&gt;Grigori ("Grisha") Perelman&lt;/a&gt;, who is credited proving the &lt;a href="w%3APoincar%C3%A9%20conjecture"&gt;Poincaré conjecture&lt;/a&gt; declined to accept the &lt;a href="w%3AFields%20Medal"&gt;Fields Medal&lt;/a&gt;, regarded as the highest honor in the field of &lt;a href="w%3Amathematics"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;.

The Fields Medal, often referred to as the "&lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; of mathematics", was awarded this year to &lt;a href="w%3AAndrei%20Okounkov"&gt;Andrei Okounkov&lt;/a&gt; (Russia/US), &lt;a href="w%3ATerence%20Tao"&gt;Terence Tao&lt;/a&gt; (Australia/US) and &lt;a href="w%3AWendelin%20Werner"&gt;Wendelin Werner&lt;/a&gt; (France) in addition to Perelman. The award was handed out by &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Carlos%20I%20of%20Spain"&gt;King Juan Carlos of Spain&lt;/a&gt; and is accompanied by a &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;C$&lt;/a&gt;15'000 (approximately US$13'400 or 10'400EUR) cash prize (less than the one million &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;s that come with the Nobel prize). Nominees have to be under 40 years, because the founder of the award, Canadian mathematician &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Charles%20Fields"&gt;John Charles Fields&lt;/a&gt; wanted the medal to be a stimulus for future endeavours.

Perelman submitted two papers in 2002 and 2003 outlining a proof for &lt;a href="w%3AThurston%27s%20geometrization%20conjecture"&gt;Thurston's geometrization conjecture&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn, implies a proof for the Poincaré conjecture. Other mathematicians filling in the details have found no flaws in Perelman's approach yet. In 2003, Perelman made a short tour in the United States to explain his proof of the conjecture. When he went back to the &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Petersburg"&gt;St Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; department of the &lt;a href="w%3ASteklov%20Institute%20of%20Mathematics"&gt;Steklov Institute of Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, he gave up his job, and is reported to be unemployed and living with his mother ever since.

"The reason Perelman gave me is that he feels isolated from the mathematical community and therefore has no wish to appear as one of its leaders." declared Manuel de Leon, chairman of the Congress, when asked about Grisha's motivation to decline. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20M.%20Ball"&gt;Prof. John Ball&lt;/a&gt;, retiring president of the International Mathematical Union, added: "The reason centres on his feeling of isolation from the mathematical community." Perelman's friend Anatoly Vershik said the reclusive math genius just wanted to be declared correct, and regarded recognition as superficial.

The Poincaré conjecture is widely considered one of the most important questions in &lt;a href="w%3Atopology"&gt;topology&lt;/a&gt; (a branch of mathematics concerned with &lt;a href="w%3AHomeomorphism"&gt;spatial properties preserved under deformation&lt;/a&gt; like stretching without tearing or gluing). It is one of the seven &lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Prize%20Problems"&gt;Millennium Prize Problems&lt;/a&gt; for which the &lt;a href="w%3AClay%20Mathematics%20Institute"&gt;Clay Mathematics Institute&lt;/a&gt; is offering a $1,000,000 prize for a correct solution.

Observers speculate that he will also refuse this prize. In 1997, he also refused an award by the European Congress of Mathematicians, because he deemed the judges unable to understand his work. A spokesman for the Institute said it would decide on the prize in two years. &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Hamilton%20%28professor%29"&gt;Richard Hamilton's&lt;/a&gt; "&lt;a href="w%3ARicci%20flow"&gt;Ricci flow&lt;/a&gt;" equation could also earn him a part of the prize, since it formed the basis for Perelman's papers.

In 1966, German &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Grothendieck"&gt;Alexander Grothendieck&lt;/a&gt; refused his Fields Medal in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; out of protest against the presence of the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Army"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern Europe. But later he accepted it.

The Poincaré conjecture is not an easy thing to explain in plain English. A &lt;a href="w%3Asphere"&gt;sphere&lt;/a&gt; as we know it is called a &lt;a href="w%3Adimension"&gt;two-dimensional&lt;/a&gt; sphere in topology (because it's surface can be approximated by a two-dimensional plane). The four-dimensional analogue of such a 2-sphere is a &lt;a href="w%3A3-sphere"&gt;3-sphere&lt;/a&gt; (which is an example of a &lt;a href="w%3A3-manifold"&gt;3-manifold&lt;/a&gt;). 

Now imagine a ball and a donut made of rubber. If you throw a lasso around the ball and pull, you can squeeze it to a single point and slide off the lasso. But you can't do that with the noose through the hole of a donut, the only way is to cut through the donut. So in topology, there are basically two kinds of objects: objects with or without holes. By deforming objects without holes you can make them look like a sphere, but this is impossible for objects with holes. So basically, Grisha proved that in topology a ball and a banana are the same.

The Poincaré conjecture surmises that if a closed three-dimensional &lt;a href="w%3Amanifold"&gt;manifold&lt;/a&gt; (our multiple-dimension banana) is sufficiently like a 3-sphere (a kind of &lt;a href="w%3Ahypersphere"&gt;hypersphere&lt;/a&gt;) in that each &lt;a href="w%3APath%20%28topology%29"&gt;loop&lt;/a&gt; in the manifold can be tightened to a point, then it is really just a three-dimensional sphere.

A Russian plane has crashed in the Ukraine killing all 170 passengers on board, according to the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry. The &lt;a href="w%3ATupolev%20Tu-154"&gt;Tu-154&lt;/a&gt; passenger jet owned by &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3APulkovo%20Aviation%20Enterprise"&gt;Pulkovo Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight number &lt;a href="w%3APulkovo%20Airlines%20Flight%20612"&gt;612&lt;/a&gt; had a roster that included at least 45 children and 11 crew members onboard. It crashed in eastern &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; at approximately 2:30 p.m. near the Russian border. A distress signal is reported to have gone off moments before the crash. The plane was on its way to &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg%2C%20Russia"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AAnapa"&gt;Anapa&lt;/a&gt;. Wreckage and many bodies have been found.

Ukrainian officials are reporting at least 160 people onboard with at least 10 crew members on hand. 

According to Russian officials, terrorism did not play a role in the crash and that the aircraft may have encountered heavy turbulence which caused the plane to go down. The plane then caught fire after hitting the ground and breaking into several pieces.

Other reports say that the plane was "hit by lightning."

"The plane most likely was hit by lightning. There was no damage on the ground. After it fell, it broke apart and burst into flames," said Irina Andriyanova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry.

Reports say that there are no survivors and at least 30 bodies have been recovered.

The crisis in the &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; left has intensified as former &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;Scottish Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="Tommy%20Sheridan"&gt;Tommy Sheridan&lt;/a&gt; has announced his intention to launch a new left wing party. 

Sheridan, currently an SSP &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament"&gt;Member of the Scottish Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, was forced to resign as leader after the ♡❤News of the World♡❤ accused him of frequenting sex clubs. Sheridan successfully &lt;a href="w%3ASheridan%20v%20News%20International"&gt;sued the newspaper&lt;/a&gt; last month, and was awarded £200,000 in damages. Eleven leading members of the SSP, including 3 MSPs supported the newspaper's allegations against him and testified against Sheridan in court. 

Sheridan had intended to attempt to reclaim the leadership of the SSP but has instead decided to found a "new party of the left" leaving what he described as the "colossal train wreck of the SSP" which is divided between two factions, the pro-Sheridan "SSP Majority" and the anti-Sheridan "&lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Socialist%20Party%20United%20Left"&gt;United Left&lt;/a&gt;". 

&lt;a href="w%3AColin%20Fox"&gt;Colin Fox&lt;/a&gt;, the current SSP leader, has urged Sheridan to abandon his plans. "I disagree with Tommy that the SSP has 'reached its historical limits'. The SSP has huge potential still ahead of it. Hundreds of thousands of people wish to see it survive and thrive and take the socialist project which it uniquely promotes, still further forward...There is no basis for two socialist parties in Scotland with indistinguishable political programmes," said Fox in a statement.

Two major platforms within the SSP, the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Socialists%20%28Scotland%29"&gt;International Socialists&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20for%20a%20Workers%20International"&gt;CWI&lt;/a&gt;) and the Socialist Worker Platform (&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Socialist%20Tendency"&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt;) support Sheridan's call as does the SSP's South of Scotland regional committee. 

Sheridan claims that several leading Scottish celebrities including actors and directors &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Mullan"&gt;Peter Mullan&lt;/a&gt;, David McKay and Martin McCardie, support his call for a new party. 

"I predict hundreds, maybe thousands, of ordinary, everyday workers will fight for equality and justice. The war is with inequality, not with fellow socialists. And Scotland is big enough for more than one socialist party, " said Sheridan. 

"The atmosphere a faction in the SSP has created is poisonous and unacceptable. It's obvious that those who are involved with the faction, which has hijacked the SSP and all its apparatus, have hatred for me as their motivating factor. The SSP have been bastardised, they're now a grotesque caricature of what we had hoped. It's time for them to fight among themselves. It's time to make a clean break. The new party will share some of the political ideology of the old SSP and the internal regime will be one of tolerance, friendship and genuine solidarity," said Sheridan in an interview with a Scottish newspaper. 

The SSP executive has issued a statement declaring that Sheridan is "on the road to oblivion" accusing him of engaging in an "act of political irresponsibility which can only delight the enemies of socialism in Scotland." The statement continues "Tommy Sheridan has decided to run away from the SSP and wreak as much damage as he can in the process."

Sheridan replied to the statement saying "I can't win either way. If I stay I am a problem according to my SSP colleagues who say they will not work with me again, but if I go I am splitting the socialist cause. Frankly, the SSP has been distorted by the faction which has hijacked its apparatus and the internal regime is now longer conducive to building a socialist party". He added there is an "unstoppable momentum building up" for the creation of a new party.

Sheridan and his supporters plan to hold a meeting on September 3, 2006 to plan the new party. The SSP, meanwhile, will hold an event the day before to rally its support. 

The SSP currently has six MSPs in the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Parliament"&gt;Scottish Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, two of whom, Sheridan and &lt;a href="w%3ARosemary%20Byrne"&gt;Rosemary Byrne&lt;/a&gt; are supporting the new party.

There have been three days of violent clashes in &lt;a href="w%3AKinshasa"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt; between supporters of &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Pierre%20Bemba"&gt;Jean-Pierre Bemba&lt;/a&gt; and incumbent &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Kabila"&gt;Joseph Kabila&lt;/a&gt; following the release of results from the first round of &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%20general%20election%2C%202006"&gt;Congo's elections&lt;/a&gt;. The two presidential candidates will face each other in a run off election October 29th after the first round of votes, July 30th, failed to produce a victor. The results were announced on Sunday with Kabila received 45% of the vote, short of the absolute majority required to avoid a run-off, while Bemba gained 20% and &lt;a href="w%3AAntoine%20Gizenga"&gt;Antoine Gizenga&lt;/a&gt; won 13%. Bemba's support is concentrated in the western provinces of the country while Kabila's support is concentrated in the east. 

Bemba's supporters claim that Kabila's presidential guard is attacking Bemba's house. Most downtown streets are deserted and shops closed as people stay in their homes to avoid the sporadic fighting which left five people dead on Sunday. 

Kabila's rivals, including Bemba, claim there was widespread fraud in the elections. 

400 &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; peacekeepers from the Netherlands and Germany currently stationed in neighbouring &lt;a href="w%3AGabon"&gt;Gabon&lt;/a&gt; are flying into the capital to quell the fighting. Spanish EU troops and 17,000 &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; peacekeepers are already in the capital. 

The June 30 election was the first democratic vote to be held in the Congo since it gained independence in 1960 and occurs following the official end of five years of conflict.

An Orizont oil platform in the &lt;a href="w%3APersian%20Gulf"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt;, owned by the Grup Servicii Petroliere (GSP) of &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, has allegedly been boarded by &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; troops after being fired at by a helicopter. Romanian officials have not "heard anything" from the workers on the platform "since then [the attack].", according to a company statement. The Iranian news agency IRNA claims that the personnel who boarded the platform were not "troops" but "police".

"We were called by one of our employees at 9.15 a.m. local time (0615 GMT), who told us a military helicopter opened fire against the Orizont rig, and by 9.45 Iranian troops got on board. Since then, we haven't heard anything from them," said Radu Petrescu, a spokesman for Servicii Petroliere.

According to a representative of GSP, Lulu Tabanesku, "Iranian [troops] used machine guns" and Iran is "in control of the rig. We cannot contact the rig." There were at least 26 workers on the 13,000-ton platform when it came under fire. There is no word on whether there are any casualties.

The Foreign Minister of Romania is scheduled to have a meeting to discuss the attack with Iranian officials on Wednesday, but so far Iran has yet to release an official statement regarding the attack. Romanian president &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20B%C4%83sescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; was unable to reach Iran's president &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, the day of the rig's seizure. August 22 is an Iranian National holiday.

The Romanian company GSP operates the Orizant and Fortuna rigs that are both subjects of a legal dispute with the Oriental Oil Company who rents the oil rights to Petro Iran Development Company (PEDCO), a broker for the National Iranian Oil Company. According to PEDCO, an Iranian court ruling in the contract dispute between the two companies found that both rigs should remain in Iranian waters. GSP moved the Fortuna rig on August 15, claiming the contract was cancelled illegally, Iran accused the Romanians of "hijacking" the platform.

&lt;a href="w%3ALech%20Walesa"&gt;Lech Walesa&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the &lt;a href="w%3ASolidarnosc"&gt;Solidarity&lt;/a&gt; movement has quit the organisation. The Solidarity trade union movement and political party was founded in 1980 to combat &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; government. "I have given up my membership last year because Solidarity and I have gone separate ways," said Walesa who served as Poland's first post-Communist president from 1990 to 1995. 

Walesa, 62, is boycotting Solidarity's 26th anniversary celebration this month as he does not want to appear with current President &lt;a href="w%3ALech%20Kaczynski"&gt;Lech Kaczynski&lt;/a&gt; and his twin brother, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJaroslaw%20Kaczynski"&gt;Jaroslaw Kaczynski&lt;/a&gt; with whose policies he disagrees. "His approach is to first destroy and then think about what to build," Walesa said of the president. Last August, he said of the union "This is no longer my union. This is a different era, different people, different problems." 

It was revealed today that Walesa has not formally been a member of Solidarity since the beginning of this year. 

"He has not been paying membership fees since the end of last year," a leading Solidarity member, Jerzy Borowczak, told the AFP news agency. 

Walesa says he left Solidarity after the union ignored his criticism of its support of the &lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20and%20Justice"&gt;Law and Justice Party&lt;/a&gt; led by the Kaczynskis. 

"When my arguments were not reaching them, I gave instructions to terminate my membership," Walesa said. "It is not over the Kaczynskis, but that was the last straw."

Solidarity was created as an independent trade union when such organizations were outlawed under the Communist state. Despite attempts to destroy the group through repressions, it came to embody a broad social anti-communist movement within Poland. It is credited as one of many dissident movements which in the 1980s pressured reforms which eventually led to the dissolution of the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and states in its sphere of influence. Solidarity eventually came to power in Poland with Walesa serving as President of Poland from 1990 to 1995.

A &lt;a href="w%3AImprovised%20explosive%20device"&gt;home-made bomb&lt;/a&gt; containing more than 1kg (2.2 US lbs) of &lt;a href="w%3ATrinitrotoluene"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; exploded at &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow's&lt;/a&gt; Cherkizovsky market. As of August 22, 2006, ten deaths had been confirmed, including that of six Chinese and one Vietnamese. Two children were also among the blast victims. At least fifty-five more were injured in the attack. Yuri Syomin, the head of the City Prosecutor's Office, says that he "does not rule out a terrorist attack on the eastern Moscow market".

Around 10:30 AM, Vietnamese and Chinese traders heard the explosion. The blast is believed to have originated at ♡❤Atlantida♡❤, a Vietnamese cafe in the Novaya Yevrazia district. Three or four Slavic men left a bag in the cafe, then ran through the doors. As security guards went in pursuit of them, the explosive detonated. 

The Russian news agency &lt;a href="w%3AItar%20tass"&gt;Itar-Tass&lt;/a&gt; reports that three men have been detained in connection with the attacks, while other sources report that only two men have been taken into custody on the charge of murder in the context of racism. Alexei Grigoryev, deputy head of the City Prosecutor's Office, however said, "currently, only witnesses are being brought in for questioning".

<h1>Australia to subsidise Herceptin for early-stage breast cancer</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australia%20to%20subsidise%20Herceptin%20for%20early-stage%20breast%20cancer&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; federal government has announced it will subsidise the breast-cancer drug &lt;a href="w%3ATrastuzumab"&gt;Herceptin&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href="w%3APharmaceutical%20Benefits%20Scheme"&gt;Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme&lt;/a&gt; (PBS) for women with &lt;a href="w%3AHER2/neu"&gt;HER2 positive&lt;/a&gt; cancer. Those with advanced breast cancer will continue to be eligible for special assistance from &lt;a href="w%3AMedicare%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Medicare Australia&lt;/a&gt; independently from the PBS.

According to the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing, around 2,000 of the 14,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed annually are of the HER2 positive type. Herceptin has shown to prevent the recurrence of cancer in 30% of these patients.

In order to constrain costs, the government has accepted a recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PABC) to provide Herceptin under the PBS only to patients who have the HER2 positive type of cancer, who have undergone surgery and who are undergoing chemotherapy. In addition, those who are predisposed to heart damage (which can be a side effect of the drug) will not be provided with the subsidised medication.

The government will provide subsidised Herceptin for 52 weeks (as found to be most effective in clinical trials) at a cost of around &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$50,000 per patient.

Herceptin will become available on the PBS from 1 October.

In their first home match of the new season, &lt;a href="w%3ATottenham%20Hotspur"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt; won against newly promoted side &lt;a href="w%3ASheffield%20United"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt;, 2-0. The &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Premier%20League"&gt;FA Premier League&lt;/a&gt; game was settled early in the first half by strikes from &lt;a href="w%3ADimitar%20Berbatov"&gt;Dimitar Berbatov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJermaine%20Jenas"&gt;Jermaine Jenas&lt;/a&gt;.

The London side started very brightly, showing their attacking intent. This paid off for Tottenham after just seven minutes.

A perfectly judged pass from &lt;a href="w%3ARobbie%20Keane"&gt;Robbie Keane&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20Lennon"&gt;Aaron Lennon&lt;/a&gt; on the right side of the penalty area. Lennon's low cross was tapped in from close range by the waiting Berbatov.

Berbatov was signed by Spurs in the summer from &lt;a href="w%3ABayern%20Leverkusen"&gt;Bayern Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt; for £10.9 million. This was his first competitive goal for Tottenham, after finding the net several times in pre-season matches.

Nine minutes later, Tottenham struck again. Jenas received a header on from Berbatov, knocked the ball around United keeper &lt;a href="w%3APaddy%20Kenny"&gt;Paddy Kenny&lt;/a&gt; and tapped in to double the lead.

Spurs pressed for a third goal, but were unsuccessful as &lt;a href="w%3AYoung-Pyo%20Lee"&gt;Young-Pyo Lee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalum%20Davenport"&gt;Calum Davenport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARobbie%20Keane"&gt;Robbie Keane&lt;/a&gt; all missed opportunities.

Despite this, Spurs looked comfortable in dealing with occasional threats from the Blades, missing the influence of manager &lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Warnock"&gt;Neil Warnock&lt;/a&gt; who was serving part of a suspension. Substitutions by United were not enough to turn around the result.

New Zealand's nineteenth &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in today. &lt;a href="w%3AAnand%20Satyanand"&gt;The Honourable Anand Satyanand&lt;/a&gt; succeeds &lt;a href="w%3ADame%20Silvia%20Cartwright"&gt;Dame Silvia Cartwright&lt;/a&gt; as the personal representative of New Zealand's Head of State, &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. Dame Silvia concluded a five year term in office.

A fanfare of trumpets and a 21 gun salute by the 16 Field Regiment from &lt;a href="w%3ALinton"&gt;Linton&lt;/a&gt; marked the start of ceremonies. Satyanand arrived at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Parliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; at 11.45am (&lt;a href="w%3ANZST"&gt;NZST&lt;/a&gt;).

His investiture began with an &lt;a href="w%3AIndian"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMaori"&gt;Maori&lt;/a&gt; welcome, followed by the constitutional swearing in. A commission of appointment was read, and the &lt;a href="w%3AOath%20of%20Allegiance%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;Oath of Allegiance&lt;/a&gt; and the oath of office taken.

The appointment was then proclaimed, at which point Satyanand became the 19th Governor-General of New Zealand.

There was &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20New%20Zealand%20Navy"&gt;Royal New Zealand Navy&lt;/a&gt; led Tri-service Royal Guard of Honour comprising 100 men and women drawn from the three services (&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force"&gt;Royal New Zealand Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Army"&gt;New Zealand Army&lt;/a&gt;) and their respective &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Colours"&gt;Queen's Colours&lt;/a&gt; and escorts, and the Band of the Royal New Zealand Navy and the Royal New Zealand Air Force Trumpeters were also attendance.

Following the ceremony the new Governor-General laid a wreath; at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20War%20Memorial%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;National War Memorial&lt;/a&gt; in honour of New Zealand's war dead; a tradition that all new Governor-Generals undertake on the day of their swearing-in.

A 24-person &lt;a href="w%3AGuard%20of%20Honour"&gt;Guard of Honour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACatafalque%20Guard"&gt;Catafalque Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Abugler"&gt;bugler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adrummer"&gt;drummer&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Defence%20Force"&gt;New Zealand Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; also attended the commemorative service.

He says he is deeply honoured to have been asked to serve as Governor-General and says there will be a great deal of pride within the Indian community about his appointment.

After the ceremony the vice regal party moved into Parliament House where presentations were be made in the Grand Hall; followed by a reception in the Banquet Hall.

Satyanand was born and raised in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;. He studied law at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Auckland"&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/a&gt; law school. He has practiced law, been a judge, an &lt;a href="w%3Aombudsman"&gt;ombudsman&lt;/a&gt;. 

Speaking at the ceremony, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;, said that he has a very good and deep understanding of the law, government, an interest in international affairs and has contributed to many community activities.

Anand Satyanand's parents were &lt;a href="w%3AIndo-Fijians"&gt;Indo-Fijians&lt;/a&gt;. Satyanand is the first Governor-General of &lt;a href="w%3AAsian"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt; descent. Satyanand married in 1970 and has three adult children.

Present at the swearing-in ceremony were the &lt;a href="w%3AVice-President%20of%20Fiji"&gt;Vice-President of Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, His Excellency Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, and the Honourable Mr Justice Sir Moti Tikaram. Also present were some of his former colleagues.

Prime Minister Clark said, "I thank you for agreeing to serve New Zealand in this way. On behalf of the government and people of New Zealand, I welcome you both to your new roles as you take up life and work at Government House, and wish you well for this period of service to New Zealand."

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Dunne"&gt;Peter Dunne&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Future"&gt;United Future&lt;/a&gt; party, said "I warmly welcome his appointment and I believe that with his Asian, Fijian, Indian and Kiwi background he will do an excellent job for the increasingly diverse society that is New Zealand today."

&lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Peters"&gt;Winston Peters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20First"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt; party leader and Foreign Minister, said, "He is the right person to carry out the diverse role of the Queen's representative in 21st century New Zealand. Judge Satyanand has the experience, respect and demeanour to fulfil ♡❤[sic]♡❤ the various demands of this most important constitutional role in the manner we expect in New Zealand."

When asked by the media in April his view of New Zealand becoming a republic, Satyanand said
"I am an admirer of our country's present constitutional arrangements and the mechanisms which enable a straightforward change of government and our connection with our historical past."

A thirty-five year-old woman and a forty year-old man, both from &lt;a href="w%3ABurnage"&gt;Burnage&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester, have been arrested in connection with the deaths of a woman and her three young children.

The corpses of Uzma Rahan and her three children were found in their home in &lt;a href="w%3ACheadle%20Hulme"&gt;Cheadle Hulme&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Manchester"&gt;Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt; on Monday morning. Eleven year-old Adam, eight year-old Abbas and six year-old Henne were found to have serious head injuries, and post-mortem tests concluded that they died from being beaten to death. An examination into Mrs Rahan's death will be carried out later. 

A &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Manchester%20Police"&gt;Greater Manchester Police&lt;/a&gt; spokeswoman said this morning: "Police investigating the murder of a woman and three children in Cheadle Hulme have this morning arrested a 35-year-old woman from Burnage on suspicion of murder. She remains in police custody and will be questioned by officers later today."

Police are continuing to look for Rahan Arshad, the children's father. In a press conference on Monday, officers revealed that the thirty-six year-old went missing five weeks ago. There is a possibility that he could be abroad.

Det Supt Martin Bottomley, from Greater Manchester Police, told reporters: "We are still actively looking for Rahan Arshad and I now believe he left the country around 29 July. We will be liaising with our colleagues on international police forces to help us to trace him. I would ask that anyone who has seen him or been in contact with him since 29 July to contact the incident room or any police officer immediately."

It is thought the four victims had been killed a month ago.

The human rights organisation &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; has accused &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; of committing war crimes by deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;Israel-Lebanon conflict&lt;/a&gt;, calling the attacks "indiscriminate and disproportionate". Israel has rejected the charge.

"The pattern, scope and scale of the attacks makes Israel's claim that this was 'collateral damage', simply not credible," said &lt;a href="w%3AKate%20Gilmore"&gt;Kate Gilmore&lt;/a&gt;, of Amnesty International.

Amnesty International cites the magnitude of the destruction caused by Israeli air strikes and artillery bombings, and declarations such as the one made by Israeli Chief of Staff &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Halutz"&gt;Lt Gen Dan Halutz&lt;/a&gt;, that "nothing is safe [in Lebanon], as simple as that", as evidence that civilians were deliberately targeted.

Israel rejected the accusation, stating that the bombings of civilian areas was justified because &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; uses civilians as "humans shields" : Lebanese infrastructure was "targeted only when that infrastructure was being exploited by the Hezbollah machine, and this is in accordance with the rules of war", said the Israeli spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Regev"&gt;Mark Regev&lt;/a&gt;. "Unlike Hezbollah, we did not deliberately target the Lebanese civilian population", Mr. Regev said. 

Over 1,000 Lebanese, mostly civilians were killed during the fighting, while 161 Israelis, mostly soldiers, were killed by Hezbollah. The Israeli attacks also wounded about 4,000 people, and turned nearly 1 million people, a quarter of the population of Lebanon, into internal refugees.

Former England football manager, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Robson"&gt;Bobby Robson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20the%20British%20Empire"&gt;CBE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , will undergo surgery to remove a tumour on his brain today.

Bobby Robson is 73-years-old, and has managed various soccer teams such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20football%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United%20F.C."&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIpswich%20Town%20F.C."&gt;Ipswich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Barcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APSV%20Eindhoven"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFulham%20F.C."&gt;Fulham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASporting%20Lisbon"&gt;Sporting Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Porto"&gt;FC Porto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Currently, he is employed as a consultant for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Republic of Ireland team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but will miss their opening &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuro%202008"&gt;Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; qualifier against Germany in Stuttgart on 2 September. He has had cancer surgery 3 times prior. 

Bobby Robson said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The tumour is in my brain, which sounds bad, but it is in a position where it can be removed relatively easily and it's extremely small - the size of a grape - which indicates they have caught it early."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robson was taken to hospital on 5 August 2006 after complaining about feeling unwell 10 minutes before the start of an Ipswich match. He was discharged on 7 August, and on 20 August it became apparent the incident was due to a brain tumour.

<h1>12 arrested after India-bound flight escorted back to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=12%20arrested%20after%20India-bound%20flight%20escorted%20back%20to%20Amsterdam%27s%20Schiphol%20Airport&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Police in the Netherlands have arrested twelve passengers after a US flight destined for &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; was escorted back to &lt;a href="w%3AAmsterdam%20Schiphol%20Airport"&gt;Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport&lt;/a&gt;. No further information about the arrests has been given. 

The plane, which had 149 passengers on board, was accompanied by two F-16 fighter jets on its way back to the airport after the security alert today. 

According to the Dutch Defence Ministry, the plane's pilot made the decision to land the aircraft after several passengers mustered suspicion. "A number of them behaved, in the opinion of the crew, in a suspicious manner," said a Defense Ministry statement. "As a result, the captain asked to return to Schiphol. The customs police have taken a number of people off the plane for questioning."

An airport spokesman said that the plane's pilot decided to reroute while in German airspace.

Earlier today, a spokeswoman said that several passengers were taken off the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Airlines"&gt;Northwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt; aircraft and have been detained for questioning. &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; quotes Mirjam Snoerwang as saying: "A number of suspects were taken off the plane - I don't know how many. They're undergoing questioning now."

The National Terrorism Coordinator has said that there is no reason to raise the terror alert level in the Netherlands. Spokeswoman Judith Sluiter said: "It is the same as it was before - light threat." 

Since August 10, when police in the UK claimed they had foiled a suspected plot to blow up several transatlantic planes, security has been stepped up worldwide.

<h1>Disease outbreak feared after mass hysteria over &quot;sweet&quot; water in Mumbai</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Disease%20outbreak%20feared%20after%20mass%20hysteria%20over%20%26quot%3Bsweet%26quot%3B%20water%20in%20Mumbai&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

"18 hours of mass hysteria" (according to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASunday%20Times%20of%20India"&gt;Sunday Times of India&lt;/a&gt;♡❤) broke out last Friday in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; as hundreds of residents flocked to &lt;a href="w%3AMahim%20Creek"&gt;Mahim Creek&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most polluted creeks in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; that receives thousands of tonnes of raw sewage and industrial waste every day after reports that the salt water had suddenly turned "sweet". 

Television reports showed people drinking water on the spot with their hands, and others bathing, apparently to wash away their sins with the "holy" water.

At the height of the hysteria, bottled mineral water was selling for &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20rupee"&gt;Rs&lt;/a&gt; 50 (RM4.50), with people buying the mineral water simply for the bottles, pouring away the mineral water and filling the bottles with water from the creek.

News reports of the Mahim Creek incident sparked further mass hysteria at &lt;a href="w%3AGujarat"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt; within hours, with residents there claiming that seawater at Teethal beach in &lt;a href="w%3AValsad"&gt;Valsad&lt;/a&gt; had also turned sweet. About 400 people had gathered by the beach in the evening.

In the aftermath of the incident, local authorities stated that they were being were extra vigilant because of the possibility of a severe outbreak of water-borne diseases, such as &lt;a href="w%3Agastroenteritis"&gt;gastroenteritis&lt;/a&gt; as a result of so many people drinking contaminated water. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board had warned people not to drink the water, but despite this many people had collected it in bottles, even as plastic and rubbish had drifted by on the current. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai had ordered a bacteriological report into the "sweet" water, but suspected that "contamination in the water might have been reduced due to the waters from &lt;a href="w%3AMithi%20River"&gt;Mithi River&lt;/a&gt; flowing into the mouth of &lt;a href="w%3AMahim%20Bay"&gt;Mahim Bay&lt;/a&gt;".

By Saturday morning, the hysteria had died down, as the taste of the water had returned to normal.

<h2>Why the water turned sweet</h2>

Geologists at the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Indian Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABombay"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt; and M.D. Zingde, the head of the Mumbai office of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institute%20of%20Oceanography%20%28India%29"&gt;National Institute of Oceanography&lt;/a&gt; explained that the water turning sweet in Mahim Creek was a natural phenomenon. Continuous rainfall over the preceding few days had caused a large pool of fresh water to accrue in an underground rock formation near to the coast, which then discharged into the sea as a large "plume" as fractures in the rocks widened. Because of the differences in density, the discharged fresh water floated on top of the salt water of the sea and spread along the coast. Over time, the two mixed to become normal sea water once more.

A similar explanation for the phenomenon in Gujarat was given by Valsad District Collector D Rawal. According to him, the reason for the water tasting less salty than usual was that because of the monsoon, two rivers &lt;a href="w%3AAuranga"&gt;Auranga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABanki"&gt;Banki&lt;/a&gt; were in spate and had been flowing into the sea in the region.

The shooting death by &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; troops of a 10 year-old boy in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; has raised fears of a backlash and retaliation. The boy was shot and a teenager injured at around 5pm local time yesterday when, while driving a motorcycle, they sped through a roadblock cordoning off the scene of a suicide bombing. A soldier fired a bullet which passed through the 17 year-old driver and killed the boy. Military authorities are investigating the incident. 

"A motorcycle carrying two people broke through the Afghan National Police outer security cordon at high speed," said Colonel Fred Lewis, deputy commander of the Canadian contingent of &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; (ISAF) in Afghanistan. "The driver failed to heed multiple warnings to stop as he headed towards the inner Canadian cordon. A Canadian ISAF soldier then opened fire in a defensive application of our rules of engagement. A single round struck both the driver and the passenger of the motorcycle."

Lewis doubts soldiers had time to fire warning shots due to the speed of the oncoming motorcycle. He also said that while no
explosives were found on the vehicle he had a "sneaking suspicion" that soldiers feared the motorcycle carried a second suicide bomber and acted defensively. He added that he was concerned that the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; would try to exploit the incident for propaganda purposes and that he was concerned about a possible backlash by locals. 

"I would be concerned about it and I think we need to pass the right message to the Afghan people," he said. "The message is that we're here to help them and we certainly would never want to hurt them."

Relatives of the boys were at the gates of the Canadian military base last night demanding answers. 

Corporal David Braun was killed in the suicide attack which occurred two hours before the shooting. Three other soldiers were wounded but are listed in good condition. An Afghan child also died in the blast which occurred when a suicide bomber rammed his car into a Canadian convoy on patrol in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;.

Corporal Braun is the 27th Canadian soldier to die since &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%27s%20role%20in%20the%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;Canadian military operations in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; began in late 2001 as part of the American led &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terror"&gt;"War on Terror"&lt;/a&gt;.

Convicted terrorist &lt;a href="w%3AFaheem%20Khalid%20Lodhi"&gt;Faheem Khalid Lodhi&lt;/a&gt; has been sentenced a 20 years prison time by the Supreme Court of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. 

Lodhi, a 36 year old Pakistani immigrant to Australia, was earlier in June convicted on three counts of terrorist related charges, planning to attack civilian targets and military installations. Justice Anthony Whealy commented at the court hearings that Lodhi had ♡❤"the intent of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, namely violent jihad"♡❤. 

Lodhi is the first person to be convicted under a new set of strict anti-terrorism laws enacted by the Australian Government in 2005 and the first person convicted of terrorist activities inside Australia.

Lodhi, who maintains his innocence, will be eligible for parole in 2019.

The girls, wearing studded knee-high leather boots and leather pants, braved a winter chill, nippy wind and objections by some city officials, in a shot at promoting an Auckland Erotica Expo happening later this week.

Auckland Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Hubbard"&gt;Dick Hubbard&lt;/a&gt; described the parade as ♡❤"morally repugnant."♡❤

A large forest fire in Kassandra on the &lt;a href="w%3AChalkidiki"&gt;Chalkidiki&lt;/a&gt; peninsula, close to Greece's second biggest city, &lt;a href="w%3AThessalonika"&gt;Thessalonika&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Macedonia"&gt;Central Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; region, has resulted in one dead &lt;a href="w%3AGerman"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; tourist and injury to hundreds of locals and other tourists. The fire, which broke out Monday afternoon, had a front of some 20km in length as it burned through pine forest in Polychrono, Hanioti, Pefkohori and Kryopigi. Approximately 4,000 hectares (8,500 acres) of forest have been destroyed along with about 20 buildings.

The Hellenic Ministry of Mercantile Marine had sent five coastguard ships to the coasts of Kassandra to help tourists evacuate the beaches - sending them to the opposite coasts of &lt;a href="w%3ASithonia"&gt;Sithonia&lt;/a&gt; to escape the fires. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Foreign Office and UK tourist operators, more than 1,500 British tourists were in the area of Chalkidiki when the fire started. Local authorities report that a German tourist was found dead during his efforts to save his family in the coast. 

According to AFP reports, in the western point of the peninsula more than 260 firemen, along with troops of the Greek army and volunteers, are struggling to extinguish the fires that continue to burn. 

Referring to the fire on the Chalkidiki peninsula, &lt;a href="w%3APASOK"&gt;PASOK&lt;/a&gt; president George Papandreou criticised the Greek government for what he called its inability to coordinate and promptly address the problem. The response from the Greek government to the major fire that broke out in northern Greece was not at all slow, the governmental spokesman told media on Tuesday. 

However, the fire in Kassandra, Chalkidiki has provoked criticism from most of the Greek media against the government, which is blamed for not being ready to tackle such a situation. MPs of the opposition announced to the media that they are ready to officially question the ability of the government to prevent such disasters in popular tourist destinations of Greece like Chalkidiki.

Earlier today former England-manager &lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Robson"&gt;Bobby Robson&lt;/a&gt; underwent surgery to remove a tumour from his brain.

A statement was made saying the surgery went "very well", and that the tumour has been completely removed.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20Association%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Football Association of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; hopes that Sir Bobby Robson will be able to resume his duties as a consultant for the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Republic of Ireland team&lt;/a&gt; for the games against Cyprus and the Czech Republic in early October.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Mark%20Karr"&gt;John Mark Karr&lt;/a&gt;, the man who last week admitted to killing six year-old &lt;a href="w%3AJonBen%C3%A9t%20Ramsey"&gt;JonBenét Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; on Boxing Day 1996, has been told by a judge that he will be sent to &lt;a href="w%3AColorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; to face charges.

On Monday, the forty-one year-old &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; teacher was extradited from &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. From there he will fly to &lt;a href="w%3AColorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; within the next few days, and it is expected that he will be formally charged with murder, sexual assault and kidnapping.

JonBenét, a beauty queen, was found beaten and strangled to death in her Colorado home on the day after &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; in 1996.

In a press conference last Wednesday, Karr confessed to being with JonBenét when she died, adding that her death was an accident. "I was with JonBenét when she died. I loved JonBenét. She died accidentally. I am so very sorry for what happened to JonBenét. It's very important for me that everyone knows that I love her very much, that her death was unintentional, that it was an accident."

Despite his confession, Karr's then ex-wife said that he was in &lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; with her when the murder occurred.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Auckland"&gt;South Auckland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20schools%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Tyndale Park Christian School&lt;/a&gt; have been asking parents of the pupils for permission to administer corporal punishment. The parents are informed that &lt;a href="w%3Acorporal%20punishment"&gt;corporal punishment&lt;/a&gt; is illegal in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; schools but it quotes the &lt;a href="w%3ABible"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt; "we ought to serve God rather than men". Strapping children has been illegal since 1989.

"When this law was changed. . . exceptions were not given based on whether a school believed it was serving 'God rather than men'. The Education Ministry should investigate allegations that trustees and staff at an Auckland school have sought permission from parents to strap children. It appears to me the school is deliberately breaking the law," &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Aotearoa%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; Member (MP), &lt;a href="w%3ASue%20Bradford"&gt;Sue Bradford&lt;/a&gt;, said.

Today the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20Zealand%20Herald"&gt;New Zealand Herald&lt;/a&gt; reported that they had obtained documents that outline the school's "corporal correction" policy. The policy states that the strap must be given on the hand after consultation with another staff member and while that staff member is present. The child will then either be spoken to, prayed with or both.

Bradford said: "A full investigation was needed to ascertain whether any students at the school had been assaulted."

Tyndale Park Christian School is a private Christian school that caters for students ranging from Year 1 to Year 13. The costs range from &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;708-$1070 per term.

Jan Brinkham, school manager, said: "Our enrollment policy is between the parents who enroll children here and ourselves. We are not a state school; we are not bound by a particular enrollment policy," but declined to talk or comment to the New Zealand Herald about the schools corporal punishment. "This is between the parents that enrol their children at our school and that is where the buck stops. It's got nothing to do with anyone else except our parents," he added.
The &lt;a href="w%3AEducation%20Review%20Office"&gt;Education Review Office&lt;/a&gt; (ERO) and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Ministry%20of%20Education"&gt;Ministry of Education&lt;/a&gt; said that they were unaware of the policy and that private schools are not legally obliged to produce documents to government bodies.
ERO last year said in a report: "The school manager should ensure that parents are clearly informed that the school administers no corporal punishment."
Charlene Scotti, ERO area manger of review services said: "Some schools had policies to call parents in for cases where corporal punishment was required, but were careful not to include staff in punishing students."

Bruce Adin, Ministry of Education northern regional manager, said: "The legality of the Tyndale Park document was unclear, but if school staff strapped a student it would be illegal."

"Corporal punishment in schools was made illegal years ago because it was considered to be brutal and unnecessary," Bradford said.

The centre of &lt;a href="w%3ARoscrea"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt;, a small town in &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Tipperary"&gt;County Tipperary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; was evacuated on August 23rd, 2006. The decision was made after &lt;a href="w%3AGardai"&gt;Gardai&lt;/a&gt; (police) observed a man and a device believed to be dangerous in a house. Bomb disposal experts were on standby. The incident ended peacefully on August 24th, 2006 and the man, identified as Jim Hourigan, a separated father of three from &lt;a href="w%3ALimerick"&gt;Limerick&lt;/a&gt;, was taken into Garda custody.

Mr Hourigan released a statement through his solicitor, before he was placed in Gardai custody. It states he is frustrated by the delays in achieving justice for being sexually abused while training as a &lt;a href="w%3ACongregation_of_Christian_Brothers"&gt;Christian Brother&lt;/a&gt;.

Roscrea town centre remains sealed off, as Garda technical experts examine Mr Hourigan's house.

The Office of National Statistics have this morning revealed figures which show the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom’s&lt;/a&gt; population has exceeded sixty million for the first time. 

In June 2005, the number of people living in the country was 60.2 million, an increase of 0.6% since June 2004. The figures also show that there were 50.4 million people residing in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; last year.

International migration played a large part in the increase, which was the largest yearly growth in population since 1962.

Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3APranab%20Mukherjee"&gt;Pranab Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; has said &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; may withdraw the 775 troops it has stationed in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; as part of the 1,990-strong &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Interim%20Force%20in%20Lebanon"&gt;United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. 

A new U.N force, comprising of troops from Italy, France and other nations is being organised to act as a buffer between Israeli forces and &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;, following the recent conflict between the two. Diplomatic sources say the withdrawal decision may have been taken because the new mandate involves ♡❤peace-enforcement♡❤ as opposed to ♡❤peace-keeping♡❤. India, which is currently the second-largest troop-contributor to U.N peacekeeping operations, will wait till the expiry of the current mandate on 31st August before handing over its positions to the new force. The contingent from the &lt;a href="w%3ASikh%20Regiment"&gt;4th Sikh Battalion&lt;/a&gt; is currently engaged in rescue and rehabilitation work following the recent weeks of conflict, in which one of its peacekeepers was critically injured by shrapnel from an Israeli shell.

In a speech in South London this morning, Communities Secretary Ruth Kelly has urged local communities to "root out" fanaticism. 

She was speaking as head of the government's Commission on Integration and Cohesion. The commission was established to enhance community relations after the 7 July bomb attacks in London last year, and it will investigate how tensions between people of different ethnic groups and religions can be countered.

"Alongside the debate, we need action at all levels - national, but even more importantly from local communities themselves to help build united communities and root out all forms of extremism," Ms Kelly said. 

She also warned that communities were becoming more and more secluded from each other. "In our attempt to avoid imposing a single British identity and culture, have we ended up with some communities living in isolation from each other with no common bonds between them?" she asked. 

On the subject of immigration, Ms Kelly said it is not racist to discuss the issue. "We need a well-managed system of immigration that has clear rules and integrity to counter exploitations from the far right."

She also acknowledged that international events are having an impact on community relations. "Global tensions are being reflected on the streets of local communities," she said.

Damian Green, the Conservative Party's spokesman on immigration said, "There is a huge and vital challenge to be met in helping Britain's Muslim communities integrate fully with the rest of society. We hope that this latest government initiative has more substance than previous initiatives which have tended to grab a headline but then achieve very little in the long term."

&lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; celebrates its independence day today, 15 years after it broke away from the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1991.

Ukrainian president &lt;a href="w%3AVictor%20Yuschenko"&gt;Victor Yuschenko&lt;/a&gt; told a crowd at an event to mark the occasion: "By the will of the people, our country's course toward membership in the European Union and NATO will be carried through ... and most importantly, I reiterate and guarantee that Ukraine's democratic, liberal, and national choice is irreversible and unconditional."

Yuschenko told the press yesterday that he would insist on the rehabilitation of those who raised the Ukrainian flag in Ternopil in 1973.

The Russian president &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; sent a message of congratulations to his Ukrainian counterpart and offered reassurances about Russo-Ukrainian relations. His note to Yuschenko said: "I am convinced that on the basis of mutual understanding and compromise on unresolved issues we can reach the level of true strategic partnership, a fundamental principle recorded in the treaty of friendship, cooperation and partnership."

The twelve people arrested after a US flight had to make an emergency landing in Amsterdam yesterday will be released, Dutch prosecutors say. "From the statement of suspects and witnesses, no evidence could be brought forward that these men were about to commit an act of violence," said a prosecution statement. It also added that no bombs were found by police on the aircraft.

The Northwest Airlines flight, which was destined for &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, was escorted back to &lt;a href="w%3AAmsterdam%20Schiphol%20Airport"&gt;Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport&lt;/a&gt; due to a security alert. 

The plane, which had 149 passengers on board, was accompanied by two F-16 fighter jets after passengers became concerned about a group of Asian men who were fidgeting with plastic bags and mobile phones. 

On landing, the twelve passengers were taken off the plane and interrogated by police.

Since August 10, when police in the UK claimed they had foiled a suspected plot to blow up several transatlantic planes, there have been several similar incidents.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A1%20Ceres"&gt;Ceres&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUB313"&gt;2003 UB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also have been recognised as dwarf planets. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharon%20%28moon%29"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which was previously in the run for promotion, did not meet the final criteria for a dwarf planet.

Some 2500 astronomers from over 75 countries gathered this week in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrague"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the Congress of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Astronomical%20Union"&gt;International Astronomical Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IAU) to decide on several issues like a formal definition of a planet. Previously, there was no definition and with the discovery of new objects beyond Pluto there was much need for a clear criterion. The scientists also discussed new research findings in their field.

Louis Friedman, the executive director of the Planetary Society in California said: "The classification doesn't matter. Pluto — and all Solar System objects — are mysterious and exciting new worlds that need to be explored and better understood."

The final draft states: "A ♡❤planet♡❤ is a celestial body that 
<ol>
BULLET::::1. is in orbit around the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASun"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::2. has sufficient mass for its self-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agravity"&gt;gravity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to overcome &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arigid%20body"&gt;rigid body forces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; so that it assumes a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahydrostatic%20equilibrium"&gt;hydrostatic equilibrium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (nearly round) shape
BULLET::::3. has &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClearing%20the%20neighbourhood"&gt;cleared the neighbourhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around its orbit.

</ol>
<ol>
BULLET::::1. is in orbit around the Sun,
BULLET::::2. has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape,
BULLET::::3. has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit,
BULLET::::4. is not a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20satellite"&gt;satellite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

</ol>

Pluto did not meet one of the criteria for planet: its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aorbit"&gt;orbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is highly &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrbital%20eccentricity"&gt;eccentric&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , causing it to overlap with Neptune's. The IAU has a dozen other objects similar to Pluto on its "watchlist" and is expected to announce new dwarf planets in the coming months and years.

Ever since its discovery by American &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClyde%20Tombaugh"&gt;Clyde Tombaugh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1930, Pluto has been considered a planet, though its status has been questioned many times after it was discovered to be far less massive than earlier calculations suggested, and because of its many other eccentricities. As a consequence of the vote, many textbooks, encyclopedias and other sources will need rewriting.

The ship of the organisation &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt;, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARainbow%20Warrior"&gt;Rainbow Warrior II&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, was blockaded off &lt;a href="w%3AMarseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt; by a fleet of 30 fisherman ships. The fishermen protested against the campaign by Greenpeace regarding an alleged over-fishing of blue-fin tuna.

The fishermen encircled the ♡❤Rainbow Warrior II♡❤, leaving her only the room to receive supply from the land by means of small boats. The confrontation was settled when Greenpeace accepted that a ship of the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Navy"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt;, the oceanic tug ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAbeille%20Flandre"&gt;Abeille Flandre&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, escort her to another harbour for supply, before leaving for Spain.

After blockading the ship, the fishermen blockaded the commercial harbour of Marseille, blocking traffic of passengers. 

The &lt;a href="w%3APr%C3%A9fet%20Maritime"&gt;préfecture maritime&lt;/a&gt; has required an investigation by the &lt;a href="w%3AParquet%20%28legal%29"&gt;parquet&lt;/a&gt; regarding the multiple infractions which the Navy reported; these include the fishermen blocking and boarding the ♡❤Rainbow Warrior II♡❤, the ♡❤Rainbow Warrior II♡❤ twice violating orders from the préfecture maritime not to stay off Marseille, and "problematic manoeuvers" on both sides.

Eight people, including one child, were killed in an early morning raid by US and Afghan forces in the Asmar, a village in the &lt;a href="w%3AKunar"&gt;Kunar&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; bordering Pakistan. American forces claim that the seven adults were linked with &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; while Afghan police deny this saying that the victims were local families and elders who had gathered to resolve a dispute. 

The US military says the raid was launched after American and Afghan forces came under attack. 

"Afghan and coalition forces came under direct fire when approaching the compound and defended themselves with return fire," the U.S. statement said.

"All of the men killed were engaging Afghan and coalition forces with hostile fire."

Weapons, ammunition and grenades were seized according to the American statement. 

The dead child was between the ages of 10 and 12 according to Colonel Thomas Collins who claimed "al-Qaeda fighters deliberately put women and children at risk in an effort to protect their illegal and immoral operations." 

American forces have been involved in heavy fighting in Kunar in the past month as they search for &lt;a href="w%3ATaleban"&gt;Taleban&lt;/a&gt; and al-Qaeda fighters in the rugged mountains of the region.

Javed Iqbal, owner of &lt;a href="w%3ABrooklyn"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;-based television company HDTV Ltd., was arrested yesterday by &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States government authorities&lt;/a&gt; for airing content from &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Manar"&gt;al-Manar&lt;/a&gt; (The Beacon). According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;U.S. Department of the Treasury&lt;/a&gt;, Iqbal has been charged with &lt;a href="w%3AConspiracy%20%28crime%29"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; to violate the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Emergency%20Economic%20Powers%20Act"&gt;International Emergency Economic Powers Act&lt;/a&gt;. Government authorities also &lt;a href="w%3ASearch%20warrant"&gt;searched&lt;/a&gt; the HDTV Ltd. office and Iqbal's home in &lt;a href="w%3AStaten%20Island"&gt;Staten Island&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion of maintaining &lt;a href="w%3ASatellite%20dish"&gt;satellite dishes&lt;/a&gt;.

According to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the arrest followed a tip from a confidential source in February. A lawyer representing Iqbal, Mustapha Ndanusa, described the accusations against his client &amp;mdash; violating U.S. law by providing news outlets to people with a satellite dish &amp;mdash; as "completely ridiculous". If convicted, Iqbal faces up to five years in prison.

Al-Manar was launched by &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; in 1991. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has declared al-Manar a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity pursuant to &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Order%2013224"&gt;Executive Order 13224&lt;/a&gt;, which criminalizes business conduct with al-Manar and prohibits their access to American news outlets. France and Spain have also prohibited al-Manar broadcasts. Transmission of al-Manar broadcasts in North America via &lt;a href="w%3AIntelsat"&gt;Intelsat&lt;/a&gt; have been blocked since December 17, 2004, when the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. Department of State&lt;/a&gt; placed al-Manar on the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department%20list%20of%20Foreign%20Terrorist%20Organizations"&gt;Terrorist Exclusion List&lt;/a&gt;.

The criminality of Iqbal actions are also subject to the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; rights of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;U.S. Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, which states in part; "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press..."

After a meeting with the government and general officers, &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20President"&gt;French President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; announced today that the French complement in the &lt;a href="w%3AUNIFIL"&gt;UNIFIL&lt;/a&gt; will be increased to 2,000. 

"Conditions required by France being fulfilled, I decided to favourably answer the requests of the General Secretary of the United Nations, and of the Lebanese and Israeli governments", Chirac declared; "two more battalions will come to reinforce our deployment on the field within the UNIFIL. 2,000 French soldiers will thus serve under the blue helmet in Lebanon".

Chirac also underlined that the deployment of the 1,700 strong &lt;a href="w%3AOp%C3%A9ration%20Baliste"&gt;Opération Baliste&lt;/a&gt; would continue.

UNIFIL is currently headed by French Major General &lt;a href="w%3AAlain%20Pellegrini"&gt;Alain Pellegrini&lt;/a&gt;.

France initially surprised the world by promising to send only 200 more soldiers, after playing a major diplomatic role in settling the cease-fire, and while a reinforcement of the UNIFIL to 15,000 troops had been announced by the United Nations. The press has commented that France is reluctant to send Blue Helmets without clear rules of engagements and guarantees, after the experience of the &lt;a href="w%3AUNPROFOR"&gt;UNPROFOR&lt;/a&gt; in Bosnia, where French soldiers had been forced to witness atrocities without being able to intervene, had been taken hostages without means to defend themselves, and had suffered heavy casualties.

Countries expected to contribute the bulk of the troops to the "reinforced UNIFIL" are France, &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;; reinforcements are also expected from &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. 

President Chirac said that he wanted a "fair repartition of contributions" and called for "other permanent members of the Security Council" to contribute; he mentioned that "Several European partners will do so, as well as important Muslim countries of Asia". Chirac cited &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201701"&gt;United Nations Resolution 1701&lt;/a&gt; by requesting "the release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, the return of the Lebanese prisoners, the delineation of the borders, especially in the Shebaa Farms area". 

Lebanese Prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AFouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt; declared that "the decision from President Chirac helps Lebanon, reinforced her stability, and helps her get back her territory through Israeli withdrawal, and instaur authority of the State in South Lebanon".

<h1>Congo electoral commissioner condemns Kinshasha clashes</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Congo%20electoral%20commissioner%20condemns%20Kinshasha%20clashes&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Nearly a week after the announcement of provisional election results in the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt; sparked violence across the capital &lt;a href="w%3A%20Kinshasa"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt;, the country's Electoral Commissioner has spoken out to halt clashes.

In an interview with journalists associated with the UN mission in Congo, Independent Electoral Commission President, Fr Malu Malu called for an end to gun battles between forces loyal to two presidential candidates. 

"It cannot be accepted, and any Congolese in his or her right mind could not consider that what happened was normal," he said, "The country and the Congolese people have expressed their will in the clearest possible way, and their choice needs to be accepted." 

Mr. Malu Malu also added that if calm returned to Kinshasha this weekend, his commission would slowly begin to announce other election results, but added that security was essential for this to happen. "All of us - the organisers of the elections, the voters, candidates, observers, and our friends who support the electoral process - all of us have a need for security, and we will not tolerate insecurity. I believe security is an issue of shared responsibility which is demanded of all of us" he said. 

Meanwhile, the incumbent government has been counting the cost of this week's violence. It is now believed around 43 people have been killed in clashes since Sunday, with many bodies still lying in the streets. The dead include 12 policemen and 4 civilians. 

Violence began after provisional results were announced for July’s landmark elections last Sunday, and several gunfights took place across the capital. 

Violence broke out around the house of one of the main presidential contenders, &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Pierre%20Bemba"&gt;Jean-Pierre Bemba&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. As Bemba was meeting with U.N. officials and ambassadors, troops loyal to the incumbent president, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Joseph_Kabila"&gt;Joseph Kabila&lt;/a&gt;, opened fire around Bemba’s villa, forcing 14 ambassadors to flee for cover. 

UN troops soon took over control in the city, but sporadic clashes continued through Tuesday. The streets have become deserted according to journalists in Kinshasa. 

A fragile truce was declared on Tuesday as both Kabila and Bemba agreed to withdraw their forces from the city. The largest &lt;a href="w%3A%20United_Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeping force in the world is currently trying to maintain the peace, which analysts fear may not last.

"The situation is still very tense," one diplomat told &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, "there are too many nervous men wandering around with guns, but we have moved on from the clashes earlier this week."

<h3>Electoral divide</h3>
Hopes were high that elections in the Democratic Republic – the first since 1961 – would mark a new start for the massive country. The initial results, however, revealed marked divisions among the population. 

The current president, Joseph Kabila, holds the lead with 44.81% of the vote, more than twice the general support of Bemba. Kabila's support though comes solely from the eastern provinces in the country. In western Kinshasha, Kabila holds just 13% of the vote, and in the west and north of the country his strength is minimal.

A presidential run-off between Kabila and Bemba is set for the 29th October.

An 8th case of &lt;a href="w%3Amad%20cow"&gt;mad cow disease&lt;/a&gt; was found in a cow in the province of &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Food%20Inspection%20Agency"&gt;Canadian Food Inspection Agency&lt;/a&gt; did a test and found &lt;a href="w%3ABovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;BSE&lt;/a&gt;. The agency found no part of the beef cow's carcass entered either the human or animal feed chains. The CFIA said that, "the cow could have likely lived another 6 months or so, but died of complications of mastitis".

"The animal's age is between eight and 10 years", said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

The CFIA also traced 172 animals would likely ate feed out of that load. 

"The cow's exposure to BSE likely occurred before or during the introduction of new feed regulations in 1997 prohibiting use of cattle parts susceptible to the disease in certain animal feeds", A release said yesterday.

An investigation is already underway to find the animal's birth farm and potential sources of contaminated feed.

The United States has delayed lifting a ban on older cattle imports from Canada, pending investigation.

<h1>Israel buys nuclear capable subs</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Israel%20buys%20nuclear%20capable%20subs&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; has purchased two more &lt;a href="w%3ADolphin%20class%20submarine"&gt;Dolphin class submarines&lt;/a&gt; which have the capacity to carry &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20warhead"&gt;nuclear warheads&lt;/a&gt;. Israel already has three older nuclear weapons-capable Dolphin submarines but the new Dolphins have propulsion systems that allow them to remain submerged for longer periods of time, according to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem%20Post"&gt;Jerusalem Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, making it harder for them to be tracked by satellite. Experts view the purchase as a clear signal to &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; that Israel can retaliate if subjected to a nuclear attack. 

"The Iranians would be very foolish if they attacked Israel," said Paul Beaver, a British based defence analyst, speaking to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. According to Beaver, the submarines would provide Israel with both &lt;a href="w%3Afirst%20strike"&gt;first strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Asecond%20strike"&gt;second strike&lt;/a&gt; capability.

Israel already has land-based nuclear-capable ballistic missiles in the form of the &lt;a href="w%3AJericho%20missile"&gt;Jericho I and II missiles&lt;/a&gt;. 

German officials confirm that the contracts for the new submarines was signed July 6. The ♡❤Jerusalem Post♡❤ reports that they will be operational shortly. 

Israel has never confirmed nor denied that it has nuclear weapons but is believed to have the world's sixth largest stockpile of the devices, with most outside estimates putting their stockpile in the low hundreds. Israel's possession of nuclear arms has often been a locus of bitter controversy in the Middle East, especially among countries who believe that the world community, and especially the United States, is hypocritical in its tolerance of Israeli nuclear arms while decrying the efforts of other Middle Eastern nations to develop their own nuclear capabilities.

Meanwhile, the ♡❤Jerusalem Post♡❤ reports there is a growing mood among Israel's defence establishment that the country will have to act independently to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons as the United States is unlikely to do so.

"America is stuck in Iraq and cannot go after Iran militarily right now," according to an unnamed official quoted by the paper. 

A report by the US House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee released on Wednesday asserts that if Iran arms itself with nuclear weapons, Israel would be pressed to respond militarily. "A nuclear armed Iran would likely exacerbate regional tensions. Israel would find it hard to live with a nuclear armed Iran and could take military action against Iranian nuclear facilities," the report states. Iran has continually maintained that it seeks only to develop nuclear technology for the production of electrical power, though this has been disputed by many nations.

<h1>Venezuelan President Chavez in Beijing to boost trade</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Venezuelan%20President%20Chavez%20in%20Beijing%20to%20boost%20trade&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, Wednesday, beginning a visit that will see new agreements to increase China's investment in Venezuela's petroleum, telecoms, agriculture and transport. Chavez says that his country intends to boost its oil exports to China to 500,000 barrels a day within five years, quadrupling its current exports, and up to one million barrels a day by 2012. 

"Within five years we'll arrive at half a million barrels (a day) to China. We are currently exporting close to 150,000 barrels (a day), and next year we will double that," Chavez said.

"The oil issue is of utmost importance because we are diversifying the petroleum business. We are moving toward a new petroleum model," said Chavez, speaking on Venezuelan state television from China. "It's one step more in a strategic alliance."

Chavez met Chinese President &lt;a href="w%3AHu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, senior leader &lt;a href="w%3AWu%20Bangguo"&gt;Wu Bangguo&lt;/a&gt; and Premier &lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. Following Thursday's meeting, Chavez said that Jintao agreed to support Venezuela's bid to join the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; as a non-permanent member. He is also discussing Chinese involvement in developing his countries gold and coal mining industries, according to reports.

The countries are also signing agreements for Chinese assistance in building a petrochemical plant within the Amuay oil refinery in western Venezuela. 

Agreements are expected to be signed with two of China's state owned oil companies to develop and export crude from Venezuela's Orinoco river basin as well as to approve the sale of Chinese oil tankers to Venezuela. 

While the United States remains the leading importer of Venezuela's oil, Chavez' left wing government has sought to diversify its trading partners in an attempt to reduce its reliance on the United States and promote a "multi-polar" world order.

China is the world's second largest consumer of petroleum and is in need of increased oil supplies in order to maintain its rapid pace of economic growth. 

Chavez told Venezuelan state television that increased trade with China and &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; will help boost Venezuela to medium-power status. He claimed that investment agreements with China will transfer technology to his country and help Venezuela escape dependency.

The bodies of a Canadian soldier killed in a suicide bombing in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; has been returned to &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, Wednesday, the same day that the remains of a child killed by Canadian troops in the aftermath of the car bomb was returned to his family. 

The soldier was killed in a suicide car bombing outside a military base two hours before the shooting took place. The 10-year old Afghan boy was riding on the back of a motorcycle when he and a teenaged driver sped to the scene of the attack, crossing a security perimeter that had been set up.

The boy's death has angered Afghans in the area and military officials are concerned of a backlash from the incident. 

The casket of Corporal David Braun, 27, was flown from Kandahar in a C-130 Hercules aircraft. He was the eighth Canadian soldier killed in Afghanistan this August and the 27th Canadian killed in Afghanistan since troops were deployed there in early 2002. Three other soldiers were injured in the suicide attack on the NATO convoy but are reported to be in good condition.

<h2>Incident under scrutiny</h2>

The military's National Investigation Service is scrutinizing the shooting of the Afghan boys. According to a &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; statement: "Soldiers signalled the motorbike to stop and fired two warning shots...the rider and passenger were both hit and wounded by a single bullet." Officials say that the motorcycle was fired upon by troops who feared a second suicide attack was underway. 

Colonel Fred Lewis, deputy commander of NATO's &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; (ISAF), denies that the shooting occurred because newly-arrived Canadian soldiers were inexperienced. 

"I don't think so, I really don't think so," Lewis told ♡❤The Canadian Press♡❤. "Initial impressions right now are the soldiers did what they had to do." 

The victims were taken to medics and then flown to Kandahar Air Field Hospital where the ten year old died. The driver, 17, remains in serious but stable condition. 

"We are very sad at what happened and we express our deep regret and condolences to the family and community," said Col. Arie Vermeij, deputy commander of ISAF's Regional Command South.

<h2>Residents angry</h2>

The father of the dead boy denounced Canada's military when approached by the Canadian Press for comment. Several women at the family home screamed, cried and shook their fists.

Military officials fear a backlash in response to the boy's death. In the aftermath of the shooting, angry Kandahar residents expressed support for the suicide bombers and their opposition to foreign troops remaining on Afghan soil. 

"They're very angry about that, the shopkeepers, the bakery man, all the people that are living in this place," said a Kandahar resident who works for a non-governmental agency and who was at the scene. 

"They're angry and they get upset and they get out of patience, and they said, 'Yeah, we support the suicide (bombers)'," he told the ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤.

The bomb, aimed at the Canadian patrol, killed 21 Afghan civilians and wounded 13.

"We support them and the international community should leave Afghanistan. We want to build our country by ourselves," he quoted other residents as saying.

"They have been telling me that they had better leave, all the ISAF, the security forces, the peacekeepers, they have to leave our country," he said. "It's a very bad situation. It's dangerous and you can't trust anyone. The Canadian soldier had to do something but sometimes ... mistakes are made."

On August 16, 2006 &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; announced its official search. "The original tapes may be at the &lt;a href="w%3AGoddard%20Space%20Flight%20Centre"&gt;Goddard Space Flight Centre&lt;/a&gt; … or at another location within the NASA archiving system. NASA engineers are hopeful that when the tapes are found they can use today's digital technology to provide a version of the &lt;a href="w%3Amoonwalk"&gt;moonwalk&lt;/a&gt; that is much better quality than what we have today."

The news that the tapes were missing broke to the public on August 5, 2006 when the printed and online versions of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald"&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ published the story with the title ♡❤One giant blunder for mankind: how NASA lost moon pictures♡❤.

The &lt;a href="Apollo%20program"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; missing tapes are the recordings of the transmissions (television, sound and telemetry data) broadcast during the Apollo missions (including broadcasts from the &lt;a href="w%3AMoon"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;), referred to as Slow-Scan TV (&lt;a href="w%3ASSTV"&gt;SSTV&lt;/a&gt;). This raw data was recorded onto 1" wide magnetic tapes at the same time as it was converted for terrestrial TV broadcast. There are about 2612 boxes that might contain the tapes and whose location is unknown. It is estimated that about 13,000 original magnetic tapes are missing. They might be at Goddard Space Flight Center or another location within the NASA archiving system. Scientists believe that if the tapes are found modern techniques would allow these tapes to be turned into higher quality pictures than the ones seen by the public.

The wife of the &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;'s new prime minister has joined a rival political party after he admitted, last Friday, having a affair with the deputy leader of parliament. &lt;a href="w%3AMirek%20Topolanek"&gt;Mirek Topolanek&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the conservative &lt;a href="w%3ACivic%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Civic Democrats (ODS)&lt;/a&gt;, was appointed prime minister last week. His wife, Pavla Topolankova, has joined the rival right-wing Politika 21 party and intends to run for the Senate under its banner. 

"I was surprised but not cross," said Topolanek who called his wife's action "sweet revenge" for his infidelity. Lucie Talmanova, 36, the deputy leader of parliament has admitted the affair with Topolanek who told Czech radio "respectable people don't ask about such things and respectable people don't answer such things. But in 27 years of marriage things can happen."

Topolanek has reportedly instructed his lawyer to begin divorce proceedings against his wife.

Almost two-thirds of &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;is want Prime Minister &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; to resign, according to a public opinion poll published on Friday. The survey suggests there has been a major shift in Israeli public opinion in the wake of Israel's 34-day war in Lebanon that appeared to achieve few of Israel's military objectives. The poll published by ♡❤Yedioth Aronoth♡❤, Israel's bestselling paper, also shows that 45% of Israelis would vote for &lt;a href="Benjamin%20Netanyahu"&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt; of the right wing &lt;a href="Likud"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt; in an election where only he and Olmert were candidates.

A second poll published in ♡❤Maariv♡❤ gives Olmert 14% support compared to 26% for Nethanyahu and that Olmert's centrist &lt;a href="Kadima"&gt;Kadima&lt;/a&gt; party would win only 14 seats in the Knesset compared to 28 for Likud and 28 for ultranationalist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAvigdor%20Lieberman"&gt;Avigdor Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Beiteinu"&gt;Israel Beiteinu party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The centre-left &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which is currently in a coalition with Kadima, would win only 9 seats according to the survey. 74% of respondents want Labour leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmir%20Peretz"&gt;Amir Peretz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to quit his post as defense minister. 

The ♡❤Maariv♡❤ poll showed 73 percent of Israelis opposed future unilateral withdrawals.

&lt;a href="w%3AEuan%20Blair"&gt;Euan Blair&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest son of British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, has been admitted to a hospital in Barbados after complaining of stomach pains. 

The twenty-two year-old is being treated in the &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20Hospital%2C%20Bridgetown"&gt;Queen Elizabeth Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, near Bridgetown. Andrew Zbar, who is a doctor there, said that he expected Euan to be dismissed from the hospital later today.

Tony Blair and his family had been holidaying on the Caribbean island for the past three weeks. Mr Blair returned home this morning and is back at his office in Number 10. He is said to be keeping up to date with his son's condition.

A spokeswoman from Downing Street said: "We can confirm that Euan Blair was taken into hospital with a stomach complaint."

India summoned the Ambassador of the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Niehe"&gt;Eric Niehe&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Foreign%20Minister"&gt;Ministry of External Affairs&lt;/a&gt; today, following the detention of 12 Indian nationals in Amsterdam because of their alleged "suspicious" behaviour onboard a NorthWest Airlines flight headed for &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. Minister of External Affairs &lt;a href="w%3AAnand%20Sharma"&gt;Anand Sharma&lt;/a&gt; said that the Indian Government's views had been communicated to their Dutch counterparts at the "highest level" and that India's envoy in that country was also in touch with the officials there. 

U.S. air marshalls were guarding the flight from Amsterdam to India and according to a Tennessee politician,John Duncan, the American air marshalls "..felt that there were passengers on the plane that were acting in a suspicious way, they conferred with both the flight attendants and the captain and they decided to turn the plane around and bring it back to the airport," Duncan said.

The Ministry's secretary (Western relations), Mrs. Shashi Tripathi met Niehe at the &lt;a href="w%3ASecretariat%20Building"&gt;South Block&lt;/a&gt; and conveyed to him that India had taken the detention of the Indian citizens "very seriously". India has asked its Ambassador in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hague"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt; to submit a detailed report of the incident to the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20India"&gt;Government&lt;/a&gt; for further analysis of the issue. 

Niehe expressed his regret over the incident and clarified that his government had had nothing to do with the detentions. He said the passengers were arrested after they allegedly behaved in an "unruly" manner and were released after being interrogated. He said that the arrests of the 12 Muslims, who according to eye-witnesses, sported beards and spoke &lt;a href="w%3AUrdu"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt;, had nothing to do with racism. The detainees, who had gone to Tobago on business, have since left for their homes in Mumbai and are expected to reach by Friday night. The detainees and their family, however allege that they were unfairly targeted on racist grounds.

Sharma rejected claims that the government had mishandled the issue, saying his officials had acted quickly to get the Indian citizens out of custody within 30 hours of their arrest. He also pointed out that consular access had been provided to them much before the 48 hour time limit stipulated by the &lt;a href="w%3AVienna%20Convention"&gt;Vienna Convention&lt;/a&gt;.

Residents in the city of Port Harcourt said that &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigerian&lt;/a&gt; troops burnt down hundreds of slum dwellings, allegedly as reprisal after an Army sergeant was killed in Thursday's abduction of oil workers in the area. 

Residents told news agencies that troops poured petrol over slum houses located near a compound belonging to Saipem, a subsidiary of Italian oil company &lt;a href="w%3AEni"&gt;Eni&lt;/a&gt;, and set them alight. The fires have reportedly destroyed hundreds of homes and shops and hundreds of people are said to have fled from the area. On Friday, people returning to the area and onlookers were chased away by soldiers. 

Speaking to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, Army &lt;a href="w%3ABrigadier%20General"&gt;Brigadier General&lt;/a&gt; Samuel Salihu denied that Nigerian troops were responsible for the arson. He said that militants active in the area had set the fires, wearing Army camouflage. 

On Thursday, oil workers were kidnapped from a bar near the slums by armed men who shot dead an Army soldier guarding the workers, and injured another soldier. Nigerian military sources said at least two foreign oil workers were missing, one of them, Italian. The Italian foreign ministry, though, said that three foreigners were missing. 

The oil-rich &lt;a href="w%3ANiger%20Delta"&gt;Niger Delta&lt;/a&gt; region has witnessed a spate of kidnappings recently. Nineteen people were held captive in eight separate abductions this month. All but three of them have been released since, some after the state government and the oil companies paid a ransom. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20for%20the%20Emancipation%20of%20the%20Niger%20Delta"&gt;Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta&lt;/a&gt; (MEND), a militant group which has taken hostages and attacked oil facilities, but says it does not kidnap for ransom, said in a statement that it the state government has encouraged such abductions by paying ransoms.

Last week, as part of a tougher line adopted by the Nigerian government, President &lt;a href="w%3AOlus%E1%BA%B9gun%20%E1%BB%8Cbasanj%E1%BB%8D"&gt;Obasanjo&lt;/a&gt; sent in the Army, with orders to use "force for force" against militants in the region. Over 160 people were taken into custody in a two day crackdown, including over 100 from a nearby slum, but most have been released since then. 

The BBC's Alex Last reports that local leaders and oil companies are concerned that this new tough policy will increase tensions in the region.

<h1>Liberal MP resigns as deputy foreign affairs critic</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Liberal%20MP%20resigns%20as%20deputy%20foreign%20affairs%20critic&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Liberal MP &lt;a href="w%3ABorys%20Wrzesnewskyj"&gt;Borys Wrzesnewskyj&lt;/a&gt; has resigned after an uproar over his comments suggesting that Canada should negotiate directly with Lebanon's &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;, which is on Canada's &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20terrorist%20organisations"&gt;list of terrorist organizations&lt;/a&gt;. In response to the statement by Wrzesnewskyj, Liberal leadership hopefuls &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Brison"&gt;Scott Brison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACarolyn%20Bennett"&gt;Carolyn Bennett&lt;/a&gt; had immediately demanded Wrzesnewskyj step down from his post, saying that his comments were unacceptable.

"His comments, which were not representative of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal party&lt;/a&gt;, caused a lot of concern," said Liberal MP &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Martin"&gt;Keith Martin&lt;/a&gt;.

Tory MP &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Kenney"&gt;Jason Kenney&lt;/a&gt;, was calling his comments nothing short of a sign of support for terrorist groups. "Their idea of a balanced approach is one where Israel is always wrong," said Kenney. "This represents a totally irresponsible approach to foreign security policy."

Wrzesnewskyj denied media reports about him claiming that he wants Hezbollah taken off Ottawa's official list of terrorist organizations.

"I've said all along that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization and will continue to be," Wrzesnewskyj said.

Wrzesnewskyj resigned on Wednesday and interim Liberal Leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt; said his resignation was accepted.

<h2>Kenny</h2>

Jason Kenney subsequently came under fire when it was revealed that in April he spoke to a rally organized by supporters of a banned Iranian terrorist group. A photograph of Kenney appears on the website of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, the political wing of the PMOI, or &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Mojahedin%20Organization%20of%20Iran"&gt;People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

The PMOI is one of the names used by the MEK, or &lt;a href="w%3AMujahedin-e-Khalq"&gt;Mujahedin-e-Khalq&lt;/a&gt;, an armed Iranian rebel group formally designated as a terrorist organization by the governments of Canada, the United States and the European Union. 

"It really means that Jason Kenney is a hypocrite," &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;New Democrat&lt;/a&gt; MP &lt;a href="w%3APeggy%20Nash"&gt;Peggy Nash&lt;/a&gt; said in response to the news.

"He's speaking to an organization that's linked to a terrorist organization according to Canada and the U.S. State Department, and he's done it on the steps of Parliament Hill in the name of the Prime Minister," she added.

American Airlines flight 55 from &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%2C%20England"&gt;Manchester, England&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; has been diverted due to a security alert and has landed in &lt;a href="w%3ABangor%2C%20Maine"&gt;Bangor, Maine&lt;/a&gt;.

An American Airlines spokesman in London, Richard Hedges, said: "I can confirm AA flight 55 from Manchester to Chicago (was) diverted into Bangor, Maine, due to a possible security concern."

An FBI spokeswoman, Gail Marcinkiewicz, said: "We're responding to determine the cause of the diversion. It's going to take a number of hours for passengers to be interviewed. The pilot made a decision to divert the plane and we're investigating this now. We're interviewing the pilot, crew and passengers."

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;, the flight was diverted when officials "learned of a reported threat to the aircraft while it was en route," said Richard Kolko, another spokeman for the FBI.

The US Transportation Security Administration said: "Given the current threat level, the agency, in conjunction with other federal authorities, took prudent action to assure the safety of the passengers and crew. The plane has landed safely and passengers are being de-planed while TSA canines search the airplane. Responders are on the scene and the FBI will be interviewing the passengers and crew to further assess the situation." 

There is no word on what caused the flight to be diverted, but ♡❤Guardian Unlimited♡❤ is reporting that the bomb squad has been asked to assist. There are at least 179 passengers onboard the plane.

Since August 10, when police in the UK claimed they had foiled a suspected plot to blow up several transatlantic planes, there have been several similar incidents.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; committed itself to participate in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20Nations%20Interim%20Force%20in%20Lebanon"&gt;United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; (UNIFIL), in an announcement in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; today. The size and the exact form of Portugal's participation will be decided in the next days by the Portuguese Superior Council of National Defence.

"We assumed the political responsibility to accompany the European partners", Luís Amado, Portugal's Foreign Affairs Minister, said.

Luís Amado said that the government has been coordinating with President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAn%C3%ADbal%20Cavaco%20Silva"&gt;Cavaco Silva&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APortuguese%20Armed%20Forces"&gt;Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; over the composition and size of the Portuguese contingent, with several possible scenarios.

"The Prime Minister has been in contact with the President that will convene the Superior Council of National Defence", Amado added.

The Foreign Affairs Minister refused to confirm details of the deployment, which have been speculated upon by the press, which advanced the possibility of sending of a mechanized group, a engineering company or a frigate. 

"I had the chance to announce our participation in this force, having started the constitutional procedures that will allow us in the next days to announce the exact dimension of our participation", concluded Amado.

Portugal currently has a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APortuguese%20Air%20Force"&gt;Portuguese Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AC-130"&gt;C-130 Hercules&lt;/a&gt; flying &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees"&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&lt;/a&gt;' missions, to transport humanitarian aid to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, and has deployed more than 800 troops in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABosnia%20and%20Herzegovina"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;. Another 200 troops are expected to be deployed in the next months to Afghanistan and East Timor to reinforce the current forces there.

A &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas, Texas&lt;/a&gt; man foiled a burglary in &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, after spotting thieves trying to break into a shop. The man spotted the burglary using a webcam. He went online to view images of the city's famous &lt;a href="w%3ABeatles"&gt;Beatles&lt;/a&gt; quarter on Mathew Street, an area in Liverpool synonymous with the Beatles and home to the &lt;a href="w%3ACavern%20Club"&gt;Cavern Club&lt;/a&gt; where the band regularly played.

The man saw intruders apparently breaking into a sports store. Then he telephoned the &lt;a href="w%3AMerseyside%20Police"&gt;Merseyside Police&lt;/a&gt;. The police went to the scene and arrested 3 men.

"We did get a call from someone in Dallas who was watching on a webcam that looks into the tourist areas, of which Mathew Street is one because of all the Beatles stuff," a Merseyside Police spokeswoman said.

There was a ladder against a wall and a first-floor window had been broken, and the men were taking property out.

The men are all aged in their mid-30s. They are arrested on suspicion of burglary and bailed pending further inquiries.

The investigation is ongoing.

&lt;a href="w%3AEuan%20Blair"&gt;Euan Blair&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest son of British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, has been released from hospital this evening. He was admitted yesterday after complaining of stomach pains. 

The twenty-two year-old was being treated in the &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20Hospital%2C%20Bridgetown"&gt;Queen Elizabeth Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, near Bridgetown. It is not thought that Euan's condition was serious and he did not undergo surgery.

Tony Blair and his family had been holidaying on the Caribbean island for the past three weeks. Mr Blair returned home this morning and he was kept up to date with his son's condition.

The European leaders who met on Thursday in &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; announced that &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; would be likely to take command of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Interim%20Force%20In%20Lebanon"&gt;United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;(UNIFIL), but &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; is to remain in command until February 2007. 

&lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and France are to send soldiers with &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Britain"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; sending military expert units to Lebanon. &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; will not be sending land troops due to historical reasons. 

&lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; called for 9000 soldiers to be sent soon, whereas &lt;a href="w%3APhilipe%20Douste-Blazy"&gt;Philippe Douste-Blazy&lt;/a&gt;, the French Foreign Minister maintained that only 7000 are to be sent. The French President &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; declared during a conference with the German Chancellor, &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; that there not more than 15,000 "blue helmets" will be stationed in Lebanon, calling this number "definitely excessive".

The Israeli Prime Minister's spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AAvi%20Pazner"&gt;Avi Pazner&lt;/a&gt;, speaking after the French announcement of sending 2000 soldiers, said "11,000 soldiers would still be missing".

France did not officially oppose this decision.

Contrary to &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Harper"&gt;Steven Harper's&lt;/a&gt; plan to put Canada's newly created &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Marriage%20Bill"&gt;Civil Marriage Bill&lt;/a&gt; back on the floor of the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20vote"&gt;free vote&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Quebecois&lt;/a&gt; plans to oppose any attempts by the Conservatives to revisit the issue when Parliament returns in the fall. 

"It is simply believed that the debate has taken place and it is not relevant to start it again," said Bloc Leader &lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20Duceppe"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; debate in Canada was kicked off in 2003 by a ruling of the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Court%20of%20Appeal"&gt;Ontario Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; which found that the constitution's definition of marriage between one man and one woman was unconstitutional, and forced Ontario to recoginize same-sex marriage. The ruling sparked similar provincial supreme court challenges in the nine other provinces, promping then Former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; to introduce a bill in the House of Commons that changed the federal constitution's definition to a union between two people. The controversial bill drew fire from Canada's conservative and religious communities who alleged that such a change to the constitution would destroy Canadian society, and lead to churches being forced to perform same-sex marriages. The bill was later changed to exclude any religious institution from being forced to perform marriages that were contrary to church doctrine. After putting the bill to a free vote in the House of Commons in the spring of 2005, the bill received the support of the house and was drafted into law. In the election that followed, Conservative Party leader Steven Harper vowed to revisit the issue of equal marriage with another free vote, this time hoping to reverse the constitutional change.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Courtrooms%20in%20Ontario%20to%20get%20cameras&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Ontario courtrooms could get cameras for Ontarians to watch court proceedings on television. This is awaiting approval by both the government and judges.

Ontario Attorney General &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20J.%20Bryant"&gt;Michael Bryant&lt;/a&gt; released a report on justice and the media which recommends cameras to be allowed in courtrooms except during witness testimony. Bryant said he agreed with the suggestion from a panel of experts composed of court officials and members of news organizations. "I think that our justice system is ready for its close-up," Bryant said in Toronto.

Bryant agreed Thursday, saying the compromise position would avoid sensational coverage of criminal trials often seen in the U.S.

"The panel looked at that and wanted to avoid the circus," said Bryant. "There were great concerns about television cameras reporting in a fashion that would intimidate witnesses. Some witnesses (and some victims) might not come forward if they thought they would be on television."

"We're not talking about filming trials, we're talking about allowing cameras into the court to record legal argument," said Louise Botham, president of the Ontario Criminal Lawyer's Association.

Proceedings at the Supreme Court of Canada are broadcast on the &lt;a href="w%3ACPAC"&gt;Canadian Parliamentary Affairs Channel&lt;/a&gt; (CPAC) and provinces such as British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Manitoba, with prior permission of the court. In Newfoundland, cameras are allowed into a courtroom up to the time the judge enters.

A fire broke out at the &lt;a href="w%3ATrinity%20Cathedral%2C%20St.%20Petersburg"&gt;Trinity Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Petersburg"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, causing the main dome and another dome to collapse, early in the evening of August 25.

Firefighters fought the blaze, and a helicopter was pressed into service. Staff, emergency service workers and passers by rescued treasured items from the cathedral.

Four hours later, St. Petersburg emergency department spokeswoman Lyudmila Rubasova said the fires were contained but the remaining domes were damaged. Later a departmental spokesmen said that the fire was extinguished. 

"The main dome has been destroyed but we could not stop the fire because it was so high and now other domes are in flames," said a spokesman for Russia's emergencies ministry.

The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but acting St. Petersburg emergency department chief Leonid Belyayev said the blaze seems to have started on scaffolding on the outside of the church, which was undergoing restoration.

He also said that the most valuable icons and other items had been saved, and that structural damage beneath the roof area was minor.

There are no reported injuries.

American freesolo rock climber &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Bachar"&gt;John Bachar&lt;/a&gt; was injured in a car crash in Nevada, in which a co-passenger was killed. 

At approxiamately 7:25 p.m. on Sunday, August 13, Forty-nine year-old Bachar of &lt;a href="w%3AMammoth%20Lakes%2C%20California"&gt;Mammoth Lakes, California&lt;/a&gt;, 49, was driving southbound on U.S. Route 93, about 33 miles north of &lt;a href="w%3AEly%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Ely, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, when he allowed his &lt;a href="w%3AToyota%204Runner"&gt;Toyota 4Runner&lt;/a&gt; to drift off the west edge of the road and struck a mile-marker post. Bachar overcorrected to the left, causing the Toyota to rotate counterclockwise and travel across both lanes to the east side of the road.

The vehicle began to rollover towards its right side at this point, and a passenger was ejected. Steve Karafa of El Sobrante, California, 40, who had been sleeping in the back seat when the accident occurred, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. Bachar suffered numerous injuries in the crash, including four fractured vertibrae, and was transported to the William B. Ririe Hospital in Ely. A third passenger, Anastasia Frangos of &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Paula%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Paula, California&lt;/a&gt;, 33, was not seriously injured.

The trio was travelling home from the Outdoor Retailer Trade Show in &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/a&gt;, where they had been represententing Acopa International LLC. Nevada Highway Patrol trooper Rocky Gonzalez said driver inattention and speed contributed to this accident, as well as two other crashes in the nearby area over the same weekend.

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Cricket%20Council"&gt;International Cricket Council&lt;/a&gt; announced on Friday that controversial Australian umpire &lt;a href="w%3ADarrell%20Hair"&gt;Darrell Hair&lt;/a&gt; has offered to resign from the ICC Elite Umpires Panel with effect from 31st August if he is paid a sum U.S $500,000 to do so. Hair is currently involved in a dispute with the &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20cricket%20team"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; side after he penalised them for ball-tampering during their &lt;a href="w%3ACricket"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Oval"&gt;Oval&lt;/a&gt;. The Pakistan team subsequently refused to come out of the pavilion, resulting in their forfeiting the match to the home side. The issue soon snowballed and both the Pakistani captain &lt;a href="w%3AInzamam-ul-Haq"&gt;Inzamam-ul-Haq&lt;/a&gt; and Hair came under criticism, the former for bringing the sport into disrepute and the umpire for his alleged bias against players from the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Subcontinent"&gt;Subcontinent&lt;/a&gt;.

The ICC's chief executive &lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Speed"&gt;Malcolm Speed&lt;/a&gt; told a press conference that copies of Hair's letter had been forwarded to both Doug Cowie (the Council's umpire manager) and the &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20Cricket%20Board"&gt;Pakistan Cricket Board&lt;/a&gt;. The umpire asks, in his letter, for "a one-off payment to compensate for the loss of future earnings and retainer payments over the next four years, which I believe would have been the best years I have to offer ICC and world umpiring." Speed, however, said that neither he nor David Richardson (the ICC's General Manager) believed that the episode was motivated by any "dishonest, underhand or malicious intent." on Darrell's part. He also expressed surprise at the contents of the letter and that he felt the issue had been "marked by a series of unfortunate and entirely avoidable overreactions.".

<h1>Four year-old boy battered with a brick in East Yorkshire</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Four%20year-old%20boy%20battered%20with%20a%20brick%20in%20East%20Yorkshire&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In what &lt;a href="w%3AHumberside"&gt;Humberside&lt;/a&gt; Police are describing as a "nasty" attack, a four year-old boy was left with a fractured skull after being battered with a brick. The incident happened on wasteland close to the child's home in &lt;a href="w%3AHessle"&gt;Hessle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire"&gt;East Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;. 

Charlie Davis was discovered by a couple on Thursday. He was in a puddle of blood and part of his ear was hanging off; doctors at Hull Royal Infirmary later performed surgery to repair it. He is still in hospital, and doctors say that his brain is not injured, despite having a fractured skull. 

A spokeswoman from Humberside Police said: "This little boy has suffered a nasty attack and has some horrible injuries." 

Police think Charlie, who was playing with a friend, was molested by a male youth. His injuries suggest that he dragged the child across the ground, kicked him in the face, tied him to a tree and struck him with a brick. 

The police spokeswoman added that police are pursuing several lines of inquiry. "There has been information suggesting possible suspects and these form one of the lines of inquiry being pursued." 

The assault is thought to have happened before lunchtime on Thursday next to Station Road which is near the Hull to Hessle railway line. "It is currently unclear how the child got to the area. He may have gone of his own accord, he might have been chased there or he may have been taken by someone against his will," said the police spokeswoman. 

Charlie, who was meant to be going on holiday with his family today, is too disturbed to talk to detectives about the incident. The spokeswoman said: "We do understand that the victim was struck with a brick which has resulted in his injuries. But, clearly, until police can get an account from the four-year-old victim it is not possible to confirm any more details of the incident."

<h1>Iran inaugurates heavy-water production plant</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iran%20inaugurates%20heavy-water%20production%20plant&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian president &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; inaugurated a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aheavy%20water"&gt;heavy-water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; production plant in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArak%2C%20Iran"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Iran on Saturday, according to reports on Iranian television. The plant is part of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20program%20of%20Iran"&gt;nuclear program of Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which the Iranian government says is for peaceful purposes only in the face of accusations by western governments that the country is trying to develop &lt;a href="nuclear%20weapon"&gt;nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt;s.

The Arak facility, located 150 miles south of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATeheran"&gt;Teheran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is part of a larger project of building a heavy-water &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20reactor"&gt;reactor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the city. The Iranian president has said that it will be used for medical purposes only, and has said that students, scientists, and journalists will be allowed to tour the plant. Construction on the production plant began in 1996. Iran provoked international controversy in April 2006 when it announced an earlier nuclear success: the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium%20enrichment"&gt;enrichment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of a small amount of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to reactor-grade levels (3.5% of the isotope &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium-235"&gt;uranium-235&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; using &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agas%20centrifuge"&gt;gas centrifuge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; technology. Concern was raised by some that if Iran was able to scale up its enrichment facilities, they could be used to produce bomb-grade uranium (90% uranium-235).

Heavy water is the colloquial name for deuterium oxide, HO. To the unaided eye it appears identical to regular water, HO, but it contains &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adeuterium"&gt;deuterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a heavy isotope of hydrogen. Among its many uses, it is commonly used as a moderator in certain types of nuclear reactors. It is considered a &lt;a href="nuclear%20proliferation"&gt;nuclear proliferation&lt;/a&gt; risk because heavy-water production reactors can easily use natural uranium, and in the process transmute it into the element &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aplutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which can be reprocessed and used as the fissile core of a nuclear bomb. Heavy-water ♡❤production♡❤ reactors have been used for this purpose by India, Israel, Pakistan, North Korea, Russia and USA. There is no evidence that heavy-water ♡❤power♡❤ reactors, such as the Canadian-produced &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACANDU%20reactor"&gt;CANDU reactor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , have been used for military plutonium production, but in theory they can also be used for this purpose, as any uranium reactor will produce certain amounts of plutonium. 

Critics have charged that current Iranian research reactors do not require the amount of heavy water which the production facility will be able to create. Iran's other controversial reactor site at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABushehr"&gt;Bushehr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; does not require heavy water. Though many of Iran's nuclear facilities do have possible peaceful uses, most of them are considered &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adual-use%20technology"&gt;dual-use technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which could also be diverted into military purposes. 

In 2003, the still-developing production site was inspected by a delegation from the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;, the non-proliferation wing of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; in charge of enforcing the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , of which Iran is a signatory. At the time, Iran claimed the heavy water would be for exporting to other countries, and later clarified that it would be used for a heavy-water reactor in Arak. Iran has claimed that it would have purchased a heavy-water research reactor from abroad but it had been unable to do so, and so had to resort to an indigenous design and construction. Iran claims that the reactor will be used to produce &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aradioisotope"&gt;radioisotopes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which have many medical applications. IAEA inspectors questioned this on the basis that the reactor plans they had seen did not have adequate facilities for producing radioisotopes. Iran claimed that the plans were still developing and that the missing facilities, known as hot cells, could not yet be designed without knowing other characteristics of the reactor, and that they were building a separate facility with those capabilities at the same site.

Iran has insisted that under the terms of the 1968 treaty, it is guaranteed the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The IAEA has called upon Iran in the past to freeze production of the heavy-water reactor at Arak, but the Iranian government has refused and began construction on the 40MW reactor facility in 2004. It has been estimated that it will take five years to build, based on the previous experience of North Korea.

None of Iran's facilities currently have the ability to produce weapons-grade nuclear material, and most experts say it would be at least a decade for Iran to be able to build a functional nuclear weapon.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Springboks&lt;/a&gt; (South Africa) lost the fifth Test in a row, whilst the New Zealand &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; continued their streak of wins, in the first of the remaining three fixtures of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;2006 Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; played at &lt;a href="w%3ALoftus%20Versfeld"&gt;Loftus Versfeld&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APretoria"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday August 26. The final score was 45 to 26. It marked the first win in South Africa for the All Blacks, who have already clinched the series, since 2003.

&lt;a href="w%3ARichie%20McCaw"&gt;Richie McCaw&lt;/a&gt; knocked on the kick off from &lt;a href="w%3AButch%20James"&gt;Butch James&lt;/a&gt;, offside All Blacks then lead to an early penalty kick to &lt;a href="w%3APercy%20Montgomery"&gt;Percy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, giving South Africa a three-nil lead. James kicked another penalty two minutes later giving them a six to nil lead. &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carter%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Daniel Carter&lt;/a&gt; then gave the All Blacks their first points with a penalty kick of his own. &lt;a href="w%3AFourie%20du%20Preez"&gt;Fourie du Preez&lt;/a&gt; scored the first &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; of the match in the 10th minute for South Africa. Montgomery missed the conversion and South Africa lead 11 to three. After a period of no scoring, Carter kicked another penalty goal in the 18th minute to reduce the gap to 11 to six. &lt;a href="w%3ANeemia%20Tialata"&gt;Neemia Tialata&lt;/a&gt; scored the All Blacks first try off a Carter kick. Carter converted, and the All Blacks moved ahead to 13 to 11. On halftime the All Blacks are given a penalty, 60m away from the South African line. An ambitious Carter went for the kick, and was successful, and the All Blacks went into the break 16 to 11.

Carter got the first points of the second half with another penalty goal in the 43rd minute. &lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20McAlister"&gt;Luke McAlister&lt;/a&gt; extended the All Blacks lead a few minutes later with a try of his own, and with Carter's conversion, the All Blacks lead 26 to 11. A subsequent penalty goal to South Africa by Montgomery reduced this to 26 to 14. The All Blacks start to move further away with the game when &lt;a href="w%3ASitiveni%20Sivivatu"&gt;Sitiveni Sivivatu&lt;/a&gt; scored in the 55th minute, although Carter missed the conversion, the All Blacks moved to a 31 to 14 lead. A try to &lt;a href="w%3AMils%20Muliaina"&gt;Mils Muliaina&lt;/a&gt; and a subsequent Carter conversion made the score 38 to 14. South Africa started to make a comeback when &lt;a href="w%3AJaque%20Fourie"&gt;Jaque Fourie&lt;/a&gt; scored a try. &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Pretorius"&gt;André Pretorius&lt;/a&gt; missed the conversion, and the score was at 38 to 19 to the All Blacks. Fourie scored again in the 70th minute, and with the Pretorius conversion, the score read 38 to 26 with 10 minutes remaining in the match. However &lt;a href="w%3ARico%20Gear"&gt;Rico Gear&lt;/a&gt; sealed the victory in the 75th minute with a try. Carter converted and the All Blacks won 45 to 26.

After being held for more than four years at the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; detention facility, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; born &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; citizen &lt;a href="w%3AMurat%20Kurnaz"&gt;Murat Kurnaz&lt;/a&gt; was transferred to German custody by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; authorities on Thursday. An hour later, he was released.

Kurnaz was picked up in &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 when riding a bus. He was first transferred to a prison camp in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and then transferred to Guantanamo bay. He was designated an "&lt;a href="w%3Aenemy%20combatant"&gt;enemy combatant&lt;/a&gt;" even after German law enforcement and US intelligence officials concluded that there was no information tying him to al-Qaeda or other terrorist activities.

Kurnaz's lawyers have charged that Kurnaz was tortured while being held in Afghanistan and - to a lesser degree - while at Guantanamo Bay. Even on the flight back to Germany Kurnaz was shackled on hand and feet, tied to the ground and blindfolded.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Chito Peppler said that the conditions for the prisoner transfer of Kurnaz to Germany included guarantees that Kurnaz be treated humanely by German authorities and that Germany take steps to ensure Kurnaz would not pose any threat to the world.

A midnight deadline to release Muslim prisoners has passed and two ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ journalists have been released.

The two journalists, American &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Centanni"&gt;Steve Centanni&lt;/a&gt;, 60, a reporter for ♡❤Fox News♡❤ and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealander"&gt;New Zealander&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOlaf%20Wiig"&gt;Olaf Wiig&lt;/a&gt;, 36, Centanni's cameraman were kidnapped from their press vehicle on August 14. Ten days later, the two journalists appeared in a video allegedly made by the kidnappers. In it, the journalists said that they were being treated well.

According to Mr. Centanni, the pair were ordered to convert to Islam at gunpoint. He told Fox News: "I have the highest respect for Islam... but it was something we felt we had to do because they had the guns and we didn't know what the hell was going on."
In a press conference earlier today, the two told of their joy at being released. They also urged journalists not to be deterred from reporting in Gaza. "I hope that this never scares a single journalist away from coming to Gaza to cover the story because the Palestinian people are very beautiful and kind-hearted," Mr. Centanni said. "The world needs to know more about them. Don't be discouraged," he added. 

Holy Jihad Brigades, a previously unknown group, claims responsibility for the kidnappings. They were demanding the release of all Muslim prisoners being held in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange they promised they would release the journalists, but the United States immediately rejected the offer. "I want to clarify that the efforts are not negotiations, but we want to get to positive results which is their release and that is all. We will continue our efforts and contacts to secure the release of the kidnapped journalists. We can confirm that they are safe and sound but we cannot give fuller details for the time being because we want our efforts to be crowned with success," said Abu Hilal, spokesman for the Interior Ministry.

Yesterday, Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas government spokesmen said: "I hope that we can hear good news within the coming two days."
&lt;a href="w%3AAnita%20McNaught"&gt;Anita McNaught&lt;/a&gt;, the wife of Wiig, recently appeared on TV calling for the release of the journalists.

The two journalists were dropped off at Gaza City's Beach Hotel, several hours after a video showed them delivering an anti-Western speech.

<h1>The Green Party of Canada to elect new leader</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=The%20Green%20Party%20of%20Canada%20to%20elect%20new%20leader&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; will elect a new leader today. The new leader will replace &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Harris%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jim Harris&lt;/a&gt;, who stepped down after holding the position since 2003.

The candidates are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20May%20%28environmentalist%29"&gt;Elizabeth May&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href="w%3ASierra%20Club"&gt;Sierra Club&lt;/a&gt; executive director &lt;br&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Chernushenko"&gt;David Chernushenko&lt;/a&gt;, the party's deputy leader&lt;br&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Fannon"&gt;Jim Fannon&lt;/a&gt;, a real estate agent from &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Catharines%2C%20Ontario"&gt;St. Catharines, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; who is a four-time Green candidate, and founder of Nature's Hemp food company.

</ul>
May and Chernushenko, have emerged as frontrunners of the leadership race.

"We draw pretty much equally from across the entire political spectrum," Jim Harris told CBC News. "If you were a Progressive Conservative, as I was, where do you go? The Green party supports Kyoto. We were opposed to the war in Iraq and yet at the same time we're fiscally responsible. This is something that's attractive to people."

The Green party didn't get any member elected in the January 23 general election, but the party did get about 4.5 per cent of the vote, enough to secure $1 million a year in federal funding.
Chernushenko, an environmental consultant in Ottawa, got the most votes of any Green candidate.

Most Green party members have already cast their ballots by mail for the next leader.

<h3>The candidates</h3>

May says that "her national profile and background as an adviser to the environment minister during Conservative &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Mulroney"&gt;Brian Mulroney&lt;/a&gt;'s government are important for getting more Canadians interested in the party". May referred to tackling climate change, urging electoral reform and ending Canada's military mission in Afghanistan.

"I don't really understand yet what she stands for. It's a lot of rhetoric," &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Globe%20and%20Mail"&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt; columnist Jane Taber told &lt;a href="w%3ACTV%20Newsnet"&gt;CTV Newsnet&lt;/a&gt;.

"We will elect MPs by continuing to gain the trust and confidence of Canadians, and by reaching out to Canadians outside of our traditional base of support," said Chernushenko. Chernushenko said the party should parachute star candidates into key ridings.

"Chernushenko sees a need for government regulation but wants to involve the private sector a bit more, and that's consistent with Jim Harris's ideas," said Jonathan Malloy, political science professor at Ottawa's &lt;a href="w%3ACarleton%20University"&gt;Carleton University&lt;/a&gt;.

Jim Fannon, who spoke casually to the audience about his talents as a mediator, capable of bridging political gaps between the Greens, Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats. Chernushenko says though he may not always be able to "wow" a crowd, he remains a strong communicator and team player. "I can't do the rah-rah motivational thing, like Jim (Harris) did an incredible job at, but I can go very deep on complex issues and explain them in plain language," he said Friday.

Josh Matlow of Earth Roots said: "Elizabeth May is someone I would want to lock myself to a tree with; David Chernushenko is someone I would want to discuss policy with; and Jim Fannon is someone I would go for a beer with".

Political analysts consider May, a veteran envirnomental activist but also a newcomer to the party, to be the strong favourite to win the race against party stalwart Chernushenko.

Fighting between the Pakistan army and &lt;a href="w%3ABalochistan%20%28Pakistan%29"&gt;Balochi&lt;/a&gt; rebels resulted in heavy casualties and the a Baloch leader, &lt;a href="w%3ANawab%20Akbar%20Bugti"&gt;Nawab Akbar Bugti&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of the Bugti tribe has been killed near the town of Dera Bugti, according to Pakistan government sources.

37 Baloch tribals and 21 security personnel have been reported to be killed in the fighting. 

Upon receiving news of his death, students at the Balochistan University rioted and police fired warning shots to disperse them. Leaders from the opposition parties, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Pakistan People's Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMuttahida%20Majlis-e-Amal"&gt;Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal&lt;/a&gt; have expressed shock and grief at the death and reiterated their opposition to the use of force in resolving the Balochistan conflict.

A former Governor and Chief Minister of Balochistan, Nawab Bugti has led a campaign to win more autonomy for the Balochistan region, a mineral rich area and the main supplier of natural gas in the country. Baloch nationalists have accused the Pakistan government of exploiting the regions resources without contributing to the area's development.

The recent fighting began after separatist rebels attacked natural gas facilities in the area.

A &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; (BA) flight from &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ADenver"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; made an emergency landing at an airport in &lt;a href="w%3AIceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; today after smoke was seen emerging from an oven in the aircraft's rear kitchen. 

A BA spokesman said that the Boeing 777 landed safely at &lt;a href="w%3AKeflavik%20International%20Airport"&gt;Keflavik Airport&lt;/a&gt;. He added that the plane’s 268 passengers left the craft unharmed. 

A spokeswoman from the Iceland Civil Aviation Administration ruled out any terrorist involvement. She added: "They were 50 miles from Keflavik when it was thought there was a fire. But it turned out to be only smoke."

The flight should complete its journey to the US tomorrow. Passengers are spending the night in a hotel.

In the second of what was termed a "regrettable incident" this week, an &lt;a href="w%3AAfghan%20National%20Police"&gt;Afghan National Police&lt;/a&gt; officer was shot and killed by &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; soldiers. Canadian troops opened fire on an Afgan National Police vehicle that was approaching a military installation west of &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;. Armed personnel on board the vehicle returned fire, resulting in a shootout between the Canadians and the Afgan police. The occupants of the vehicle are now believed to be members of Afganistan's secret police force, the Amaniyat. Members of Amaniyat do have uniforms, but rarely wear them and rarely travel in marked vehicles.

"It is believed that the persons in the vehicle opened fire in response to warning shots fired by the Canadians," said Col. Fred Lewis, commander of the Canadian forces in Afganistan. "It was at this time [that] Canadian soldiers returned fire on the vehicle and its six occupants." The six were taken to the multinational military hospital at Kandahar airfield and are undergoing treatment. They are currently listed in serious but stable condition.

40 minutes later, a second incident occurred reminiscent of a shooting earlier this week in which a 10 year old boy was killed. Two motorcyclists were injured when they approached the same artillery installation at allegedly high speed. Canadian troops opened fire on the motorcycle riders after they allegedly failed to heed warning shots. "Efforts to slow or divert the scooter failed and troops subsequently fired shots in self-defence. One man was injured by a shot while the other wounded when the scooter ran off the road," stated a press release from NATO. The motorcyclists were later identified as also being members of the Afghan police.

"It would appear that Canadian soldiers reacted in self-defence in both incidents, one of which was regrettably a friendly force on friendly force engagement," Lewis said.

NATO apologized for the incidents, describing both shootings as self-defence reactions to volatile circumstances. Canada's military investigative body, the NIS and the Afghan police will investigate the shootings.

An eleven year-old boy has been arrested this morning on suspicion of attacking a four year-old boy in &lt;a href="w%3AHessle"&gt;Hessle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Yorkshire%20%28district%29"&gt;East Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;. The boy was arrested on suspicion of assault and has been bailed to mid-September pending further inquiries.

Charlie Davis was left with a fractured skull after being battered with a brick. The incident happened on wasteland close to the child’s home before lunchtime on Thursday, and he was discovered by a couple who were out walking. He was in a puddle of blood and part of his ear was hanging off; doctors at Hull Royal Infirmary later performed surgery to repair it. 

Yesterday, a spokeswoman from Humberside Police said: “This little boy has suffered a nasty attack and has some horrible injuries.” 

Police say they haven’t been able to talk to Charlie about the attack, and they say that they are keeping an “open mind” about the attack. A police spokeswoman added: “Police hope to be able to take a statement and get a full account of the incident from the four-year-old victim some time today, so long as he's able to speak to us.”

According to reports, the little boy was tied to a tree before being battered, but police said there was no evidence to verify such information.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; soldier has been killed in southern &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) says.

A spokeswoman from the MoD said: "It is with deep regret that the MoD can confirm the death of a British soldier during a contact with enemy insurgents in northern Helmand, Afghanistan, at approximately 0500 local time. The soldier was shot and killed during an attack in northern Helmand. Next of kin are being informed and no further details will be released until that process is completed."

Eight British soldiers have died in Afghanistan this month. In total, twenty-one have died since military operations started in November 2001.

The President of &lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIdriss%20D%C3%A9by"&gt;Idriss Déby&lt;/a&gt; has ordered the US oil company &lt;a href="w%3AChevronTexaco"&gt;ChevronTexaco&lt;/a&gt; and the Malaysian &lt;a href="w%3APetronas"&gt;Petronas&lt;/a&gt; to leave the country in 24 hours for non-payment of taxes. ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ quotes a government official saying that three ministers, including the Oil minister who was involved in negotiations with the consortium have been suspended. 

Spokesmen for both the companies said that they have not received any official intimation of the expulsion orders, and a Chevron spokesperson said that the company was fully compliant with its tax obligations. 

The two companies account for 60% of the 160-170 thousand barrels of oil currently produced per day in Chad. Déby announced that the government has asked the companies earlier this month to honour their corporate tax obligations, but the companies had not responded. The ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ reports that the government has asked the company to pay $450 million in taxes owed.

"From tomorrow, representatives of Chevron and Petronas must leave Chad and close their offices for not respecting their commitment in accordance with clauses relating to the payment of taxes on the companies," said Deby on Saturday.

ChevronTexaco, Petronas and &lt;a href="w%3AExxonMobil"&gt;ExxonMobil&lt;/a&gt; formed a consortium in 1988 to exploit oilfields in the Saharan region. On Wednesday, Déby had asked his government to renegotiate the 1988 contract signed with the consortium, under which Chad would get 12.5% of the wellhead-value of the oil produced, minus transportation costs and a "quality discount". Déby has also said that three ministers involved in making the deal would be removed and will appear before courts. 

Déby said that after 3 years of production, the consortium had earned a $5 billion return on a $3 billion investment, while the government of Chad has received $588-million as oil revenues. 

A source in the oil ministry said that the state owned Chad Hydrocarbons Company would be brought into the consortium. There is also speculation in the media that Chinese oil companies may enter the field, with Chad recently resuming diplomatic ties with China. 

Chad was involved in a dispute over oil revenues earlier in the year. Last December, the Chad government relaxed laws it had earlier passed, which mandated that 80% of oil revenues must be spent on developmental works. The spending restrictions were demanded by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; when it helped finance an oil pipeline linking oil fields in Chad to Atlantic ports. The World Bank responded to the change in laws by withholding payment of revenues. In June, an agreement was reached to spend 70% on developmental works. 

The restrictions were meant to combat corruption and mismanagement in government spending - Chad was labeled the world's most corrupt state by a &lt;a href="w%3ATransparency%20International"&gt;Transparency International&lt;/a&gt; survey last year.

Brazilian driver &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;, driving for &lt;a href="w%3AFerrara"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;, won the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Turkish%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Turkish Grand prix&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul%20Park"&gt;Istanbul Park&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, marking his first &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Prix"&gt;Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; victory. &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; placed second and third respectively in a close finish. 

Massa began at pole position and capitalised on an incident right at the start, when &lt;a href="w%3ARenault"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;'s Alonso braked hard, causing team mate &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt; to lose control as he attempted to avoid contact. The incident disrupted much of the initial grid behind them, with multiple contacts involving Nick Heidfeld, Pedro de la Rosa, Ralf Schumacher, Scott Speed, Kimi Raikkonen, Takuma Sato, Tiago Monteiro and Jarno Trulli, forcing many of them to take a pit stop at the end of the lap.

Massa's &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; teammate Michael Schumacher lost the second position to Alonso while the German was awaiting Massa on the pit-lane. On the dying laps of the race Schumacher pushed hard on Alonso until the finish line. They finished together, with the official timing unable to split them, and Alonso won by protecting his line into the final corner.

&lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Button"&gt;Jenson Button&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda's&lt;/a&gt; drivers, finished fourth. 

Once again &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20Raikkonen"&gt;Kimi Raikkonen&lt;/a&gt; failed to finish, quitting the race not long after after the start incident and &lt;a href="w%3AMcLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; teammate &lt;a href="w%3APedro%20De%20La%20Rosa"&gt;Pedro De La Rosa&lt;/a&gt; replaced him in his position.

&lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ABMW"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ASauber"&gt;Sauber&lt;/a&gt; team driver finished last.

A military compound in Southern Afghanistan came under insurgent fire today killing a British soldier and injuring seven others. In response to the attack 10 militants were killed. It is reported that 40 gunmen stormed the Musa Qala district, ensuing a three-hour gunfight between the rebels and the ISAF (&lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;). Reports that civilians had been killed prompted Afghan President Hamid Karzai to launch an inquiry into the deaths. British ISAF soldiers took over operations at Musa Quala from a Danish contingent that was attacked almost daily during their tenure.

Brigadier Ed Butler, Commander of the British forces in Afghanistan - "The current tempo of operations in northern Helmand, including those in Musa Qaleh, is demanding, but manageable. We are making good progress in helping to bring security to areas that have had little by way of law and order for over 30 years, most recently with the establishment of a large number of Afghan police in the heart of the town. The Taliban are a determined enemy, and the challenge of bringing security to Musa Qaleh is a continuing one. But we are well on track to succeed."

In Western Afghanistan two police officers were killed and two others injured when insurgents opened fire. Details of the incidents are still emerging. Separate reports indicate they police officers may have been killed by a roadside bomb.

Kabul, which has been spared much of the violence also came under attack today. Four missiles fell in the western part of Kabul in the vicinity of a district police station. No fatalities or injuries were reported.

NATO forces have faced increasing violence in Afghanistan's northeastern and southern districts as of late, increasing tensions between the residents and NATO personnel who's primary mission is nation building, the destruction of herion growth operations and to curb terrorist activities in the region.

The official charges include espionage, passing information illegally, writing "false news" and entering the country without a .

The charges come three weeks after he, along with his driver and interpreter, were arrested on August 6th by pro-government forces in . His driver and interpreter, both Chadian nationals, are both accused of espionage as well. At the moment, he has been granted a defense motion for a continuance, delaying the start of the trial until September 10th. Until then both the editors of the ♡❤Chicago Tribune♡❤ and ♡❤National Geographic♡❤ are working through diplomatic channels to ensure his release back to the United States. 

♡❤National Geographic♡❤ Magazine Editor in Chief Chris Johns was quoted as saying, "Paul Salopek was on assignment for ♡❤National Geographic♡❤ magazine to write a comprehensive feature article on the swath of sub-Saharan Africa known as the Sahel.

As Tropical Storm Ernesto moves toward the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; coast, the weather system has been downgraded to a Tropical Storm, but forecasters warn the storm could re-strengthen into a category 2 or possibly category 3 hurricane by Thursday.

Information on the storm's location and direction can also be found on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANOAA"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's National Hurricane Center web page and on NIST Shortwave Radio Station WWV on 2.500, 5.000, 10.000, 15.000, and 20.000 MHz at 8, 9, and 10 minutes past the hour. Propagation for evening reception is usually best on 10 and 15 MHz. The ARRL have announced that the WX4NHC Amateur Radio Hurricane net will convene at 13:00 UTC on 14.325 MHz (SSB) on Monday, 28 August. HWN Assistant Net Manager Bobby Graves (KB5HAV) has announced that a Bilingual Support Team will be present to assist with Spanish language translation. "Ernesto could become a potentially dangerous hurricane as it moves across the northwestern &lt;a href="Caribbean"&gt;Caribbean Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;," Julio Ripoll (WD4R) said, citing NHC forecaster Jack Bevin. Ripoll said the "Cone of Uncertainty" still includes most of South &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and the Florida Keys. WX4NHC will be used for providing observed and measured weather data to the NHC for assistance in forecasting

SATERN will be active on 14.235 MHz (SSB) to handle health &amp; welfare calls.

The Government of &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; has issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Las Tunas, Granma, Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo.

The State of Florida has ordered a tourist evacuation of the Florida Keys and declared a State of Emergency in preparation for the Tropical Storm's landfall, which is expected in the next 24 hours. 

The Department of Homeland security has warned that New Orleans could endure storm damage. One year ago Tuesday, Hurricane Katrina caused widespread devastation to New Orleans after dykes designed to hold back the Gulf of Mexico failed, flooding the city and leaving thousands stranded for days without access to food, water or shelter. The subsequent evacuation and cleanup left a considerable dent in the US economy.

Economic forecasters say that the storm could cause a sharp rise in electronic trading overnight. The possibility of landfall in the Gulf of Mexico caused natural gas commodity prices to rise by 6% on Friday. The Gulf of Mexico is also a key production center for crude oil. After the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, refined oil production dropped by 22%, causing a surge in the price of gasoline at the pumps. In &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; pump prices soared to $1.34/litre. Simliar increases were seen across the US in Katrina's wake, reaching $1.15 US/gallon.

John Kerr is the editor of Global Resources Trader, a newsletter of MarketWatch.

The storm is "certainly one of the big drivers behind oil and gas right now, but there are so many uncertainties ... from &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; deal, to &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; threatening to attack &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and new violence in &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;," said Kerr, in comments ahead of the weather system's upgrade. "On top of all that, the &lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; announcement that everything is not so hunky-dory in &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; is rallying prices too," he said (quote from marketwatch.com)

A &lt;a href="w%3AComair"&gt;Comair&lt;/a&gt; commuter jet crashed on takeoff from &lt;a href="w%3ALexington%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Lexington, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, killing 49 people on board and seriously injuring the plane's first officer, James M. Polehinke.

The early-morning &lt;a href="w%3AComair%20Flight%205191"&gt;Flight 5191&lt;/a&gt; was operating as &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20Connection"&gt;Delta Connection&lt;/a&gt; and was headed from Lexington's &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Grass%20Airport"&gt;Blue Grass Airport&lt;/a&gt; to Atlanta's &lt;a href="w%3AHartsfield-Jackson%20Atlanta%20International%20Airport"&gt;Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. It crashed about a mile west of the airport at 6:07 a.m. Eastern Time. The plane was a &lt;a href="w%3ACanadair%20Regional%20Jet%23CRJ-100"&gt;Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-100&lt;/a&gt;.

Polehinke was taken to the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Kentucky"&gt;University of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;'s Chandler Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt;, the aircraft departed from a shorter runway than it was cleared to take off from.

According to Gary Ginn, the &lt;a href="w%3AFayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Fayette County&lt;/a&gt; coroner, there was a significant fire on board the aircraft after impact, after which it continued to move forward several hundred yards before coming to a stop. The aircraft, however, is largely intact, Ginn said, and most of the passengers remained inside the cabin. Ginn said he expects the cause of death to be fire for the majority of the victims. The tail number has been confirmed as N431CA.

Based on information recovered from the flight's &lt;a href="w%3Aflight%20data%20recorder"&gt;data recorder&lt;/a&gt; and physical evidence on the scene, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; is focusing on the theory that the pilot attempted to take off from a 3,500-foot or 1067-meter runway that is not certified for airline traffic. That runway is only for &lt;a href="w%3Ageneral%20aviation"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt; aircraft.

Investigators believe the plane did not get enough speed to lift off the ground before running out of runway. &lt;a href="w%3Aair%20traffic%20control"&gt;Air traffic controllers&lt;/a&gt; in the tower had cleared the flight for takeoff from an adjacent 7,000-foot or 2135-meter runway used for commercial airlines.

Local police and fire fighters responded to the scene within minutes, and it has been reported that two off-duty police officers helped pull Polehinke from the cockpit of the burning jet.

Laura Brown, a spokeswoman for the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; told CNN that there is no indication that terrorism was involved in connection with the crash.

Family members and friends who suspected that their loved ones may have been on Flight 5191 began arriving at Blue Grass Airport shortly after the crash. They have been taken to a local hotel, where staff from Comair as well as airport officials are caring for them and providing them with information. Comair has also set up a hotline where family and friends can receive information: the number is 1-800-801-0088.

Among the dead were Jon Hooker and Scarlett Parsley, who had married just the night before and were off to their honeymoon.

A moment of silence was held for the crash victims before the Los Angeles Dodgers-Arizona Diamondbacks baseball game in Phoenix, where Brandon Webb, a former University of Kentucky baseball teammate of Hooker, is a pitcher. Another passenger, Charles Lykins of Naples, Fla., wanted an early flight so he could get home to his two young children after visiting friends and family in the Lexington area, said Paul Richardson of Winchester. Mike Finley, 52, who lived in Corbin and owned the Finley Fun Centers, was headed to Reno, Nev., for a rollerskating convention, said his son, David Taylor. "I'd say there's thousands of kids who grew up with our father," he said.

Rick Queen, who works for Turfway Realty in Lexington, said his father-in-law, Les Morris, was on the flight. Queen and Taylor were both frustrated with how Comair handled the families. "I just felt Delta ran families around this morning for three hours. I finally got some help from a Lexington firefighter," Taylor said.

Flight attendant Kelly Heyer was single and lived in the Cincinnati area. He had been working for the airline since &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; and was recently appointed base representative for the flight attendant union said Tracy Riley, a union secretary and fellow Comair flight attendant. "He was a standup individual," Riley said. "He was very professional, loved the job."

Bornhorst described his own reaction as "complete devastation" and he lamented the frustration of the families as they awaited word. "When tragedies like this happen, information can just not be relayed fast enough and I certainly understand the frustrations related to that," Bornhorst said.

The upcoming Sony &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%203"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; game console is going to assist scientists in finding cures for &lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href="w%3AFolding%40home"&gt;Folding@home&lt;/a&gt; distributed computing program.

Folding@home is run by the Pande group of (America) to research protein folding, this is the process whereby &lt;a href="w%3Aproteins"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt; build themselves inside the cells in the body. Analyisis of how proteins fold (specifically how the folding goes wrong) can give insights into how diseases form. The simulation processes used in the research take months just for a single protein so the data is split into small packets (called workunits by the community) and distributed to volunteers around the world. By downloading a program called a 'client' users can receive units and perform the simulations on them - results are then sent back to the Stanford servers.

Currently more than 150,000 computers run the folding 'client' worldwide. The new client can be downloaded to the users PlayStation 3 console and will then begin to calculate "work units" when users are not playing games. Since the PS3 has a 'Cell' processor with a total of 8 cores the calculations should be performed faster than on a PC. With this new program scientists aim to create a &lt;a href="w%3Asuper%20computer"&gt;super computer&lt;/a&gt; faster than &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;'s BlueGene/L System (which currently calculates more than 280.6 trillion bits of information per second). The new calculations are expected to process a thousand trillion bits of information across the whole project every second.

A statement on Folding@home's website explained further: "Using the Cell processor of the PS3, we should be able to do more folding than what one could do on a PC. Also, since the PS3 has a powerful GPU, the PS3 client will offer real time visualization for the first time."

The new program is part of an expansion of the project and the first of 2 new clients that have been developed. The second, scheduled for release later on, will utilise a computer's graphics card (supporting only &lt;a href="w%3AATI"&gt;ATI&lt;/a&gt; graphics cards at first) to perform folding calcualtions.

"We will release more details on all of this as the new software rolls out," said the statement, "We are beta testing the ATI GPU client software internally at the moment and will likely announce an open beta in four to five weeks (end of September)."

The Pande group noted their ultimate aim as being to create an even faster super computer, with the ability to process over a million trillion bits of data every second: "The PS3 client and GPU client are together part of our new broader goals to push Folding@Home to the next stage, reaching calculations on the petaflop to 10 petaflop scale."

The PS3 client is expected to be available at the end of September.

<h1>Multiple bombs set off in Turkish resort</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Multiple%20bombs%20set%20off%20in%20Turkish%20resort&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; resort of &lt;a href="w%3AMarmaris"&gt;Marmaris&lt;/a&gt; was hit by at least 3 bombs and one bomb went off in Istanbul's Bagcilar district on Sunday injuring at least 27 people. The blasts come two days after four people were injured in a separate bombing in Adana.

"We heard one of the bombs and it sounded just like a gunshot. The bus had exploded outside a McDonald’s restaurant. We saw its remains: it had been ripped apart," said one witness, Danielle Pearson.

The second explosion happened 45 minutes later, in a residential district near the harbour.

"Ambulances and police cars were going everywhere. The streets were really busy with people running everywhere. Before the explosions people were being typical holidaymakers and just enjoying themselves," added Pearson. Of the injured, 10 are Britons, all of whom are in hospital, four of whom are in serious condition.

A fifth bombing has been reported in the European section of Istanbul. Six people are reported to have been injured, none seriously. The bomb was reportedly in a package left near a school.

Reports from southern Turkey at 17:16 say that yet another round of bombings have killed three people and injured a score of others.

There is no official word on who is responsible for the blasts, but responsibility has been claimed by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Other militant groups are warning tourists not to visit Turkey. "We had warned before, Turkey is not a safe country. Tourists should not come to Turkey" - website of the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (Tak)

Tourism is a mainstay of the Turkish economy, bringing millions of dollars of foreign money to the country. Deterring tourism constitutes a serious threat to jobs for thousands of Turks.

Bureaucrats from the British Foreign and Commonwealth office have not advised tourists to leave, but continue to follow events as they unfold - "Ten British nationals have been injured and are in hospital," quoted a spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office, "We have consular staff on the ground." 

The Foreign Office has set up a telephone hotline for concerned relatives on 020 7008 0000.

A 24-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; man is set to be the first person &lt;a href="w%3Aexecution"&gt;executed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Dakota"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; in 59 years after asking to fire his lawyer and drop further court appeals.

Elijah Page of &lt;a href="w%3AAthens%2C%20Texas"&gt;Athens, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, may die by &lt;a href="w%3ALethal%20injection"&gt;lethal injection&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow for the brutal murder of Chester Poage, 19, in Higgins Gulch, in the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Hills"&gt;Black Hills&lt;/a&gt; region of South Dakota.

The court will weigh whether or not Page is competent to fire his lawyers and drop appeals, and a decision is expected today.

Page, along with Briley Piper, 25, of &lt;a href="w%3AAnchorage%2C%20Alaska"&gt;Anchorage, Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, pleaded guilty in 2001 for the March 13, 2000, killing. Both were sentenced to death. A third man, Darrell Hoadley, 26, of &lt;a href="w%3ALead%2C%20South%20Dakota"&gt;Lead, S.D.&lt;/a&gt;, also pleaded guilty and testified against Page and Piper. He was sentenced to &lt;a href="w%3ALife%20imprisonment"&gt;life in prison&lt;/a&gt;.

Hoadley told prosecutors the men planned to steal a stereo, TV, and other items from Poage's mother's house. Prosecutors said Piper and Page killed Poage because they wanted to eliminate a witness to the theft.

Hoadley described brutal details to authorities how Piper stabbed Poage three times in the head and neck and Page then kicked Poage 30 to 40 times and then tore Poage's ears off. Page then bashed Poage's head in with large rocks. Hoadley finished the job by striking Poage with two large rocks.

Piper and Page then threatened to kill Hoadley if he told police about the crime, Hoadley told authorities.

Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said it is rare for someone to receive a death sentence after they've pleaded guilty to the crime. But in this case, the judge, Warren Johnson of Deadwood, opted for the death penalty, saying he considered the crime to be "vile and depraved".

&lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20May%20%28environmentalist%29"&gt;Elizabeth May&lt;/a&gt; has been elected leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; today, winning the position with 2,145 votes or 65.34 per cent of ballot cast. She beat her nearest rival, environmental consultant and Green deputy leader &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Chernushenko"&gt;David Chernushenko&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of almost 2 to 1. &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Fannon"&gt;Jim Fannon&lt;/a&gt;, the third candidate, finished far back with only 29 votes. The new leader will replace &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Harris%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jim Harris&lt;/a&gt;, who stepped down after holding the position since 2003.

In her acceptance speech, May called on the federal government to give notice that Canada will withdraw from the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement"&gt;North American Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; in order to force the United States to renegotiate the treaty. 

May, a long-time environmental activist and former executive director of the &lt;a href="w%3ASierra%20Club"&gt;Sierra Club of Canada&lt;/a&gt; takes over the party which received 4.5 per cent of the popular vote in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20election%2C%202006"&gt;last federal election&lt;/a&gt;, enough to secure over $1 million a year in federal funding but not enough to elect any of its candidates to the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Canadian House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;. Chernushenko won the highest vote percentage of any Green candidate in the January election winning 10% of the vote in Ottawa Centre. 

"We draw pretty much equally from across the entire political spectrum," Jim Harris told CBC News. "If you were a Progressive Conservative, as I was, where do you go? The Green party supports Kyoto. We were opposed to the war in Iraq and yet at the same time we're fiscally responsible. This is something that's attractive to people."

"What we need to do is clearly build a method and a platform so that they are not voting for 'none of the above' but so that they are voting for 'all my dreams,' " said May after her victory.

The race has brought new people to the party with membership rising from 5,517 to 8,694 in recent months.

House Speaker &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Wilson"&gt;Margaret Wilson&lt;/a&gt; told New Zealand television station, &lt;a href="w%3ATV3%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;TV3&lt;/a&gt;, owned by &lt;a href="w%3ACanwest"&gt;Canwest&lt;/a&gt;, they are banned from recording &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Parliament"&gt;New Zealand Parliament&lt;/a&gt; for three days.

The ban comes after they showed footage of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20First"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt; Member of Parliament (MP) &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Mark"&gt;Ron Mark&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly pulling his middle finger at National MP &lt;a href="w%3ATau%20Henare"&gt;Tau Henare&lt;/a&gt; on August 1.

TV3's ban will come into force tomorrow.

The Parliament's media rules state that only the Speaker or an MP who is standing and speaking can be recorded. TV3 broke this rule as Mark was sitting during his gestures.

"The rules are arcane. We were only showing what would have been observed by members of the public if they had been sitting in the public gallery on that day," said the Director of News and Current Affairs for TV3, Mark Jennings. "Politicians behaving badly is a news story, and the public have a right to see what is really going on in the debating Chamber."

"We will accept our punishment and get on with our job, but it is time politicians took responsibility for their behaviour and stopped shooting the messenger," Jennings said.

"That argument was not accepted last year, and I do not accept it now", Ms Wilson says referring to a breach of the rules last year.

"In addition, this time TV3 repeated the shots in question even though it knew they were in breach of the rules. This was clearly a premeditated breach."

Widespread protests and violence were reported across parts of &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href="w%3ABaloch%20Alliance"&gt;Baloch Alliance&lt;/a&gt; declared a general strike following the killing of its leader, &lt;a href="w%3ANawab%20Akbar%20Khan%20Bugti"&gt;Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti&lt;/a&gt;. 

Shops and establishments in &lt;a href="w%3AQuetta"&gt;Quetta&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABalochistan"&gt;Balochistan&lt;/a&gt; province, remained closed as angry mobs vandalised government vehicles and offices in retaliation for the separatist leader's slaying. The main Quetta-Karachi highway and Quetta-Punjab highway have remained closed to traffic since Monday. A curfew was imposed by the authorities in Quetta, leading to the closure of educational institutions there.

A high-alert also was sounded in the commercial capital of &lt;a href="Karachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;, where the opposition plans to hold a protest later today. Pakistan's Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azim Khan said that the Pakistani Army had not intentionally targeted Mr. Bugti and that he died when the cave he was in collapsed following a land-mine expolsion. President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, however, congratulated his army following the Balochi leader's death. 

Balochistan, which became a province of Pakistan following the &lt;a href="w%3APartition%20of%20India"&gt;Partition of India&lt;/a&gt;, has been waging a low-key struggle for autonomy for quite some time, but the rebels stepped up their attacks over the past year. Pakistan has, in the past, blamed Indian intelligence agencies such as the &lt;a href="w%3AResearch%20and%20Analysis%20Wing"&gt;Research and Analysis Wing&lt;/a&gt; for fuelling unrest in Balochistan.

<h1>Amnesty: &quot;looming human rights crisis&quot; in Darfur</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Amnesty%3A%20%26quot%3Blooming%20human%20rights%20crisis%26quot%3B%20in%20Darfur&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A "peacekeeping gap" is likely to plunge &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; back into major conflict in the &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region, according to &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;. The group today added its voice today to a growing disquiet over the worsening situation in that country, as expressed by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Rescue%20Committee"&gt;International Rescue Committee&lt;/a&gt;.

In a statement, the body’s Executive Deputy Secretary General Kate Gilmore, confirmed concerns that the Sudanese government are arming soldiers in preparation for conflict, despite signing a peace deal in May. 

"Eyewitnesses in el-Fasher in North Darfur are telling us that Sudanese government military flights are flying in troops and arms on a daily basis," Gilmore said, urging the international community to act. 

The &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; is discussing a draft resolution today to send 20,000 troops into western Sudan to protect the 2.5 million displaced people. But the Sudanese government has rejected calls for foreign intervention, instead suggesting a 26,000-strong domestic force, which Amnesty opposes.

"How can Sudan — which appears to be about to launch its own offensive in Darfur — realistically propose being a peacekeeper in a conflict to which it is a major party and perpetrator of grave human rights violations," Amnesty officials asked. 

<h2>Impending conflict</h2>

Evidence that Khartoum is arming in preparation for further fighting in Darfur is causing concern among governments about a future genocide. Yesterday the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer flew to the Sudanese capital to urge the government, led by &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt;, to accept the U.N. force. 

"Darfur is on the verge of a dangerous downward spiral," Frazer said, criticizing the U.N. for "foot dragging" on the issue.

The Sudanese government are wholly against the U.N. intervention. National Congress Party chairman Ghazi Salah Eldin Atabani told journalists "any state that sponsors this [U.N.] draft resolution will be regarded as assuming a hostile attitude against the Sudan."

If Darfur does descend into further government-sponsored conflict, the consequences would be devastating for the civilian population, according to Eric Reeves of &lt;a href="w%3ADemocracy%20Now"&gt;Democracy Now&lt;/a&gt;:

"If this offensive takes place, there will be massive, massive civilian destruction. I think we're also likely to see a withdrawal of virtually all humanitarian workers. This will leave some 1.2 million people completely dependent on humanitarian aid, without any assistance whatsoever," Reeves told the Coalition for Darfur on Saturday.

<h2>Sexual assaults rise dramatically</h2>
Meanwhile, the situation for the millions of refugees on the ground is deteriorating rapidly, according to the International Rescue Committee. On Wednesday, the group released statistics which suggest as many as 200 women have been sexually assaulted since the start of July, often as they leave settlements in search of firewood and food. 

"This is a massive spike in figures," said the IRC's Kurt Tjossem, "we are used to hearing of 2 to 4 incidents of sexual assault per month in Kalma camp [in southern Darfur]".

A &lt;a href="w%3AKamov-32"&gt;Kamov-32&lt;/a&gt; fire-fighting helicopter has crashed while trying to fill its water tanks, reports the &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤Anatolian News♡❤ agency. The crew was reported to be in good condition.

Since mid-August, the forest fires have swept the Southern part of Turkey including popular tourist destinations like &lt;a href="w%3ABodrum"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt; and . Lately the General Directorate for Forestry has sent short text messages through Turkish operators for citizens to be aware of forest fires. Amid warnings another fire started in &lt;a href="w%3AKas"&gt;Kas&lt;/a&gt; during the weekend.

The latest fire in Kas was taken under control with the help from fire helicopters, where the Kamof-32 type &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n fire helicopter has crashed while filling its tanks with water from nearby &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Gombe"&gt;Lake Gombe&lt;/a&gt;. Three Russian citizens working with the team, a Turkish pilot and a Turkish engineer have reported to be fine and in good condition in Gombe Health Center.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;The Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; is considering replacing the nuclear warheads on some &lt;a href="w%3Aballistic%20missiles"&gt;ballistic missiles&lt;/a&gt; with conventional munitions so that they can be used for "pre-emptive" strikes against alleged terrorists, Secretary of Defence &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; told reporters after a meeting with Russia's Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Ivanov"&gt;Sergei Ivanov&lt;/a&gt;. 

"If either of our countries or friends and allies were threatened at some number of years into the future with a weapon of mass destruction or a capability that was that lethal, I think any president, whether of Russia or the United States, would like to have available a conventional weapon that could attack that target swiftly and accurately and precisely and not feel that the only thing they had might be a nuclear weapon, which they would not want to use.", Rumsfeld said. He urged Russia to consider the idea too, but Ivanov said a pre-emptive strike was not the only solution.

The Pentagon has considered such strategies before. In February 2003 a similar plan was suggested, and in May 2006 it was recommended that Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) be used for such a purpose. Critics wondered what the risks would be for setting off accidental &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20warfare"&gt;nuclear war&lt;/a&gt;: it would be impossible for another nation to tell whether a &lt;a href="w%3ATrident%20II"&gt;Trident II&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AMinuteman%20III"&gt;Minuteman III&lt;/a&gt; launch was conventional — or nuclear-armed until it had actually detonated.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Ministry of Defence named the soldier who was killed in Afghanistan yesterday. He was Lance Cpl. Jonathan Hetherington and was shot dead by insurgents during an attack on his platoon residence in Musa Qaleh, northern &lt;a href="w%3AHelmand%20Province"&gt;Helmand&lt;/a&gt;.

The 22-year-old joined the army in September 2000. During his career he served in Germany, Kuwait, Iraq and the Falkland Islands. He was dispatched to Afghanistan this year.

His commanding officer, Lt. Col, Steve Vickery, said: "Lance Corporal Jon Hetherington had only been in Afghanistan for a short time. In this period his commitment to his profession was first-class and he stood out as a young man of stature and great enthusiasm. He was a very bright junior non-commissioned officer who had integrated extremely well into regimental life since his arrival in February of this year." He also said that Lance Cpl. Hetherington was "an outstanding soldier, trusted comrade and valued friend."

Defence Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADes%20Browne"&gt;Des Browne&lt;/a&gt; said yesterday: "The sad news… has reminded us of the challenges we face in Afghanistan. We are there as part of the Nato mission to help rid Afghanistan of these terrorists and provide security to help rebuild." 

He is the eighth British soldier to have died in Afghanistan this month. Since military operations began in November 2001, 21 British soldiers have died.

<h1>Afghanistan: 17 killed, 47 injured in Afghan suicide attack on market</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Afghanistan%3A%2017%20killed%2C%2047%20injured%20in%20Afghan%20suicide%20attack%20on%20market&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Seventeen people were killed today and another 47 injured when a suicide bomber detonated a hidden explosive in a market. Local hospital officials have confirmed that another six people are in critical condition, undergoing treatment.

The market was owned by a former police chief in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province. The bomber detonated the explosives — apparently strapped to his body — outside the busy market, which is close to a police station.

There are conflicting reports that the bombing may have been the work of al-Qaeda related groups, or it may have been done by a group of men meeting to settle a dispute.

Afghanistan's southern provinces have seen a surge in violence in recent days, making them the bloodiest since 2001. The NATO ISAF forces have taken a number of casualties, sparking internal investigations amid reports of friendly fire incidents that have killed several members of the Afghan National Police.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai has ordered an inquiry into the killing of civilians in the insurgent attacks as residents and troops brace for what could be more violence in the days to come.

<h1>Case against Karr dropped: no DNA link to JonBenet Ramsey murder</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Case%20against%20Karr%20dropped%3A%20no%20DNA%20link%20to%20JonBenet%20Ramsey%20murder&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Prosecutors have withdrawn their case against &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Mark%20Karr"&gt;John Mark Karr&lt;/a&gt;, the man who confessed to killing &lt;a href="w%3AJonBenet%20Ramsey"&gt;JonBenet Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, as &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; tests do not place him at the crime scene.

"The people would not be able to establish that Mr. Karr committed this crime despite his repeated insistence that he did," District Attorney Mary Lacy said in court papers. Lacy also said that prosecutors found no evidence placing Karr in Boulder at the time of the killing. She also vowed to keep pursuing leads in the murder, saying, "This case is not closed."

Karr will remain in custody in Boulder until he can be sent to Sonoma County, Calif., to face child pornography charges dating from 2001.

According to reports by ♡❤MSNBC♡❤ and ♡❤KUSA♡❤, a local television station in &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Denver, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, tests performed on DNA samples taken from Karr do not match samples recovered from Ramsey's body. 

On its website, ♡❤KUSA♡❤ says it "has confirmed from two sources that the DNA taken from John Mark Karr, 41, does not match the DNA samples taken from the crime scene in the JonBenet Ramsey murder case. No charges will be filed against Karr in connection with the Ramsey case by the Boulder County District Attorney's office." 

DNA from Karr's hair and saliva were tested in the &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Denver, Colorado&lt;/a&gt; Police Department's lab over the weekend.

"This information is critical because … if Mr. Karr's account of his sexual involvement with the victim were accurate, it would have been highly likely that his saliva would have been mixed with the blood in the underwear," said Colorado District Attorney, Mary Lacy. Lacy noted that Karr had become a suspect after exchanging e-mail with a professor in California.

Karr's attorney has requested that all DNA evidence be handed over to the defense for examination. His attorney has also requested additional testing of Karr's DNA; however, there is confusion about who represents Karr. Seth Temin, a public defender claims to represent Karr, but at least two other attorneys in California, Jamie Harmon and Patience Van Zandt, are also claiming to represent him.

"The warrant on Mr. Karr has been dropped by the district attorney. They are not proceeding with the case," said Timen. "We're deeply distressed by the fact that they took this man and dragged him here from Bangkok, Thailand, with no forensic evidence confirming the allegations against him and no independent factors leading to a presumption he did anything wrong," added Timen.

JonBenét, a beauty queen, was found beaten and strangled to death in her Colorado home on the day after Christmas in 1996.

In a press conference earlier this month, Karr confessed to being with JonBenét when she died, adding that her death was an accident. "I was with JonBenét when she died. I loved JonBenét. She died accidentally. I am so very sorry for what happened to JonBenét. It's very important for me that everyone knows that I love her very much, that her death was unintentional, that it was an accident."

Despite his confession, Karr's then ex-wife said that he was in Alabama with her when the murder occurred.

In the southern city of Diwania, Iraqi troops battled members of the Shia minority's Mehdi 
Army, killing 40 gunmen and wounding another 40 civilians. The fighting claimed 19 Iraqi 
Army troops. Internal Iraqi forces had lost control of parts of Diwaniya city in Iraq's 
south after members of the Mehdi Army rejected a call to participate in peace negotiations. 
In response the Mehdi Army setup checkpoints in parts of the city, sparking the violence 
that saw the Iraqi government send in large numbers of reinforcements to re-take control of 
the city.

In Baghdad a mid-morning blast injured about a dozen people, and killing at least eight 
police officers. The blast was aimed at the heavily securied Iraqi Interior Ministry, which 
has been the frequent target of attacks. No claim of responsibility has been reported.

This morning's violence contrasted statements by Maj Gen William Caldwell, who claimed 
"Insurgents and terrorists are hitting back in an attempt to offset the success of the Iraqi 
government and its security forces," the general went on to say that violence had fallen by 
half since July, but had increased suddenly in the last two days.
Yesterday five US soldiers were killed in three separate bombing incidents, killing four and 
one respectively, the US military announced today.

Sectarian violence has flared in Iraq since the US-led invasion, leading some to speculate 
that Iraq is now in the throwes of a civil war. Calls to partition the country are 
becoming louder, bringing into question the future of Iraq as a unified state.
The assassination of the chief prosecutor in Saddam Hussein's trial for genocide highlights 
the deep divisions between Iraq's cultural factions, lending creedance to speculation that 
Iraq has a long way to go before the safety of civilians can be assured. Factions still 
loyal to the Hussein Regieme remain under cover, undermining the reported progress of 
western forces.

An eighteen year old &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n girl, who was held captive by a 44 year-old man in the basement of his house for eight years, said that she is mourning his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asuicide"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which he committed after she escaped from him.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANatascha%20Kampusch"&gt;Natascha Kampusch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , abducted on her way to school eight years ago, had been "part of [her captor's] life." Police and investigators, unable to find a single lead or tip of her whereabouts, had all but given up hope of finding her alive and well until last week, when Natascha fled from her captor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWolfgang%20Priklopil"&gt;Wolfgang Priklopil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a telecoms technician after he left her cleaning his car to answer the telephone. Natascha's abductor, Wolfgang Priklopil, committed suicide hours after Natascha's escape by throwing himself in front of a train only minutes after he realized her escape.

After hearing of Priklopil's death, Kampusch wrote "..[Priklopil] was part of my life, that's why in a certain way I'm mourning him". &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APsychoanalysis"&gt;Psychoanalysts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; believe Kampusch may be suffering from &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm%20syndrome"&gt;Stockholm Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a psychological condition in which captives begin to feel empathy, and even affection, for their captors. Psychoanalysts are well represented in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASigmund%20Freud"&gt;Sigmund Freud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the founder of Psychoanalysis was Viennese. After eight years with her captor, Kampusch is spending time receiving care from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Apsychologist"&gt;psychologists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at a secret location, away from the media and her parents. Natasha spoke at first but later became more reticent and reluctant to answer questions. A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Apsychiatrist"&gt;psychiatrist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; feared a "delayed trauma".

Kampusch's parents expressed their frustration on not being allowed to have access to their daughter. Nevertheless, psychiatric staff with the girl have said that Kampusch needs time to re-adjust to life in the outside world. In a letter to her parents, Kampush stated that they would have "...all the time in the world..." once she had become re-accustomed to the outside. Psychologists claim she may lead a normal future life but probably will require years of psychological therapy. Ludwig Koch, her father said, "Natascha is very thin, has very, very white skin, and patches on her whole body. I don't want to think where they come from." She may be suppressing physical or sexual abuse. Early on she had to call her captor "master" or "lord".

Casualties are mounting in a &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lankan&lt;/a&gt; army offensive launched against the separatist &lt;a href="w%3ALiberation%20Tigers%20of%20Tamil%20Eelam"&gt;Tamil Tigers&lt;/a&gt; militia in the northeast of the island nation. Reports say eight soldiers have been killed and 28 injured in the latest fighting.

The campaign, launched Sunday, includes navy, air and ground force advancement into Tamil Tiger held territory. Last month the town of Muttur saw heavy fighting and recession of rebel-held territory to the Sri Lankan Government. The fighting prompted international aid agencies to send emergency supplies to the estimated 500,000 residents.

"There was heavy shelling and aerial bombardment, 20 civilians were killed and 26 injured," rebel spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤. Accounts of the fighting differed from the account given by Brig. Prasad Samarasinghe of the Sri Lankan Government forces, "We have killed no civilians. I don't think any civilian lives there."

Neither of the reports can be confirmed at this time. International observers have pulled out of the conflict zone and the district is closed to outsiders. The port of Trincomalee is an important supply point for the region's 43,000 government troops.

The airstrikes and shelling have internally displaced close to 204,000 civilians.

The offensive continues even though a 2002 ceasefire is in place, from which neither side has officially withdrawn.

&lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Quebecois&lt;/a&gt; Member of Parliament &lt;a href="w%3ABeno%C3%AEt%20Sauvageau"&gt;Benoit Sauvageau&lt;/a&gt; was killed in an automobile accident on Monday morning after his vehicle hit a tow truck at the side of a road in his &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; constituency. 

Sauvageau, 42, had been an MP since 1993 and represented the riding of &lt;a href="w%3ARepentigny%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Repentigny&lt;/a&gt; at the time of his death. 

Bloc Québécois (BQ) Leader &lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20Duceppe"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt;, speaking in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20City"&gt;Quebec City&lt;/a&gt;, remembered Sauvageau as a hard-working representative who was widely respected "not only in the sovereigntist camp but by his adversaries who always recognized him for his honesty and his determination."

"I think he was a very good member of Parliament, a very good &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20sovereignty%20movement"&gt;sovereigntist&lt;/a&gt;," added Duceppe. 

Visibly shaken by the news, Duceppe said: "It's awful, at 42 with four children (daughters) between the ages of five and 15, it's not right."

Former &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Quebec"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALucien%20Bouchard"&gt;Lucien Bouchard&lt;/a&gt;, who led the BQ when Sauvageau was first elected, told &lt;a href="w%3ARadio%20Canada"&gt;Radio Canada&lt;/a&gt;: "It's a tragedy. It's unbelievable that he died like that."

"He is a man who was engaged in political fights but he did it correctly, with nobility and idealism and a lot of respect for others, even his adversaries," said Bouchard.

Sauvageau was a history professor before entering politics. As an MP he was the Bloc's spokesperson on public accounts and the treasury board and was also the party's critic responsible for the &lt;a href="w%3AOfficial%20Languages%20Act"&gt;Official Languages Act&lt;/a&gt; and the rights of &lt;a href="w%3Afrancophone"&gt;Francophones&lt;/a&gt; outside of Quebec.

"On behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada and our Parliamentary caucus, I would like to express my deepest sadness and regret at the news of the death of Benoît Sauvageau in a tragic car accident in Repentigny this afternoon," said interim Liberal leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt;.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; said the prayers and thoughts of all Parliamentarians are with Sauvageau's loved ones at this difficult time.

The software watchdog group StopBadware.org, run by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABerkman%20Center%20for%20Internet%20%26amp%3B%20Society"&gt;Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20School"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20Internet%20Institute"&gt;Oxford Internet Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has opened a dialogue with &lt;a href="AOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt; about concerns over the presence of badware, also known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amalware"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in the now-free AOL 9.0 software. Badware refers to software applications that try to download additional software with very little or no explanation. StopBadware.org decided to investigate after their users have sent in complaints regarding the operation of the software.

According to the "open inquiry" on StopBadware.org, the preliminary tests conclude that AOL 9.0 installs software and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; extensions without the consent of the user, requires users to take certain actions, and it doesn't completely uninstall itself. The page then warns readers not to use the AOL software unless they're prepared to handle the risks involved.

The report clarifies its charges; for example it lists ♡❤"RealPlayer, QuickTime, AOL You've Got Pictures Screensaver, Pure Networks Port Magic, and Viewpoint Media Player"♡❤ as the software that is installed without notification. Additionally, the AOL toolbar, a bookmark to AOL.com, as well as extra icons are added to Internet Explorer without consent. The report continues by noting that AOL coerces users into upgrading the software by a popup window that does not allow refusal, as well as automatically upgrades the software without allowing that option to be disabled.

AOL spokesman Andrew Weinstein claims that these problems are going to be addressed in an upgrade available next month. In the meantime, Weinstein claims that the problems are not malicious. "No one has done more to protect users from malware than AOL," Weinstein said. John Palfrey agrees that the findings of AOL are not the worst he's seen, but they should disclose more information about the software to users. When AOL was issued with an advance copy of the report, StopBadware.org was "very impressed" with their response, and that they look forward to working with AOL.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;Secretary General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; called on &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;, Monday, to release the two &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; soldiers who were captured on July 12.

Annan also urged Israel to lift its air and sea blockade of Lebanon faulting it for not meeting the requirements of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201559"&gt;UN resolution&lt;/a&gt; governing the 15 day old ceasefire. The UN leader made his comments in &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; following talks with Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AFuad%20Saniora"&gt;Fuad Saniora&lt;/a&gt;.

"It's a fixed menu. . . . It's not an a la carte menu where you choose and pick," said Annan of the ceasefire provisions and the failure of both sides to fulfill them. He said that the truce had created the opportunity for a "long-term ceasefire and a long-term peace" but that all sides of the conflict had to fully implement the UN Security Council resolution for that to occur. 

Israel responded to Annan's comments by saying it intended to continue the blockade until international forces are deployed along Lebanon's border with &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and other entry points in order to stop arms shipments to Hezbollah. 

"Once the international forces are fully in place and they're able to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Hezbollah, there will be no need for the air and naval blockade," said David Baker speaking on behalf of Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;. 

<h3>Addresses Syrian concerns</h3>

Annan said that the Lebanese army, not the international force, should have the responsibility of policing the border with Syria saying that the deployment of peacekeeping troops on the border of two countries that have not been at war would be unprecedented. Syrian President &lt;a href="w%3ABashar%20Assad"&gt;Bashar Assad&lt;/a&gt; has said having international forces on the country's border would be a "hostile" act. 

He stressed that southern Lebanon must become an arms free zone, "In Lebanon, there should be - as we have all agreed - one law, one authority, one gun," he said, and that the disarmament of Hezbollah must be achieved by national agreement within Lebanon and could not be implemented by international forces. 

Annan's visit to Lebanon is the first leg of a tour of the Middle East aimed at propping up the ceasefire. He will also be visiting Israel, Syria, the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Territories"&gt;Palestinian Territories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

Five passengers have died and more than a dozen are injured after a bus bound for &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; crashed through a guard rail in upper New York state on Monday evening.

The Greyhound bus was heading north on Interstate 87 when it rolled over at around 6:45 pm before reaching &lt;a href="w%3AWestport%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Westport, New York&lt;/a&gt;, about half way between &lt;a href="w%3AAlbany%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; and Montreal. Several passengers were still trapped two hours after the crash, according to the ♡❤Plattsburgh Press Republican♡❤.

"All we did was try to comfort people," said Plattsburgh Mayor Daniel Stewart. "I also did a lot of French to English translation for police. Many on the bus were tourists returning to Canada."

The dead include a 16-year old boy and 34-year old man, both from Montreal, and a 69-year old woman from an undisclosed Canadian location. The other two victims are both from New York State including the bus driver. 

Thirty-seven passengers were taken to Champlain Valley Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3APlattsburgh%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Plattsburgh, New York&lt;/a&gt;, following the crash. Twenty-two were treated and released.

Two passengers were have been transferred to Montreal General Hospital where they are in intensive care. Four others are in stable condition. 

Reports suggest that the bus crashed through a guard rail after passing a truck, went down an embankment and rolled at least twice before landing upside down. The rear and top of the bus were crushed and one of its back wheels was turned inward. According to Don Jaquish, deputy director of the &lt;a href="w%3AEssex%20County%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Essex County, New York&lt;/a&gt; Emergency Services, many of the passengers were thrown out of the bus and landed on a grassy area nearby.

Major Richard Smith, Jr., of the New York State Police said that investigators believe a tire failure may have been a contributing factor in the crash. Survivors say they heard a loud bang before the bus lost control.

Smith said that 48 of the 52 passengers on the bus sustained injuries. Greyhound Bus No. 4014 had been due to arrive in Montreal at 9:10 pm. Many of the passengers are believed to be from the Montreal area.

The highway remained closed late Monday between Exits 30 and 31 in both directions.

Family members can call Greyhound at 1-800-972-4583 for more information.

<h1>U.S. commuter blows up section of Washington D.C. Bridge</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20commuter%20blows%20up%20section%20of%20Washington%20D.C.%20Bridge&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Regular commuter Dan Ruefly detonated a half-&lt;a href="w%3Amile"&gt;mile&lt;/a&gt; (800 &lt;a href="w%3Ametre"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt;) section of the old &lt;a href="w%3AWoodrow%20Wilson%20Bridge"&gt;Woodrow Wilson Bridge&lt;/a&gt; just after 12:30 a.m. local time (0530 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) on Tuesday 29 August 2006. The detonation brought down over 2,600 &lt;a href="w%3Aton"&gt;tons&lt;/a&gt; of steel. The bridge, which carried the &lt;a href="w%3ACapital%20Beltway"&gt;Capital Beltway&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href="w%3APotomac%20River"&gt;Potomac River&lt;/a&gt;, was scheduled for destruction as part of a $2.4 billion project to replace the span. The bridge has caused traffic delays nearly every day since its opening in 1961. 

Mr. Ruefly had won the honour of pushing the plunger in a contest to find the worst commuting experience; after a motoring accident he became stuck in a traffic jam. Mr. Ruefly (who leaves home at 5:00 a.m. every day to beat the traffic) had crashed into a stationary &lt;a href="w%3Atractor-trailer"&gt;tractor-trailer&lt;/a&gt; on the bridge, leaving him with severely crushed hips. The ambulance sent to transport him to hospital was unable to make it through rush hour traffic and, as a result, Mr. Ruefly almost died.

The detonation of the six-lane drawbridge was originally planned to occur at 11:59 p.m. however it was delayed by over half an hour when spectators broke through security fences to get a better view, the bridge was finally brought down at around 12:35 a.m. There was a 20 second delay between the time of initiation and the actual detonation. It was reported that the plunger was not actually wired to the charges, and was only a ceremonial prop to signal the actual detonation by the engineering crews.

The demolition is part of a complete replacement of the former six-lane bridge with a twelve lane version comprised of two side-by-side drawbridges. Work started on the project as early as 1999 and the new north-bound bridge was opened on June 10 2006. This demolition is the first step in the next stage of the project; to replace the existing bridge with the southbound 'twin'.

Boat traffic on the Potomac River and vehicle traffic on the new Wilson Bridge were halted during the detonation. Airspace was also briefly closed for a short duration.

&lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤Redbus♡❤ bus driver Micheal Sean Ohiomhair, 57-year-old, is being sought for &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;9000 by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; for wasting time and resources after he filed a false statement that a woman had attacked him. The police had put 100 hours into the hunt for the attacker.

The Christchurch District Court found out today that the injuries he sustained were self-inflicted. Ohiomhair changed his plead to guilty to the charges of making a false statement after originally pleading not guilty. Serina Bailey, defence council, said "57-year-old Ohiomhair had originally pleaded not guilty because there were medical and psychological issues I wished to raise". Her client has now consulted mental health services for on-going psychological matters.

Police and ambulance personnel were called to the scene on May 10 at 2045 (&lt;a href="w%3ANZST"&gt;NZST&lt;/a&gt;), when Ohiomhair told the police that a woman had attacked him while he was at a bus stop in Hornby, Christchurch. The ambulance staff treated him at the scene for injuries he sustained to his forearm and the left side of his head.

The police and police dogs then searched the area but failed to find the alleged woman attacker. After reconfirming what happened the police told him that it appeared his reconfirmation appeared incorrect, he then left the station but later appeared back at the station and confessed to making it up. 

This incident followed an original incident when a different bus driver was attacked by teenage girls.

Ohiomhair will appear back in court, after he was remanded on bail, on September 15 for a probation report, a reparation report and sentencing.

Mark Berryman, Police prosecutor Sergeant, said "He said he received information from a family member two hours before, which caused him to become stressed and confused," the information he had received was relating to an incident that happened 25 years ago.

&lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; government spokesman and Justice Minister Cemil Cicek has confirmed their government's intentions to send troops to &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; under the UN Resolution 1701. The statement was made after the Council of Ministers met yesterday. The final decision is to be made by Turkish parliament.

The statement also revealed the ongoing struggle between &lt;a href="w%3ATayyip%20Erdogan"&gt;Tayyip Erdogan's&lt;/a&gt; AK(Justice and Development) Party government and President &lt;a href="w%3AAhmet%20Necdet%20Sezer"&gt;Ahmet Necdet Sezer&lt;/a&gt;. Sezer's statements on Friday was regarded as a clear indication of the President's reluctancy to send Turkish troops to Lebanon. "Yes, let's do it, I am not against it. But the UN resolution does not focus on humanitarian aid", said Sezer on Thursday. On Saturday, Head of Parliament MP Bulent Arinc has made a counter declaration that it is not Presidents but government and parliament's decision on whether or not to send troops.

On the other hand, Turkish army generals are refraining from making political statements but emphasizing their readiness for such operations if parliamentary decision is made. The new Militay Chief of Staff General Yasar Buyukanit said "It is government's duty to decide joining the operation", but he also underlined that Turkish army has started the preparations.

Despite differences between state organs opinions, Turkish people are not very enthusiastic to send their army to Lebanon as one online survey on the highest selling daily newspaper Hurriyet web page indicates. According to the poll more than 75% of the respondents are against sending troops to Lebanon.

The final decision has to be given by Turkish Parliament, expected this week or early next week according to government spokesperson Cemil Cicek.

In the biggest ever narcotics haul in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;India's capital&lt;/a&gt;, the New Delhi police have seized over 4,400 kg of &lt;a href="w%3AMandrax"&gt;Mandrax&lt;/a&gt; and Rs. 20 &lt;a href="w%3Acrore"&gt;crore&lt;/a&gt; from a dealer in the city. The consignment, meant for a customer in the U.S, was seized from a godown in Badarpur, near the Delhi-&lt;a href="w%3AHaryana"&gt;Haryana&lt;/a&gt; border. The alleged trafficker, identified as Vinod Sharma, claimed that the contraband was not his and that he had nothing to do with the matter. Sharma started his career as a scrap-dealer in Delhi, and police suspect that with the help of some contacts he used container depots for drug-trafficking, whilst successfully dodging both the police and the Customs Department.

On Sunday the Delhi Police arrested him at his Kalkaji residence. The Deputy Commissioner of Police for South District, Delhi Police, Anil Shukla said, "Sharma befriended container drivers and once they had driven past customs, he and his men would meet them at a distance and pilfer the containers."

&lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Thatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AClement%20Attlee"&gt;Clement Attlee&lt;/a&gt; topped a list of the greatest British &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Ministers&lt;/a&gt;, evaluated by Historian Francis Beckett. Writing in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20History%20%28magazine%29"&gt;BBC History Magazine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Beckett gave 20 Prime Ministers a score from 0 to 5, basing his view on the leader's implementation of their policy rather than the content of their policies.

Thatcher and Attlee topped the list (both scoring 5). Identifying her &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20miners%27%20strike%20%281984%E2%80%931985%29"&gt;victory over the miners&lt;/a&gt; as the key decider, Beckett said of Lady Thatcher: 
"Today few people under 40 remember a time when trade unions were a real force in the land, when the public sector controlled large swathes of the economy, when local councils controlled education and other local services, when benefits were considered rights of citizenship,"

Thatcher, the only woman to have become British Prime Minister, is recognised as one of the most significant British politicians in recent history and her policies have been met with both strong support and strong opposition.

Attlee, the longest serving &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20party"&gt;Labour party&lt;/a&gt; leader (at 20 years) and Prime Minister from 1945 to 1951, ranked highly due to his key role in major reforms in British politics and economy. He was responsible for the creation of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Health%20Service"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; (NHS) and for granting independence to &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. In 2004 a poll of political academics (organised by &lt;a href="w%3AMORI"&gt;MORI&lt;/a&gt;) Attlee was voted the most effective (non-wartime) British Prime Minister of the 20th century.

The current Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; ranked mid table; with a score of 3. Beckett noted that Blair's handling of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 marked him down, although his running reforms of schools and hospitals counted in his favour ensuring an average mark.

In a (conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;) Sir &lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Churchill"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; (awarded 4 points in this new ranking along side &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Heath"&gt;Edward Heath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHarold%20Macmillan"&gt;Harold Macmillan&lt;/a&gt;) was voted the greatest Briton of all time. Interestingly, in the same poll Thatcher came 16th whilst Attlee did not feature.

Of the twenty, only &lt;a href="w%3ANeville%20Chamberlain"&gt;Neville Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt; and Sir &lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Eden"&gt;Anthony Eden&lt;/a&gt; scored 0. Beckett cited Chamberlain's failure to prevent the &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20World%20War"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; as his reason for the low marking.

Assuming the role of Rene Oswin, spokesperson for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Housing%20and%20Urban%20Development"&gt;United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&lt;/a&gt; (HUD) in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, a member of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Yes%20Men"&gt;The Yes Men&lt;/a&gt; gave a satirical 15-minute speech claiming that HUD had reversed its decision to demolish four serviceable public housing complexes &amp;mdash; a controversial action, suspected by many former residents and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People"&gt;NAACP&lt;/a&gt; as a policy intended to drive out poor black families. The media coordinator for the Survivors Village, Annie Chen, applauded Oswin.

Alternatively, Oswin proposed for &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; "to withdraw from areas near low-income New Orleans neighborhoods and to help nurture local businesses to replace them," "partnership with health departments and the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;" to "insure there is at least one well-equipped public health clinic for every public housing development," and "that Exxon and Shell have agreed to finance the rebuilding of the protective wetlands from part of their 60 billion dollars in profits this year."

From &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, HUD spokeswoman Donna White confirmed the speech as a hoax and that no one named Rene Oswin works for the department. She said, "I'm like, who the heck is that?"

<h1>FBI most-wanted fugitive, polygamist Warren Jeffs, arrested</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=FBI%20most-wanted%20fugitive%2C%20polygamist%20Warren%20Jeffs%2C%20arrested&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Jeffs"&gt;Warren Jeffs&lt;/a&gt;, the fugitive leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AFundamentalist%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter%20Day%20Saints"&gt;Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&lt;/a&gt; (FLDS) has been arrested in &lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. 

Around 9 p.m. local time, he was arrested on &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2015"&gt;Interstate 15&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AClark%20County%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Clark County, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, north of &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, during a routine traffic stop when he was recognized by a local officer. He was found to be carrying computers, 15 cell phones, disguises (3 wigs), and a total of more than $54,000 in cash with him in the vehicle.

Jeffs' red 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ACadillac%20Escalade"&gt;Cadillac Escalade&lt;/a&gt; was pulled over because the vehicle's temporary plates from Colorado were not visible. No weapons were found in the car or at the scene. Naomi Jeffs, one of Jeffs' wives, and Isaac Steve Jeffs, his brother, were both in the vehicle and detained for questioning. Both were released and not charged with any crime.

When questioned separately, Warren Jeffs and his brother gave inconsistent responses when asked where they were going, Warren saying Denver, and his brother saying Utah. In addition, the officer responsible for the arrest, Eddie Duchover, stated that when initially pulling the car over, Jeffs would not make eye contact, and nervously ate a salad. The officer also cited Jeffs' throbbing &lt;a href="w%3Acarotid%20artery"&gt;carotid artery&lt;/a&gt; as an indication that he had done something big.

Jeffs, a recluse, was indicted last June on a sexual misconduct charge in Arizona; prosecutors allege he arranged marriages for under-age girls and older men. Reclusive for over a year, the FBI placed him on its 10 most wanted fugitives list. A $100,000 reward was offered for information leading to his capture. He now faces new charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

It is not yet clear where Jeffs will be tried, though currently he is being held in Clark County jail (Las Vegas) pending a court hearing for the latest charge. He may be extradited to Arizona to face the additional charges there.

The FLDS is a separatist movement that split off from the &lt;a href="w%3AMormon%20church"&gt;Mormon church&lt;/a&gt; more than a century ago due to the latter's changed views on polygamy. FLDS members (estimated at ten thousand) believe that a man must marry at least three times to enter heaven after death. The sect is based in &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%20City%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Colorado City, Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHildale%2C%20Utah"&gt;Hildale, Utah&lt;/a&gt; (although there are other compounds in other parts of America).

Jeffs became leader of the group in 2002 after the death of the former leader, his father &lt;a href="w%3ARulon%20Jeffs"&gt;Rulon Jeffs&lt;/a&gt;.

President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; expressed his unwillingness to conform to &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; demands on Tuesday. Ahmadinejad said, "Peaceful nuclear energy is the right of the Iranian nation. The Iranian nation has chosen that based upon international regulations, it wants to use it and no one can stop it." Iran has until Thursday to comply with a U.N. Security Council demand to stop its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium%20enrichment"&gt;uranium enrichment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; program. If Iran does not comply by Thursday, the UN has left open the possibility of economic sanctions. Ahmadinejad says that he is willing to listen to negotiations related to changing Iran's nuclear program but that, "...any kind of dialogue should be based upon the certain rights of the Iranian nation."

While the rights of which Ahmadinejad speaks are not currently available for public viewing, Iranian academics point to the six issues in Iran's standard diplomatic policy.

Iran has consistently claimed that it is enriching uranium and building plutonium-producing reactors for solely peaceful purposes—for the generation of electricity, the exporting of materials for other civilian nuclear industries, and the creation of medical radioisotopes—while many western nations have accused the country of running a clandestine &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20weapon"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; program. They have cited as evidence for this Iran's continual investment in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adual-use%20technology"&gt;dual-use technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which could be used for either civilian or military purposes, as well as alleging that Iran has not been forthright in disclosures of its nuclear developments.

Iran provoked international controversy in April 2006 when it announced an earlier nuclear success: the enrichment of a small amount of uranium to reactor-grade levels (3.5% of the isotope &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium-235"&gt;uranium-235&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; using &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agas%20centrifuge"&gt;gas centrifuge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; technology. Concern was raised by some that if Iran was able to scale up its enrichment facilities to thousands of centrifuges, they could be used to produce bomb-grade uranium (90% uranium-235).

Iran has insisted that under the terms of the 1968 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , of which it is a signatory, it is guaranteed the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. None of Iran's facilities currently have the ability to produce weapons-grade nuclear material, and most experts say it would be at least a decade for Iran to be able to build a functional nuclear weapon.

<h1>Mexican ruling boosts Calderon, rival vows parallel government</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mexican%20ruling%20boosts%20Calderon%2C%20rival%20vows%20parallel%20government&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Mexico's electoral court has unanimously rejected claims of massive fraud in the July 2nd presidential election and reported that the partial recount ordered at the end of last month has not changed the original result of a narrow victory for conservative candidate &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Calderon"&gt;Felipe Calderon&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Action%20Party"&gt;National Action Party (PAN)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AAndres%20Manuel%20Lopez%20Obrador"&gt;Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador&lt;/a&gt; of the left-wing &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Revolution%20Party"&gt;Democratic Revolution Party (PRD)&lt;/a&gt;, continues to insist that the election was rigged and has vowed to continue fighting the result. Lopez Obrador has rejected the ruling and suggested forming a rival parallel government. 

There is no legal avenue to appeal the court's ruling, in except of the 39th article of the Mexican Constitution which states: "The sovereignty of the state resides on the citizens. The citizens have always the righ to change or to modify its government", article that has been claimed by &lt;a href="w%3AAndres%20Manuel%20Lopez%20Obrador"&gt;Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador&lt;/a&gt; as a right to summon a National Democratic Convention. The seven judges have until August 31 to resolve all complaints and until September 6 to officially declare a president-elect or annul the elections. 

Lopez Obrador has led massive protests in &lt;a href="w%3AMexico%20City"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; over the past month demanding a full recount. 

"Never more will we accept that an illegal and illegitimate government is installed in our country," he told thousands of supporters following the ruling calling upon them to never accept Calderon as president and to decide if he should form a parallel government and (or) continue nationwide protests. 

Leonel Castillo, the president of the tribunal, said Lopez Obrador's claims of massive fraud "turned out to be completely unfounded."

Lopez Obrador's election team had filed complaints at 50,000 polling stations but the court ordered a recount at only 11,839 stations or 9% of all voting locations following massive street protests. Calderon won the intial ballot count by a margion of less than 0.6%

A man named George Schultz in &lt;a href="w%3AParksville%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Parksville, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; is selling the boat from old TV series &lt;a href="w%3AGilligan%27s%20Island"&gt;Gilligan's Island&lt;/a&gt; at the cost of $99,000. The cruiser, originally cost about $290,000 in the 1960s.

"There have been a couple of modifications, so it doesn't look exactly like the original," said Shultz, a boat broker who's selling the 36-foot Wheeler Express Cruiser for fellow Parksdale resident Scotty Taylor. "But it's still the original boat."
Originally, the boat's name was The Blue Jacket. 

"Just for the show, for a stage name, it was called the S.S. Minnow," Shultz said. The name was a reference to &lt;a href="w%3ANewton%20Minnow"&gt;Newton Minnow&lt;/a&gt;, once chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AFCC"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;.

"He just liked the boat, he wanted to restore it, it was a nice looking boat, a wooden boat, a classic and he likes classic boats," said Shultz. "The hole in the hull was actually the least of the repairs - the interior needed a lot more work". 

Someone later stole the plaque on the boat, but the 46-year-old boat still has the round life preserver with S.S. Minnow emblazoned on it and the skipper's chair.

<h1>India's Secretary-General candidate Tharoor suggests UN reform agenda</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=India%27s%20Secretary-General%20candidate%20Tharoor%20suggests%20UN%20reform%20agenda&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
India's nominee for the post of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AShashi%20Tharoor"&gt;Shashi Tharoor&lt;/a&gt; has revealed a four-point plan to tackle the problems the international body is facing. He said that the biggest hurdle faced by the UN is that it has to deal with a large number of issues at the same time. The United Nations with its "impressive achievements and "haunting failures has changed but needs to change further" he said in an article in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANewsweek%20International"&gt;Newsweek International&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

Tharoor's proposal is concentrated on four areas- making democracy a priority; bolstering the ranks (of the United Nations); prioritising and streamlining; and healing wounds. He talked about the crisis in the Middle East, and the nuclear standoff between the U.N and countries like North Korea and Iran, referring to them as "obvious and trying". He also pointed out "problems without passports" such as climate change, narcotics smuggling and human rights violations. Tharoor, a leading candidate to succeed &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, said that strengthening the capacities of both the UN and its member-states was the best way to deal with these problems.

Tharoor stated that further efforts were needed to promote democracy and good governance the world over. "We now have a Democracy Fund to help us do that, financed not just by the rich West but by countries like India," he said. He also pointed out that the UN should try and stand up more for human rights by making sure the &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Council"&gt;Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt; did its job more effectively than the "over-politicised" &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Commission"&gt;Human Rights Commission&lt;/a&gt; it replaced. He said the UN should support the efforts bodies like &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; were making in their peacekeeping. Tharoor also spoke about the conflict in Iraq, saying "And where the task, like enforcing peace in Iraq, is clearly beyond us (the UN), we should let wars be fought by warriors, not peacekeepers,"

In reference to "healing wounds", he pointed out the danger of the &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; divisions being replaced by a North-South divide at the UN "The new secretary-general must urgently combat this. I would focus on building issue-based coalitions to deal with specific practical problems (things like management inefficiencies, procurement policies, information technology, outsourcing) that have little to do with ideological politics," he said.

Tharoor is currently the UN's Under Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information. He and South Korean Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki%20Moon"&gt;Ban Ki Moon&lt;/a&gt; are considered frontrunners in the race to succeed Annan, whose term ends at the end of the year. Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASurakiart%20Sathirathai"&gt;Surakiart Sathirathai&lt;/a&gt; and former UN disarmament chief &lt;a href="w%3AJayantha%20Dhanapala"&gt;Jayantha Dhanapala&lt;/a&gt; from Sri Lanka are also official candidates for the top UN job.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=GAO%20report%20says%20federal%20anti-drug%20Ad-campaign%20ineffectual&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20Accountability%20Office"&gt;Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt;, an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress to investigate how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars, has concluded that the $1.2 billion anti-drug advertising campaign conducted by the government since 1998 does not appear to have helped reduce drug use.

In its August 25, 2006, report entitled ♡❤ONDCP Media Campaign: Contractor's National Evaluation Did Not Find that the Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign Was Effective in Reducing Youth Drug Use,♡❤ the G.A.O. states that "reports and associated documentation leads to the conclusion that... the campaign was not effective in reducing youth drug use, either during the entire period of the campaign or during the period from 2002 to 2004 when the campaign was redirected and focused on marijuana use." It further suggests that the campaign "may have promoted perceptions among exposed youth that others' drug use was normal."

Making a recommendation on the spending aspects of this apparently failed program, the G.A.O. report includes the following: "Given that Westat's evaluation stated the campaign did not reduce youth drug use nationally, Congress should consider limiting appropriations for the campaign, beginning in the 2007 fiscal year budget until ONDCP [Office of National Drug Control Policy] provides credible evidence of a media campaign approach that effectively prevents and curtails youth drug use."

Tom Riley, spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20National%20Drug%20Control%20Policy"&gt;White House Office of National Drug Control Policy&lt;/a&gt; (ONDCP) says that the GAO report is "irrelevant" to his organization because it is "based on ads from 2.5 years ago, and they were effective, too," according to a report in USA Today . "Drug use has been going down dramatically. Cutting the program now would imperil (its) progress," according to Riley.

However, the anti-drug campaign had been criticized before. In 2003, the &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Management%20and%20Budget"&gt;White House Office of Management and Budget&lt;/a&gt; called the campaign "non-performing" and said it had not demonstrated results.

<h2>Microsoft's PlaysForSure DRM cracked</h2>
Engadget reported last Friday that a crack for &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APlaysForSure"&gt;PlaysForSure&lt;/a&gt; DRM has been released. The application that removes the protection is called "FairUse4WM". It allegedly removes all DRM from Windows Media DRM versions 10 and 11, although it does not work for version 9. Files from the Napster online music service have been reported to work with this software. According to some, it removes all protection from the files and allows them to be played by any non-DRM-enabled WMA decoder.

<h2>Atlantis launch delayed by weather</h2>
NASA's launch of the space shuttle Atlantis was delayed due to lightning storms in the Florida Gulf, and may possibly be delayed indefinitely due to Tropical Storm Ernesto. This will allow more time to analyze the impact of lightning on the launch pad. The space shuttle was re-scheduled for today 15:43 local time (1842 UTC), but will now launch September 7 at the earliest.

A film by Isuma Productions of Canada's north will open the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival"&gt;2006 Toronto International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; (TIFF). Produced by an Igloolik, Nunavut company, the film is titled ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Journals%20of%20Knud%20Rasmussen"&gt;The Journals of Knud Rassmusen&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and co-directed by &lt;a href="w%3AZacharias%20Kunuk"&gt;Zacharias Kunuk&lt;/a&gt; of Igloolik and Norman Cohn of Montreal.

The company received critical acclaim for their first film, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAtanarjuat"&gt;Atanarjuat&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which translates to ♡❤The Fast Runner♡❤. Released in 2001, TIFF declared ♡❤Atanarjuat♡❤ one of the &lt;a href="w%3ATIFF%20List%20of%20Canada%27s%20Top%20Ten%20Films%20of%20All%20Time"&gt;top ten Canadian films of all-time&lt;/a&gt;. The film grabbed awards at TIFF, Montreal, Chicago, Cannes, Edinburgh, San Diego, Lake Placid, New Port, and many others.

The film portrays the pressures on traditional &lt;a href="w%3AInuit"&gt;Inuit&lt;/a&gt; culture when explorer &lt;a href="w%3AKnud%20Rasmussen"&gt;Knud Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; introduced European cultural influences to the area in 1922.

The film will play three times during the festival, debuting at the "Visa Screening Room" of the &lt;a href="w%3AElgin%20Theatre"&gt;Elgin Theatre&lt;/a&gt; at 6:30 p.m. local time, Thursday, then at &lt;a href="w%3ARoy%20Thompson%20Hall"&gt;Roy Thompson Hall&lt;/a&gt; at 8:30 p.m. The next day, &lt;a href="w%3ARyerson%20University"&gt;Ryerson University&lt;/a&gt; will show the film at 9:30 a.m.

The festival attracts independent filmmakers and Hollywood celebrities alike. It will run from 7 to 16 September 2006.

A Canadian university and a Toronto firm selling books on tape are both running advertising campaigns that poke fun at &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Toronto firm simplyaudiobooks.ca has covered the city with billboards depicting a shrugging US president under the headline "Don't read enough?" The Toronto area company promoted by the ads say that their sales have doubled since the billboard campaign began. 

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3ALakehead%20University"&gt;Lakehead University&lt;/a&gt;, a small &lt;a href="w%3Anorthern%20Ontario"&gt;northern Ontario&lt;/a&gt; school, is attempting to attract new students with ads that feature Bush over the words "Yale Shmale" advising that "graduating from an Ivy League university doesn't necessarily mean you're smart." The website for the campaign proclaims "There are universities and then there are universities. So let's not beat around the bush."

Frederick Gilbert, president and vice-chancellor of Lakehead, said the campaign is meant to gain attention in a humorous manner.

"It was literally a tongue-in-cheek way of getting attention," he said, adding, "I must say that older generations, well even some of our students, have looked at it as not appropriate." 

Lakehead's student union president, Isabelle Poniatowski, described the ads as "repugnant" though Gilbert says that 95% of the response on the campaign's website, yaleshmale.com, has been positive.

The website of the newspaper currently also runs a featuring Bush and several recent . The ad states: "US presidents have always come to us for an overview of world affairs. Except one. ... (Go on George it's free)".

&lt;a href="w%3AEnvironment%20Canada"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that the water levels of &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Erie"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Huron"&gt;Lake Huron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Superior"&gt;Lake Superior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Michigan"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt; have dropped and that Lake Erie could lose two feet or 15% or more of its water level by the year 2050.

"We should pay attention to what they're telling us. That's not to say they're perfect, and there's always room for uncertainty, but . . . it's the best information we have at this point," said director of the Great Lakes Center at &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20State%20College"&gt;Buffalo State College&lt;/a&gt;, Joe Atkinson.

Reports also state that if any of the lakes lose a few feet of water the event could be an "economic disaster."

"That would just be an economic disaster. Water levels are what make or break this industry," said spokesman for the Lake Carriers Association, Glen Nekvasil. He also added that if a drop in water levels of a few feet in any of the great lakes, could render the shipping "inviable."

Researchers at Buffalo State College are not convinced that a major problem is looming.

"It's really just too early to make a decision," he said. "Water levels have fluctuated a lot in the last [few] hundreds of years, so it's hard to put that to global warming," said researcher with the Great Lakes Center at Buffalo State College, John J. Freidhoff.

Some officials admit that the loss of water levels in the lakes are not in the "top ten" problems that the Great Lakes face.

"The water being lost through climate change is not in our top 10. We have other fish to fry, so to speak," said Lake Erie specialist at the &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Envirnmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s (EPA) Great Lakes National Program Office located in &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, Dan O'Riordan.

Lake Michigan and Lake Huron are at least 45 cm. below their yearly average and Lake Superior is only 20 cm below its average, but Lake Erie and Lake Ontario have made a recovery from their averages.

Residents in Michigan are complaining about foul smells, dead fish, muck and garbage that litter the shorelines of &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20St.%20Clair"&gt;Lake St. Clair&lt;/a&gt; which is also 7 inches below its level this year when measured in mid-summer. 

"It's not just down a little -- it's down a lot," said &lt;a href="w%3AMacomb%20County%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Macomb County&lt;/a&gt; resident, Jim Doran who resides in the township of Harrison. 

"It's not a pretty sight, and it smells," added Doran.

Shipping companies are reporting that at least 200-500 tons of cargo will not be able to be shipped in the lakes if the levels continue to drop. Freighters will lose the ability to ship at least 270 tons of cargo for every one inch of water that is lost.

"We're down 200 to 500 tons per trip, compared to last year," said Nekvasil.

<h1>Ugandan ceasefire takes effect</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ugandan%20ceasefire%20takes%20effect&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A twenty year war between the &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;n government and the rebel &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALord%27s%20Resistance%20Army"&gt;Lord's Resistance Army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; entered a new stage today as both sides initiated a ceasefire agreement. 

At 0600 hours local time (0300 GMT) government soldiers returned to their barracks and rebel guns fell silent after a peace deal was signed on Saturday.

Under the deal, rebel forces, under leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Kony"&gt;Joseph Kony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , will have 3 weeks to assemble at select locations in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Sudan"&gt;southern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; where they will escorted in safety by regional government troops. Kony and the LRA leadership are reportedly on the &lt;a href="Chad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; border and are planning on flying to the assembly locations. 

Kony's second in command, General Otti appeared on radio in Gulu on Sunday night to address his troops declaring the ceasefire and ordering them to lay down their weapons.

For their part, the Ugandan government has promised to respect the ceasefire and not attack the rebel troops as they assemble. 

An army spokesperson, Major Felix Kulaije, announced today that "The cessation of hostilities is in effect now and involves the Ugandan army halting their search-and-destroy operations."

State Minister for Defence Ruth Nankabirwa told journalists "we are now in a period of silence... I pray that none of the sides violate the cessation of hostilities agreement." 

Once rebel troops have been gathered under the protective wing of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUgandan%20Peoples%27%20Defence%20Force"&gt;Ugandan Peoples' Defence Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , extensive peace talks are due to begin. Key issues to be discussed will likely be the return of thousands of children kidnapped by the Lord's Resistance Army for use as child soldiers, and Kony's status as a wanted war criminal. The Ugandan government surprised many outsiders by promising to protect the LRA leader in return for negotiations despite being wanted by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

A modest wooden hotel in &lt;a href="Juba%2C%20Sudan"&gt;Juba&lt;/a&gt; was the scene of this weekend's landmark talks which secured the ceasefire to end two decades of conflict. The Ugandan government has been fighting the Lord's Resistance Army since the 1980s, in a war that has caught up over 20,000 children, many becoming child soldiers or sex slaves for the LRA. 

With Ugandan President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYoweri%20Museveni"&gt;Yoweri Museveni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; warning that hostilities would begin again if talks collapsed, the international community will be following the upcoming talks very closely.

Last night the top four of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Idol"&gt;Canadian Idol&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ performed. &lt;a href="w%3ATyler%20Lewis"&gt;Tyler Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChad%20Doucette"&gt;Chad Doucette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Sharpe"&gt;Craig Sharpe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AEva%20Avila"&gt;Eva Avila&lt;/a&gt; sang songs that were picked by the judges. They each performed twice in one hour. They are now awaiting Canadas vote for who should be eliminated.

When the show started the host had a quick chat with the judges:

"When we made the selections, we thought let's make them look good and at the same time challenge them," said Idol judge &lt;a href="w%3AJake%20Gold"&gt;Jake Gold&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the show.

"I was all ready to go 'he shoots, he scores,' but you came out really flat in the third period," said Idol judge &lt;a href="w%3AZack%20Werner"&gt;Zack Werner&lt;/a&gt; when he was judging Tyler Lewis' first performance of the night.

The results show will be featuring a special guest performance from last year's Top 2 competitor, &lt;a href="w%3ARex%20Goudie"&gt;Rex Goudie&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABurlington%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Burlington, Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;.

Legislation concerning civil officials who refuse to perform same-sex marriages has been filibustered in the province of &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;. 

18 months ago, in response to federal legislation tabled by then Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt;, the conservative premier of Alberta, &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Klein"&gt;Ralph Klein&lt;/a&gt;, promised that he would draft legislation to protect the "traditional" definition of marriage (that of one man to one woman). Klein had threatened to use the constitution's notwithstanding clause to veto the federal legislation in the province. 

The original civil marriage bill, tabled under the Liberal minority government, eventually received approval, including the support of the &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Quebecois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, the conservative government of Klein threatened to draft counter-legislation following the passage of the federal legislation into law, however no such legislation ever materialized, prompting Foothills-Rocky View Tory MLA &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Morton"&gt;Ted Morton&lt;/a&gt; to draft his own legislation and introduce the bill as a &lt;a href="w%3Abackbencher"&gt;backbencher&lt;/a&gt;. 

In order for the bill to be debated again, the provincial legislature would have to sit again before the Autumn, which it is not scheduled to do.

As public opinion wavers over &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada's&lt;/a&gt; involvement in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, Defence minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20O%27Connor"&gt;Gordon O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; made an appearance to shore up support among the troops for the Afghan mission.

O'Connor disembarked a Canadian Forces &lt;a href="w%3AC-130%20Hercules"&gt;Hercules C-130&lt;/a&gt; transport plane dressed in full desert battle fatigues and boots, and was greeted by Lieut.-Gen. &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Gauthier"&gt;Michel Gauthier&lt;/a&gt; at Canada's base on Kandahar airfield. "I'm here on this visit to get three perspectives - One is what's happening on the ground here. The other in Kabul for what's happening on the national level, and then I'm going to Pakistan for the international perspective."

The minister's visit comes as a surge of violence is sweeping across southern Afghanistan. Military casualties have run high since August 3rd, claiming the lives of eight Canadian troops, one British soldier and many more civilians. Much of the violence comes at the hands of suicide bomb attacks against resupply convoys amid growing frustration at the presence of foreign troops in Afghan territory. In the hours before O'Connor's arrival another suicide bomber targeted a Canadian convoy, killing two civilians and injuring a third.

Military officials took the opportunity to highlight concerns for the troops on the ground who are complaining of poor equipment, vehicles and accommodation.

Former US President &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt; has accused British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; of contributing to the crisis in Iraq through lack of leadership and subservience to current US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

"I have been surprised and extremely disappointed by Tony Blair's behaviour," said Carter in an interview with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

"I think that more than any other person in the world the Prime Minister could have had a moderating influence on Washington - and he has not. I really thought that Tony Blair, who I know personally to some degree, would be a constraint on President Bush's policies towards Iraq."

Carter also said the &lt;a href="w%3Ainvasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; had strengthened al-Qaeda and undermined the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terror"&gt;war on terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. 

"In many countries where I meet with leaders and private citizens there is an equating of American policy with Great Britain - with Great Britain obviously playing the lesser role."

"We now have a situation where America is so unpopular overseas that even in countries like Egypt and Jordan our approval ratings are less than five per cent. It's a shameful and pitiful state of affairs and I hold your British Prime Minister to be substantially responsible for being so compliant and subservient," said Carter, 81.

&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Diwaniyah"&gt;Diwaniya, Iraq&lt;/a&gt;— At least 27 people are dead after a disused pipeline exploded today. Unconfirmed reports have already placed the count as high as 74. Fuel shortages are common in Iraq, even though the country is endowed with large reserves of petroleum. According to reports, locals cut holes in the unused pipeline to syphon fuel, igniting fumes inside the pipeline. Many of the survivors were left with severe injuries, often with burns over 75% of their bodies. The blast comes after fierce fighting yesterday in Diwaniya between Iraqi government forces and the local Mehdi Militia that claimed 40 lives. The Mehdi Militia are loyal to the cleric Moqtada Sadr. 

In Baghdad, 20 people were found shot to death. Investigators said the victims had been bound, and showed signs of torture. The bodies were dumped behind a Shia mosque, heightening tensions between Iraq's cultural factions. As sectarian killings continue, the divide between the Shia and Sunnis is driven deeper. Armed groups now patrol neighbourhoods that at one time coexisted peacefully. The groups are often comprised of local militias, or simply by vigilantes bent on protecting their territory. In spite of the violence, some economy continues to survive. "Shoula property prices have risen a lot, because it is protected by the Mehdi Army and is safe," said Ahmad Abdel Karim,a Shia police officer and member of the Mehdi Militia, "Sunni families left on their own. No one threatened them. They left so that the bombs fall only on Shias. The Americans come here with the National Guard. They try to confiscate weapons from the Mehdi Army so that this area falls to the terrorists."

On Tuesday, two Shia militia members were killed by insurgents in the city of Baquba.

On the other side of the fence a small Sunni enclave exists, guarded by equally dedicated Sunni community members. "My life is basically between the house and guarding the mosque. You can't go anywhere else. If you go down that street, it's almost guaranteed a car will stop, pick you up, and you'll disappear." - Mohamed Reyad, a former plumber. Reyad said that weapons were provided by his "Sunni brothers", which included a group of scholars.
The latest wave of violence comes as US and Iraqi government forces have intensified efforts to secure Baghdad against growing violence and division among Iraqis.

A &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; trapeze artist, Vitaly Kharapavitski, 26, performing at a circus in &lt;a href="w%3AScariff%2C%20Ireland"&gt;Scariff, Ireland&lt;/a&gt; has died after a cage attached to a hot air balloon crushed the performer. His wife, Sasha, 24, who was also performing at the time, was injured, breaking her arm. Both were dressed in clown suits.

At least 100 people were attending the circus and watched the acrobat fall. Most of the attendees were children.

According to witnesses, the balloon caught fire and the cage fell on top of the acrobat, crushing his head.

Spectators of the circus were asked to leave the area while the incident was being investigated. Tony Kenneally, a &lt;a href="w%3AGarda"&gt;Garda&lt;/a&gt; Superintendent said that the incident is being treated as an accident.

"We had to discharge the audience because we knew it was quite serious," said spokespeople for the Royal Russian Circus.

Some of the attendees thought the fall was part of the performance.

Yesterday &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; officers were showcasing their new &lt;a href="w%3ATaser"&gt;tasers&lt;/a&gt;, model X26, and at the same time, trialling them on their own officers. This Friday 180 police officers, between &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, will start trialling them for 12 months.

Policeman, Constable Mike Smith, who had the new taser trialled on him said, "My whole body was completely incapacitated from my feet to my head. My legs felt like concrete. I wouldn't do it again."

The police will not carry the tasers with them everywhere but only to call outs where they can expect violent encounters.

The tasers will replace pepper spray, as it is more effective and the offender is able to recover quicker. Only the armed offenders squad carry guns.

The particular model the police will use is the X26 model. This model delivers 50,000 volts of electricity but counters this high voltage with a very low amperage of .0036 amps, police say that this is safe. The taser works by firing two metal spurs at the target and transmits a charge of five seconds which paralyses the victim long enough to get the offender in handcuffs. The taser has a range of six metres, and is able to penetrate through both skin and clothes.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Green%20Party"&gt;New Zealand Green Party&lt;/a&gt; and civil rights lawyers are protesting against the use of tasers, saying that "It risks lives and could be misused."

The superintendent, John Rivers, said that a report that had been commissioned after Steve Wallace was fatally shot in 2001 said that tasers were "A less lethal option."

John Rivers said Tuesday, "The use of tasers was in the interest of public safety. He said they give police more tactical options when dealing with violent offenders. Very [sic] person who is shot with a taser gun during the trial will receive an examination by a doctor afterwards. British research had found that of the 400 times police there had drawn the weapon at least 60 per cent have resulted with the police not firing the device." 

Most injuries were not caused by the taser itself but by the falling to the ground that is caused by the taser, according to an independent medical research group run by Peter Robinson. "No coroner or medical officer has found a situation where the Taser was the cause of death," Robinson said.

Following confirmation by &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; caretaker cabinet, a proposal to create a 77th province to honour the king's 80th birthday, will be the subject of a feasibility study.

King &lt;a href="w%3ABhumibol%20Adulyadej"&gt;Bhumibol Adulyadej's&lt;/a&gt; 80th birthday next year follows on from the 60th anniversary of his accession to the throne earlier this year. The as-yet unnamed new province would likely consist of three districts and one sub-district surrounding the Klaikangvol Palace in Hua Hin. In addition to Hua Hin, Pran Buri and Sam Roi Yot districts from &lt;a href="w%3APrachuap%20Khiri%20Khan%20Province"&gt;Prachuap Khiri Khan Province&lt;/a&gt; and Cha-am from &lt;a href="w%3APhetchaburi%20Province"&gt;Phetchaburi&lt;/a&gt; would make up the new province.

Currently the country consists of 75 provinces, it is expected that the 76th province will be around the Suvarnabhumi International Airport which opens in September 2006.

Tuesday, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; was filming a cameo appearance on the popular &lt;a href="w%3Asitcom"&gt;sitcom&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACorner%20Gas"&gt;Corner Gas&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. ♡❤Corner Gas♡❤ is filmed about 40 km south of Regina in the tiny farming community of Rouleau.

Harper was filmed in a scene where he was surrounded by a large group of actors playing reporters and photographers. After completing the scene, he got back into his car and a motorcade left the town, which is called Dog River on the show.

"We can't say much about cameo appearances, because they're supposed to be a surprise for the viewers, but yes, there was press scrum," ♡❤Corner Gas♡❤ executive producer Virginia Thompson said. "That's all I can reveal." "It works well for the show, actually ... We were told by the Prime Minister's Office that he had a sense of humour, but we thought we would wait and see and sure enough, yeah, he delivered."

When &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the government, he had a cameo on the show last season. Saskatchewan Premier &lt;a href="w%3ALorne%20Calvert"&gt;Lorne Calvert&lt;/a&gt; has also made an appearance on the show last season.

"The prime minister was not paid for his appearance and had other reasons for coming to Saskatchewan beyond being part of the show", said Thompson.

Reporters were kept back and not allowed to see how he performed in front of the cameras.

Harper waved goodbye to small town of Rouleau while travelling down Highway 39 away from the set after spending about 1 1/2 hours there. After, Harper planned to meet with members of his Saskatchewan caucus at a barbeque at Sherwood Forest Country Club Tuesday night. Harper is scheduled to tour the &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;RCMP&lt;/a&gt; training academy in Regina today.

The episode featuring Harper will air sometime next spring.

East Timorese rebel leader &lt;a href="w%3AAlfredo%20Reinado"&gt;Alfredo Reinado&lt;/a&gt; and other 56 inmates escaped last night from &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt;'s mail jail.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; forces initiated a massive manhunt for the escapees, which with their escape, created a new crisis for international security forces in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;. Australian &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Special%20Air%20Service%20Regiment"&gt;SAS&lt;/a&gt; troopers using &lt;a href="w%3AUH-60%20Black%20Hawk"&gt;Black Hawk helicopters&lt;/a&gt; and night-vision goggles were involved in the search.

&lt;a href="w%3APortuguese%20Republican%20National%20Guard"&gt;GNR&lt;/a&gt;'s liaison officer, Lieutenant Cabrita told the Portuguese Rádio Renascença news agency that the prisoners took advantage of the relieve of guard to escape. "The evasion happened during the relieve of the forces that were serving in the jail's security, having the escapees used vehicles for their escape".

Later Australian police liaison officers confirmed the escape of the rebel leader. "It is understood 57 prisoners are currently unaccounted for, one of those being Mr Alfredo Reinado," an Australian police spokesman said.

Alfredo Reinado is a former East Timorese Army officer who deserted and led a rebel group during the unrest in May, being blamed for some of the country's violence during the security crisis.
Him and other 14 soldiers of his rebel group were arrested on July by Australian troops for illegal possession of firearms after an GNR patrol found them with pistols, hundreds of ammunition and grenades in a house during a routine operation.

Of the other 56 prisoners unaccounted for, 16 are believed to be former Timorese police and soldiers accused of crimes committed during East Timor's security crisis, and five prisoners convicted for homicide.

According to Becora's prison warden Carlos Sarmento, the inmates had escaped by breaking down several walls on the prison's east wing.

The East Timorese Justice Minister, Domingos Sarmento, blamed the international security forces for the jailbreak and told the Lusa news agency that the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; forces in charge of the security of the prison's exterior left the prison without informing the Timorese government.

"There was an agreement in which the forces of New Zealand would be in charge of the outside security of the prison, but about a week ago they left the location and didn't inform us", Domingos Sarmento said.

Domingos Sarmento said that he contacted the Australian-led forces so that the security outside the prison could be restored, but was told that the forces' removal from the prison were due to the necessity of deploying troops in other points of the city.

The Minister recognized that the absence of police and military forces on the prison's outside and the fact that the guard were unarmed contributed to facilitate the escape of the prisoners. Also recognizing that the use of weapons by the guards would improve the security in the jail, he noticed that the internal regulation doesn't allow that use.

Last night was the eliminations for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Idol"&gt;Canadian Idol&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡s top 4. &lt;a href="w%3AChad%20Doucette"&gt;Chad Doucette&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANova%20Scotia"&gt;Chezzetcook, Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; was voted off. The show started with the current top 4 singing together on stage.
&lt;a href="w%3ARex%20Goudie"&gt;Rex Goudie&lt;/a&gt; performed live on the ♡❤Canadian Idol♡❤ stage last night. Goudie performed his hit single "Run". Host Ben Mulroney presented Goudie, the 2005 ♡❤Canadian Idol♡❤ runner-up, with a Platinum Record on behalf of &lt;a href="w%3ABMG%20Music%20Canada"&gt;Sony BMG Music (Canada) Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and ♡❤Canadian Idol♡❤ for his hit CD Under The Lights.

&lt;a href="w%3AEva%20Avila"&gt;Eva Avila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Sharpe"&gt;Craig Sharpe&lt;/a&gt; were safe and Chad Doucette was called to centre stage with &lt;a href="w%3ATyler%20Lewis"&gt;Tyler Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. After the commercial break the results were announced.

After the results were revealed, Mulroney thanked Doucette: "I am so glad you decided to come back and audition this year," he said. "If there is anything you have shown us in your run to Top 4 is how memorable you are."

"I don't know if I was as confident in what I wanted to do before I started this competition, but now I am absolutely positive I want to be a musician," Doucette said. "You guys showed me that it's alright to be unique. Thank you!"

"You've got a unique voice, which means you have to sing your own words," &lt;a href="w%3AJake%20Gold"&gt;Jake Gold&lt;/a&gt; advised him after the results were announced. "Keep doing what you're doing and write songs."

Next week the top 3 will go to New York to talk with &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Bennett"&gt;Tony Bennett&lt;/a&gt;.

This week ♡❤Canadian Idol♡❤ got a record of 4.3 million votes. "When the competition is this good and only four singers are left, each week is anybody's game", said Mulroney.

<h1>Iraqi activist forced to change t-shirt with Arabic peace slogan</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iraqi%20activist%20forced%20to%20change%20t-shirt%20with%20Arabic%20peace%20slogan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Raed Jarrar, an &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; peace activist who lives in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, was forced to change his T-Shirt, which bore an Arabic slogan, because it was found "offensive".

The incident took place in JFK airport in New York. The activist Jarrar reported in his blog ♡❤RaedInTheMiddle♡❤ that he had checked-in his bags and was issued a boarding pass. After waiting near the gate to board his &lt;a href="w%3AJetBlue%20Airways"&gt;jetBlue airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight, and after having to gone through a secondary search, two officials approached him.

"People are feeling offended because of your t-shirt," Raed reported that one of the men said to him. The writings on the T-Shirt said in both Arabic and English: "We will not be silent". 

Raed asked why this has offended anyone, and insisted his right to freedom of expression was violated.

According to Jarrar, one of the inspectors said, "You can't wear a T-shirt with Arabic script and come to an airport. It is like wearing a t-shirt that reads 'I am a robber' and going to a bank". The airport official, unable to read Arabic, was unyielding to protests by Jarrar that the English language version of the Arabic was accurate, and suggested he wear the shirt inside out. 

"Many people called and complained about your t-shirt. Jetblue customers were calling before you reached the checkpoint, and customers called when you were waiting here in the boarding area", Jarrar was told after he complained.
One employee from JetBlue offered to buy Jarrar a T-shirt to replace the one he was wearing, since the activist had none other after his bags were checked. Refusing at first, he agreed to wear one with "New York" written on it. 

The officer on the scene commented that it need not have gone from one extreme to the other: wearing a T-Shirt with an Arabic peace slogan on it, to wearing one with 'New York'. There is no reason to hate New York if you are an Arab speaking peace activist, according to Jarrar.

"I feel very sad that my personal freedom was taken away like this. I grew up under authoritarian governments in the Middle East, and one of the reasons I chose to move to the U.S. was that I don't want an officer to make me change my t-shirt. I will pursue this incident today through a constitutional rights organization, and I am sure we will meet soon," Raed said.

He was issued another boarding pass, with a different seat at the back of the plane.

JetBlue said it was investigating the incident but a spokeswoman said: "We're not clear exactly what happened." The spokeswoman also said the airline does not forbid Arabic T-shirts, but that it does take into account the concerns of its passengers. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican-Arab%20Anti-discrimination%20Committee"&gt;American-Arab Anti-discrimination Committee&lt;/a&gt; said the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation"&gt;US Transportation Department&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ATransportation%20Security%20Administration"&gt;Transportation Security Administration&lt;/a&gt; were also investigating the incident after the committee lodged complaints on behalf of Jarrar. 

"We Will Not Be Silent" is a slogan adopted by opponents of the war in Iraq and other conflicts in the Middle East.

It is said to derive from the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Rose"&gt;White Rose&lt;/a&gt; dissident group which opposed Nazi rule in Germany.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20State%20Department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; has called for sanctions against &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and has also said that Iran has not indicated to the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; that they intend to follow through with halting their &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20program%20of%20Iran"&gt;nuclear program&lt;/a&gt;. 

"We would expect that the parties would immediately begin formal discussions about a resolution that would call for sanctions," said spokesman for the State Dapartment, &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McCormack"&gt;Sean McCormack&lt;/a&gt;.

"[Sanctions] have been our intention for some months, it remains our intention, it'll be our intention on September the first if the Iranians don't comply with the resolution," said &lt;a href="John%20R.%20Bolton"&gt;John R. Bolton&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. embassador to the United Nations.

Today, the ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ reported that the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; will report to the U.N. tomorrow that Iran is still enriching Uranium despite a U.N. resolution calling for the country to halt its nuclear program.

The &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing however, has called for a "diplomatic resolution" to Iran's nuclear program.

Iran's President, &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; said that sanctions will not stop Iran from their "lofty goals of progress." He also said that &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; should "be independent [from the U.S.] in decision-making and to settle problems through negotiations" in regards to Iran's nuclear program.

The deadline set by the U.N. is set to expire on August 31.

&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Ernesto%20%282006%29"&gt;Tropical Storm Ernesto&lt;/a&gt; has weakened over &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. It is expected to make another landfall on the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; coast as a tropical storm. Ernesto came ashore early this morning in the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Keys"&gt;Florida Keys&lt;/a&gt; with less intensity than expected by forecasters. The storm had weakened to a tropical depression as it moved up the Florida peninsula. It is expected to go to &lt;a href="w%3ACharleston%2C%20South%20Carolina"&gt;Charleston, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Tropical storm watches have been issued for &lt;a href="w%3ASavannah%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Savannah, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="w%3AMorehead%20City%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Morehead City, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. 

At 5 p.m. local time (2100 GMT), Ernesto's sustained winds were about 35 mph (56 kph), as stated by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt;. The center of the system was still over Florida, about 55 miles (90 km) south-southwest of &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%2C%20Florida"&gt;Cape Canaveral&lt;/a&gt;.

Forecasters say Ernesto could regain tropical storm status with peak winds exceeding 40 miles (64 kilometers) an hour.

"Ernesto has the potential to regain tropical storm strength on Thursday over the Atlantic," the hurricane center said.

Two deaths were reported in separate wrecks in Florida.

Scientists using &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASwift%20Gamma-Ray%20Burst%20Mission"&gt;Swift Satellite&lt;/a&gt; and other telescopes have observed a &lt;a href="w%3Asupernova"&gt;supernova&lt;/a&gt; in near real time occurring in the constellation of &lt;a href="w%3AAries"&gt;Aries&lt;/a&gt;. The explosion is said to be the most powerful explosion known to scientists, which consists of a gamma-ray burst or an x-ray blast. Scientists say that bursts signal the beginning of a star's death.

Swift first detected the explosion on February 18 (it was given a designation &lt;a href="w%3AGRB%20060218"&gt;GRB 060218&lt;/a&gt;), which allowed telescopes and satellites to watch the event as it happened. The blast lasted for more than 2,000 seconds (33 minutes).

"This is totally new and unexpected. This is the type of unscripted event in our nearby universe that we hoped Swift could catch," said Neil Gehrels, Swift principal investigator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

"Those observations capture the time when the star collapsed, ejected its outer envelope and most of its mass and left a compact remnant behind. And we think that compact remnant is a neutron star," said an author writing for journal ♡❤Nature♡❤, where the report will be published on Thursday.

Scientists are also planning on using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory in an attempt to get more images of the event.

The star is at least 440 million light years from Earth. The group of scientists was led by Sergio Campana of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics and Alicia Soderberg, a graduate student at Caltech in Pasadena, California.

Swift was launched in November of 2004.

Peter William Raeburn Hunter, a 61-year-old stock agent from &lt;a href="w%3AHastings%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Hastings, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, died early yesterday morning from a rampaging friesian bull. The bull first flung recently married Hunter in the air and then gored him at Stortford Lodge saleyards in Hastings.

Hunter had tried to escape into another yard but the bull rammed him against the yard rails. He then fell to the ground but the bull didn't stop attacking him until another agent came to his aid and hit the animal on the nose with a stick.

Bruce Campbell, yards manager, said: "The agent was behind an alleyway gate which the bull lifted off its hinges. It was awful and has given us all a real shake-up."

Hunter was then transported to &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20hospitals%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Hawke's Bay hospital&lt;/a&gt; but died before he got to the hospital.

The bull has now been shipped to &lt;a href="w%3APalmerston%20North"&gt;Palmerston North&lt;/a&gt; on a truck to be slaughtered after the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; declined the request to shoot the bull dead at the lodge. Acting Sergeant Andy Clinton said: "It calmed down and they had no problems loading it on the truck."

It was the first death at the lodge in the 103 years that it has been operating.

Friesian bulls are not normally dangerous. 

"Peter was very much a valued member of the local team," Elders Livestock, managing director, Stuart Chapman said. "It's a freak accident, an absolute tragedy."

A Russian-made aircraft carrying sophisticated arms and ammunition to Nepal has been detained in &lt;a href="w%3AAhmedabad"&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt;. The ♡❤Jana Astha♡❤ reported that the plane's cargo, which was comprised of rifles, ammunition and anti-aircraft guns, was probably made in Israel. The lack of documents regarding the cargo made Indian authorities suspicious, prompting them to order the aeroplane to land after it entered Indian airspace. The plane, headed for &lt;a href="w%3AKathmandu"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt; has been on the tarmac at the &lt;a href="w%3ASardar%20Vallabhbhai%20Patel%20International%20Airport"&gt;Sardar Patel International Airport&lt;/a&gt; for six days now.

According to reports, the consignment is part of a deal struck between Nepal and the manufacturer of the arms, at a time when both &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; (the largest supplier of arms to Nepal) and the U.S have suspended military dealings with the &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Gyanendra"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; to show their displeasure at his attempts to suppress democracy in his country. India has contacted the Nepalese embassy in New Delhi about this matter

India has long been supplying military equipment to its Himalayan neighbour, that too at a 70% subsidy. Many Nepalese governments however, failed to make payments, thereby resulting in a credit amount of several million &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Rupee"&gt;rupees&lt;/a&gt;. India waived the dues as a goodwill gesture when Nepal's PM Girija Prasad Koirala visited New Delhi this June.

On September 1, controversial new &lt;a href="w%3Aorgan%20donor"&gt;organ donor&lt;/a&gt; laws, changes to the Human Tissue Act, come in to effect. The radical changes now mean relatives of organ donor card carriers will no longer be able to overturn their wishes. Under the current system 1 in 10 of all possible organ donations are stopped by the families of the deceased.

The new act (proposed in 2004) replaces the original Human Tissue Act 1961 and the &lt;a href="w%3AAnatomy%20Act"&gt;Anatomy Act&lt;/a&gt; 1984. 

Chris Rudge (MD of UK transplant) said, "Many more people could receive a life-saving transplant with the donors' wishes being given priority." He indicated that the new legislation could mean 400 extra donors a year translating to 1,200 more transplant operations (an average of 3 organs are used per donor).

The changes, which apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland, are the result of a series of recent scandals. The Isaacs Report, published 2003, was held after Elaine Issacs discovered (in 2000) her husbands brain was passed on to Manchester University for research after his &lt;a href="w%3Apost-mortem"&gt;post-mortem&lt;/a&gt;, the report concluded that ethical considerations had been sidelined and that the Human Tissues Act (in its then form) was not followed. A further scandal involved &lt;a href="w%3AAlder%20Hey%20hospital"&gt;Alder Hey hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where it was discovered that children's organs were removed without permission over a period of 7 years.

The new laws extend beyond Organ donation also covering things like ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; theft♡❤ (a new offence involving the taking and testing of genetic material without consent) or the illegal storage of human tissue (with the penalty of up to 3 years in jail).

The act will modify the operation of the &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Tissue%20Authority"&gt;Human Tissue Authority&lt;/a&gt; (HTA); a relatively new body which will regulate these new laws as well as issuing licenses to organisations and facilities who perform post-mortems or who test, store or display human materials. The HTA said they expected to hand out around 500 licenses. Licensing is required from the start of the act (September 1) although storage of human tissue for therapeutic use will not be licensed till April 2007.

The new laws mean consent must be given for any kind of storage or research to be carried out. Adrian McNeil (Chief executive) said, "Consent is the underlying principle on which this act is based. This is an important milestone for the HTA, and for patients, the families and professionals." 

Other organisations welcomed the act, Professor Alex Markham of &lt;a href="w%3ACancer%20Research%20UK"&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt; said that "Cancer Research UK is hopeful that this new regulatory framework will give researchers the support they need to carry out their work."

However some have criticised the changes, saying they are worried that researchers will not be able to cope with the additional administration and that tissue would be even harder to obtain for research.

<h1>Hard shoulder gets the soft treatment on British motorways</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hard%20shoulder%20gets%20the%20soft%20treatment%20on%20British%20motorways&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Some of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s most heavily congested &lt;a href="w%3Amotorway"&gt;motorway&lt;/a&gt;s are to have their &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20shoulder"&gt;hard shoulders&lt;/a&gt; converted into new lanes during busy periods, if a pilot scheme proves successful. 

The idea is to create an extra lane at a fraction of the cost of widening the roads. The hard shoulders can be converted in less than 2 years as opposed to the 10 needed to add a new lane. A similar scheme has been running in the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; for over 10 years and has resulted in a decline in accidents.

The pilot scheme will be in operation on an 11 mile (17 km) strip of the &lt;a href="w%3AM42%20motorway"&gt;M42&lt;/a&gt; (south-east of &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;) from September, and may be extended to include parts of the &lt;a href="w%3AM5%20motorway"&gt;M5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AM6%20motorway"&gt;M6&lt;/a&gt;. The pilot project has cost approximately £100 million as opposed to 5 times that amount estimated cost for adding a new lane.

The conversion involves building lightweight gantries across the motorways to control the use of the new 'lanes'. Sensors will detect when congestion is forming and inform a control centre. Digital signs on the gantries will then notify drivers they may use the hard shoulder. New refuge laybys, complete with emergency telephones, will also be built at 500 m intervals for broken down vehicles to stop. &lt;a href="w%3ACCTV"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt; cameras will be added to the gantries to help spot stopped vehicles.

Whilst the hard shoulder is in use, speed limits will be reduced to 50 miles per hour (80 km/h), a reduced speed is reported by the Times to improve journey times in busy periods as it deters lane hopping.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHighways%20Agency"&gt;Highways Agency&lt;/a&gt;, who are responsible for the new idea, said: "We get a big increase in capacity for a fifth of the cost and there is no environmental penalty because we do not have to extend the land boundaries of the motorway. It's all about making best use of the available space."

However there has been criticism of the scheme, with some saying that the loss of the hard shoulder will hinder emergency services - who use the hard shoulder to reach accidents on motorways. In 2005, ambulance bosses criticised drivers using the hard shoulder when paramedics were delayed in reaching an accident on the A127 in &lt;a href="w%3AEssex"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;. There are fears that accidents during busy period will be completely inaccessible once the hard shoulders are used in this way.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAA%20Motoring%20Trust"&gt;AA Motoring Trust&lt;/a&gt; also expressed concerns, saying that the new scheme may confuse drivers and that a more consistent approach is needed (on other motorways the Highways agency is adding in the extra lanes).

Produced by &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20Atlantis"&gt;Alliance Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;, the tour will run from September 9 to October 14.

The tour will feature part of Jim's lunar village, an inflated replica of his home on Moona Luna. Also at the events will be a colouring activity, an area to play with the recently launched &lt;a href="w%3AFisher-Price"&gt;Fisher-Price&lt;/a&gt; toys, and have their photo taken with a costumed character version of Jim, and cut-out characters of the rest of the cast.

The tour coincides with the launch of Lunar Jim toys by this month. Canadians can watch the series on &lt;a href="w%3ACBC"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt; and Société Radio-Canada (SRC), the French version of CBC.

A &lt;a href="w%3AScugog%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Scugog Township&lt;/a&gt; councillor Lynn Philip Hodgson lowered the town hall flag to half mast following the death of an Edmonton-based medic, Cpl. Andrew James Eykelenboom, who was killed in a fiery suicide attack south of Kandahar.

It is part of a unionized municipal employee's contract to raise and lower the Canadian flag on township properties, a role supposedly written into &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Union%20of%20Public%20Employees"&gt;CUPE&lt;/a&gt; Local 1785-01's collective agreement with the municipality northeast of &lt;a href="w%3AWhitby%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Whitby, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

"I can't talk for the union, but I think on this one, maybe they could have passed," &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Legion"&gt;Royal Canadian Legion&lt;/a&gt; branch 419 president Lucy Wilson said. 

The municipal office in &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Perry%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Port Perry, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; was closed and no union employees were on site.

"It only takes two minutes to lower a flag," said Hodgson.

His position as a town councillor is restricting him from commenting further until the union is dealt with.

Norwegian Police have said that the stolen &lt;a href="w%3AEdvard%20Munch"&gt;Edvard Munch's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Scream"&gt;The Scream&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMadonna%20%28Edvard%20Munch%29"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ masterpiece paintings which were stolen by art thieves have been found.

According to officers, the two paintings were recovered in "police action". "We are 100% certain they are the originals. The damage was much less than feared," police said. 

In a press conference in Oslo, Norway, police chief Iver Stensrud said: "For two years and nine days we have been hunting systematically for these pictures and now we've found them." 

He also added that police suspect the paintings had remained in Norway since they were taken. "We feel we have been hot on the trail of the paintings the whole time, but it has taken time," he said. 

They were stolen by art thieves in August 2004 from the &lt;a href="w%3AMunch%20Museum"&gt;Munch Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;. Bjoern Hoen, 37, Petter Tharaldsen, 37, and Petter Rosenvinge, 34, were found guilty of stealing the paintings after a trial this May. 

♡❤The Scream♡❤ was completed in 1893. It is regarded by many as being one of Munch's most important pieces of work, and is his most recognizable piece amongst the general public. 

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Toska"&gt;David Toska&lt;/a&gt;, the alleged mastermind of the "&lt;a href="w%3ANOKAS%20robbery"&gt;NOKAS robbery&lt;/a&gt;" was rumoured to have known the whereabouts of the paintings, and they may now have been recovered as a result of some sort of collaboration between him and Norwegian prosecutors. This might result in an improvement of Toska's public image (he's currently sentenced to 20+ years of prison time, after planning and executing a huge bank heist that led to the unfortunate death of a highly respected police officer.).

<h1>Portuguese troops leave for Lebanon in October</h1>

&lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;'s Superior Council of National Defence (CSDN) decided Wednesday the composition of the countries' participation in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Interim%20Force%20in%20Lebanon"&gt;United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (UNIFIL).

The decision reached by the Superior Council of National Defence yesterday evening will be to send a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20engineer"&gt;Engineering Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with 140 troops as part of its participation in UN's peacekeeping force in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;.

At the end of the Council's meeting CSDN's spokesman, General Goulão de Melo told the journalists that the Portuguese contingent would participate in the "reconstruction of the infrastructures destroyed during the war", adding that the duration of the mission will be established in agreement with the UN's established calendar.

Portugal's Defense Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuno%20Severiano%20Teixeira"&gt;Nuno Severiano Teixeira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said Wednesday night, during a news conference that the Company, based in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Margarida%20da%20Coutada"&gt;Santa Margarida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbrantes"&gt;Abrantes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , will be deployed on October 14, integrating this way what the Minister considers UNIFIL' third generation forces.

"They will be on the ground but they are not a fighting force; they will be working on reconstruction so the risk they face is moderate", Teixeira said.

This confirms what already was foreseen by defence specialists, due the fact that Portugal doesn't have any adequate means available for the Lebanese Theater of Operations, and since countries like Germany and the Netherlands already confirmed the possibility of sending warships, a Portuguese offer of a frigate to patrol the Lebanese coast would become redundant.

Also at the meeting held by the CSDN the reduction of the Portuguese participation in international peacekeeping missions was approved. The Defense Minister responded by saying that Portugal already has manifested the interest in reducing its participation in &lt;a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;. Also the reduction of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFuzileiros%20Navais"&gt;Portuguese Marines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; currently in the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to begin on November.

The Portuguese participation in the UNIFIL is calculated in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 9.3 millions. Portugal will spend this year about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 88.4 millions with all its international missions in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;, Democratic Republic of the Congo, &lt;a href="East%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; says it will launch the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;space shuttle Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, September 6, at 12:29 p.m. Countdown until launch will begin on Sunday.

NASA officials also say that the shuttle, launch pad and facilities at the space center suffered no damage from tropical depression Ernesto.

"We had no damage. Zero. Nada. We fully anticipate being ready to go as early as September 6," said Bruce Buckingham, a spokesman for NASA's Kennedy Space Center.

"There was no water intrusion in any operational areas, and so basically we came through this one unscathed," said Bill Johnson, a spokesman for NASA.

If any delay causes the shuttle not to launch on Wednesday, NASA will attempt another launch two days from Wednesday.

A bolt of lightning struck the launch pad which caused NASA to delay the shuttle launch. No damage was sustained when the bolt hit.

<h1>Clinical study supports pollen tablets as hay fever treatment</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Clinical%20study%20supports%20pollen%20tablets%20as%20hay%20fever%20treatment&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A large &lt;a href="w%3AClinical%20trial"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;a href="w%3APollen"&gt;grass pollen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATablet"&gt;tablets&lt;/a&gt; under the tongue (&lt;a href="w%3ASublingual"&gt;sublingual&lt;/a&gt;) are an effective treatment option for &lt;a href="w%3AHay%20fever"&gt;hay fever&lt;/a&gt; sufferers. The results have been published in this month's edition of the ♡❤Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology♡❤.

Tablets with grass pollen that dissolve quickly under the tongue may provide doctors with a better tool to fight the illness. The patient could take the pills at his own home, and after a while the symptoms may disappear completely and treatment can be ceased. Contrary to the current &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20treatment"&gt;standard treatment&lt;/a&gt;, this therapy targets the &lt;a href="w%3AImmune%20system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; in such a way that it treats the cause and not just the &lt;a href="w%3ASymptom"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.

634 patients from 8 countries participated in the trial. Half received Grazax tablets (a product of &lt;a href="w%3AALK-Abello"&gt;ALK-Abello&lt;/a&gt;, Hørsholm, &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;), the other half &lt;a href="w%3Aplacebo"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; pills. The group receiving treatment showed fewer symptoms during hay fever season and consequently cut down on their medication use. Grazax also caused few and tolerable &lt;a href="w%3AAdverse%20effect%20%28medicine%29"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as itching and swelling in the mouth.

Combined with several earlier papers, these results provide a basis for ALK-Abello to apply for &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; approval of their &lt;a href="w%3Adrug"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt;. It has already been approved in &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, and the company will follow a Mutual Recognition Procedure hoping to get their product in European &lt;a href="w%3Apharmacy"&gt;pharmacies&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2006. The company will continue to fund further inquiries into Grazax and will keep collaborating with scientists from several European countries.

During hay fever season, patients develop a &lt;a href="w%3ARhinitis"&gt;runny nose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANasal%20congestion"&gt;swelling of the mucous membranes of the nose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASneeze"&gt;sneezing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAllergic%20conjunctivitis"&gt;teary eyes&lt;/a&gt;, a condition doctors call &lt;a href="w%3AAllergic%20rhinoconjunctivitis"&gt;allergic rhinoconjunctivitis&lt;/a&gt;. The condition seems to be increasingly frequent, with approximately 10% of the population suffering from grass pollen &lt;a href="w%3AAllergy"&gt;allergy&lt;/a&gt;. First-line treatment includes &lt;a href="w%3AAntihistamine"&gt;antihistaminics&lt;/a&gt; (like &lt;a href="w%3ACetirizine"&gt;cetirizine&lt;/a&gt; or Zyrtec/Zyrlex) and &lt;a href="w%3AGlucocorticoid"&gt;steroid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANasal%20spray"&gt;sprays&lt;/a&gt;, but results are often disappointing.

Long term results have been demonstrated for weekly shots with pollen extracts (a procedure called &lt;a href="w%3ADesensitization"&gt;desensitization&lt;/a&gt;), but too many visits to the doctor make the process troublesome. Also, the patient has to wait some time before leaving the doctor's office, due to the risk of developing a kind of shock state termed &lt;a href="w%3AAnaphylaxis"&gt;anaphylactic shock&lt;/a&gt;.

In southern &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; in the province of Ghazni, the 29-year old &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; pilot Michael Donkervoort died when his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AF-16"&gt;F-16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; fighter jet crashed.

"The plane was flying at a great height when the accident occurred, which means it can be ruled out that the craft was shot down. We therefore assume it was an accident," said the Dutch Defense Ministry.

There has been an investigation launched into the cause of the crash, which was found by a team of rescuers from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The jet was flying with another F-16 when it crashed.

After its previously expected July roll-out date was delayed, &lt;a href="w%3AJatalla"&gt;Jatalla&lt;/a&gt;, has made available a prototype of its search engine. The new search engine appears unique in that relevance rankings are produced only by users themselves, rather than through the use of webcrawlers and page analysis algorithms.

In this way, Jatalla resembles &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADigg"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Adel.icio.us"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; as part of a growing trend of user-controlled content, collective processing, and transparency. This approach may be contrasted with that of search engines in which rankings are produced by a formula that is determined internally, as indicated in a recent &lt;a href="http%3A//news.com.com/Judge%2Bdismisses%2Bsuit%2Bover%2BGoogle%2Branking/2100-1030_3-6094132.html"&gt;court ruling&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Super%20high%20speed%20internet%20launched%20in%20New%20Zealand&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The Prime Minister of New Zealand, &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday unveiled &lt;a href="w%3AKiwi%20Advanced%20Research%20and%20Education%20Network"&gt;Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network&lt;/a&gt; (KAREN). It is super high speed Internet that is capable of transmitting data with speeds of up to ten gigabits per second, 10,000 times faster than the current speed of broadband (1Mbps), and 200,000 times faster than dial-up.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Government"&gt;New Zealand Government&lt;/a&gt; put NZ$43 million ($28.1 million USD) into the Crown company: Research and Education Advanced Network of New Zealand (REANNZ) organization, responsible for the running of KAREN.

KAREN will link universities and research institutions in Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hawkes Bay, Nelson and Rotorua and then to the rest of the world via a TelstraClear fibre optic cable. 

The network will allow geologists/geophysicists to access U.S. data on fault lines, 3D modellers the ability to collaborate on international mapping projects and students will be able to participate in interactive video lectures with experts, anywhere in the world.

The technology so far is limited to just universities and research institutions but Minister for Education Steve Maharey said: "The network will be extended over time to include other institutions, including schools, libraries and museums." It is also limited to just one university in the South Island, it is located in the HIT Lab NZ at the University of Canterbury.

Clark said: "The link is crucial in order to attract and retain scientists, because it allows a greater level of real time collaboration between scientists based in New Zealand, and their colleagues around the world."

The Telecommunications' Users Association of New Zealand chief executive, Ernie Newman, said: "Karen was a 'great initiative' for the science community, and that would have wider benefits for the country."

Dr. Mark Billinhurst, HIT Lab director, said: "The network meant the country was now legitimately part of the international research community."

&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Ernesto%20%282006%29"&gt;Ernesto&lt;/a&gt;, now a &lt;a href="w%3Atropical%20storm"&gt;tropical storm&lt;/a&gt;, made landfall along the coastline of the state of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; near Long Beach in Brunswick County at 11:40 p.m. eastern time.

Reports say the storm was near hurricane strength when it made landfall, but officials are welcoming the rain.

"We need some rain around here - just not all at once," said Jean Evans, a worker for a convienence store in North Carolina's Holden Beach.

The threat of flooding is the main concern, said meteorologists.

"The storm system is moving quite fast, and it's bringing a lot of moisture with it. You always have flash flooding with these types of systems in the mid-Atlantic because of mountainous terrain. People really need to monitor that. You don't want to go through standing water or running water because you don't know how deep it is," said meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, Jennifer Pralgo.

Hurricane watches have been activated in from South Santee River in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; to Cape Lookout in North Carolina, but all watches located south of Santee River are no longer in effect.

There is no word on any serious damage as of yet.

As the storm moved northward into &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, eastern portions of the state received up to as much as a foot rain. Flash flood watches were in effect there, and further up the U.S. coastline, including areas of &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and central &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.

A man has been arrested in connection with the murders of a mother and her three children. The thirty-six year-old was arrested at &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt; this morning. He was leaving an incoming flight from &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%2C%20Thailand"&gt;Bangkok, Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.

It is believed that the man arrested is Rahan Arshad, the husband and father of the victims. He is expected to be taken to &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%2C%20England"&gt;Manchester, England&lt;/a&gt; for questioning later today.

The bodies of thirty-two year-old Uzma Rahan and her three children were found in their home in Cheadle Hulme in Greater Manchester on August 20. Police think the four bodies had been there for up to four weeks.

Police say they were aware that Mr. Rahan had left the country on a Thailand-bound flight about four weeks ago. After the bodies were discovered, officers wanted to trace the whereabouts of Mr. Rahan immediately.

Mrs. Rahan, eleven year-old Adam, eight year-old Abbas and six year-old Henne were found to have serious head injuries, and post-mortem tests concluded that they were beaten to death. 

Three days after the bodies were discovered, a thirty-five year-old woman and a forty year-old man were arrested in connection with the deaths, but they were later released on police bail.

With a very tough defence and an attack of 101 points, the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChampions"&gt;Champions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, beat the national team of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; with a score 101-95, on the semi-final of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIBA%20World%20Championship"&gt;2006 Fiba World Championship&lt;/a&gt; which took place in &lt;a href="w%3ASaitama"&gt;Saitama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.

The Greek team had a very good day - especially &lt;a href="w%3AVassilis%20Spanoulis"&gt;Vassilis Spanoulis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADimitris%20Diamantidis"&gt;Dimitris Diamantidis&lt;/a&gt; - while the zone defence organized by the Greek coach &lt;a href="w%3APanagiotis%20Giannakis"&gt;Panayiotis Giannakis&lt;/a&gt; blocked the &lt;a href="w%3ANBA"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; stars who, despite their good performance, will not take part in the final. The best player of the USA team was &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%20Nuggets"&gt;Denver Nuggets&lt;/a&gt; star, &lt;a href="w%3ACarmello%20Anthony"&gt;Carmello Anthony&lt;/a&gt;, who scored 25 points. The other semi-final of the 2006 Fiba World Championship is the game between &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. 

<h4>Statistics (points and fouls)</h4>

Greece: Papaloukas 8, Diamantidis 12(2), Τsartsaris 3(1), Hadjivrettas 2, Vasilopoulos, Schorchianitis 12, Papadopoulos 8, Kakiouzis 13(1), Fotsis 9(1), Dikoudis 8, Spanoulis 20(3).

<h1>Gene therapy trial for skin cancer cures two terminal patients</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Gene%20therapy%20trial%20for%20skin%20cancer%20cures%20two%20terminal%20patients&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Results of &lt;a href="w%3Agene%20therapy"&gt;gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; trials at the US National Cancer Institute, &lt;a href="w%3ABethesda"&gt;Bethesda&lt;/a&gt; to fight &lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; published online yesterday by the scientific journal ♡❤Science♡❤ show some levels of success. However experts have warned that despite the promise more work is needed for this to become a viable cure.

Dr Stephen Rosenberg, who lead the research team, said "It's important to emphasize this is a highly experimental treatment that's still in the course of development."

The team treated 17 terminal skin cancer patients with modified cells from their immune systems. The technique uses genetically modified &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20blood%20cell"&gt;white blood cell&lt;/a&gt;s (more specifically &lt;a href="w%3AT%20cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt;) to attack and kill the cancer cells. Of the 17 subjects only 2 were cured of the disease (an aggressive form of skin cancer called a &lt;a href="w%3Amelanoma"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; which is usually fatal in advanced stages). Before the treatment, which lasted 18 months, the patients were only expected to live for up to 6 months. The remaining 15 patients were not affected by the treatment.

One of the successful patients was Mark Origer (53) from &lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. He has been fighting cancer since first being diagnosed in 1999. After finding out about the new trial on the internet he applied and, after interviews, was accepted along with 16 other candidates. The treatment removed Origer's melanoma and also shrunk another tumor in his &lt;a href="w%3Aliver"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; - to the extent it could be removed surgically. Doctors confirmed he was free of the disease last week, nearly 2 years after treatment began. A second man (39) was cleared of his cancer which had spread to the &lt;a href="w%3Alung"&gt;lung&lt;/a&gt;s, liver and &lt;a href="w%3Alymph%20node"&gt;lymph node&lt;/a&gt;s. Cancer that progresses to the lymph nodes is usually untreatable and fatal.

T cells can attack and destroy &lt;a href="w%3Abacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and other harmful cells like cancer cells. However cancer cells sometimes reduce the signals on their outer surface by which they are recognised, so the immune system cannot affect them. Gene therapy involves modifying some of a patients T cells to contain a new receptor. (&lt;a href="w%3AReceptor%20%28biochemstry%29"&gt;Receptor&lt;/a&gt;s are what enable the immune cell to identify harmful cells, like those corrupted by &lt;a href="w%3Avirus"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;es. The new receptor is inserted with the use of a &lt;a href="w%3Aviral%20vector"&gt;viral vector&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤i.e.♡❤ a virus made safe to insert the receptor in the cell.

In the trial, T Cells were removed from each patient and modified in the laboratory. Patients underwent chemotherapy to kill most of their current immune system, which was replaced by the &lt;a href="w%3Amutation"&gt;mutated&lt;/a&gt; cells. The modified cells successfully survived after injection into the body - making up 10% of the subject's T cell count during the first 2 months. The team is now looking for ways to enable the cells to survive longer and in greater numbers.

Experts have called this a significant technical advance but warn that more patients need testing and the technique refining before any conclusive results can be drawn. Dr Edel O'Toole, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokesman, said: "I think that the success of this approach in two patients shows promise, however 15 patients did not respond to the treatment suggesting that further work is needed to optimise this approach for all patients, which could take many years."

Rosenberg now hopes to run a new trial with possibly stronger gene therapy treatments, he is currently awaiting &lt;a href="w%3AFDA"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; approval.

Gene therapy was much hyped after it's first successful application in so called "&lt;a href="w%3ABoy%20in%20the%20bubble"&gt;bubble boys&lt;/a&gt;" (patients with &lt;a href="w%3ASevere%20combined%20immunodeficiency"&gt;severe combined immunodeficiency&lt;/a&gt;). After follow-up, these trials were stopped when it was discovered that three of eleven patients in one trial had developed &lt;a href="w%3ALeukemia"&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt;.

Former Deputy Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Armitage"&gt;Richard Armitage&lt;/a&gt; has been revealed as the original source of the information about &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; that made its way into &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Novak"&gt;Robert Novak's&lt;/a&gt; column about the Niger affair. According to sources, Armitage discussed it casually and it is not clear whether he had knowledge of her classified status. 

Plame and her husband &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20C.%20Wilson"&gt;Joseph Wilson&lt;/a&gt; have filed a civil lawsuit alleging that the administration intentionally used the leak to retaliate against him for his criticism of the war on Iraq.

According to ABC News, when Armitage realized he was the source of the leak early on in the affair, he informed the FBI of it.

López is perhaps best known for his role on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASaved%20by%20the%20Bell"&gt;Saved by the Bell&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and currently stars on soap opera ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bold%20and%20the%20Beautiful"&gt;The Bold and the Beautiful&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The &lt;a href="w%3AScugog%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Scugog&lt;/a&gt; flag controversy has now came to an end. The controversy began when councillor Lynn Philip Hodgson lowered the town hall flag out of respect for a fallen Canadian soldier.

Rather than an issue of patriotism, the controversy dealt with union contracts which may have specified that the raising and lowering of flags was a role reserved only for union members.

Liz Drebit, &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Union%20of%20Public%20Employees"&gt;CUPE&lt;/a&gt; Local 1785-01 unit chairman, said she is "extremely upset by the spin that portrayed the grievance as a lack of respect for fallen Canadian soldiers". "My apologies to the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Legion"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Never ever did we have any intent to cause them any distress, and pain, any suffering because of this," she said.

"I thought I was doing the right thing at the time and I still think I did," Hodgson said yesterday.

"The public reaction to the lowering of the flag in a timely manner needs to be addressed," said Drebit.

The union dropped the grievance and said it was all a "misunderstanding."

The Executive Board of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; has agreed on a proposal to increase the quotas of &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, the IMF Managing Director &lt;a href="w%3ARodrigo%20de%20Rato"&gt;Rodrigo de Rato&lt;/a&gt; announced. The increases are part of a program of reforms for the organisation, addressing its governance and its macroeconomic monitoring process. The proposals need final approval at the annual meeting scheduled later this month.

Speaking at a press briefing in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20DC"&gt;Washington DC&lt;/a&gt; on August 31, Mr. de Rato spoke on the current state of the global economy and outlined the reforms, which include a two-phase reshaping of the quota shares - the proposed increases announced today followed by the development for a new formula to come up with increases for a broader range of members. 

<h2>Global economy</h2>
The Director said that the &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20economy"&gt;global economy&lt;/a&gt; has been resilient in the past year, and that growth prospects are still very good. While growth in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is moderating, He said, &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; has been above "most people's expectations", &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; appeared to have "put deflation behind it", China and &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; showed strong growth and many other countries, including in &lt;a href="w%3Asub-Saharan%20Africa"&gt;sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;, are enjoying a continuation of last year's strong growth.

He added that inflation risks were a concern, along with high oil prices that could adversely affect inflation and growth. He also noted the collapse of the &lt;a href="w%3ADoha%20round"&gt;Doha round&lt;/a&gt; of trade talks as a "major setback" and that global economic imbalances "remain large". He called for economies to adjust to high oil prices and governments to reassess policies on subsidies, more labour reforms and better social security nets.

<h3>Asia: Current status and prospects</h3>
Focusing on Asia, Mr. de Rato said that the strong growth is undergoing some "modest rebalancing", with exports slowing in tune with global growth but domestic demand strengthening. He also said that the business environment in Asia needs to become more attractive with more efficient financial integration. 

<h4>&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;</h4>
In line with the Indian central bank, the &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20India"&gt;Reserve Bank of India&lt;/a&gt;'s (RBI) statement earlier this week that the outlook for inflation in the country is "clouded", Mr. de Rato said that some inflationary pressures were building. The RBI had forecast a 5 to 5.5% average inflation or the 2006-2007 fiscal year, in July. 

<h4>&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;</h4>
Mr. de Rato called for China to implement "more forcefully" its foreign exchange regime and "let market forces" determine the value of its currency, the &lt;a href="w%3AYuan"&gt;Yuan&lt;/a&gt;, adding that it was in China's own interest to do so. The United States partly blames the weak value of China's Yuan for its huge &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20deficit"&gt;trade deficit&lt;/a&gt;, which hit a record $805bn (£423bn) last year.

<h2>Institutional reforms</h2>
The proposed two-year reform program, the Medium-Term Strategy, was initiated by members in April. The current proposal, backed by the United States and &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, was approved by an 85 percent majority of the IMF's 24-member board. The proposal will now be presented for final approval at the fund's annual meeting in &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; on 19-20 September.

<h3>Governance</h3>
The change in the Fund quotas, which largely determine the voting powers of members is proposed to be a two-phase affair. The proposed ad-hoc quota increases for the four "clearly under-represented" countries, followed by a second round of adjustments for a broader range of members, based on a yet to be determined quota formula. Mr. de Rato said that the Board will ask the governors to "enhance the voice of low-income members through an increase in basic votes", adding that an effort is underway to increase resources for the offices of African Executive Directors. The quota increase for China, South Korea, Turkey and Mexico together come up to a 1.8% increase, board officials told Reuters.

Mr. de Rato said, "relative quotas and voting shares of our members do not adequately reflect the greatly increased economic weight of major emerging market economies" and, "initial ad hoc increase will only correct about one third of the very heavy underrepresentation of quotas... Many other countries are underrepresented too. These four cases were accepted by the Board"

An IMF member country's quota, the amount of money it contributes, is determined by the &lt;a href="w%3Agross%20domestic%20product"&gt;gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt; (GDP), &lt;a href="w%3ABalance%20of%20payments"&gt;account transactions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20exchange%20reserves"&gt;official reserves&lt;/a&gt; and other economic conditions. The quota also determines the voting stake in the IMF and is reviewed every five years. 

In the new formula for determining quotas, the United States is lobbying for greater emphasis on GDP, with other factors such as exports and reserves counting for much less. The slower-growing European nations have resisted such a change. The ad-hoc increase of quota is also opposed by India.

African countries spoke out against the ad-hoc increase proposals, saying it would mean a delay in expanding the role of the poorer countries, many in Africa. They called for countries to block the proposal. The UK Chancellor, &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; has previously backed demands for greater African voice in the IMF. He currently chairs the IMF's international finance and monetary committee.

<h3>Economic monitoring and analysis</h3>
The reform program also initiates the Multilateral Consultations, where IMF members will discuss policies to address regional or systemic issues. The first such consultation has began with China, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuro%20zone"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt; countries, Japan, &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and the United States focusing on narrowing global &lt;a href="w%3Acurrent%20account"&gt;current account&lt;/a&gt; imbalances. 

The IMF director also spoke of the need to improve the quality of the Fund's economic analysis. In particular, he said that the assessment of whether &lt;a href="w%3Aexchange%20rate"&gt;exchange rates&lt;/a&gt; are in line with economic fundamentals, which is currently performed for industrial countries, needs to be extended to emerging economies. He called for proceeding with caution, though, pointing to the methodological difficulties and market sensitivities involved. 

He also said that the fund was working on developing better crisis prevention financial instruments for emerging markets with robust fundamentals and that the Fund would "continue to strengthen and focus our support for low income members".

<h2>The IMF</h2>
The 184-member IMF was established in the aftermath of the Second World War, with a mandate to ensure global economic stability by monitoring currency, trade and fiscal policies of countries and providing low-cost loans to countries in financial distress. 

The United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, Russia and France have single seats on the IMF's 24-member governing executive board. Europe commands the largest representation, with eight seats, Asia has five, the Americas four, Middle east three and Africa has two. 

Critics have said that the IMF fails to represent the needs of most developing countries; Nobel laureate and former World Bank chief, &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Stiglitz"&gt;Joseph Stiglitz&lt;/a&gt; has blamed policies prescribed by the IMF when it loaned funds to countries in crisis for deepening their economic problems.

An Iran Air Tour commercial jet, flight 945, has crash landed in &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and has killed at least 80 people and injured as many as 60. None of the crew was killed. The plane crash landed at approximately 1:45 p.m. local time in Iran. The plane is a &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; made Tupolev 154 passenger jet. There were at least 148 people on the plane according to Iranian Civil Aviation official, Reza Jafarzadeh.

There are conflicting reports as to how many have been killed. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hindu"&gt;The Hindu&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that at least 80 have been killed, but ♡❤BBC News♡❤ reports that only 29 have been killed.

The plane crashed after landing when a tire blew up causing the plane go off the runway and "then its left wing hit the ground and caught fire," said chairman of Iran's civil aviation, Nourollah Rezai Niaraki, but Jafarzadeh says the cause of the crash is not yet known. The jet was coming from Bandar Abbas, a port city in southern Iran and was landing at an airport in &lt;a href="w%3AMashhad%2C%20Iran"&gt;Mashhad&lt;/a&gt; located in northeast Iran.

"As the plane was landing one of its tyres burst, forcing to it to swerve off the runway before hitting nearby barriers and bursting into flames," another aviation official said.

Witnesses say that the "plane was going up and down" when it was attempting to land and that a "huge sound" was heard coming from "underneath" the plane.

"The plane was going up and down when we were trying to land. When we landed, I heard a huge sound from underneath the plane. The plane leaned to one side and started sliding on the ground and then a fire started from the front of the plane," said one of the survivors.

Mashhad, which is home to the Imam Reza shrine, is a popular destination for pilgrimages of &lt;a href="w%3AShias"&gt;Shias&lt;/a&gt;.

Iran Air Tours currently has 43 planes in operation.

On August 22, 2006, another Tupolev Tu-154 Russian made passenger jet crashed in &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; killing all the passengers aboard.

<h1>Ghana bans gay and lesbian conference</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ghana%20bans%20gay%20and%20lesbian%20conference&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A conference between gay men and lesbians that was scheduled to meet in September has been banned by &lt;a href="w%3AGhana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;'s government which has said that "disciplinary action" will be taken if the conference proceeds.

As in many African countries homosexuality is illegal in Ghana, primarily for cultural reasons, "[The] Government does not condone any such activity which violently offends the culture, morality and heritage of the entire people of Ghana," said Kwamena Bartels (Ghana's Information Minister). Homosexuality is described as being "un-African" and a "disease" in parts of Africa, often regarded as a "Western" import. Bartels continued "Unnatural carnal knowledge is illegal under our criminal code. &lt;a href="w%3AHomosexuality"&gt;Homosexuality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALesbian"&gt;lesbianism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AZoophilia"&gt;bestiality&lt;/a&gt; are therefore offences under the laws of Ghana."

Although Ghana law does not stop groups from meeting the government has actively discouraged the event: "[The] Government would like to make it absolutely clear that it shall not permit the proposed conference anywhere in Ghana..." "...It's not illegal for them to meet and talk, but we in Ghana don't want to encourage it. They can go and do it elsewhere" added Bartels.

BBC reporter Kwaku Sakyi-Addo (based in the Ghanese capital Accra) said that it was difficult to establish who had organised the conference. He noted that the Gay and Lesbian community operates underground in Ghana because of the social stigma. It is believed that the meeting was to be at the Accra International Conference centre, &lt;a href="w%3AKoforidua"&gt;Koforidua&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. Managers at the centre have denied the conference was due to take place there.

A researcher at the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n-based gay and lesbian rights group, Wendy Landau, condemned the ban: "It seems the government got wind of something. It goes along with all the things that have been happening in places like &lt;a href="w%3ACameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;. It's kind of the spirit of the times in Africa,"

The Ghana public may be divided over the issue, whilst the Ghana News Agency reports many members of public and the clergy have spoke out in support of the ban, anonymous callers to radio phone-in programmes have called it an infringement of freedom of speech.

In recent times homosexuality has been regular news in African nations, earlier this year Cameroon newspapers launched an attack against "deviants" publishing the names of suspected homosexuals.

South Africa, by comparison, has recently had a gay marriage bill approved by its cabinet to allow equal rights for homosexual couples; making it the first African nation to officially recognise gay and lesbian couples.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; have defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; (New Zealand) in a &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt; match at the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Bafokeng%20Stadium"&gt;Royal Bafokeng Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARustenburg"&gt;Rustenburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The final score was a one-point victory, 21 to 20, ending the All Blacks' 15 game winning streak. For the Springboks, it ended a five-match losing streak. The All Blacks performed the controversial &lt;a href="w%3AKapo%20O%20Pango"&gt;Kapo O Pango&lt;/a&gt; haka before the match. It was the final match for the All Blacks, who had already won the trophy two weeks ago. The final match of the series will take place at &lt;a href="w%3AEllis%20Park%20Stadium"&gt;Ellis Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; next week, when the Springboks play &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

The first opportunity for points came in the 6th minute when New Zealand were penalised. South Africa opted to kick at goal, and even though there was some breeze at the ground, &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Pretorius"&gt;André Pretorius&lt;/a&gt; slotted it through the posts, giving South Africa a three point lead. However the All Blacks were able to even the scores in the 10th minute, with &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carter%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Dan Carter&lt;/a&gt; kicking a penalty goal after the Springboks were penalised for off-side near their line. Pretorius' boot was accurate once again, when he successfully kicked another penalty goal in the 17th minute, giving South Africa the lead once again, six points to three. The first &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; of the match was scored in the 20th minute, when Carter crossed the line and after converting his own try, the All Blacks led 10 to six. However the Springboks bounced back within minutes, with wing &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Habana"&gt;Bryan Habana&lt;/a&gt; intercepting a New Zealand pass, and racing down to score under the posts. Pretorius converted from in front, and South Africa were back in front, leading 13 to 10. The All Blacks were unable to level the scores in the 27th minute, with Carter missing a penalty goal. The All Blacks' were denied a try in the 37th minute when the television match official deemed one of the New Zealanders to have been an obstruction. Carter was able to level the scores on the stroke of half time with a penalty kick.

Pretorius attempted to put South Africa back in front, attempting two drop goals, though both missed. A line-out turnover soon led to &lt;a href="w%3APedrie%20Wannenburg"&gt;Pedrie Wannenburg&lt;/a&gt; getting over the try line to score South Africa's second try. Pretorius' conversion was away to the left, however, South Africa were now leading 18 to 13, with over 20 minutes remaining in the game. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Rokocoko"&gt;Joe Rokocoko&lt;/a&gt; scored a try for the All Blacks in the 66th minute, and Carter converted the try from the touchline to give the All Blacks a 2 point lead, the score now 20-18 with 14 minutes remaining. Pretorius attempted another drop kick with nine minutes remaining, though it missed, and the All Blacks remained in front. The Springboks were back in front, by one point, 21 to 20, when Pretorius landed a penalty kick with two minutes remaining in the match. A New Zealand knock-on in the 79th minute led to a South African scrum. The scrum needed to be set a number of times, sending the clock into overtime. However the ball got out and the whistle was blown, sending the crowd and players into celebration.

A &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; aircraft, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHawker-Siddeley%20Nimrod"&gt;Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; MR2, crashed in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan today, killing 14 &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; servicemen. There is no indication that hostile fire was involved. 

The crash came a day after fighting across the volatile south killed nine Afghan policemen, at least 13 suspected &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and a British soldier.

British Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said the incident would "distress the whole country", adding that the mission in Afghanistan is "vital". "Our thoughts go out immediately to the families of those who have died," he said. "British forces are engaged in a vital mission in Afghanistan and this terrible event starkly reminds us of the risk that they face daily." 

The "aircraft was supporting a NATO mission. It went off the radar and crashed in an open area in Kandahar" province, about 12 miles west of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; city, said Maj. Scott Lundy, spokesman for NATO's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The British Ministry of Defense said the dead included 12 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Air%20Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; personnel, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Marine"&gt;Royal Marine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and an army soldier.

Lundy said "there was no indication of an enemy attack." He gave no other details, but an ISAF statement said the plane's crew reported a technical problem before going down. It also said that "enemy action has been discounted at this stage."

However, shortly after the crash, a purported spokesman for the Taliban, Abdul Khaliq, claimed responsibility. "We used a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFIM-92%20Stinger"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; missile to shoot down the aircraft," he said.

British &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence"&gt;Secretary of State for Defence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADes%20Browne"&gt;Des Browne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said: "This is dreadful and shocking news. I know that the people of Britain will join me in sending our deep condolences to the loved ones of those who have lost their lives. "At this stage all the indications are that this was a terrible accident and not the result of hostile action," he added. 

Haji Eisamuddin, a local tribal elder, told The Associated Press by phone that the plane's wreckage was burning in an open field.

"I can see three, four helicopters in the sky, and coalition forces are also arriving in the area," he said.

People can call a special helpline on 08457 800 900 if they are worried about relatives.

Over 400 survivors have been pulled from the water, along with 195 bodies, leaving approximately 800 still missing. Tensions are rising between the ferry owners and the families of the passengers, many of whom have been camping out on the dock since the accident. Many are complaining that they have been given very little information regarding the passengers. While details about the passengers are not available, information regarding condition aboard the ferry have been quickly spreading, including reports that there were not enough lifejackets and lifeboats for everyone, and that alarm systems were malfunctioning. The crew has also been accused of ignoring problems.

Witnesses are reporting that a fire started aboard the ferry approximately 90 minutes into the trip, possibly either on the deck where the vehicles were stored or in the engine room. It appears that the fire spread quickly and filled the ferry with smoke. While the crew appears to have contained the fire properly and the ferry most likely had a fire suppression system, excess water was not removed afterwards. This caused the ferry to become unstable as its center of gravity was no longer fixed. Rough winds were then able to knock the ship over in what is known as a &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Surface%20Effect"&gt;Free Surface Effect&lt;/a&gt;.

Protests over allegations of fraud in &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;'s razor-thin election forced outgoing President &lt;a href="Vicente%20Fox"&gt;Vicente Fox&lt;/a&gt; to abandon his state of the union address, Friday, after a protest by left-wing legislators who stormed the podium from which he was to speak carrying placards and shouting demands for a full recount of the presidential vote. Unable to address Congress, Fox withdrew to a television studio in his official residence to broadcast his speech which called on the country to mend its divisions.

It is the first time in modern history that a Mexican president has had to cancel his annual speech to the country's Congress.

Fox did not enter the legislative chamber. Instead, after waiting for several minutes in a back room, he handed over a written copy of his speech, as required by the constitution, before withdrawing to his residence. In his television speech Fox criticised opposition politicians saying "all voices should be heard... [but] respect for the law is not discretionary."

Thousands of protesters have occupied the centre of &lt;a href="w%3AMexico%20City"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; throughout the summer to demand a full recount of the July 2nd presidential election in which conservative &lt;a href="Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n"&gt;Felipe Calderón&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Action%20Party%20%28Mexico%29"&gt;Partido Acción Nacional&lt;/a&gt; (PAN) defeated leftist &lt;a href="w%3AAndres%20Manuel%20Lopez%20Obrador"&gt;Andres Manuel López Obrador&lt;/a&gt;, the former mayor of Mexico City running under the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20for%20Wellbeing%20of%20all"&gt;w:Alliance for Wellbeing of all&lt;/a&gt; coalition banner, by a margin of less than 0.6%. An electoral tribunal ordered a limited recount of 9% of all polling booths. Following the limited recount, the electoral court ruled that a further recount was unnecessary as the limited re-examination showed no significant change.

López Obrador has rejected the court's rulings and vowed to lead a parallel government from the streets. 

The Congress building was surrounded by 10 blocks of steel barriers, caged attack dogs, water cannon and riot police in order to prevent demonstrators from storming Congress. 

Cuauhtemoc Sandoval, a legislator for the left wing &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Revolution"&gt;Partido de la Revolución Democrática&lt;/a&gt; (PRD), part of López Obrador's coalition, said ""It's completely militarized around here. It is completely illegal, unconstitutional, Vicente Fox started out as a president and is finishing up as a dictator."

López Obrador called on supporters to remain in the city's Zocalo plaza rather than march on Congress, "We aren't going to fall into any trap. We aren't going to be provoked," he told tens of thousands of supporters.

The electoral court has until September 6 to either declare a winner or annul the election.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's call to withdraw the 2,000 &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; troops stationed in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; by February 2007 has not been universally greeted by his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acaucus"&gt;caucus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

NDP &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Stoffer"&gt;Peter Stoffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said his views were more in line with those expressed by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defence critic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUjjal%20Dosanjh"&gt;Ujjal Dosanjh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who supports keeping troops in Afghanistan but altering their mission. Stoffer represents a riding that includes a large military base. 

"To be honest with you, Mr. Dosanjh got it right the other day when he said just to extend the mission for two years without a proper debate and a plan is wrong, but to do an immediate pullout, or a very quick pullout, is also wrong, Stoffer said to the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGlobe%20and%20Mail"&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ adding "without a comprehensive plan, what are you pulling out for? What are you leaving behind?"

Layton said on Thursday that Canada must withdraw its troops as there is no "comprehensive strategy to achieve peace", no clear goals and no exit strategy. He has also called for negotiations with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

In another interview, Stoffer said, "I think just to ask for a pullout right now may be a bit early." 

"You just can't say, 'Well, we're going to stay in Afghanistan for two more years' without a plan. And I don't think you can say, 'We'll pull out right away or in February' without a plan. I think both elements of that discussion should be more comprehensive in their approach," he added.

In May, MPs voted narrowly 149 to 145 to extend the mission in Afghanistan by two years. At the time Stoffer voted against extending the mission. 28 Canadian soliders and one diplomat have died since the mission began four years ago.

The disagreement within the NDP caucus comes as the party prepares for its policy convention in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20City"&gt;Quebec City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; later this week.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; has announced that a "low pathogenic" form of the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; has been found in fecal samples taken from wild &lt;a href="w%3AMallard%20ducks"&gt;Mallard ducks&lt;/a&gt; located in Queen Anne's County in &lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and in Crawford County located in &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. Officials stress that the strain is of no risk to humans. Samples from the ducks in Pennsylvania were taken on August 28.

"Testing has ruled out the possibility of this being the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in &lt;a href="w%3AAsia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Test results thus far indicate this is low pathogenic avian influenza, which poses no risk to human health. The fecal samples were collected on August 2 from resident wild ducks in Queen Anne's County, Maryland, as part of a research project conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State%20University"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;. The fecal samples came from mallards that showed no signs of sickness," said the USDA in a statement on its website. Ducks in Pennsylvania also had shown no signs of being sick.

"Additional testing at NVSL will confirm the pathogenicity of the virus. These results are expected within two weeks and will be made public when completed. It should be noted that wild birds are known to harbor many influenza viruses, and the finding of these viruses during routine testing is not unusual," added the statement.

Officials also state that there is no threat to the U.S. chicken industry.

"There is nothing in international rules that would indicate this low-pathogenic bird flu case being a problem" for the poultry industry in the U.S said, director of communications with the National Chicken Council, Richard Lobb, but some poultry groups are worried that some countries may impose sanctions on American chickens.

This is the second time this year a low pathogenic strain of the Bird Flu has been found in the U.S.. Two wild swans in &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; tested positive for the same strain on August 14.

Since 1975, the same strain has shown up at least six times in the U.S.

The England football team's first Euro 2008 qualification match against Andorra finished 5-0 with victory going to the home nation. It was Steve McClaren's first competitive game as Manager after replacing Sven-Göran Eriksson at the beginning of August.

Peter Crouch, in continued good form, opened the scoring after 4 minutes with a close range shot past Koldo (the Andorran goalkeeper). Eight minutes later Liverpool FC captain Steven Gerrard double the score with a half volley on the edge of the box. England went to the dressing room at half time 3-0 up after Jermain Defoe scored a third goal eight minutes before the end of the half. Soon after the break England scored twice more, the first from a Defoe header off a cross from Phillip Neville (brought in to replace his brother Garry Neville who usually plays right-back). Crouch got his second goal in the just after the hour mark (another header, this time from an Aron Lennons cross) to end the scoring. Owen Hargreaves was noted for his continued consistent form (as was Peter Crouch), hitting the post twice - once from a free kick suggesting he may be a worthwhile replacement for Beckham (who was recently dropped from the squad).

Andorra had a very poor game, raising concerns over their suitability for entry to the competition, and never managed a full attack or shot on the England goal.

Before the match England had suffered injury worries with strikers Michael Owen out long term and Wayne Rooney suspended. They were also missing Joe Cole, Gary Neville and Rio Ferdinand from the side.

England's next qualifying match will be against Macedonia on Wednesday night.

Former Prime Minister of &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, 78, has been moved out of the intensive care unit at Sheba Medical Center after his condition "improved."

"[There has been] noticeable improvement in his kidney function and the pneumonia in his lungs," said David Weinberg, a spokesman for the medical center.

Sharon's condition is still being called "serious" and he is still being held in the care department for respiratory functions.

Sharon suffered a major stroke in January and has been in a coma since then. On August 14, Sharon was admitted to ICU when he developed pneumonia.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to give &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; two more weeks to comply with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; resolution to stop its nuclear program.

"We in the EU and &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; have no interest in an escalation in the coming weeks due to deliberations in the Security Council. That's why we will neglect no opportunity to keep trying to find out through talks whether there is a possibility to return to the negotiating table," said Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German Foreign Minister.

The U.N. gave Iran until August 31 to halt is nuclear program which Iran states is for peaceful purposes.

"Hyperbole against Iran's peaceful nuclear activities by Western countries especially the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; will continue. Today those countries, which have filled up their arsenals with nuclear weapons, threaten nations and make claims about human rights and democracy. They are the biggest liars of the world. Avaricious powers can't create any obstacles on the way to the progress of our nation," said Iran's President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Germany, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, the United States, &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Britain"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; are scheduled to meet on September 7, 2006 in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%2C%20Germany"&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the next step regarding Iran's nuclear program.

A 41 minute long video, released by &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, has appeared on the internet featuring an al-Qaeda operative wanted by the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;.

The man speaking on the tape is known as Azzam or &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Yahiye%20Gadahn"&gt;Adam Yahiye Gadahn&lt;/a&gt;, 28, a native of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. He calls himself "Azzam the American." 

Al-Qaeda's second in command, &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahri&lt;/a&gt; introduced him on the video. Zawahiri gives "an Invitation to [join] &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;" before making the introduction.

"To Americans and the rest of Christendom, we say either repent misguided ways and enter into the light of truth or keep your poison to yourself and suffer the consequences in this world and the next. We invite all Americans and unbelievers to Islam. Muslims don't need democracy to rid themselves of their homegrown despots and tyrants," said Gadahn.

"Ignorance of Islam causes the people of the West to rapturously applaud when &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; perpetrates wholesale slaughter of &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; and leads them to give their consent to the atrocities that governments commit in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere in the Muslim world," added Gadahn.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that one of the voices on the tape is Zawahiri, but has not confirmed if the other voice is Gadahn.

Zawahiri and Gadahn were not speaking together.

Fourteen pilgrims, three of them &lt;a href="w%3AIndian"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; nationals, who were travelling to &lt;a href="w%3AShia"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; holy sites in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; were abducted and slain in Anbar province - the heartland of the &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; insurgency. 

An official at the Al-Hussein hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AKerbala"&gt;Kerbala&lt;/a&gt; stated that the men were bound and then shot in the head. Some of the bodies that were brought to the hospital showed signs of having been tortured, and one had been partially beheaded. 

An attack on a Shia shrine this February has led to increasing sectarian violence in Iraq, prompting the Pentagon to release a 63-page assessment report that warned of a possible "civil war" between the Shias and the Sunni minority. The U.S report, however, indicated the fact that the current violence could be quelled to prevent it from escalating into a full-scale war. Washington has been trying to strengthen Iraqi security forces to curb the conflict and enforce the authority of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANuri-al-Malliki"&gt;Nuri-al-Malliki&lt;/a&gt;, but has, so far, been unsuccessful. A ceremony to hand over operational command of Iraqi armed forces from U.S-troops to local authorities was postponed due to poor planning of the itenary.

India's Deputy Foreign Minister E.Ahmed expressed regret over the fact that the victims had ignored an Indian advisory against travelling to Iraq. Pakistan condemned the killings and once again warned its citizens against visiting Iraq.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; forces have captured the al-Qaeda in Iraq's second in command, Hamad Jama al-Saedi. He is also known as Al-Suaidi, Abu Rana and Abu Humam. Officials say that the arrest "dealt a severe blow" to al-Qaeda in Iraq. According to officials, Saedi masterminded the al-Askari shrine bombing which occurred in February.

"We announce today the arrest of the most important al-Qaeda leader after the criminal Abu Ayyub al-Masri [the current leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq]. He's the second man in the organisation. He wanted to use children and women as human shields as our forces attempted to capture him. We continued to track him down [in the Salaheddin province] and then he moved to north of Baquba in mid-June," said Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the National Security Adviser of Iraq.

"This is a very important development. It comes in the wake of [the] killing of Zarqawi and also a number of Zarqawi associates. Deliberate intelligence work both by Iraqi forces and as well as multinational forces have dealt a very severe blow to al Qaeda organization in Iraq," said Barham Salih, the Planning Minister for Iraq.

The arrest was made north of &lt;a href="w%3ABaquba%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baquba&lt;/a&gt; when forces found Rana hiding inside a building. According to Rubaie, the building was currently in use by some families. No injuries were reported during the arrest.

Forces found information on the location of Saedi when a U.S. airstrike in June killed former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

Nato claims that numerous &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; have been killed and 80 captured as a result of a major two-day &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; offensive in southern &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; which also saw the deaths of four Canadian NATO soldiers. On Saturday, a British military reconnaisance plane supporting the operation crashed killing all 17 on board. 

The stated objective of the offensive is to gain control of the Taliban stronghold of Panjwaii, an area covering roughly between 20 and 40 kilometres of terrain west of &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt; city. 

"Reports indicate that more than 200 Taliban fighters have been killed since Operation Medusa began early Saturday morning," said a NATO spokesman. The Afghan Defense Ministry, however, puts the number of Taliban dead at 89.

Approximately 2,000 NATO and Afghan soldiers are fighting as part of &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Medusa"&gt;Operation Medusa&lt;/a&gt;, the largest military operation in southern Afghanistan since July when the NATO-led &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; replaced US-led forces in the region. Most of the NATO combat units are from the &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; military which reports that its casualites were sustained in fighting around Panjwayi district. British, American, Dutch and Danish troops are also involved in the offensive. 

Ground troops engaged in fierce fighting have been supported by artillery and air strikes against enemy forces using rocket-fired grenades and small arms. 

"This operation, which is continuing on tomorrow, has inflicted severe damage to the Taliban capability," says Canadian Brigadier-General David Fraser. "We will continue operations here. We're making good progress."

According to NATO spokesperson Major Scott Lundy, the coalition forces have gained ground and disrupted the Taliban command and control. 

The operation had "special emphasis on driving out the insurgents so Afghans in Panjwayi district can return to their homes and orchards that sustained their livelihoods," according to NATO. 

British forces have denied that the &lt;a href="w%3ANimrod%20MR2"&gt;Nimrod MR2&lt;/a&gt; reconnaisance plane was shot down by the Taliban. Instead, they say, it was brought down by a technical fault. 

The 4 Canadian deaths bring to 30 the number of Canadians killed since &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces"&gt;Canadian Forces&lt;/a&gt; joined the conflict in 2002.

&lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister of &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; has offered to make peace with &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, calling for an end to "hostility, fanaticism and hatred" towards each nation by "shaking [each other's] hands."

"How natural it would be if the Lebanese prime minister replied to the many requests I conveyed to him, through different people, to sit down together, shake hands, make peace and end once and for all the hostility, fanaticism and hatred that part of his country feels towards us," said Olmert, who was speaking to students at a school in &lt;a href="w%3AMa%27alot%2C%20Israel"&gt;Ma'alot&lt;/a&gt;.

Olmert also said that he "hopes that day comes soon."

"We have to have a situation, where we do not see those lorries coming from &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, full of &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; missiles, full of Iranian rockets. That will just make &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; strong again. That is not good for Lebanon; it is not good for Israel," he added.

&lt;a href="w%3AFouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister of Lebanon said that no treaty or invitation to talk has reached his office and that any such treaty or invitation would be turned down.

"Nobody has conveyed such invitations. [Both] are rejected before they arrive," said a statement from Siniora's office.

The statement continued saying, "what is required from Israel is that it ... withdraw from the Lebanese territory it has occupied and from the &lt;a href="w%3AShebaa%20farms"&gt;Shebaa farms&lt;/a&gt; and stop violating the [UN truce] resolution by ending its unjust blockade of Lebanon. Lebanon will be the last state to sign peace with Israel and that can only happen based on the &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20peace%20initiative"&gt;Arab peace initiative&lt;/a&gt;."

&lt;a href="w%3AAndre%20Agassi"&gt;Andre Agassi&lt;/a&gt; retired after a defeat by &lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Becker"&gt;Benjamin Becker&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20U.S.%20Open"&gt;U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt;. The score was 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-5.

After the match ended, Thirty six year old Agassi sobbed as the 24,000 fans gave him a standing ovation lasting four minutes.

"The scoreboard said I lost today, but what the scoreboard doesn't say is what it is I've found," Agassi told the crowd, tears streaming down his cheeks, his voice cracking with emotion. "Over the last 21 years, I've found loyalty. You have pulled for me on the court and also in life. I have found inspiration. You have willed me to succeed sometimes even in my lowest moments."

Agassi had a 21-Year Tennis Career. 

In all he won four &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Open"&gt;Australian Opens&lt;/a&gt; (1995, 2000, 2001 and 2003), two US Opens (1994 and 1999), one &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; (1992) and one &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Open%20%28tennis%29"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt; (1999). 

He was also World No.1 on several occasions. 

Recently, he had been increasingly crippled by a bulging disc in his lower back in the last 18 months and announced on June 24 that this was his farewell tournament.

<h1>Over 1000 illegal immigrants arrived at Canary Isles this weekend</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Over%201000%20illegal%20immigrants%20arrived%20at%20Canary%20Isles%20this%20weekend&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A high number of &lt;a href="w%3AIllegal%20immigration"&gt;illegal immigrants&lt;/a&gt;, mainly of &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; origin, arrived on the beaches of the &lt;a href="w%3ACanary%20Islands"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt; this weekend. Although the exact number reported varies, it seems that more than 1000 have been registered. One person did not survive the trip.

Earlier this year, in the weekend of May 12, 974 immigrants set foot on different isles. This Saturday alone, 674 foreigners have been found without the proper documents. Early August it already became clear that immigration numbers were increased dramatically, when officials reported a 307% increase (14,589 immigrants, compared to 4,751 during the same period in 2005).

A special session of the Canarian regional government pertaining to the immigration question is planned for Tuesday. Some Spanish sources expect these events to reopen the political debate on this issue.

The immigrants generally leave the African continent in overcrowded canoes, embarking on a dangerous boat trip. They try to reach the &lt;a href="w%3Aarchipelago"&gt;archipelago&lt;/a&gt;, which, being part of &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, serves as an outpost for immigration into the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. Boats are often intercepted in Spanish territorial waters. On the shore, humanitarian organisations like the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; are waiting to provide the first care to the travellers. On arrival, &lt;a href="w%3Ahypothermia"&gt;hypothermia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Adehydration"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt; and minor &lt;a href="w%3AInjury"&gt;injuries&lt;/a&gt; are the most common problems.

Thereafter, officials try to establish the immigrant's identity. Most of them have no legal grounds for immigration, but cannot be &lt;a href="w%3ARepatriation"&gt;repatriated&lt;/a&gt; because they conceal their identity, or because they are less than 18 years old. In that case they are taken to a state Foreigner Internment Center, where they can be held up to 40 days. Since Spain lacks bilateral agreements with most countries around the &lt;a href="w%3AMediterranean%20Sea"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt; except &lt;a href="w%3AMorocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;, they cannot return the immigrants without negotiations. If they aren't arrested upon arrival, or when the procedure doesn't result in repatriation, they can freely enter Spain and the European Union.

&lt;a href="Steve%20Irwin"&gt;Steve Irwin&lt;/a&gt;, the environmentalist and star of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Crocodile%20Hunter"&gt;The Crocodile Hunter&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, died on Monday after an accident with a &lt;a href="w%3Astingray"&gt;stingray&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ACairns%2C%20Australia"&gt;Cairns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, according to local Australian media. He was 44.

Irwin was filming an underwater documentary for his daughter's television show, by &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Douglas%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Port Douglas&lt;/a&gt;, Queensland around 11 a.m. Eastern Australian Time (0100 UTC) when he was struck by a stingray barb in the chest. While the stingray barb had penetrated the left side of his chest, the exact cause of death is still officially unknown. Steve Edmondson, a local diving operator, listed &lt;a href="w%3Acardiac%20arrest"&gt;cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt; from the injury as a possibility.

John Stainton, producer of Steve Irwin's Film Company, disclosed the information. "Steve decided to shoot a couple of segments for a new TV show that he's doing with his daughter Bindi and, with the cameramen, went out on to the reef at Batt Reef to do a little segment on stingrays. He came over the top of the stingray... and the stingray's barb went up and went into his chest and put a hole into his heart."

Ross Coleman of the University of Sydney Institute of Marine Science said it was rare for someone to die from contact with a stingray barb, and that he does not remember hearing of any similar incidents. He says that stingrays are "dangerous if provoked," and "as a recreational diving instructor you hear of people getting injured by standing on them ... but they rarely die."

The Queensland Ambulance Service said a call was received about 11 a.m. local time on Monday and an emergency services helicopter was flown to a boat on Batt Reef. Irwin was dead before medical attention arrived, and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Irwin's body is being flown to a morgue in Cairns where he will remain until he is formally identified.

He is survived by his wife &lt;a href="w%3ATerri%20Irwin"&gt;Terri&lt;/a&gt;, who was believed to be exploring Cradle Mountain in &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his children Bindi Sue, age 8, and Bob, age 2. They have been notified of Irwin's death.

<h3>Reactions</h3>

Steve Irwin's death was considered to be very unexpected; Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said he was "quite shocked and distressed at Steve Irwin's sudden, untimely and freakish death."
"It's a huge loss to Australia. He was a wonderful character. He was a passionate environmentalist. He brought joy and entertainment and excitement to millions of people," continued Howard.

Similarly, Mark O'Shea, a British zoologist, said that Irwin's death will "leave an immense hole," while Jeff Wilks of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Queensland"&gt;University of Queensland&lt;/a&gt; called Irwin "a great ambassador."

John Stainton, Steve Irwin's manager, claimed he always feared that Irwin would lose his life while working in nature. He also stated that he's gotten into "close shaves" with Irwin, but regardless always feared that this day would come.

"You think about all the documentaries we've made and all the dangerous situations that we have been in, you always think 'Is this it, is this a day that maybe is his demise?'," commented Stainton, "We've been in some pretty close shaves. [But] nothing would ever scare Steve or would worry him. He didn't have a fear of death at all."

John said on ♡❤Croc One♡❤ today "The world has lost a great wildlife icon, a passionate conservationist and one of the proudest dads on the planet. He died doing what he loves best and left this world in a happy and peaceful state of mind. Steve would have said, 'Crocs Rule!'"

During the recycling day, sponsored by &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Ministry%20for%20the%20Environment"&gt;Environment Ministry&lt;/a&gt; and Computer Access New Zealand Trust, Dell New Zealand took in more than 30 tonnes of obsolete equipment by 1,200 people at Wellington's Westpac Stadium. Instead of the equipment going to a landfill where it is unable to decompose and will leak chemicals into the ground, 97% of all equipment collected will be recycled.

Susan McGregor, an Auckland City Council spokesperson, said: "There is a regional forum looking into waste disposal; but to date there is only a scheme for hazardous material to be collected separately by the council. It [the council] would welcome computer companies taking some responsibility for disposing of old computer ware."

Dell has indicated it will hold another PC clean up next year.

According to Dell, out of the 6.3 million New Zealand computers, 250,000 of them are old and obsolete, mainly because most computer owners, according to a survey, will upgrade their computers every two to five years.

&lt;a href="w%3ASydney%2C%20Australia"&gt;Sydney, Australia&lt;/a&gt; had recently hosted one of their own computer recycling days; however Wellington's event was four times more successful.

&lt;a href="w%3AAdriaan%20Vlok"&gt;Adriaan Vlok&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South African&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aapartheid"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt; regime's police minister, went to &lt;a href="w%3AReverend"&gt;Reverend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adirector-general"&gt;director-general&lt;/a&gt; Frank Chikane's church in &lt;a href="w%3ASoweto"&gt;Soweto&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, the 3rd of September to &lt;a href="w%3Arepent"&gt;repent&lt;/a&gt;. This follows his recent apology on the 3rd of August, 2006, which was described by some as "a miracle" that has had global impact.

<h2>Apology</h2>
Vlok and Chikane met privately on the 3rd of August, 2006. As part of the apology, Vlok washed the feet of Reverend Frank Chikane. As an &lt;a href="w%3Aordained"&gt;ordained&lt;/a&gt; minister, Chikane has &lt;a href="w%3Apreach"&gt;preached&lt;/a&gt; at the small church in Naledi, Soweto, for 16 years. It allegedly took Vlok two months to convince Chikane to meet him and hear his apology.

Chikane said he accepted the apology, during which Vlok admitted to &lt;a href="w%3Aatrocities"&gt;atrocities&lt;/a&gt; committed during the apartheid era.

<h2>"I am sorry for what you had to suffer"</h2>
Vlok, who is described by some sources as "one of the most evil men that apartheid created" called Chikane's congregation his "brothers and sisters" and telling them, "I feel your pain," and "I am sorry for what you had to suffer." "We were fighting here in Soweto. It was a war. But today we're coming here to pray."

Vlok admitted that he used to "hate your pastor [Chikane]" and that "[they] were fighting each other with guns, &lt;a href="w%3Ahand%20grenade"&gt;hand grenades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Apoison"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;". Vlok also said "I thank God for letting me not succeed in killing you."

<h2>Death of his wife</h2>
Vlok described his wife's &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; in 1994 as the defining point in his life.

"It took me 12 years, after the &lt;a href="w%3Agovernment"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; changed, to come to this point. I had to rid myself of my own pride, my &lt;a href="w%3Aegotism"&gt;egotism&lt;/a&gt; and selfishness," he said. "I don't represent anyone else because I stand before the &lt;a href="w%3AGod"&gt;Lord&lt;/a&gt; alone."

Vlok was seated in the front row next to Chikane's wife. At one point he stood and clapped along to a &lt;a href="w%3Agospel"&gt;gospel&lt;/a&gt; song in the packed church. When he was introduced, he joked by saying: "You can't give a &lt;a href="w%3Amicrophone"&gt;microphone&lt;/a&gt; to an old &lt;a href="w%3Apolitician"&gt;polititian&lt;/a&gt; and expect him to speak for only a minute. It's not possible."

<h2>Chikane's memories of Adriaan Vlok</h2>
Reverend Frank Chikane spoke of how he kept a small plastic bag with a &lt;a href="w%3Atoothbrush"&gt;toothbrush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Atoothpaste"&gt;toothpaste&lt;/a&gt;, expecting to be &lt;a href="w%3Adetained"&gt;detained&lt;/a&gt;. He recalled how his mother had been driven around Soweto by &lt;a href="w%3Apolice"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; who were hunting for his younger brother, with instructions to "shoot on sight".

He described today's South Africa as "a new country in an old country," and, "a country of peace." Chikane is still seeking &lt;a href="w%3Aaccountability"&gt;accountability&lt;/a&gt; from those who tried to kill him in the late 1980s by lacing his clothes with poison.

Chikane maintained that the &lt;a href="w%3Aapology"&gt;apology&lt;/a&gt; was sincere and said that: "The fact that Mr. Vlok has come to make a confession to me and is here with us today is a miracle," and, "It is the talk of the town ... Some people have told me it's profoundly historical."

The &lt;a href="w%3ABurgas"&gt;Burgas&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AAlexandroupolis"&gt;Alexandroupolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apipeline"&gt;pipeline&lt;/a&gt; will be the major issue of the discussions between the &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;a href="w%3ACostas%20Karamanlis"&gt;Costas Karamanlis&lt;/a&gt; and his counterparts, &lt;a href="w%3ARussian"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABulgarian"&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgi%20Parvanov"&gt;Georgi Parvanov&lt;/a&gt;, which will take place in &lt;a href="w%3AAthens%2C%20Greece"&gt;Athens, Greece&lt;/a&gt;. The three-party meeting is scheduled to follow afterwards on cooperation on issues regarding energy and economy among Greece, Russia and Bulgaria, with the construction of the oil pipeline Burgas-Alexandroupolis being an issue of important geostrategic importance for SE &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

The Burgas-Alexandroupoli oil pipeline will stretch for around 280 kilometres and is expected to transfer 35 million tonnes per year. The cost of its construction will be 800 million euros. The meeting has been scheduled upon President Putin's request, who has submitted a draft plan aimed to be signed by the three countries by the end of the year. It is characteristic that Putin and Karamanlis met two times since &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%202005"&gt;September 2005&lt;/a&gt;, including one meeting in &lt;a href="w%3AChalkidiki"&gt;Chalkidiki&lt;/a&gt;, northern Greece, as well as one in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow%2C%20Russia"&gt;Moscow, Russia&lt;/a&gt;. 

Vladimir Putin is expected at Maximus Palace at 3pm (&lt;a href="w%3AGTM"&gt;GTM&lt;/a&gt;+2), while he will be escorted by a delegation of Russian politicians, leading businessmen and energy corporation officials. At 7:30pm, Greek Premier Karamanlis will host a dinner in honour of the Presidents of Russia and Bulgaria.

The arrival of the two leaders in Athens has prompted the capital's Traffic Police to proceed with traffic adjustments in the city centre. The major traffic adjustments relate to streets around Athens Hilton, where President Putin will stay during his visit in &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;.

A gunman has opened fire on tourists in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmman"&gt;Amman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the capital of &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. One Briton was killed and five others were injured at the Roman Theatre in central Amman. Two &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; women were among the injured tourists, the rest were from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (So far the dead man has not been named). It is not yet clear whether the man was acting on his own or as part of group.

The attack took place at 12:30 local time (09:30 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGMT"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). The lone gunman shouted "God is great" (in Arabic) before firing up to 12 shots, according to eye witness reports given to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAFP"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news agency. When he ran out of ammunition the man fled the scene but was overpowered by Police and local inhabitants. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInterior%20Minister"&gt;Interior Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEid%20al-Fayez"&gt;Eid al-Fayez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; confirmed that a man was arrested and is now being questioned.

A BBC reporter in the area has said that the area is cordoned and currently being patrolled by armed police.

A roadside bomb attack by &lt;a href="w%3AInsurgency"&gt;insurgents&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ABasra%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Basra, Iraq&lt;/a&gt; has killed two &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asoldier"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s. The explosion also injured two other soldiers, who are being treated at Shaibah Logistics Base. The troops were travelling on patrol as part of a &lt;a href="w%3Aconvoy"&gt;convoy&lt;/a&gt; 15 miles (9 km) from Basra when it was attacked at approximately 1300 local time.

In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: "It is with great regret that we can confirm that two British soldiers have died as a result of an attack on a British patrol. One other British soldier was seriously injured, and a further one suffered minor injuries. Both have been evacuated for emergency medical care and taken by helicopter to a British &lt;a href="w%3AField%20hospital"&gt;Field Hospital&lt;/a&gt; at Shaibah Logistics Base." 

A British base in Basra was also hit with a &lt;a href="w%3AMortar%20%28weapon%29"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Arocket"&gt;rocket&lt;/a&gt; attack in a separate incdent. The attack set fire to boats inside the base. Military spokesman have reported no casualties.

<h1>Smart-1 probe ends mission with planned crash into the Moon</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Smart-1%20probe%20ends%20mission%20with%20planned%20crash%20into%20the%20Moon&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Observatories around the world watched the skies early on Sunday morning as a &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; space probe, the &lt;a href="w%3ASMART-1"&gt;SMART-1&lt;/a&gt; crash landed on the &lt;a href="w%3AMoon"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;; the first time a European made object has landed there and, as the first, it made quite a bang. For the culmination of its three-year mission the probe left its orbit around our nearest neighbor and smashed into the &lt;a href="w%3ALacus%20Excellentiae"&gt;Lake of Excellence&lt;/a&gt; at around 4,500 mph. The impact created a brand new &lt;a href="w%3Acrater"&gt;crater&lt;/a&gt; and scattered debris up to 30 miles, in contrast to the gentle touchdown of the Eagle lander (when &lt;a href="Neil%20Armstrong"&gt;Neil Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; became the first man on the moon) 37 years ago.

<h2>SMART</h2>
SMART-1, an unmanned probe, was launched aboard an &lt;a href="w%3AAriane%205"&gt;Ariane 5&lt;/a&gt; rocket on September 27, 2003 from the &lt;a href="European%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s launch site in &lt;a href="w%3AKourou"&gt;Kourou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="French%20Guiana"&gt;French Guiana&lt;/a&gt;. The first probe from the Small Missions for Advanced Research in Technology (SMART) group took 14 months to reach its destination. Since then it has orbited more than 3000 times, covering a staggering 62 million miles. In that time its mission has been to gather new information about the Moon's geographical and &lt;a href="Chemistry"&gt;chemical&lt;/a&gt; make up. An ESA scientist, Bernard Foing said: "The legacy left by the huge wealth of SMART-1 data, to be analysed in the months and years to come, is a precious contribution to Lunar science at a time when the exploration of the Moon is once again getting the worlds interest." Using &lt;a href="w%3AX-ray"&gt;X-ray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Ainfrared"&gt;infrared&lt;/a&gt; cameras the probe took pictures of the Moon's surface; some of its findings include a mountaintop (christened the Peak of Eternal light) where the Sun never sets.

Considering the distance it had traveled, the fuel consumption of SMART-1 was quite economical: the entire mission required just 62 litres (13 gallons) of liquid &lt;a href="w%3AXenon"&gt;Xenon&lt;/a&gt; to fuel it. Weighing in at 376 kilograms and costing £75 million, SMART-1 was one of the smallest and cheapest space missions. Towards the end of its mission the probe was orbiting up to 4 times a day (as opposed to twice a day at the start of its mission) as controllers brought it closer and closer to the Moon in preparation for the final act.

<h2>New technology</h2>

The mission was also a test of new technologies. The miniature &lt;a href="w%3AX-ray"&gt;X-ray&lt;/a&gt; camera is the first in the world to be able to identify &lt;a href="w%3ACalcium"&gt;Calcium&lt;/a&gt; deposits in rock formations. Combined with other features the probe was, for the first time, able to map the chemical structure of large sections of the Lunar landscape. Manuel Grande, the University of Wales scientist in charge of the camera, said: "What was particularly pleasing was the calcium signal [...] This is the first time we've been able to take an inventory of all the rock-forming elements of the moon."

A similar camera is expected to be included on a similar &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; mission, the &lt;a href="w%3AChandrayaan-1"&gt;Chandrayaan-1&lt;/a&gt;, due to be launched in 2007-2008.

Another new technology used by the probe was its engine, called a &lt;a href="w%3AHall%20effect%20thruster"&gt;Hall effect thruster&lt;/a&gt;, a new form of &lt;a href="w%3AIon%20thruster"&gt;Ion thruster&lt;/a&gt; (first considered by scientists in the 1950's). Previously this type of engine was only flown on &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asatellite"&gt;satellites&lt;/a&gt;, and this was the first time one has ever powered a craft beyond earth orbit. The thruster works by applying a large &lt;a href="w%3Avoltage"&gt;voltage&lt;/a&gt; across a &lt;a href="w%3Amagnetic%20coil"&gt;magnetic coil&lt;/a&gt;, creating a strong &lt;a href="w%3Amagnetic%20field"&gt;magnetic field&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href="w%3AIonisation"&gt;ionises&lt;/a&gt; the Xenon fuel supply which accelerates the ions to high speeds, pushing the craft forward. The propulsion of such an engine is around 3 times that of a normal chemical rocket. The thruster was powered by 2 &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20panel"&gt;solar panels&lt;/a&gt; on either side of the probe.

The engine's small size and cost-efficiency helped keep down the mission budget. However there are drawbacks; for example, maneuvers have to be carried out in long progressive burns rather than with short sharp bursts. A hall effect engine will also be used on the Bepi-Colombo mission to &lt;a href="w%3AMercury"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt; in 2013.

<h2>Earth observations</h2>

&lt;a href="Astronomy"&gt;Astronomers&lt;/a&gt; and scientists in ground observatories tracked the crash landing as it unfolded, controlled by the ESA staff from the &lt;a href="w%3ADarmstadt"&gt;Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt; centre, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AMauna%20Kea%20Observatory"&gt;Mauna Kea Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; caught the impact on infrared cameras, seen as a bright flash as rock and soil became superheated. Elsewhere, results were less conclusive; in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; thick clouds meant astronomers missed the event. One observer said: "It would have been nice if it was clear, but that's the way astronomy works."

<h2>Success</h2>

ESA sources say the mission was entirely successful in its aim to test new technology and obtain more data about the Moon. "It was really a great mission for the agency," said mission manager Gerhard Schwehm, "It was a technology demonstrator that grew up and provide lots of beautiful science data."

A British soldier has been killed and another is seriously injured after a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20bomber"&gt;suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; struck a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; convoy in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the capital city of &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed the attacker drove his vehicle into the convoy. Four Afghan civilians were also killed in the incident, four more were injured.

In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: "Sadly, one UK soldier has been killed and another very seriously injured as a result of this attack. The injured soldier has been evacuated to a military medical facility for treatment. No further details of the incident will be released until next of kin have been informed."

The death comes two days after 14 British military servicemen were killed after their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHawker-Siddeley%20Nimrod"&gt;RAF Nimrod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; plane crash landed near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

So far, 37 British troops have been killed in Afghanistan since military operations started in 2001.

<h1>Chicago apartment fire kills six children</h1>

Six children aged between 3 and 14 died early Sunday in an apartment fire on the 7700 &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20block"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; of Marshfield Ave on the north side of &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20IL"&gt;Chicago, IL&lt;/a&gt;. The fire also injured the victims' mother and three other siblings. Authorities say that candles are suspected as the cause, and that the apartment had had no electricity since May.

The three-bedroom apartment on the third-floor did not have a smoke detector, officials say. &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Edison"&gt;Commonwealth Edison&lt;/a&gt; spokesman John Edison declined to comment on why the electricity was turned off for the apartment.

Fire Commissioinor Raymond Orozco told the media, "This is the largest multiple fire fatality we've had from a single fire in quite a few years. I mean it's children. It's difficult for everyone involved." 

Witness Cmdr. Will Knight said, "The mother came running out with one child in her arms, screaming to the neighbors that there were other children inside." 

Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said that the children were found in the front room, huddled not far from where the fire started. He added that the fire broke out shortly after midnight.

Witness Al Tillman, 32, said that he was visiting a friend when he heard the children cry for help. He ran up to the third floor, where he managed to grab a boy's arm and drag him out to the waiting paramedics. 

Tillman said, "I'm shaken up because the other children didn't make it. I only heard one child. I wish I could have saved the others." 

One man said that he and several others tried to get into the building, but the intense heat forced them to turn around. 

Later, people held a blanket under one of the apartment's windows, asking them to jump down. Firefighters retrieved the children remaining by ladder.

The mother is hospitalized with three other children. The Court County's medical examiner indentified the children as Vanessa Ramirez, 14; Eric Ramirez, 12; Suzette Ramirez, 10; Idaly Ramirez, 6; Kevin Ramirez, 3; and Escarlet Ramos, 3. Escarlet Ramos has been listed as living at a different address, but details regarding this have not been revealed.

&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India's&lt;/a&gt; former External Affairs Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANatwar%20Singh"&gt;Natwar Singh&lt;/a&gt; has, for the first time, been directly accused by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for his involvement in the &lt;a href="w%3AOil-for-Food%20Programme"&gt;Iraq oil scam&lt;/a&gt;. The ED, which is responsible for enforcing foreign exchange control laws, has alleged that Singh, along with his son &lt;a href="w%3AJagat%20Singh"&gt;Jagat Singh&lt;/a&gt; and three others, acquired foreign exchange worth $8.9 &lt;a href="w%3Alakh"&gt;lakh&lt;/a&gt; illegally. The 18-page show-cause notice issued by the ED says the money was acquired by the accused, in violation of &lt;a href="w%3AU.N"&gt;U.N&lt;/a&gt; regulations, in exchange for two oil contracts awarded to Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organisation (SOMO).

Of the $8,90,000, $7,48,550 was allegedly transferred by them to an account in the &lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20National%20Bank"&gt;Jordan National Bank&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining $1,46,247.23, which was the commission for the oil-contracts, was deposited with &lt;a href="w%3ABarclays%20plc"&gt;Barclays Bank&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%20Islands"&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt;. The money was transferred to an account in the name of Indus Trading Company, which itself is owned by Andaleeb Sehgal, a friend of Mr. Singh. 

The accused are required to respond to the show-cause notice (issued on the 2nd of September), which Natwar says is an attempt by the ED to "defame" him, within 30 days. The independent Pathak Commission's report had stated that there was "no material evidence to show that Natwar Singh derived any financial or other personal benefits from the contracts."

A &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; soldier, Pte. Mark Anthony Graham of &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, was killed and more than 30 were wounded, five seriously, in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; today in an incident being described as "&lt;a href="w%3Afriendly%20fire"&gt;friendly fire&lt;/a&gt;". 

The Canadian soldiers came under cannon fire from NATO airplanes, reported to be two U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AA-10%20Thunderbolt"&gt;A-10 Thunderbolts&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Warthog. 

Brigadier-General David Fraser, the Canadian commander of the &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; in southern Afghanistan said an investigation has been ordered; "An aircraft flying in support of ISAF operations accidentally engaged a Canadian position in Panjwaii at approximately 5:30 this morning, killing one soldier and wounding a number of others. An investigation has been ordered into this event and while this event is tragic, Operation Medusa and the Canadians continue to operate in the Panjwaii district in support of Afghan government efforts to rid the area of Taliban." 

"We've got to find out what were the details there." said Fraser. "We do have procedures, we do have communications, we do have training and tactics and techniques and procedures to mitigate the risk, but we can't reduce those risks to zero."

Four Canadian soldiers were killed in a 2002 "friendly fire" incident when they were bombed by an American F-16 fighter plane.

An advisory has been issued for &lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Depression"&gt;Tropical Depression&lt;/a&gt; "Six" by the National Hurricane Center. The storm is currently located about 1165 miles East of the &lt;a href="w%3ALesser%20Antilles"&gt;Lesser Antilles&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;North Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and estimated to be near latitude 16.9 North, Longitude 43.8 West. This depression is moving toward the Northwest at 12 MPH and is expected to continue for the next 24 hours. No major change in strength is expected in the next 24 hours while winds are close to 35 MPH with higher gusts. The depression is a little disorganized according to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt; and showers and thunderstorms are still showing signs of organization within a large circulation. The depression may become a tropical storm later today or tonight.

2,000 charges had been laid province-wide in &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; for highway traffic act offences over the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Day"&gt;Labour Day weekend&lt;/a&gt;. More than 100 charges for people not wearing seatbelts. 17 drivers have been charged with impaired driving, 17 others received 12-hour suspensions.

Remnants of tropical storm &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Ernesto%20%282006%29"&gt;Ernesto&lt;/a&gt; in southern Ontario could have caused accidents. &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;OPP&lt;/a&gt; Sgt. &lt;a href="w%3ACam%20Woolley"&gt;Cam Woolley&lt;/a&gt; said on Sunday that about 130 crashes could be attributed to "people going too fast in the rain and &lt;a href="w%3Ahydroplaning%20%28road%20vehicle%29"&gt;hydroplaning&lt;/a&gt;."

Students heading to college residences posed another problem. Improperly secured desks, futon frames and even a refrigerator were found on provincial highways.

"About 200 unsafe vehicles taken off the road this weekend, some with no brakes, bald tires, wheels ready to separate, that sort of thing," said OPP Sgt. Cam Woolley. "And also drunk drivers continue to be arrested, continue to be in crashes and Labour Day has traditionally been deadly and that's what we found this weekend."

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; secretary-general &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; has announced he will appoint a secret mediator to oversee negotiations for the release of &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i prisoners held by &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;. The soldiers were captured by the &lt;a href="w%3Aguerrilla%20warfare"&gt;guerrilla&lt;/a&gt; group on July 12, 2006 in a cross border raid, sparking a 34 day war by Israel on Lebanon. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201701"&gt;UN Security Council resolution 1701&lt;/a&gt; called for the captives to be released. Israel has also previously said that the soldiers' return is crucial to any peace effort.

Annan announced in a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; that his efforts were requested by both Israel and Hezbollah. Speaking in the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20sea"&gt;Red sea&lt;/a&gt; port of &lt;a href="w%3AJiddah"&gt;Jeddah&lt;/a&gt; today, he told reporters: "I will appoint a person to work secretly with the two sides ... I will not announce his name today or tomorrow." The secretary-general is currently on an 11 day tour of the Middle East.

Hezbollah reportedly wishes to swap Lebanese prisoners held in Israel for the soldiers. This is something the two parties have done before although, currently, Israel is refusing to negotiate any form of swap.

The announcement is another sign of progress in the region since the &lt;a href="w%3Acease%20fire"&gt;cease fire&lt;/a&gt;. Although Lebanon indicated earlier today that it would reject an &lt;a href="Israel%20offers%20peace%20treaty%20with%20Lebanon"&gt;imminent peace treaty from Israel&lt;/a&gt; and agreed to file complaints about the latter's eight week sea and air blockade with the UN.

So far there has been no reaction to the statement either from Hezbollah or Israel.

Bomb blasts in South-eastern &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; have claimed the lives of two people, one of them a police officer and injured up to 14 other people. The bombing comes during the escalating battle between the Turkish government and the &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Workers%20Party"&gt;Kurdistan Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤PKK♡❤), the separatist group fighting for an independent state between the Iraq-Turkish border.

The two &lt;a href="w%3Abomb"&gt;bomb&lt;/a&gt;s appear to have been detonated by &lt;a href="w%3Aremote%20control"&gt;remote control&lt;/a&gt; as police investigated claims of a suspicious package left near a garden area in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ACatak"&gt;Catak&lt;/a&gt; (in the Van province). Authorities in the area said that the bomb had been located in a rubbish bin. The &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Freedom%20Falcons"&gt;Kurdistan Freedom Falcons&lt;/a&gt; (TAK), who are linked to the PKK, have claimed responsibility for the attack. On Tuesday, 29 August, the groups website carried the message, "We will trun Turkey into hell." They also warned foreign tourists to stay away from the country.

The frequency and sophistication of these attacks appear to be on the rise, following other bombings last week. The previous attacks at Turkish holiday resorts, which killed 3 people and injured over 100 (10 of them Britons), were also claimed by TAK. Many of the recent bombings have been aimed at tourists. In recent years Turkey has improved its foreign reputation as a safe country by promoting &lt;a href="w%3Atourism"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt;, now the disruption to that industry places thousands of jobs (and millions of dollars in revenue) at risk.

In a separate incident, 7 Turkish &lt;a href="w%3Asoldier"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s were killed in a clash with PKK militants in the south east. The militants are reported to have launched an attack against the soliders in their army post on the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;-Turkey border. The Turkish government has warned that unless Kurdish separatist violence stops it will take action against PKK targets in Iraq, sending its own troops across the border. The threat was reiterated by the newly-inaugurated chief of Turkish defense forces General Yasar Buyukanit, who vowed to defeat Kurdish terrorism.

&lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lankan&lt;/a&gt; government troops are claiming their first significant victory since the peace accord went into effect four years ago, capturing the rebel-held enclave of Sempur in the country's embattled east.

"We captured the main Sampur artillery position of the Tigers, We suspect they dismantled the guns or pulled them back. We are now in Sampur." said Keheliya Rambukwella. Rambukwella noted that the government's troops received little or no resistance as they took the 10-km swath of land. 

Overnight shelling and mortar attacks from the &lt;a href="w%3ALTTE"&gt;Tamil Tigers&lt;/a&gt;, the main rebel group involved in the fighting, killed one government soldier and injured several others. The objective of the incursion, said Rambukwella, was to neutralize the use of three Tamil Tiger guns aimed on government troops to the south. Tamil Tigers are claiming that they have not fled the area, and are continuing to engage government troops.

The collision of a freight train with a passenger train just north of &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; in the town of Shebin al-Qanater. The accident claimed 5 lives and injured another 30. It is reported that one of the dead was the engineer of the freight train.

In August the director of rail service in &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; was fired after a similar accident killed 58 people in the town of Qalyoub. A public inquiry into that accident is underway amid growing criticism of the government for lax rail safety and transport regulation. 

Mohammed Mansour, Egypt's new director of transport has agreed that the transportation system is in need of extensive overhauls. The government has approved $860 million to develop the rail infrastructure, plus another $600 million in loans to private rail operators.

An agreement to create a new alliance between the powerful &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20of%20Islamic%20Courts"&gt;Islamic Courts&lt;/a&gt; movement in &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt; and the Somalian provisional government has been reached. The agreement calls for peaceful coexistance between the two groups, and the establishment of a national police and military force. The agreement goes on to call on Somalia's neighbours to maintain peaceful relations and repect the territorial integrity of Somalia.

The agreement was reached after three days of negotiations that were mediated by the &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20League"&gt;Arab League&lt;/a&gt;, and have set 30 October as the date for a provisional power sharing agreement to be established. 

"I am delighted by the signing of this agreement that will pave the way for the pacification of Somalia," said Ibrahim Hassan Addow, chief of the Islamist delegation. "As the Islamic courts, we will implement this agreement that has been made here in Khartoum and we call upon the government to do the same."

"The Somali people are tired of war, They no longer want to see a continuation of factional fighting. The time to make peace has come and we will not hesitate to take all opportunities to ensure our country is peaceful." said deputy prime minister Abdullahi Sheikh Ismail.

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; witnessed more violence, with more than 30 people killed and a well known football player abducted. The incidents follow Sunday's arrest of "al-Qaeda second-in-command in Iraq" by security forces. 

The bodies of 33 men were discovered dumped in various places in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; today. The men had been blindfolded, had their hands and feet bound, were tortured and shot dead. 

On Saturday, a well known Iraqi football player, 22-year old Ghanim Ghudayer, was abducted by persons wearing military uniforms and has not been seen since. Ghudayer is a member of Baghdad's Air Force Club.

South of Baghdad in the town of &lt;a href="w%3AKut"&gt;Kut&lt;/a&gt;, two more bodies were discovered found near a roadside. Both of the victims had been shot execution style, according to the local pathologist. The execution style killing has coincided with an Iraqi forces effort to secure the city of Karbala in advance of a Shiite religious holiday, set for 9 September. So far the fighting has killed 14 gunmen and one soldier.

The incidents follow Sunday's announcement by the Iraqi security service that they had arrested &lt;a href="w%3AHamed%20Jumaa%20Farid%20al-Saeedi"&gt;Hamed Jumaa Farid al-Saeedi&lt;/a&gt;, who they claimed was &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda's&lt;/a&gt; second-in-command in Iraq. 

British Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt;, who made a surprise visit to Baghdad, said "We do not underestimate the challenges ahead, But we must not forget the progress made in the last twelve months in bringing the first democratically elected national unity government to the country, with a constitution voted for by the people." The visit comes as public support for the Iraq operation is beginning to sag on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Iraq's parliament voted to extend Iraq's two-year-old state of emergency by another month. The state of emergency grants security forces special powers of curfew and detention.

A &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; woman who lay down between railway tracks and had a freight train run over her is "incredibly lucky", sustaining only minor injuries, according to Sue Foley, spokeswoman for the railway company, &lt;a href="w%3AToll%20Holdings"&gt;Toll Holdings&lt;/a&gt;.

The driver saw the woman lying in between the tracks while the train was travelling at about 20 km/h. Despite the slow speed of the train, the driver was unable to stop the train before it ran over the woman. "By the time he stopped the train and walked back down the line, she popped out from under the third wagon," said Mike Lawton, acting sergeant for &lt;a href="w%3AFeilding"&gt;Feilding&lt;/a&gt; police.

The woman was flown to &lt;a href="w%3APalmerston%20North"&gt;Palmerston North&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20hospitals%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Hospital&lt;/a&gt; after complaining about sore elbows and shoulders and receiving minor injuries.

The driver of the train has been offered counselling while he has been taken off driving duties.

Police and the train operator would not comment on why the woman was lying between the tracks.

♡❤Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq♡❤, a report to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Congress by &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;, dated August 2006, explicitly mentions "conditions that could lead to civil war" in Iraq. American think-tank &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20on%20Foreign%20Relations"&gt;Council on Foreign Relations&lt;/a&gt; commented that "'Civil War' Becomes the Question"

In the recent days, American politicians have been taking positions as to what should be done if a civil war breaks out in Iraq ; "Are we going to put our troops in the middle of a civil war? Who are they going to fight? This will be slaughter of immense proportions. The American people will not put up with it. The leadership in Congress will not put up with it.", Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Hagel"&gt;Chuck Hagel&lt;/a&gt; declared. The publication of the White House "Plans in Case of a Civil War" has suggested that ability of the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" to maintain its deployment in Iraq would be at best uncertain : "if there's a full-blown civil war, the president isn't going to allow our forces to be caught in the crossfire", a source told MSNBC. Most Democrats, such as Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20P.%20Murtha"&gt;Murtha&lt;/a&gt;, and an increasing number of Republican senators, such as Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Hagel"&gt;Hagel&lt;/a&gt;, are pushing for a withdrawal of the occupation troops.

In early August, a confidential report by the British ambassador in Iraq had warned of a "low-intensity civil war and a de-facto division of Iraq". US generals &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Abizaid"&gt;John Abizaid&lt;/a&gt;, the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, and &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Pace"&gt;Peter Pace&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also warned of a worsening of the situation, degrading to a "civil war".

After more than two months of wrangling following the July 2 election, &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Calder%C3%B3n"&gt;Felipe Calderón&lt;/a&gt; of the conservative &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Action%20Party%20%28Mexico%29"&gt;National Action Party (PAN)&lt;/a&gt; has been declared &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Mexico"&gt;president-elect of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; by the country's &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Electoral%20Tribunal"&gt;electoral court&lt;/a&gt;. His six year term will begin December 1st. The court's 7 judges unanimously affirmed that Calderón defeated left-wing candidate &lt;a href="w%3AAndres%20Manuel%20Lopez%20Obrador"&gt;Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of less than 0.6% of the vote rejecting Lopez Obrador's claims of electoral fraud and undue influence by outgoing president &lt;a href="w%3AVicente%20Fox"&gt;Vicente Fox&lt;/a&gt; and dismissing the option of annulling the election and holding a new vote. Tens of thousands of Lopez Obrador's supporters have been rallying in &lt;a href="w%3AMexico%20City"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; for weeks demanding a full recount. The court allowed only a partial recount of 9% of the ballots - the recount narrowed the margin by 0.03%, which the court decided was not enough to justify a wider recount. 

Calderón has responded to the court's ruling with an attempt to placate the left with a call for unity to defeat poverty, unemployment and crime. 

"I want to again express my recognition of my adversaries," said Calderon in a Tuesday evening broadcast to the nation. 

"Their proposals, the most worthwhile ones, which are the most legitimate and representative, will be incorporated into my government programme." 

"From my side, there will always be an extended hand and an open door to dialogue," he added. 

Lopez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City, has rejected the electoral court's ruling.

"I do not recognize someone who tries to act as the chief federal executive without having a legitimate and democratic representation," he said in a rally in Mexico City's &lt;a href="w%3AZ%C3%B3calo"&gt;Zócalo plaza&lt;/a&gt;. 

Lopez Obrador referred to his rival as a "&lt;a href="w%3AUsurper"&gt;usurper&lt;/a&gt;". He has spoken of the possibility of declaring a parallel government "of the people to rival that of the political mafia and white-collar criminals", and said he would continue to lead street protesters.

Under Mexican law the court's decision is final and cannot be appealed.

<h2>Egypt - Rail accident claims five lives</h2>

The collision of a freight &lt;a href="w%3Atrain"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; with a passenger train just north of &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href="w%3AShebin%20al-Qanater"&gt;Shebin al-Qanater&lt;/a&gt;. The accident claimed 5 lives and injured another 30. It is reported that one of the dead was the engineer of the freight train.

The accident comes amid a public inquiry into a previous crash. Mohammed Mansour (Egypt's new director of transport) has said that the transportation system is to be overhauled. The government has approved $860 million in funding to develop the rail infrastructure as well as another $600 million in loans to private rail operators.

The &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Iran"&gt;president of Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;, at a meeting today, advised the heads of Iranian universities to restrain from political involvement.

On the occasion of the National Youth Day, the president met with university students. He declared that "Today, students have the right to strongly criticize their president for the continued presence of liberal and secular professors in the country's universities." He complained of how difficult the reforming process at the universities, affected by &lt;a href="w%3Asecularism"&gt;secularism&lt;/a&gt;, progressed, but added: "Such a change has begun."

The president is also the head of the Council of Cultural Revolution, thus having the power to institute such changes. Last November, the regime appointed a &lt;a href="w%3Acleric"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt; as head of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Tehran"&gt;Teheran University&lt;/a&gt;, against the will of student protesters. The current events are in line with previous reports of the Iranian regime interfering with university activities.

Ahmadinejad also praised the students by saying that they have spectacular talents and intelligence compared to students elsewhere in the world.

Liberal leadership hopeful &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Dryden"&gt;Ken Dryden&lt;/a&gt; outlined his vision of the country today. He wants Canada to be a fair, global, environmental and learning society.

"What I'm trying to focus on is the educational systems as part of a whole piece of what I call a learning society," Dryden told CTV's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACanada%20AM"&gt;Canada AM&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ this morning. "We learn from the day we are born and we learn until the day we die."

"The challenge is finding ways of enhancing learning through a national system of early childcare and a proper mix of scholarships and government help, such as grants and tax incentives," said Dryden.

Dryden admitted during a news conference that he doesn't know whether Canadian troops should withdraw or stay in Afghanistan or whether a carbon tax should be part of any climate change plan. He has now called for a thorough debate and examination of the issue.

Other leadership hopefuls are planning big policy announcements this week as they head into the few weeks before delegates are chosen to attend to leadership convention in December.

15-year-old teenager, Ngatai Reweti was sentenced and jailed today at Auckland's High Court for four years after killing &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Currie"&gt;Christopher Currie&lt;/a&gt; by throwing an eight kilogram chunk of concrete at Auckland's Southern Motorway.

Currie, from Taupo, was driving along the Auckland Southern Motorway with his friends when the concrete smashed through his windscreen from the Princes Street, &lt;a href="w%3AOtahuhu"&gt;Otahuhu&lt;/a&gt; over-bridge, killing Currie instantly.

Reweti was originally convicted of the murder of Currie on August 19, 2005 but in July, 2006 a jury overturned this conviction and instead of murder charged him with &lt;a href="w%3Amanslaughter"&gt;manslaughter&lt;/a&gt;.

Justice Winkelmann, during the sentencing, said: "Reweti's actions were serious and of breathtaking stupidity worthy of condemnation." She said it was a mindless act that killed Mr Currie and irreparably damaged the lives of others.

Winkelmann has suggested that he should serve his sentence at a youth justice residence and said that it was not premeditated unlike what the crown said.

Currie's family are outraged at the sentence. "We feel let down by the justice system. I feel the judge has disrespected us as good people and good people all over New Zealand," said Wayne Currie, father of Christopher Currie.

Reweti's family had said that Ngatai was gentle and loving but the deputy principal from his school said that he was often absent and very challenging. Reweti had taken full responsibility for the killing even though he had been smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol the day before Currie died.

Aaron Perkins, crown prosecutor, said: "The sentence should deter others from committing such acts and people should be able to travel on the roads without the fear of a missile being thrown and the consequences of that."

The &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; parliament approved the government's proposal for sending troops to &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; to take part in the UN-led peacekeeping operation. 533 MPs attended the voting session where 340 of them approved the proposal and 192 rejected. The troops are expected to departure by the end of this month or early October.

The Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATayyip%20Erdogan"&gt;Tayyip Erdogan&lt;/a&gt; of Turkey commented that "The required has been done. May it be good for the nation.". Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said "The framework of the proposal is planned to minimize the possible risks Turkish troops may face. After this parliamentary decision, it is our duty to support our soldiers to be sent and pray for them. I hope these discussions [regarding risks] will end after this decision".

Main opposition party leader Deniz Baykal and his party has opposed the decision. He said "This [discussion] has been beneficial as a chance to reflect opposition's understanding to the society". The other opposition party leader Erkan Mumcu emphasized the public reluctance about the mission and said "In the surveys, an average of 86%, in the least attended surveys around 74.6% of the participants have rejected the idea to send troops."

A well known Turkish international relations expert Prof. Huseyin Bagci, Lecturer at Middle East Technical University said "The approval of the proposal was the only chance". He also sees the risk for Turkish soldiers as "minute". However Derya Sazak, left wing columnist from daily Milliyet newspaper, is regarding the mission as risky.

The proposal's approval has been welcomed by U.S. 

The proposal voted yesterday night will be passed to Turkish General Staff. Then the mission details including the number of soldiers to be sent will be clarified. This week, Turkish Foreign Ministry and General Staff personnel will meet to discuss technical details.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrincess%20Akishino"&gt;Princess Kiko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has given birth to a 2,558 gram (5.639 lb) baby boy, on 6 September at 8 h 27 (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Standard%20Time"&gt;Japan Standard Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). He is the first male baby born in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20House%20of%20Japan"&gt;Japanese imperial family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; since his father in 1965. The baby was delivered with a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACaesarean%20section"&gt;Caesarean section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and will not be named until a ceremony seven days after his birth.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEmperor%20of%20Japan"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAkihito"&gt;Akihito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , currently on a tour of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHokkaido"&gt;Hokkaido&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , welcomed the birth. A number of traditional rites will take place, including the baby boy being symbolically presented with a sabre. 

The boy will be the third in line to succeed to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChrysanthemum%20Throne"&gt;Japanese throne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANaruhito%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Japan"&gt;Crown Prince Naruhito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Akishino"&gt;Prince Akishino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , father of the child.

The fact that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMasako%2C%20Crown%20Princess%20of%20Japan"&gt;Crown Princess Masako&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wasn't able to have a boy to succeed the throne is thought to have provoked her &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClinical%20depression"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and subsequent withdrawal from public activity. 

Pressure from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20Household%20Agency"&gt;Imperial Household Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for another child was ineffective and therefore &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Japan"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; appointed a panel to find an alternative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASuccession%20order"&gt;succession system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The panel's recommendation to allow women to inherit the throne was met with fierce criticism from conservatives.

The birth of the baby boy eases the pressure for the reform which about 70% of Japanese favoured but which was postponed ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asine%20die"&gt;sine die&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ when the news of the pregnancy came to the public.

Prince Akishino has previously criticized his elder brother for not trying to sire a boy. According to Crown Prince Naruhito this was in order to protect Crown Princess Masako. At the same time, Princess Kiko has become the darling of the media while the Crown Princess has been accused of being "selfish" by some newspapers.

<h2>Sport - Materazzi admits Zidane comment</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Materazzi"&gt;Marco Materazzi&lt;/a&gt; has told ‘Gazzetta dello Sport' exactly what comment he made to &lt;a href="w%3AZinedine%20Zidane"&gt;Zinedine Zidane&lt;/a&gt; that caused him to headbutt the player during the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20cup%20finals"&gt;2006 world cup final&lt;/a&gt;. Materazzi said "I was tugging his shirt; he said to me 'if you want my shirt so much I'll give it to you afterwards,' I answered that I'd prefer his sister." Zidane, who was sent off for the incident, has previously refused to go into detail over what had been said, referring to it as a personal comment about his mother and sister.

Materazzi has been banned for 2 matches by &lt;a href="w%3AFIFA"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; (the world football governing body) whilst Zidane, who is now retired from the sport, was given a 3 match ban and fined £3,260.

<h2>UK - &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Health%20Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; must "cut back" on old treatments</h2>
The National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence is to encourage British &lt;a href="w%3Adoctor"&gt;doctor&lt;/a&gt;s to stop using older treatments if newer ones are available. It has been reported that unneeded tonsillectomies and &lt;a href="w%3Ahysterectomy"&gt;hysterectomies&lt;/a&gt; (that could be treated with drugs) are costing the health service £21 million year.

Andy Burnham, a government spokesman said that the health authorities would still keep the money just be asked to review its processes; "New drugs and treatments are continuously emerging and trusts have to make difficult decisions about how to invest funding."

<h2>Europe - Sony announces launch of PS3 in Europe will be delayed</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; have announced that they will delay the launch of the &lt;a href="w%3APlaystation%203"&gt;Playstation 3&lt;/a&gt; from November 2006 to March 2007. A spokesperson cited supply issues for a key component. The delay, the second this year after Sony earlier moved the date from spring to November, means the PS3 will not be on sale for the Christmas rush (traditionally the best selling time for games consoles).

The delay is due to problems over ther supply of a blue laser used in the PS3's &lt;a href="w%3ABlu-ray"&gt;Blu-ray&lt;/a&gt; drive. The planned &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;n launch date remains unchanged and Sony say they still aim to sell 6 million units by March.

Economic cooperation and reconstruction in Afghanistan are also on the agenda. President Musharraf is scheduled to meet cabinet ministers and address parliamentarians tomorrow. His delegation includes ministers for foreign and religious affairs and the petroleum sector, and the head of Pakistan's intelligence agency.

"Frank discussions on the war on terror and expanding bilateral cooperation on regional issues," read a statement by President Karzai's office. 

Pakistan foreign office spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam told AFP news agency that the Presidents "will exchange views on bilateral relations, economic cooperation, reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and cooperation in the fight against terrorism," 

"Afghanistan is expecting the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to take effective action against terrorism," Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Sultan Ahmad Baheen said.

<h3>Pakistan signs "agreement" with militants</h3>

Pakistan signed a peace agreement with pro-Taliban militants in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Waziristan"&gt;North Waziristan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region on the eve of the visit. The deal aims to end years of unrest in the border province. Under its terms the Pakistan military forces and militants will stop attacks on each other and the militants have agreed to disarm or expel foreign &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -linked fighters in the area. Pakistan has rejected criticism that the deal will allow pro-Taliban forces to operate freely in the area. 

"Pakistan is committed to its policy on war on terror, and Osama caught anywhere in Pakistan would be brought to justice," army spokesman Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤.

<h3>Karzai meets NATO chief</h3>

On Wednesday, President Karzai met the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; General Secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJaap%20de%20Hoop%20Scheffer"&gt;Jaap de Hoop Scheffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Kabul and signed an accord aimed at boosting security and development in the country. The NATO chief warned that "some of the terrorists, the spoilers, think they can win in the south,", adding "They are wrong. Because they cannot win, they will not win, [...] That is why we are engaged in combat as well at this very moment."

<h3>Violence continues</h3>

The visit comes amidst an upsurge in violence in Afghanistan, with US forces saying that 60 militants were killed by artillery and air-strikes on Tuesday. Some 700 more are believed to be surrounded by soldiers in an operation in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKhandahar"&gt;Khandahar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; province. 

NATO and Afghan forces launched an operation in Khandahar's Panjwayi district last weekend, and NATO reports 250 militants as killed in the operations, though a Taliban commander has disputed the figure and there is no independent confirmation of the toll. Hundreds have been killed in continuing fighting between government and international security forces and insurgents in the last four months. 

An estimated 1500 families have been displaced by the fighting in Khandahar. 

Suspected Taliban militants shot dead two muslim clerics in Lashkar Gah, capital of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHelmand"&gt;Helmand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; province in the last two days and raided a district headquarters in the town of Arghandad in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZabul"&gt;Zabul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; province.

<h3>Strained relations</h3>

Musharraf last visited Afghanistan in 2002. Afghanistan has previously complained that Pakistan is not doing enough to combat Taliban insurgency in its side of the 2,250km (1,400-mile) mountainous border between the two countries. Earlier in the year, allegations by Afghanistan that Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders were living in Pakistan were dismissed by Musharraf as "nonsense". In February, Afghanistan issued a list of 150 Taliban suspects it said were living in Pakistan. President Musharraf dismissed the information as "old and outdated", but President Karzai reiterated that the list was up-to-date. 

Some Al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been arrested in Pakistan, which has also stationed close to 80,000 troops along the Afghan borders. There is international pressure on Musharraf to deal with Islamist groups in Pakistan who are believed to assist Taliban forces. 

"Pakistan has the potential to be the solution to the problems of Afghanistan," Afghan foreign ministry advisor Ali Muradian said.
"We hope that President Musharraf will open a new chapter in relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan."

Pakistan was closely associated with the Taliban's rise to power in the 90s one of only three nations that recognised the then Taliban government.

<h3>Opinion divided over Pakistan's role</h3>

While state run dailies ♡❤Kabul Times♡❤ and ♡❤Hewad♡❤ expressed hope that two leaders will work together to improve security, The daily ♡❤Cheragh♡❤ said that while statements about restoring security can be expected from the meeting, "as experience has shown", previous pledges by Pakistan "have not been fulfilled". 

♡❤Kabul Times♡❤ also said Afghanistan was grateful for Pakistan's help to thousands of Afghan refugees. 

"The key concern is whether the agreement is going to lead to more insurgents going to and fro across the border or less," A diplomat told AFP, while another questioned Pakistan's peace deal with the militants.

Demands that the British Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; set a date for his departure as leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28Britain%29"&gt;British Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; reached a new level today as seven government members resigned to protest his continued leadership. 

Junior Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Watson%20%28politician%29"&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/a&gt; and six &lt;a href="w%3AParliamentary%20Private%20Secretary"&gt;Parliamentary Private Secretaries&lt;/a&gt; had previously been considered loyal Blair supporters. &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20David"&gt;Wayne David&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Lucus"&gt;Ian Lucas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Tami"&gt;Mark Tami&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Wright"&gt;David Wright&lt;/a&gt;, the resigning PPSs, signed a letter stating their concern that the ongoing leadership crisis would hurt Labour at next year's elections to the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Parliament"&gt;Scottish Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWelsh%20Assembly"&gt;Welsh Assembly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASubdivisions%20of%20England"&gt;English Local Authorities&lt;/a&gt;. Two others, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Mole"&gt;David Mole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Mahmood"&gt;Khalid Mahmood&lt;/a&gt; have also resigned as PPSs. Parliamentary Private Secretaries are Members of Parliament appointed to assist Cabinet ministers. Blair responded by calling Watson "disloyal, discourteous and wrong."

Watson told BBC News he no longer believes it is in the best interests of the country for Blair to continue as prime minister. 

The resignations come in spite of a report in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sun"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper quoting unnamed friends of the prime minister saying he would resign as Labour leader on May 31, 2007. The report has not been confirmed by Blair or his office. 

Earlier this week at least 14 MPs who were first elected in 2001 and were previously thought loyal to Blair, including Watson and the 6 PPSs, signed a confidential letter to Blair calling on him to publicly announce a date for his resignation. The letter was leaked to the press. 

&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28UK%29"&gt;Leader of the Opposition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="David%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; responded to the resignations by saying the government was "divided and in meltdown". &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AMenzies%20Campbell"&gt;Sir Menzies Campbell&lt;/a&gt; said that the national interest was "not being served by the continuing uncertainty over Mr Blair" and that the prime minister "should either resign or set a date." 

The mounting crisis comes two weeks before the party's annual conference being held this year in Manchester.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s air and sea blockade of &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; is to end Thursday evening according to a statement issued by the office of Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;. The blockade has been in place since the beginning of the Israel-Hezbollah war on July 12 and will end tomorrow at 1800 local time (1500 UTC). It continued despite the declaration of a ceasefire three weeks ago with Israel declaring the blockade necessary to prevent arms shipments to &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;. International forces are to take up command positions at Lebanese seaports and airports in order to block future smuggling of arms. 

German experts are to take up positions monitoring &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;'s airport on Wednesday while German naval vessels will be deployed off the Lebanese coast. There are currently over 3,000 international troops in Lebanon, a figure expected to rise to 5,000 by next week. Under &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Resolution%201701"&gt;UN Resolution 1701&lt;/a&gt; 15,000 international peacekeepers are to police the border with Israel along with approximately the same number of Lebanese government troops. 

Lifting the blockade will make it easier for Lebanon to rebuild after the devastating 38 day war and allow the country to resume use of its normal trading and travel routes.

President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; today confirmed that the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; has held up to 100 terrorism suspects in secret overseas prisons. Speaking in a televised announcement, he said the CIA no longer held any prisoners and was disclosing information on the men's detention because the &lt;a href="w%3Ainterrogation"&gt;interrogation&lt;/a&gt; was complete. 14 of the men have been moved from CIA custody to &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20%28Cuba%29"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed"&gt;Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, is thought to be among 14 suspects moved, including &lt;a href="w%3ARamzi%20Binalshibh"&gt;Ramzi Binalshibh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Zubaydah"&gt;Abu Zubaydah&lt;/a&gt;.

President Bush said that the CIA interrogations had been vital in tracking down and capturing further suspects; such as Mohammed. He denied that the men were &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;tortured&lt;/a&gt;: "The US does not torture. I have not authorised it and I will not." Despite the frank disclosure the President would not confirm exactly where the secret prisons had been located, although last year ♡❤The Washington Post♡❤ reported on the possible existence of detention centers in &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Europe"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; causing deep concern in the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; also protested against so called 'rendition' flights across Europe to transport prisoners to the secret centers.

The announcement comes a month after the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled that the use of military commissions to try detainees was illegal. The president's proposal will help lay the groundwork for congressional legislation proposals, that if approved, would establish a legal basis for allowing military tribunal hearings of some prisoners held in the Cuban base. Mr Bush, speaking alongside family members of 9/11 victims, said it was now up to &lt;a href="w%3ACongress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; to authorize the commissions so that, "the men our intelligence officials believe orchestrated the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001, can face justice." The new policy is more like a military tribunal than the previous proposals.

The president said he would submit the legislation today for consideration. It is reportedly causing controversy on &lt;a href="w%3ACapitol%20Hill"&gt;Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt; leaving Bush facing a potential rebellion from his own party, something he will be keen to avoid with his mid-term elections approaching. A spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; subcommittee that will consider the bill said there were "some sticking points with the administration" over the exact content.

A major part of the bill marks a role reversal by the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;; previously the administration had argued that many of the detainees were "illegal &lt;a href="w%3Acombatant"&gt;combatant&lt;/a&gt;s" and so not subject to the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20convention"&gt;Geneva convention&lt;/a&gt;. The military commissions will now cover all Guantanamo Bay suspects with the convention, which, among other things, expressly forbids the use of torture. The president said that the bill would also ensure that individual &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asoldier"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s could not be sued by detainees in US courts.

The announcements coincide with a renewed focus on terrorism by Bush's &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; administration and comes as the party faces a tough mid-term election later this year.

The president concluded that the interrogation program had helped to prevent terrorism in America: "Were it not for this program, our intelligence community believes that &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Qaeda"&gt;al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against the American homeland. By giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhere else, this program has saved innocent lives."

An additional four members of the &lt;a href="w%3ABali%20Nine"&gt;Bali Nine&lt;/a&gt;, convicted of smuggling &lt;a href="w%3AHeroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; will face the death penalty. In all, six of the drug smugglers are sentenced to death by firing squad. The Bali Nine is the name given to nine Australian citizens arrested in Indonesia in early 2005.

Zarof Ricar from &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta's&lt;/a&gt; Supreme Court has confirmed that the previous 20 year sentences given to &lt;a href="w%3ATan%20Duc%20Thanh%20Nguyen"&gt;Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASi%20Yi%20Chen"&gt;Si Yi Chen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Norman"&gt;Matthew Norman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Rush"&gt;Scott Rush&lt;/a&gt; had been changed to death by firing squad after an appeal by prosecutors. Bali Nine members &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Chan"&gt;Andrew Chan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMyrun%20Sukumaran"&gt;Myran Sukumaran&lt;/a&gt; had previous been the only members of the group to be given the death penalty.

Ricar's confirmation ends a day of speculation about the fate of the men. The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; government is still seeking official confirmation about the decision, believed to have been made on August 16.

Relatives of the Bali Nine have again attacked the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; for passing intelligence to Indonesian officials which led to their arrest. Australian Justice Minister Chris Ellison denies any inappropriate actions by the AFP and says authorities merely cooperated with Indonesia.

Macquarie National News's Indonesian correspondent Sujadi Siswo said it was not unusual for Supreme Court decisions to be kept secret in Indonesia.

"It's not the procedure for the Supreme Court to make public their results, so what's happened is one of the lawyers of the defendants has informed the media," he said.

<h1>American Academy of Pediatrics supports dairy for lactose intolerant children</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=American%20Academy%20of%20Pediatrics%20supports%20dairy%20for%20lactose%20intolerant%20children&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Academy%20of%20Pediatrics"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; (AAP), in the September 2006 issue of its journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APediatrics%20%28journal%29"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, supports the use of dairy by &lt;a href="w%3Alactose%20intolerance"&gt;lactose intolerant&lt;/a&gt; children.

Dr. Melvin B. Heyman, author of the article, says that just because a child is lactose intolerant, does not mean that they should avoid dairy altogether. Many lactose intolerant people can consume small amounts of dairy. 

Heyman says that dairy consumption is important, especially for children, because of its high &lt;a href="w%3ACalcium%20in%20biology"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; content. The calcium is, in turn, important for stengthening growing bones. "If dairy products are eliminated," the article says, "other dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements need to be provided."

<h3>Lactose intolerance</h3>

Lactose intolerance is a condition, present in the majority of human population above the age of infancy, due to which the body cannot tolerate &lt;a href="w%3Alactose"&gt;lactose&lt;/a&gt;, a sugar present in milk and other dairy products. Lactose intolerance causes a range of unpleasant abdominal symptoms, including stomach cramps, bloating, flatulence and diarrhea. 

As lactose intolerance is inherent, its prevalence varies by ethnic group. For example, while only 12% of American Caucasians have it, its prevalence is 75% among African Americans, 93% among Chinese, 60%-80% among Ashkenazi Jews,and 100% among American Indians. Many people do not realize that they have this condition simply because they have eaten dairy all their lives and view the symptoms of lactose intolerance as "normal". 

<h3>Opposing views</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APhysicians%20Committee%20for%20Responsible%20Medicine"&gt;Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (PCRM) has long stated that the risks of consuming dairy far outweigh the benefits. According to PRCM's fact sheet, called "Parents' Guide to Building Better Bones", there are many healthy ways of getting enough calcium and promoting bone health. Many foods contain calcium, not just dairy. Also, it is important to consider the amount of calcium absorbed, not just the amount of calcium present in a food. For example, more than three times as much calcium is absorbed from one serving of Total Plus cereal as from one serving of 2% milk. 

PCRM promotes a strictly vegetarian diet. Despite its name, it claims only 5 percent of its members as physicians. PCRM has also been accused of having links with animal rights "extremists", in particular &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Vlasak"&gt;Jerry Vlasak&lt;/a&gt;, a former PCRM spokesman who called for the murder of scientists who use animals in research.

<h3>Supporting view</h3>

The report in News-Medical.Net says that Ann Marie Krautheim, with the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Dairy%20Council"&gt;National Dairy Council&lt;/a&gt;, a dairy lobbying group, says 

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; she hopes the report will educate parents on how to continue to include dairy in the diets of children sensitive to lactose and also help improve their nutrient intake. Krautheim says calcium-fortified beverages and other foods which seek to provide an alternative source of calcium, do not provide an equivalent nutrient package to dairy foods such as milk, cheese and yogurt.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – News-Medical.Net&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

This last statement, however, that dairy products are superior to calcium-fortified foods, is not supported by the article in ♡❤Pediatrics♡❤.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; reportedly failed to explain why Canada is fighting in Afghanistan, while the Harper government won parliamentary approval for a two-year extension of Canada's mission.

Polls show that while Canadians may oppose about their soldiers engaging in direct combat, most are immensely proud of the mission.

"This is tough slogging. Canada has one of the most difficult parts of Afghanistan. They (the troops) are engaged in a very determined effort to take the Taliban on," Foreign Affiars Minister &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20MacKay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt; told CBC.

"I think we should stay in but we need to have a proper debate about whether this is the right course of action in the future. What is our best role in the world? Is our only security, military security?" Liberal MP &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Dryden"&gt;Ken Dryden&lt;/a&gt; said.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt; wants to pull troops out of Afghanistan, including having a debate. "The prime minister won't even use the word 'war', even though it's obvious that's what Canada has now declared. There is no exit strategy that's ever been offered and there's no comprehensive plan to achieve peace," says Mr. Layton.

&lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20Duceppe"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Quebecois"&gt;Bloc Quebecois&lt;/a&gt;, is also demanding an emergency debate on the whether Ottawa should pull its troops out of Afghanistan.

Harper and Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20O%27Connor"&gt;Gordon O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement yesterday expressing their sadness and condolences over the death of Pte. Mark Anthony Graham, who was killed in a friendly fire incident by an American plane. 

"His sacrifice, the ultimate sacrifice, will have helped the local displaced population to return home and be free from the shadow of the Taliban," Harper's statement read.

A defence and security agreement was signed in Berlin today by &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, heralding a new era of cooperation between the two nations. India's Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3APranab%20Mukherjee"&gt;Prnab Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; and his German counterpart &lt;a href="w%3AFranz%20Josef%20Jung"&gt;Franz Josef Jung&lt;/a&gt; signed the deal after a meeting at Defence Ministry. The two countries agreed to training and exchanging senior personnel, as well as to the formation of a joint committee to hold annual meetings in either nation.

The two ministers also exchanged views on combatting international terrorism, described by Mukherjee as "the biggest threat to peace and stability". He also stated that the aim of the agreement was to "expand relations from the level of a buyer-and-seller relationship to that of co-production and the transfer of technology". On his part, Jung spoke about the cooperation between German and Indian forces during &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeping missions, such as the effort to monitor elections in &lt;a href="w%3ACongo"&gt;Congo&lt;/a&gt;. He also said that the two countries would, most likely, be involved in overseeing the truce between &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;. 

Mukherjee had, on Tuesday, visited &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, where he had talks with his counterpart in that country &lt;a href="w%3AMichele%20Alliot-Marie"&gt;Michele Alliot-Marie&lt;/a&gt;, about increasing Indo-French defence cooperation. He also met the German Ecomonic Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Glos"&gt;Michael Glos&lt;/a&gt; and visited a cemetery in &lt;a href="w%3AZehrensdorf"&gt;Zehrensdorf&lt;/a&gt; to pay homage to &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20India"&gt;Indian soldiers&lt;/a&gt; killed in action in &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20World%20War"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. Mukeherjee will conclude his trip on Friday.

Six Apart does not plan to continue development of Rojo, and "intends to sell a majority interest in Rojo's newsreader services in the coming months", making them a minority stockholder. Rojo founder and CEO Chris Alden and CTO Aaron Emigh will join Six Apart's executive team.

Rojo was founded in June 2003, and launched in October 2004. Rojo had a promising start and its userbase is still growing gradually. But the feed reader market is dominated by Ask.com's &lt;a href="w%3ABloglines"&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANewsGator"&gt;NewsGator&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Blair will quit as British PM within a year</h1>

British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; bowed to pressure from within his own &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; today by publicly confirming he will resign within a year. "I would have preferred to do this in my own way," said Blair who added "the next party conference in the next couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader." However, he refused to name the specific date of his resignation, "The precise timetable has to be left to me and has to be done in the proper way," Blair insisted. "I'm not going to set a precise date now. I don't think that's right. I will do that at a future date, and I will do that in the interests of the country."

He apologised for the party's conduct this week saying it "has not been our finest hour, to be frank". 

Demands that Blair announce his resignation plans have mounted over the past few months particularly over concerns about the Prime Minister's strong support for Israel during the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;Israel-Hezbollah war&lt;/a&gt;, the perception that he is a loyal follower of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and a precipitous slide in Labor's support in public opinion polls where the party is now at a 16 year low. 

Yesterday, eight Labour MPs resigned from their junior government positions over Blair's refusal to announce his retirement. They had previously been considered staunch Blairites. The British press reports of a shouting match yesterday between Blair and his likeliest successor, &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; over the handover date. 

"I want to make it absolutely clear today that when I met the prime minister yesterday, I said to him, as I have said on many occasions to him and I repeat today, that it is for him to make the decision," Brown said. 

"I said also to him, and I make clear again today, that I will support him in the decisions he makes, that this cannot and should not be about private arrangements but what is in the best interests of our party and, most of all, the best interests of our country."

Despite Blair's announcement, several MPs expressed their dissatisfaction at his refusal to name a precise date and demanded that he leave sooner rather than later. 

Manchester Blakeley MP Graham Stringer told the BBC if Blair "thought it was going to take the politics out of the next nine months that simply is not going to happen". 

MP Doug Henderson said "It doesn't seem to me that the public knows any more about the PM's retirement plans. People keep saying to me that the Labour party must have a clear direction forward with clear priorities and a new leader before the May 2007 (regional) elections." 

The eight MPs who resigned as junior ministers or parliamentary secretaries, Wednesday, expressed a concern in their resignation letter that Blair needed to go soon in order not to harm the party's prospects in next May's elections to the Scottish parliament, Welsh assembly and English local authorities.

Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 when Labour defeated the Conservative government of John Major. He has led the party to three majority victories and promised before the last election that his third term would be his last.

<h1>17 terrorism suspects arrested in Belgium</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=17%20terrorism%20suspects%20arrested%20in%20Belgium&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Following a two-year investigation into &lt;a href="w%3AFar%20right"&gt;far right&lt;/a&gt; political activists, the lead suspect of which was a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Belgium"&gt;Belgian military&lt;/a&gt;, police have made a series of arrests at barracks, soldiers' homes and civilians' homes across &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Those arrested are suspected of plotting terrorist attacks to disrupt the country.

During the raids, police found home-made bombs, large quantities of ammunition, firearms, detonators and other equipment, along with Nazi symbols and extremist literature. Belgium's federal prosecutors' office has said that those arrested are "soldiers and people with an extreme-right ideology who clearly express themselves through &lt;a href="w%3Aracism"&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Axenophobia"&gt;xenophobia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust%20denial"&gt;Holocaust denial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Semitism"&gt;anti-Semitism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANeo-Nazism"&gt;neo-Nazism&lt;/a&gt;". The prime suspect is a member of a &lt;a href="w%3AFlemish"&gt;Flemish&lt;/a&gt; splinter group of &lt;a href="w%3ABlood%20and%20Honour"&gt;Blood and Honour&lt;/a&gt;, a militant neo-Nazi network.

Of the 17 arrested, 10 were within the military, and they had been stockpiling "a slew of weapons". The alleged leader is thought to have recruited like-minded fellows since 2004 and to have organised paramilitary trainings, survival weekends and firearms practice for them. Some of the trainings took place on army grounds, without the knowledge of the General Staff. The federal prosecuter said the arrests were set off by an increase in the group's weapons traffic. Police also say they have evidence that the faction was in touch with a similar group in the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. No plans for a specific attack were uncovered, but detectives say there was a model letter to claim attacks.

The arrests were part of a coordinated campaign and involved raids with over 100 police officers on 18 private addresses plus 5 military locations.

The week of 12-15 September, American talk show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALive%20with%20Regis%20and%20Kelly"&gt;Live with Regis and Kelly&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ will play host to various attempts to set world records, for &lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20World%20Records"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt;. Announced are attempts involving cartwheels, pirouettes and tango spins, and cutting apples with a sword.

Today the show previewed the week, with a man who set the record for most ice cream eaten in 30 seconds, 12.5 oz.

Last year, Canadian &lt;a href="w%3ASuresh%20Joachim"&gt;Suresh Joachim&lt;/a&gt; set the record for longest continuous time watching television, 69 hours, 48 minutes. Joachim chose to only watch ABC the entire time. Another successful attempt was most watermelons broken by one's head in one minute. Both were nominated for Relly Awards, a sell-congratulatory honour that series producers award guests and the show's hosts, to make up for a lack of Emmy wins.

Co-host &lt;a href="w%3ARegis%20Philbin"&gt;Regis Philbin&lt;/a&gt; was named a Guinness Record holder himself two seasons ago. Philbin has been broadcast on-camera more hours than any other television personality. Philbin's television experience goes back to the late-1960s as the sidekick to &lt;a href="w%3AJoey%20Bishop"&gt;Joey Bishop&lt;/a&gt;, then continued with a short-lived series with &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Hart"&gt;Mary Hart&lt;/a&gt;, then the long-running ♡❤Live♡❤, with co-hosts including &lt;a href="w%3AKathy%20Lee%20Gifford"&gt;Kathy Lee Gifford&lt;/a&gt;, the popular ABC game show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWho%20Want%20to%20be%20a%20Millionaire"&gt;Who Wants to be a Millionaire&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the 2005 New Year's broadcast for FOX, and NBC talent series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%27s%20Got%20Talent"&gt;America's Got Talent&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

♡❤Live♡❤ launched its new season on 4 September, after a few weeks of reruns and "best of" specials. This is &lt;a href="w%3AKelly%20Ripa"&gt;Kelly Ripa's&lt;/a&gt; fifth season as co-host of the series, which has long past the two-decade marker.

The show features a revamped set, containing various &lt;a href="w%3Aart%20deco"&gt;art deco&lt;/a&gt; elements, and additional plasma televisions to decorate.

The resignation was unexpected. It was believe she would lead the party for another year.Mary Harney said, "It is my wish to allow a successor the opportunity to lead our party into the general election next year.In my judgement, this is now the right time, as we prepare for a new Dáil session and after a period of reflection over summer."

Members of her Parliamentary Party were very taken aback by her decision according to &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Dardis"&gt;Senator John Dardis&lt;/a&gt;.

Nominations for the leadership will close at midday on September 18, 2006. If there are more than one nomination, an election contest will begin. All members of the Parliamentary Party can stand for the leadership. The leader is elected by an electoral college, which is compose of the Parliamentary Party, the party's Councillors and ordinary members.

In &lt;a href="w%3AFuerteventura"&gt;Fuerteventura&lt;/a&gt;, the Foreigner Internment Center 'La Matorral' was the scene of an incident on Tuesday evening. Five officers of the National Police sustained light injuries, as well as several immigrants. The riot started when a man tried to get a second dinner.

Only eight policemen were guarding the 1400 detained immigrants. Members of the Police Union attributed the incident to the recent increase in immigration from &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ACanary%20Islands"&gt;Canary Isles&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, custody centres are overcrowded. Guards say there is a different atmosphere, since normally the centers are more tranquil and few guards are needed.

<h1>MySpace to take on iTunes</h1>

The goliath of social networking services, &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;, is trying to take on the goliath of legal online music download stores, &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;. Bands will be able to sell &lt;a href="w%3AMP3"&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; tracks through their MySpace profiles.

Most MySpace pages for musicians currently feature &lt;a href="w%3Astreaming%20audio"&gt;streaming audio&lt;/a&gt;, which allows web users to listen to a small selection of up to four songs while online. The new feature, currently in development, will allow instant pay-per-downloading of the songs. The downloading has been tested on a few bands' MySpace profiles, over the last few weeks. It is expected that the service will be available to visitors in the United States by year's end.

Bands will be able to set whatever price they wish, as opposed to the flat rates of services like iTunes; an undisclosed percentage will go to MySpace/Snocap. Snocap claims they are attempting to keep costs as low as possible. Fans of the bands, called "Friends" on MySpace, will be able to add the "storefront" to their own profiles.

MySpace claims to have three million music performers registered on its site. Many of these bands are unsigned or independent, and thus don't currently sell their tracks elsewhere.

Downloaded MP3 files will be copy-protection free, which means users can keep copies on as many playing devices as they wish, unlike on most legal song download sites.

The feature will be powered by a company called Snocap. The corporation processes the songs to make sure users don't attempt to sell tracks they don't own the rights to.

The &lt;a href="Qatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;-based Arab news channel ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has aired a new video which was made five or more years ago featuring &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; meeting with two men that the FBI accuse of being September 11, 2001 hijackers, &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi&lt;/a&gt; nationals Hamza el-Ramdi and Wael el-Shemari.

Wael el-Shemari was found days after 9/11, alive and well, by a ♡❤BBC News♡❤ investigation, which states, "he is protesting his innocence from Casablanca, &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;." At least four other men accused of hijacking planes on September 11 have also turned up alive.

In the video, Bin Laden is seen meeting with his former lieutenant Mohammed Atef. The video also shows bin Laden meeting with Ramzi Binalshibh who is also believed to be one of the masterminds of the attacks. Atef was killed in an airstrike, by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 located in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. Binalshibh has been in U.S. custody for at least four years. 

The video, shows the alleged hijackers "preparing for the attacks and practising their execution" in Afghanistan according to ♡❤BBC News♡❤. 

It is not known how ♡❤Al Jazeera♡❤ got the video.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has delayed the launch of &lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;space shuttle Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; due to a "fuel cell anomaly."

"We want to fly a good mission, we want to fly a safe mission, we want to have a successful mission," said Space Shuttle Program Manager, Wayne Hale.

"We put together a huge amount of data, but it's not complete yet. We have to put all the data on the table and look at it," said deputy manager of the Orbiter Project, Ed Mango. He also stated that "we'll need more time to understand what this signature really means." The issue has never before been seen on the space shuttles.

The issue with the fuel cell was discovered by officials when NASA was preparing to fill up Atlantis's fuel tank. One cell gave a low voltage reading, while two other cells gave readings that were too high. All three of the fuel cells must be working properly in order for Atlantis to lift-off successfully.

More tests will be done on Atlantis in the next 24-hours, but so far officials have not yet decided when Atlantis will launch. The next window for launching is on Friday September 8, 2006 at 11:41 a.m.. If Atlantis does not launch on Friday, officials will try for a launch date in October.

A meeting was scheduled for 2:00 p.m. this afternoon between NASA officials, but there is no word on the conclusion of that meeting.

The 31st annual &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Toronto International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; (TIFF) is starting tonight. The festival, runs until Sept. 16. Hundreds of stars will be there. Including &lt;a href="w%3AReese%20Witherspoon"&gt;Reese Witherspoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Pitt"&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Crowe"&gt;Russell Crowe&lt;/a&gt; and more.

"Even if the film isn't bought, it's just the industry [is] seeing your film, recognizing the name," festival director and CEO Piers Handling said. "Financiers, agents are all here. It's amazing the number of filmmakers who will get American agents out of being at the festival. Even a Canadian agent."

The festival has a 352-film lineup, and includes selections from 61 countries, ranging from dramas and horror movies to documentaries, independent features and short films.

"Toronto offers the widest breadth of any of the major festivals," said Tom Ortenberg, president of &lt;a href="w%3ALions%20Gate%20Entertainment"&gt;Lionsgate Films&lt;/a&gt;.

Filmmakers like &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Moore"&gt;Michael Moore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Waters%20%28filmmaker%29"&gt;John Waters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Cameron%20Mitchell"&gt;John Cameron Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; will be among the participants of the festival's Maverick program, during which filmmakers discuss their latest works.

&lt;a href="w%3AWinnipeg"&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/a&gt; filmmaker &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Maddin"&gt;Guy Maddin&lt;/a&gt; will also screen his new silent film, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Brand%20Upon%20the%20Brain"&gt;The Brand Upon the Brain&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, with accompaniment from the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Symphony%20Orchestra"&gt;Toronto Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, two sound-effects artists, a narrator and a singer.

The world premiere of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmazing%20Grace%20%282006%20film%29"&gt;Amazing Grace&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, based on the story of 18th-century British abolitionist, &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Wilberforce"&gt;William Wilberforce&lt;/a&gt;, and his campaign to end the slave trade will be shown on the last day.

Organisers of the Targa West Tarmac &lt;a href="w%3ARally%20%28Motorsport%29"&gt;Rally&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed the death of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; motor sport legend &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Brock"&gt;Peter Brock&lt;/a&gt;, 61, as reported on Australian Media.

Brock died after his Daytona Coupe left the road and stuck a tree, shortly after 11:50AM today near the small town of &lt;a href="w%3AGidgegannup%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Gidgengannup&lt;/a&gt; in Western Australia. His co-driver, Mick Hone was injured and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Brock had admitted earlier in the day that he was "still coming to grips with the car" on radio. Spectators report seeing the rear of Brock's car sliding out as he negotiated a corner. They say he was going no faster than anyone else.

Race organisers and the &lt;a href="w%3AConfederation%20of%20Australian%20Motorsport"&gt;Confederation of Australian Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; will conduct an investigation into the accident once the civil authorities have completed their investigation.

Brock was one of Australian motorsport's most significant figures, having won the &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%201000"&gt;Bathurst 1000&lt;/a&gt; nine times. His death comes only days after the death of fellow Australian celebrity &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Irwin"&gt;Steve Irwin&lt;/a&gt;.

The bomb blast incident happened on Friday in Barkhan city of &lt;a href="w%3ABalochistan"&gt;Balochistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;.

The dead and wounded have been shifted to a local hospital, where some of the wounded are in critical condition. The police further said, "The death toll may rise because some of the injured are in critical condition".
Police Officer Hafiz Inayat Ullah claimed that supporters of Akbar Bugti are involved in the blast. Further he said, "Everyone in knows that the supporters of Nawab's are behind the blast."

&lt;a href="w%3ANawab%20Akbar%20Bugti"&gt;Nawab Akbar Bugti&lt;/a&gt;, 79, died on August 26 during the military operation in Baluchistan. The Pakistan government declared him as a terrorist. The protests, rallies and processions since Akbar Bugti's death have left many people dead. The strikes are continue in Balochistan, due to the strikes market activities are almost stopped.

Jamil Akbar Bugti, the Bugti's son, had also demanded that international human rights groups exhume Nawab Akbar's body for tests to determine the cause of his death.

&lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACostas%20Karamanlis"&gt;Costas Karamanlis&lt;/a&gt; and the whole of Cabinet is already in Greece's second-largest city &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;, in order to take part to the inauguration of the, organized by Helexpo&lt;a href="http%3A//www.helexpo.gr"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 71st International Fair&lt;a href="http%3A//www.tif.gr"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will take place later today. The Greek Premier will address a speech - as it traditionally happens every year - at the ♡❤♡Vellidion Conference Centre♡❤♡ where he is going to speak about the upcoming governmental policies in Economy. Earlier today, Karamanlis visited the sites of two upcoming public works in the city; the &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki%20Metro"&gt;Thessaloniki Metro&lt;/a&gt; construction site and the expansion of &lt;a href="w%3AMakedonia%20International%20Airport"&gt;Makedonia International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. At 1pm(GTM +2), the Greek Premier will inaugurate the renovated &lt;a href="w%3AArchaeological%20Museum%20of%20Thessaloniki"&gt;Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;. 

According to government officials, Karamanlis is expected to emphasize &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democracy"&gt;New Democracy&lt;/a&gt;'s achievements in two-and-a-half years in government while avoiding promises of handouts, although he is due to announce some changes regarding economical issues, like the tax system. 

Prime Minister Karamanlis will address his official speech at 8pm in Vellidion Centre while several demonstrations have been scheduled in the centre of Thessaloniki and around the area of the International Fair. Among those demonstrations, condemning the governmental policies, are the supporters of &lt;a href="w%3APAOK%20FC"&gt;PAOK FC&lt;/a&gt; who demand solution to the their team's administration as well as &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;'s largest labour unions, &lt;a href="w%3AGSEE"&gt;GSEE&lt;/a&gt; and ADEDY, which have also organized a protest in the city center at 6pm and demonstrators are due to march to the exhibition center where the Thessaloniki International Fair is being held.

At least 30 people have died and 112 people have been injured, many critically in three explosions in a crowded market in the town of Malegaon, in the state of &lt;a href="w%3AMaharashtra"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The explosions appeared to have been caused by crude bombs and occurred between 1:45&amp;nbsp;PM and 1:49&amp;nbsp;PM (&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Standard%20Time"&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt;) on Friday afternoon. The blasts took place near the Noorani Mosque, when a Shab-e-Barat procession was passing through the market. Curfew has been imposed in the town, which itself has been cordoned off, to prevent communal tensions from escalating. Mobile networks in the city have been jammed.

&lt;a href="w%3AMaharashtra"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt; DCP P. S Pasricha, however, claimed that only one blast had occurred resulting in 5 fatalities. An &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Legislative%20Assembly"&gt;MLA&lt;/a&gt; from the area later confirmed the occurrence of three explosions. Special Inspector-General of Nashik, P. K Jain, said that two state police companies and ten &lt;a href="w%3ARapid%20Action%20Force"&gt;Rapid Action Force&lt;/a&gt; had been sent to Malegaon to control the situation. He also added that prior intelligence had been received about the possibility of such an attack. 

An angry mob attacked the Superintendent of Police when his team tried to reach the blast site. Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, &lt;a href="w%3AR%20R%20Patil"&gt;R R Patil&lt;/a&gt; is headed to the town to assess the situation. The Union Home Secretary has asked the state authorities to speak to local leaders in Malegaon and ask them to help maintain the peace there. A high alert has been declared throughout the state and paramilitary forces are en route to control the situation in communally volatile areas. 

Malegaon, in the Nasik district of Maharashtra, is famous for its powerlooms, and one of the biggest cities in Northwest Maharashtra. It has a history of communal tensions between its majority Muslim population and their Hindu neighbours. The town witnessed riots in 1984 and then again in 1992 (in the aftermath of the &lt;a href="w%3ABabri%20Masjid"&gt;Babri Masjid&lt;/a&gt; demolition) and, most recently, in 2001. 

The blasts happened a day after a controversy over India's national song, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVande%20Mataram"&gt;Vande Mataram&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ heightened communal tensions. 

<h3>Suspects</h3>

The police are investigating the incident and the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATimes%20of%20India"&gt;Times of India&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper suggests that either the Hindu &lt;a href="w%3ASangh%20Parivar"&gt;Sangh Parivar&lt;/a&gt; organisation &lt;a href="w%3ABajrang%20Dal"&gt;Bajrang Dal&lt;/a&gt; or the Kashmiri separatist group &lt;a href="w%3ALashkar%20e%20Toiba"&gt;Lashkar eToiba&lt;/a&gt; may be responsible. The &lt;a href="w%3ABajrang%20Dal"&gt;Bajrang Dal&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Mohammadi Masjid in Parbhani and mosques at Pona and Jalna earlier this year following a similar pattern. &lt;a href="w%3ALashkar-e-Toiba"&gt;Lashkar-e-Toiba&lt;/a&gt; might want to create a communal divide between Hindus and Muslims.

For &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;, the fifth anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; will be marked with a new kind of controversy over alleged political motives in a new miniseries, slated to be aired on prime-time slots this coming Monday and Tuesday.

Titled ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Path%20to%209/11"&gt;The Path to 9/11&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the 5-hour film is slated to be aired over the course of 2 nights, culminating on Monday with dramatizations of the October 2000 attacks on the US Navy ship, USS Cole, as well as fictionalized portrayals of the attacks on the World Trade Center towers, which killed 2,973. Many officials and watchdogs, however, have criticized the film for allegedly stretching and fabricating the truth. Samuel R. Berger, a national security adviser made a statement denouncing the film claiming the film "flagrantly misrepresents my personal actions." Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright called one scene involving her "false and defamatory," and former White House aide Bruce R. Lindsey said "it is unconscionable to mislead the American public about one of the most horrendous tragedies our country has ever known." 

A flurry of on-line email campaigns, protesting the film and demanding it be corrected or not aired, has erupted. According to the liberal group Truemajority, "It's not just that ABC's movie is slanted. Big parts of it are simply untrue. The producer himself even admitted to simply improvising a key scene which depicts the Clinton administration letting bin Laden go when they had him in their sights -- a complete fabrication. Last night, the movie's star, Harvey Keitel, said 'It turned out not all the facts were correct.'"

According to ABC's entertainment division, the film is a "dramatization... not a documentary." However, several key scenes, which critics allege distort the September 11 commission's report on which the film is based, are being reworked, reshot, or pulled altogether, and ABC is reportedly "mulling the idea of yanking the mini altogether." 

For ABC, credibility, along with what is reported to be millions of dollars spent in advertising, is on the line. The film includes many noted actors, including Donnie Wahlberg, Patricia Heaton, and Harvey Keitel, who plays counterterrorism official John O'Neil. However, criticism has come from within as well. Many who worked on the film have spoken out, claiming the film's accuracy and objectivity is questionable. One writer, Cyrus Nowrasteh, in an interview with Los Angeles radio station KRLA-AM, claimed that moments had been improvised, and writer James Bamford claimed on MSNBC that an FBI agent working as a consultant on the film quit due to allegations of fabrication.

Action committees from all across the political spectrum have made statements on the film, including liberal watchdog MoveOn.org, which, in a recent statement to its members, stated that "ABC shouldn't have any role in the political exploitation of 9/11."

"This docudrama is designed to do just that," the statement continued. "It's spreading a false message to millions of viewers across the country."

"No one has seen the final version of the film, because the editing process is not yet complete, so criticisms of film specifics are premature and irresponsible," said Disney, the company that owns ABC.

Internationally acclaimed graffiti kingpin and art-saboteur, &lt;a href="w%3ABanksy"&gt;Banksy&lt;/a&gt;, successfully infiltrated the &lt;a href="w%3ADisneyland"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; themepark in &lt;a href="w%3AAnaheim%2C%20California"&gt;Anaheim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

It is alleged that the graffiti bandit extraordinaire clandestinely entered the park over-night, then proceeded to install a piece depicting a prisoner in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; at the themepark. Banksy installed a sculpture, a life-size doll dressed in an prison inmate's orange jumpsuit and bound and shackled, behind the bars of the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride.

Disneyland closed down the ride and removed the sculpture amid fears over public safety.

Based on an ongoing investigation by Colombian prosecutors, &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt;'s leading newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Tiempo"&gt;El Tiempo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ published a report claiming that some Colombian officers from the Army's 13th Brigade would have fabricated a number of terrorist attacks in the weeks prior to the inauguration of president &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt;'s second term in office, and that they would have paid for the cooperation of demobilized members of the leftist guerrilla group &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt;, in particular that of a woman known as "Jessica".

The allegedly fake attacks, most of which were presented as foiled by the actions of Army, would have had the purpose of allowing the officers involved to show "positive" results in the fight against &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt; before the public and the government. Security measures had been tightened during the days prior to August the 7th, when Uribe initiated his second term in office. Four years before, during the inauguration ceremony of Uribe's first term in office, a number of handmade rockets were launched by FARC from houses in the city's center, causing minor material damage to the presidential palace and killing several people from a nearby neighborhood.

One of the incidents that have come under questioning happened on July 31, 2006 in the north of Bogotá, during which a truck-bomb killed a garbage collector and wounded ten soldiers who were driving past in a military truck. The Army's commander acknowledged on September 7 that two military officers are under investigation: "♡❤The recent attack with a car bomb, in which ten soldiers were wounded and a citizen died, and which had been attributed to outlawed groups, as well as the alleged confiscation of several explosives during the last two months, apparently do not to correspond to reality. These deceptions may have been carried out by unscrupulous people, including two army officials♡❤".

In addition to the case of the truck-bomb, doubts now surround a number of other related incidents, including the confiscation of several kilos of explosives, the discovery of a house-bomb and of three other car bombs in the latest weeks. In one of these cases, according to ♡❤El Tiempo♡❤, witnesses said that the same man that abandoned a taxi bomb in the south of the capital was the same man who claimed the cash rewards for the tip-off.

Only two military officers are currently under investigation. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACaracol%20Radio"&gt;Caracol Radio&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ station reported that, according to other military sources, there could be as many as seven members of the institution involved in the events.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=State%20Police%3A%20New%20York%20fugitive%20Ralph%20%27Bucky%27%20Phillips%20cornered&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

"We believe we have him contained. I won't say that I'm completely convinced that this is going to come to the conclusion we want," said Wayne Bennett, the New York State Police Superintendent.

Bennett also said that Phillips may be cornered in between &lt;a href="w%3ACarroll%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Carroll, New York&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARussell%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Russell, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and that Phillips "made a mistake" in threatening to fire upon an officer. Officers began the search for the fugitive around 2:00 a.m. after a man failed to stop for an officer performing a traffic stop. The man fled into the woods and officers responded with a massive search. Officers then used dogs to track the man down and at 9:00 a.m. was seen by at least two N.Y. troopers.

"I think he's made a mistake. I hope it's a big enough one and we can capitalize on it," added Bennett.

Phillips became one of the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;'s top ten most wanted men yesterday and the reward for his arrest or a tip leading to it jumped from $225,000 to $420,000.

Phillips broke out of an Erie County prison in &lt;a href="w%3AAlden%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Alden, New york&lt;/a&gt; with a can opener on April 2 and shot a N.Y. state trooper in June. He is also believed to have shot two more troopers on August 31 which resulted in the death of one trooper.

♡❤WSEE♡❤ is reporting that the U.S. military is assisting in the search for Phillips.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Experts%3A%20obesity%20is%20a%20bigger%20threat%20than%20AIDS%20or%20bird%20flu&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

From September 3 to 8, experts gathered at the 10th International Congress on Obesity in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, to discuss what they call the worldwide "&lt;a href="w%3AObesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; epidemic". According to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), 1 billion people in the world today are overweight, and 300 million of those are obese. "Obesity and overweight pose a major risk for serious diet-related chronic diseases, including &lt;a href="w%3ADiabetes%20mellitus%20type%202"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular disease, &lt;a href="w%3Ahypertension"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, and certain forms of &lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;", a WHO fact sheet states. According to AP, experts at the conference "have warned that obesity is a bigger threat than &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, and will easily overwhelm the world's health care systems if urgent action is not taken".

Of particular concern is the large number of overweight children. Dr. Stephan Rossner from Sweden's Karolinska University Hospital, a leading obesity expert who was present at the conference, has warned that as a result of the increasing number of overweight children, "we will have, within a decade or two, a number of young people who are on &lt;a href="w%3AKidney"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Adialysis"&gt;dialysis&lt;/a&gt;. There will not be organs for everybody". UK-based International Obesity Task Force has said that &lt;a href="w%3Ajunk%20food"&gt;junk food&lt;/a&gt; manufacturers target children, for example, through Internet advertising, chat rooms, text messages, and "advergames" on websites. Politicians are not doing enough to address the problem of obesity, including childhood obesity, the experts said.
According to Wikipedia, examples of junk food include, but are not limited to: hamburgers, pizza, candy, soda, and salty foods like potato chips and french fries. A well-known piece of junk food is the &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Mac"&gt;Big Mac&lt;/a&gt;. The US version of just one Big Mac burger contains 48% of &lt;a href="w%3ACalorie"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt; from fat, 47% &lt;a href="w%3ADietary%20Reference%20Intake"&gt;US Recommended Dietary Allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) of fat, 52% RDA of saturated fat, 26% RDA of &lt;a href="w%3Acholesterol"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, 42% RDA of sodium, and little nutritional value. It also has 18% of calories from &lt;a href="w%3Aprotein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;. According to WHO, most people need only about 5% calories from protein. Staples such as rice, corn, baked potatoes, pinto beans, as well as fruits and vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, oranges, and strawberries, provide more than this required amount of protein without the unhealthy amounts of fats or sodium, without cholesterol, and with plenty of &lt;a href="w%3ADietary%20fiber"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVitamin"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ADietary%20mineral"&gt;minerals&lt;/a&gt;.

Both WHO and the American &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) define overweight in adults as a &lt;a href="w%3ABody%20Mass%20Index"&gt;Body Mass Index&lt;/a&gt; (BMI) of 25 or above, and obese as a BMI of 30 or above. To combat overweight and obesity, WHO recommends that, among other things, people should be taking the following steps

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; * eating more fruit and vegetables, as well as nuts and whole grains;

&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; will have a televised address for the 5th anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11&lt;/a&gt; attacks. It will be held in the &lt;a href="w%3AHall%20of%20Honour"&gt;Hall of Honour&lt;/a&gt; in the Parliament Buildings. It will also be in both official languages (English and French). Harper will make the statement of five to eight minutes on national Canadian television.

The PM is expected to address concerns over &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%27s%20role%20in%20the%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;Canada's role in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, where 2,200 Canadian troops are in the midst of battling insurgents.

&lt;a href="w%3ACarolyn%20Stewart-Olsen"&gt;Carolyn Stewart-Olsen&lt;/a&gt; said that Harper wanted to recognize the 24 Canadians who perished in the attacks on the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Centre&lt;/a&gt; in New York. Olsen says Harper wants to speak to the "families and victims, and to people who fight terrorism on a daily basis." 

U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; said she will travel to &lt;a href="w%3AHalifax%20Regional%20Municipality%2C%20Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; on Monday to mark the anniversary.

The PM will deliver his statement at 6:00 p.m on Monday. There will be no audience for the address in the foyer except journalists. The statement will be available for television and radio broadcast.

The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the massive suicide bomb which killed 16 citizens, and two US soldiers near the Kabulian US Embassy. Master Sergeant Chris Miller commented, "A coalition convoy was the target of a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device this morning near the U.S. Embassy here."

The convoy was comprised of three armored Humvees. Sixteen Afghans were wounded in the attack, and several were killed. 

Gen. James Jones, NATO's supreme allied commander, said on Thursday that the troops have encountered "more resistance than we originally thought."

The fighting is extraordinarily intense. The intensity and ferocity of the fighting is far greater than in Iraq on a daily basis," Brig. Ed Butler, the commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, told ITV news on Friday. He echoed Jones' call for more troops. 

In western Afghanistan, four Italian soldiers were wounded Friday in a roadside bomb blast while on patrol, the Italian Defense Ministry said.

The ministry said an improvised explosive device detonated around 9 a.m. near Farah while an Italian military vehicle was on patrol.

The city of &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Panorama"&gt;Mount Panorama&lt;/a&gt; race circuit in Central Western &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; will host a "fitting tribute" to motor sport legend Peter Brock, according to Bathurst Mayor Norm Mann.

Brock, aged 61, died when he crashed his car during the Targa West rally in &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

Long regarded as "king of the mountain" in recognition of winning a record nine events such as the &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%201000"&gt;Bathurst 1000&lt;/a&gt; at Mount Panorama, Brock was regarded as an icon amongst the Bathurst community.

Bathurst mayor, Norm Mann said despite Brock having never lived in Bathurst, he was an honorary citizen. "Although he is not a local resident and has never lived here, Peter Brock was very much an honorary citizen of Bathurst and has over his career had a significant impact on the lives of many people in this community – our local radio station B-Rock FM is even named after him," said the mayor.

Mr Mann also said that preparations were being carried out at the National Motor Racing Museum at the foot of Mount Panorama for a display honouring the racing legend's life. The museum will also accept tributes to be passed onto the Brock family according to the Mayor.

The mayor promised that his council would host a fitting tribute to Mr Brock. "Council will make plans for a fitting tribute in honour of Peter's life and career in coming days."

Mr Mann's sentiment has been echoed by chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AV8%20Supercars"&gt;V8 Supercars Australia&lt;/a&gt; Tony Cochrane. Mr Cochrane said Bathurst would be the most appropriate place for a tribute to the motor racing icon. In a statement, Mr Cochrane said "The most befitting place for a tribute is Bathurst. He forged his name in motor sport on that mountain, I think the fans will come to expect something special and we will provide that. We will obviously give special thought to how we are going to do that and we will take into account the families' wishes."
