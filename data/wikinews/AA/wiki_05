Sir &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASir%20Richard%20Branson"&gt;Richard Branson&lt;/a&gt;, successful British entrepreneur, better known as the founder of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVirgin%20Group"&gt;Virgin&lt;/a&gt; brand, has made a suggestion to the next British chancellor to both save &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMG%20Rover"&gt;MG Rover&lt;/a&gt;, the largest independent manufacturer of cars in England until it &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMG%20Rover%23Potential%20deal%20with%20SAIC%20of%20China%20and%20its%20collapse"&gt;collapsed this spring&lt;/a&gt;, and help with rapidly rising oil demand. He wants the British government to give subsidies to the fallen car-maker so that it can be the first European producer of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHybrid%20car"&gt;hybrid cars&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Angolan Marburg virus still threat</h1>
♡❤♡April 19, 2005♡❤♡
Fearing that burial rites might be the cause of more cases of the &lt;a href="w%3AMarburg%20virus"&gt;Marburg virus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Dave Daigle says the transmission cycle has not yet been broken. Cases of persons fallen ill by the virus outside the province of &lt;a href="w%3AUige%20Province"&gt;Uige&lt;/a&gt; are reportedly connected to visits to that region.

The burial custom there for most families includes the preparation of the body, and kissing and embracing the deceased. The epidemic spreads through contact with body fluids.

The death toll so far, stands at 235 in the epidemic. The &lt;a href="w%3AEbola"&gt;Ebola-like fever&lt;/a&gt; cannot be treated with any known drugs. The best protection is wearing masks and gloves when in contact with a carrier.

<h1>Elwood Norris receives 2005 Lemelson-MIT Prize for invention</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Elwood%20Norris%20receives%202005%20Lemelson-MIT%20Prize%20for%20invention&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

MIT has announced that &lt;a href="w%3A%20Elwood%20Norris"&gt;Elwood "Woody" Norris&lt;/a&gt;, inventor of potentially revolutionary technologies of Hypersonic Sound beams and AirScooter flying vehicles, will receive this year's Lemelson-MIT prize for invention this Friday, April 22. The prize comes with an award of US$500,000, making it the largest single award for invention given in the United States.

<h2>Hypersonic Sound beams</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3AHyperSonic%20Sound"&gt;HyperSonic Sound&lt;/a&gt;, or HSS®, has been called by MIT "the first big improvement in &lt;a href="w%3AAcoustics"&gt;acoustics&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href="w%3ALoudspeaker"&gt;loudspeaker&lt;/a&gt; was invented 80 years ago". It represents a new way to focus audio in beams, rather like light is focused.

HSS works because &lt;a href="w%3ASound"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt; of sufficiently high &lt;a href="w%3AFrequency"&gt;frequency&lt;/a&gt; above human hearing does not normally spread out like audible frequency waves. These waves can be projected onto specific individuals, causing them to hear a sound that appears to be emanating from themselves, while others around them hear nothing.

Potential benefits could include the reduction of &lt;a href="w%3ANoise%20pollution"&gt;noise pollution&lt;/a&gt; in public places. Announcements, instructions, and advertisements could be aimed at individuals, not disturbing their neighbors. People in the same room could all listen to different music without the use of &lt;a href="w%3AHeadphones"&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt;.

Crank up the volume, and HSS could also be useful to military or law enforcement agencies. HSS beams can be focused up to 500 yards away, transmitting warnings or temporarily stunning and disabling a person with non-lethal force.

<h2>AirScooter flying vehicles</h2>

The AirScooter™ is a flying, &lt;a href="w%3AHelicopter"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;-like personal vehicle that is planned to be made available for sale later this year. The price is estimated to be less than US$50,000.

Weighing less than 300 pounds and able to carry a load of an additional 350 pounds, the AirScooter runs on ordinary &lt;a href="w%3AGasoline"&gt;gasoline&lt;/a&gt; rather than expensive airplane fuel, and is able to travel about 2 hours at 55 m.p.h. on a 5-gallon tank, at heights up to 10,000 feet above sea level. Its ultralight weight means that no &lt;a href="w%3APilot%20licensing%20and%20certification"&gt;pilot license&lt;/a&gt; is required to fly one.

The light weight is made possible by the production of a new AeroTwin 4-stroke engine specifically for the AirScooter, designed by &lt;a href="w%3AMotorcycle%20racing"&gt;motorcycle racing&lt;/a&gt; engine specialists at Pearson Motor Co of New Zealand. &lt;a href="w%3AMechanical%20equilibrium"&gt;Stability&lt;/a&gt; is provided by two rotors both set on a single shaft, which turn in opposite directions, eliminating the need for a tail rotor.

The craft is steered using only the hands on a motorcycle-like handlebar. Throttle up to gain altitude, turn left or right to rotate, and move the bars like a joystick to steer in different directions, including reverse.

Pictures and video of the new craft are available from the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.airscooter.com/pages/airscooter_media_files.htm"&gt;AirScooter.com website&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Woody Norris</h2>

Norris is a self-educated, independent inventor with boundless curiosity who never made it out of the 3rd grade in traditional schooling. He has been developing inventions for more than 30 years, particularly in audio technology, since taking apart his family's radio at the age of 8. He is 63 years old and has 11 children.

Part of the reason Norris was selected for the prize is his commitment to inspiring others. “There are classes to inventing. It isn't limited to science and technology. Writers, actors, cooks and artists are all inventors,” Norris says. “People need to be encouraged to go out there and pursue the fields that will help them create the wonderful things they are capable of achieving.”

Norris plans to use the prize money to establish a foundation to help other struggling, independent inventors like himself.

On Saturday April 16, students at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASimon%27s%20Rock%20College"&gt;Simon's Rock College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Barrington%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Great Barrington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Dr. Richard Wallace of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AA.L.I.C.E."&gt;A.L.I.C.E. AI Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for their first time tested &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Turing"&gt;Alan Turing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's thought-experiment. The ♡❤Imitation Game♡❤, based on the original Turing model for testing the ability of humans to recognize &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aartificial%20intelligence"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (AI), was carried out with nearly eighty human and AI participants.

The 'Original Imitation Game' is described in Turing's 1950 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AComputing%20machinery%20and%20intelligence"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A popularized version now dubbed the "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATuring%20test"&gt;Turing Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " involves a judge knowingly interviewing a software program and a human person during a computer chat, and then trying to discern which is which. The Turing Test has been conducted many times as Artificial Intelligence programs developed. However, no study was ever published following the guidelines of the original thought-experiment itself.

The Imitation Game involved playing a "gender guessing game", wherein two human subjects, a male and a female, communicate via computer chat to the judge. Both the male and the female would try to convince the judge that s/he is female. Turing's original question was, if a gender guessing game were done with two humans, and then with an AI replacing the male, would the judge be more accurate in guessing who the real female was?

Three students at Simon's Rock &amp;mdash; Cameo Wood, Melissa Leventhal, and Allyson Sgro &amp;mdash; wrote a grant to support the experiment, and shepherded the proposal through the Human Research Review Committee under the oversight of Professor Anne O'Dwyer. The experiment was funded by the departments of Natural Science and the department of Social Science at the college.

The experiment utilized a program called A.L.I.C.E., which is designed to hold one end of an interactive conversation. The program was provided by the ALICE Artificial Intelligence Foundation. Dr. Richard Wallace was on hand during the experiment to troubleshoot the AI robot, later gave a lecture about on The Anatomy of A.L.I.C.E. and blogged the event.

Six human subjects from Simon's Rock composed the human players in the game; the judges were recruited from various non-technical internet communities. Roughly eighty individuals participated in the experiment, which required the organizers to maintain strict secrecy about the experiment until it was concluded. All subjects who participated in the experiment were required to be over 18, not affiliated with the college, and were not allowed any foreknowledge of the use of AI in the experiment. Roughly 70 interviews were conducted over a three hour period last Saturday, via &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAOL%20Instant%20Messenger"&gt;AOL's Instant Messenger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a messaging tool that allows individuals to write to one another online.

The research team at Simon's Rock has started to analyze the data they acquired during the experiment and will be writing a paper for publication in the coming months. Inquiries regarding the experiment may be directed to researcher@theguessinggame.net.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AViktor%20Yushchenko"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt;, the president of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, will make an official visit to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; this Thursday. This will be the first visit to Romania of a foreign president since &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; became president of Romania in December 2004.
Yushchenko will receive an official welcome ceremony at &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACotroceni%20Palace"&gt;Cotroceni Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the residence of President Băsescu. The Ukrainian president will also give a speech during the afternoon to a joint meeting of the two Chambers of Parliament, in Bucharest's &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APalace%20of%20the%20Parliament"&gt;Palace of the Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, Europe's largest building.

After leaving Romania early on Friday morning, President Yushchenko will go to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AChisinau"&gt;Chişinău&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARepublic%20of%20Moldova"&gt;Republic of Moldova&lt;/a&gt;, to attend the &lt;a href="w%3AGUUAM"&gt;GUUAM&lt;/a&gt; meeting, a joint meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3Ahead%20of%20state"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAzerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMoldova"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt;. President Băsescu will also be present at the meeting, since one of the goals of his presidency was to promote stability in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; region, and most of the GUUAM countries have Black Sea coastlines.

The relationship between Romania and Ukraine has become fairly cool in the last few years, during the presidency of Leonid Kuchma, Yushchenko's predecessor. This was due to economic disputes, as well as a dispute over Ukraine's construction of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABastroe%20Channel"&gt;Bastroe Channel&lt;/a&gt;, which was to be built a few kilometres north of the Romanian border. The Bastroe Channel was opposed by Romania on the grounds that it would damage the Danube Delta ecosystem, affecting Romania's environment. Romania's point of view towards the project was also supported by the European Union and several environmental organisations worldwide.

However, when President Yushchenko was sworn in during the Orange Revolution last year, the two countries gradually improved ties, especially since Băsescu focussed more on the Black Sea region than his predecessor, Ion Illiescu, and said that Romania and Ukraine would try to reach an agreement on their problems without going to international courts.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; government has allocated 16.6 million &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aeuro"&gt;euros&lt;/a&gt; for the modernisation of two thermoelectric power plants that serve a residential area in the city of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArad"&gt;Arad&lt;/a&gt;, western Romania. The funds come in response to a request sent at the beginning of this year by the Arad municipal government.

The mayor of Arad, Gheorge Falcă, said that the modernisation was necessary because, up until now, apartments in the area could not be properly heated due to a significant loss of hot water caused by problems in the pipe network. According to the mayor, the installations will be fully modernised by this winter (December 2005). Falcă also added that, in years to come, he would request more funds from the national government in order to modernise all out-of-date power plants in the city, and therefore reduce the costs for consumers.

At the same time, the Romanian government has pledged to reduce pollution levels, especially in industrial cities like Arad, in order to comply with &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; environmental standards. Romania is set to join the EU in 2007. The government's target is that, by 2015, all plants or facilities using large combustion installations will have to align to EU environmental standards or will be forced to shut down. One of such plants is the Arad District Heating Plant, CET Arad, which is going to be modernised in the future. The modernisation is expected to take 100 million euros to complete.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has discussed its objectives for the future in a seminar about informational services development. Romanian Prime Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACalin%20Popescu%20Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Zsolt Nagy, presented the government's major targets for the expansion and development of information services.

These include the sale of the government's remaining shares in telecommunication corporations &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomtelecom"&gt;Romtelecom&lt;/a&gt; and Postelecom, the relaunching of mobile phone operator Cosmorom and the maintaining of tax breaks for programmers. Another important objective was the awarding of more &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A3G"&gt;3G&lt;/a&gt; licenses to mobile phone operators and more comprehensive online tax payment services. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConnex%20GSM"&gt;Connex&lt;/a&gt;, Romania's second largest mobile phone operator, launched a comprehensive 3G service this month, and more companies are expected to follow in the future.

MiniMax Discount, a recently-established joint venture between several &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; and foreign investors, will open its first three discount stores between today and April 28. The discount stores, which will be similar to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Asupermarket"&gt;supermarkets&lt;/a&gt;, will open in the southern Romanian cities of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASlatina"&gt;Slatina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUrziceni"&gt;Urziceni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATargoviste"&gt;Târgovişte&lt;/a&gt;. MiniMax invested 750,000 euro per outlet, with each store having 1,000 m² of floor space and a parking area for 100 cars. The first store to be opened will be the one in Slatina, with the other ones opening by April 28.

The company is planning to open a total of ten stores this year, as well as another twenty in 2006. It is expected that most of the stores will open in small- to medium-sized cities, of greater than 20,000 inhabitants, rather than larger cities of over 150,000 inhabitants. In a few years time, it has said that it plans to extend its network to over 100 stores.

A 15-year-old boy who allegedly stole a &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; tram and drove for 40 minutes picking up and setting down passengers, may yet be allowed to work as a tram driver, despite his nine charges related to the incident.

"We have a very good recruiting policy and anybody who passes the muster for our recruiting policy we'd be glad to offer a job to, provided he's old enough to hold a driver's license," Yarra Trams Deputy Chief Executive, Dennis Cliche, told ♡❤Australian Associated Press♡❤ on Monday.

Detective Senior Constable Barry Hills of Victoria Police, said of the boy, "He's a nice lad, he's a good lad. I think his obsession just got the better of him."

Described as wearing a jacket similar to official Yarra Trams uniforms, the boy was caught on Sunday night by police in east suburban Kew, 15km from where the tram was stolen, when electricity was shut off to the route.

He is also accused of stealing a tram on Friday night, from South Melbourne depot. It is said that he drove it twice between the depot and Port Melbourne.

The lad was thought to have picked up the keys from Box Hill depot three weeks ago, said Detective Senior Constable Hills.

"There are safety systems built in that he would have had to study and know how to drive this tram without engaging the safety systems, which are designed to shut the tram down," said Mr Cliche.

"So ... this is someone who's spent a lot of time and a lot of effort to go about this."

"When somebody takes one of our vehicles unauthorised it's of grave concern to us and we are conducting a full investigation - whether he's a 'trammie' or an individual who cares for trams, it makes no difference whatsoever," he said.

A full report on all depots, which would also look at the potential impact of terrorism, was due for release in three weeks.

Police say the boy, of Sunshine in Melbourne, has been charged with nine offences, including two counts each of theft of trams and conduct endangering life. The boy, whose name was not given, was released on bail to appear in the Melbourne Children's Court in June.

In a convoy ambush Monday in southeastern &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, 8 &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; rebels were killed and 16 captured after a fire fight that ended after Afghan coalition forces called in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; air power for support. There were no reported coalition casualties.

The convoy was travelling in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZabul%20province"&gt;Zabul's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dai Chopan district when the ambush occurred. Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman General Muhammad said, "After the ambush, fierce fighting broke out and we called in coalition air support," according to ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

U.S. ground forces were also involved in the fighting where several weapons and two satellite phones were seized from the rebels. Zabul province lies along the rugged Afghan-Pakistani border where pockets of &lt;a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; terror network are thought to be holding out.

The growing power of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; is clearly reflected in the decision, announced Tuesday, for the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; to begin charging newspapers and broadcasters to post wire stories, photos, and other content on their online editions. The changes go into effect January 1, 2006. An advisory committee meeting will be held in the fall to ease the transition.

As the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; draws more news consumers from traditional repositories of data, increasing numbers are demanding the stories on the Internet reflect the quick updating and coverage of a large wire network such as the Associated Press.

The rates the AP charges, known within as “assessments”, have risen by about 2.75 percent annually during the 90’s. Since the service is supposed to be not-for-profit and is owned by its customers, price increases are a tough sell. 

The formula for the new calculations still has not been set, making it difficult to determine how the changes will affect what the outlets charge for their online news coverage. Currently the AP bases rates on newspaper circulation or broadcast audience with the large ones footing the major part of the bill.

The AP is creating a computer database of news paraphernalia which includes stories, photos, graphics, audio and video. It is all designed to make it easier for news rooms to create usable content.

In a recent online poll conducted by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Advocate"&gt;The Advocate&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, some respondents spoke of their appreciation for the &lt;a href="w%3AGay%20and%20Lesbian%20Alliance%20Against%20Defamation"&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation&lt;/a&gt; (GLAAD). But the organization, which has recently seen the resignation of its director, Joan Garry, faces opposition from a vocal minority of its constituency, as gaged by criticism from some responses to the poll.

When asked by the publication, "Is GLAAD an effective advocate for the fair portrayal of gays and lesbians in the media?', at one point on April 18, the tally of 2294 votes showed a vote of no confidence with 58.5 percent voting "No" and 39 percent saying "Yes." But less than 12 hours later the tide turned as a tally of 4055 votes reported showed 62.6 percent voting "Yes" to 35.9 percent voting "No."
The Advocate poll contains plenty of comments from constituents who approve of GLAAD, and these are readily found among the poll results. What is new is the realization that some in GLAAD's constituency is upset with the organization for various reasons including: perceived organizational greed, high administrative pay, charges of waste and inaction, and other forms of claimed ineffectiveness.

Barry Prime has been appointed the new National Performance Director of &lt;a href="w%3ASwim%20Ireland"&gt;Swim Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, the governing body of swimming in &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr. Prime (50), a former &lt;a href="w%3AOlympics"&gt;British Olympian&lt;/a&gt;, has an extensive coaching background. He moved to &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in 1993 to take on the role of senior coach at the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Institute%20of%20Sport"&gt;Australian Institute of Sport&lt;/a&gt; (AIS) in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;. He spent 25 years coaching in &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; prior to his move to Australia. In Birmingham he trained five British swimmers to Olympic representation including &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Gillingham"&gt;Nick Gillingham&lt;/a&gt;.

Swim Ireland has struggled in recent years due to a sex abuse scandal and legal dispute with Sarah Keane who was made CEO last year. Further setbacks occurred earlier this year when the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Aquatics%20Center"&gt;National Aquatics Center&lt;/a&gt; (NAC) in &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; suffered storm damage to its roof resulting in closure since then.

<h1>U.S. federal communications agency revisits do-not-call registry</h1>
♡❤♡April 19, 2005♡❤♡ 

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; issued a consumer advisory on April 15 in response to a recent flurry of e-mails claiming cell phone users will soon have their phones assaulted by telemarketers. In a paper titled &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fcc.gov/cgb/donotcall/%23ordersandnotices"&gt;The Truth about Cell Phones and the National Do Not Call Registry,&lt;/a&gt; the FCC reasserted that it is prohibited for telemarketers to use automated dialers to contact &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; cell phones.

The paper notes the federal government itself does not maintain a national cell phone registry. Users of the do-not-call registry can, if they choose to, add cell numbers in addition to their traditional land-line listings. Up to three numbers per e-mail address can be added if done on-line.

The much anticipated do-not-call registry went live in October 2003. The registry has, in the FCC’s own words, been an “overwhelmingly popular initiative.” It serves as an option for consumers to stop unwanted telemarketing calls and currently contains over 80 million subscribers.

Additionally, in an FCC change to the registry guidelines effective January 2005, telemarketers are now required to update their call lists against the registry once each month. Previously, the update requirement was once every 3 months. Newer regulations also require marketers to unblock their numbers so users of caller ID will know when a telemarketer calls.

The U.S. contact information is 1-888-382-1222 by phone, or https://www.donotcall.gov/default.aspx by Internet, and registry to the do-not-call list is free.

&lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; shut down a main &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20reactor"&gt;nuclear reactor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Monday at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYongbyon"&gt;Yongbyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Officials worldwide suspect the reactor was shut down to allow for extraction of spent fuel rods. Once spent fuel rods that are rich in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aplutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are extracted from a shut-down reactor, they can be processed to yield the high-purity plutonium necessary for manufacturing an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aatomic%20weapon"&gt;atomic weapon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; officials initially pointed out the reactor could have been shut down for non-threatening reasons. It may have experienced mechanical difficulties, or North Korea may simply have bluffed, having no spent fuel rods to remove.

On Tuesday, North Korea confirmed the reactor was shut down to remove fuel rods for weapons processing. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Today"&gt;♡❤USA Today♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; quoted North Korea's ambassador to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Han Sang-ryol, saying the measure was taken to "increase its deterrent against a possible U.S. attack."

"The ball is in the U.S. court," Han said. "We asked the United States to change its hostile policy. Then we can believe the United States and enter the disarmament process. If the U.S. policy is normal and friendly, [North Korea] will feel safe."

North Korea has blamed harsh words from the United States for its reluctance to conduct talks regarding its nuclear program. Most recently, US Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; called North Korea an "outpost of tyranny," enraging &lt;a href="Kim%20Jong-il"&gt;Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of North Korea. 

The &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; estimates that North Korea has between two and six nuclear weapons in its arsenal, and told ♡❤USA Today♡❤ that additional plutonium gained from the reactor is enough for six more.

New &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMass%20grave"&gt;mass grave&lt;/a&gt; was discovered in a cave in Klina region, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUNMIK"&gt;UNMIK's&lt;/a&gt; report, the remains are probably of non-Albanian victims, killed in Kosovo during the war in 1998. 

According to B92 there are around 46 bodies of people from villages Retimlje, Opteruša and Zočište. UNMIK's forensic team is still working on exhumation and it will take around ten days to search the whole location. Jose Pablo Baraybar, head of the Office on Missing Persons and Forensics, could not specify the number or identity of victims.

Serbian president of Coordination Center for Kosovo and Metohija, Nebojša Čović, said that Serbian authorities knew about the mass grave, but were denied access until now.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (AP) announced yesterday that it will charge its members for online content, starting on January 1, 2006. The decision occurred at its annual board meeting.

Until the new pricing arrangement takes place, news sites that purchase AP content for their print editions have been able to use the same content on their websites at no additional charge. No pricing scheme has been announced, but the AP did say that it would increase its fees less than usual this year to ease the transition.

Burl Osborne, the chairman of the AP's board, stated that since the creation of the internet, the "AP's philosophy was to promote member efforts to develop this new medium, and to give those fledgling online efforts time to grow."

The price increase was not the only plan mentioned at the meeting. According to an AP report in the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, "The AP also plans to introduce a new multimedia package designed to appeal to young adults, a prized advertising demographic deeply immersed in the Internet and other digital media."

Papyrologists at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oxford"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; in England last week reported major literary finds in examining old fragments of &lt;a href="w%3Apapyrus"&gt;papyrus&lt;/a&gt; with a new technique: &lt;a href="http%3A//eo1.gsfc.nasa.gov/Technology/ALImultispectral.htm"&gt;multi-spectral imaging&lt;/a&gt; (MSI). The fragments were unearthed near the buried town of &lt;a href="w%3AOxyrhynchus"&gt;Oxyrhynchus, Egypt&lt;/a&gt; in a major archaeological find a century ago. Many of the fragments were unable to be read until now.

<h2>Multi-Spectral Imaging</h2>

Multi-Spectral Imaging (MSI) is based on technology originally developed by &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; to photograph features of other worlds in bands beyond the visible spectrum, both &lt;a href="w%3Ainfrared"&gt;infrared&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aultraviolet"&gt;ultraviolet&lt;/a&gt;. The technology was adapted by researchers at &lt;a href="w%3ABrigham%20Young%20University"&gt;Brigham Young University&lt;/a&gt; to filter a narrow bandwidth of infrared light, which reacts with ink but not the surrounding material, making the writing stand out more easily and plainly than before and enabling non-destructive photographs of formerly invisible text to be taken.

MSI was successfully used in 1999 to read many of the &lt;a href="w%3AHerculaneum"&gt;Herculaneum&lt;/a&gt; Scrolls, which were considered to be blank or charred beyond recognition until then. Herculaneum was a town in ancient Italy that was buried next to &lt;a href="w%3APompeii"&gt;Pompeii&lt;/a&gt; in its volcanic eruption of 79 AD, leaving many scrolls damaged but naturally preserved.

<h2>Oxyrhynchus</h2>

Oxyrhynchus, whose name means "sharp-nose", was a town located along a tributary of the &lt;a href="w%3ANile"&gt;Nile&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3Aancient%20Egypt"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and populated largely by Greek immigrants. The name refers to a river-dwelling fish with a long snout that was worshiped as the town's patron deity by a local cult.

In between the town's surrounding wall and the local farmlands, there developed a number of dumping sites for papyrus and other materials, many of which have survived to the present day buried under mounds of sand because of dry, rainless local conditions. Papyrus, a paper-like writing surface made from reeds along the Nile river, normally does not last and no actual books written on ancient papyri have been uncovered.

The site was explored in the late 19th century by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt of Oxford University, during which about 100,000 fragments of papyrus were unearthed, which today are stored at &lt;a href="w%3AAshmolean%20Museum"&gt;Sackler Library&lt;/a&gt;, Oxford, in the largest collection of its kind in the world.

<h2>Classical and Christian Writings</h2>

Oxyrhynchus was not noted as a center of learning, and 90% of the fragments found there are expected to be mundane yet useful in reconstructing ancient daily life, including such things as "codes, edicts, registers, official correspondence, census-returns, tax-assessments, petitions, court-records; sales, leases, wills, bills, accounts, inventories, horoscopes, [and] private letters". According to researchers on the project, "the mass of unedited material represents the random waste-paper of seven centuries of Greco-Egyptian life."

The remaining 10% could possibly contain unknown portions of literary classics of Greek and Roman antiquity, or even lost Christian gospel copies or apocryphal writings. Among the items currently being worked on are parts of a play by &lt;a href="w%3ASophocles"&gt;Sophocles&lt;/a&gt;, a lost novel by &lt;a href="w%3ALucian"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;, mythological poetry by &lt;a href="w%3AParthenius%20of%20Nicaea"&gt;Parthenius of Nicaea&lt;/a&gt;, an elegiac poem by &lt;a href="w%3AArchilochus"&gt;Archilochus&lt;/a&gt;, and other writings by &lt;a href="w%3AEuripides"&gt;Euripides&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHesiod"&gt;Hesiod&lt;/a&gt;.

Given that Oxyrhynchus was also the site of a discovery of portions of the &lt;a href="w%3AGospel%20of%20Thomas"&gt;Gospel of Thomas&lt;/a&gt; (although that discovery was later overshadowed by the discovery of a more complete copy among the &lt;a href="w%3ADead%20Sea%20Scrolls"&gt;Dead Sea Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;), many classical scholars are excited by the new discoveries.

“The Oxyrhynchus collection is of unparalleled importance — especially now that it can be read fully and relatively quickly,” said Dr. Dirk Obbink of Oxford, who is leading the imaging project. “The material will shed light on virtually every aspect of life in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt and, by extension, in the classical world as a whole.”

The amount of new material, estimated to be around 5 million words, could expand the entire storehouse of classical writings by as much as 20%.

Digital photographs of some of the writings are expected to be published as early as next month; given the number of fragments, the effort in documenting and preserving them may continue as long as the next decade.

<h1>Google Maps, Google Local launches for Britain and Ireland</h1>
♡❤♡April 20, 2005♡❤♡ 

Google has extended its &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.co.uk/"&gt;mapping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//local.google.co.uk/"&gt;local searching&lt;/a&gt; services to the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.

Google Maps first launched in North America on February 8 2005, and proved popular with its innovative user interface. Google Maps UK is the first mapping website to be offered by Google outside of North America.

Two weeks ago Google added satellite imagery to its maps after buying the Keyhole company. Google Maps UK currently does not offer a similar service.

The Google Local service offers users two search boxes - one for the search terms, and a second to specify a location, for example a postcode or 'near London'. This enables users to find business in or near a specific location.

Google also introduced their &lt;a href="http%3A//www.google.co.uk/sms/index.html"&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt; service to the UK. This allows users to get information - both abstract, such as dictionary definitions and the answers to mathematical calculations - and geographical, such as driving directions or the address of nearby businesses.

<h1>Australian blitz on fish poaching</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20blitz%20on%20fish%20poaching&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Australian officials have impounded 27 Indonesian boats and 240 crew off the country's north coast, in what it says is the biggest operation against illegal fishing so far. Fisheries Minister, Ian Macdonald, told the nation's ♡❤ABC Radio♡❤ that a number of boats caught fishing for shark fin and reef fish had been taken to Gove and Darwin.

The nine-day joint navy, customs and army "Operation Clearwater" was continuing, and had taken months to plan.

"I think all of the illegal vessels up there, because of their inter-vessel communication will now be aware that there is a major sting on by the Australian authorities and those that haven't been arrested, I think will be hightailing it back to Indonesian ports as we speak," said Senator MacDonald.

Intelligence indicated what he called "organised transnational criminal activity", including some Asian connections beyond the Indonesian village ports where the vessels originated, but the activity was apparently limited to illegal fishing, and did not include smuggling.

"We are talking about large-scale commercial operations rather than simply subsistence fishing," Macdonald said in a statement, indicating that fifteen of the boats were large vessels with ice for storage. Two boats each had one tonne of fish, and shark fin.

Fishing by some Indonesian peoples has occurred legitimately in the area between the two nations for hundreds of years before European colonization. A 1906 Australian claim on as much as 80% of the waters has since been softened by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two governments, recognizing some traditional fishing rights.

However analysts say the Australian government strategy is flawed, since it is based on the fishing technology employed, rather than catch numbers. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.deh.gov.au/coasts/mpa/bajo/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.insideindonesia.org/edit54/watson.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.insideindonesia.org/edit46/elliott.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

At time of writing, it has not been ascertained whether the currently detained vessels were fishing in such "traditional" waters or not, or whether they were operated by crews who would have traditional fishing rights, if they had been in compliance with the MOU.

Senator MacDonald told the ♡❤ABC Radio♡❤ programme ♡❤AM♡❤ that he expected in the case of those thought to have been fishing in Australian waters illegally, the captain and perhaps the senior fishing master would be charged, with other crew being immediately repatriated to Indonesia.

As for the boats, "We're required by international law to offer them to bond them back to the owners, but as the crew are immediately repatriated the ability of the owners to get them back to Indonesia ... is fairly limited," the Senator explained.

"I would expect that most of these boats apprehended in operation Clearwater will actually be forfeited to the crown and will be destroyed."

The fishermen were expected to appear in court next week, reported ♡❤Reuters♡❤ news agency. An Indonesian fisherman was last week fined $A130,000, setting a new record, after his boat was caught off with over 100kg of dried reef fish, 300kg of fish on ice and 10kg of dried shark fin.

The Northern Territory Fisheries Minister, Kon Vatskalis, on ♡❤ABC Radio♡❤ asked the Federal Government to commit the same level of resources permanently.

"Provide the extra funding, provide the extra resources to the Navy and the Customs and then they will be able to stop the illegal boats, not only when they run an operation but every day, every week, every month," Mr Vatskalis told the ABC.

Italian Prime Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; resigned on Wednesday, handing in his letter to Italy’s President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACarlo%20Azeglio%20Ciampi"&gt;Carlo Azeglio Ciampi&lt;/a&gt;.

A statement from the President’s office said Berlusconi had tendered the resignation of his cabinet. This brings Italy’s longest-serving government since &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; to a close.

The Prime Minister pledged to form a stronger coalition government than the present one, which has been weakened by a sluggish economy and the Prime Minister’s close relationship with George Bush and the war in Iraq.

His &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AForza%20Italia"&gt;Forza Italia&lt;/a&gt; party was crushed in regional elections this month. Two other parties, the centrist &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnion%20of%20Christian%20and%20Centre%20Democrats"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and a tiny New Italian Socialist Party bailed out of his coalition, triggering the crisis.

Berlusconi addressed the Senate, then went to the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AQuirinale"&gt;Quirinale&lt;/a&gt; presidential palace and announced his resignation and his plans to form a new government. He stated that the coalition has a loose agreement to form a new government that will last until elections scheduled for next year. It is heavily speculated that the parties composing the coalition are still debating about which ministers to choose.

He added that the crisis itself and resignations were simply a process dictated by the laws more than a necessary step. He claimed that the anticipated election time is not an option (even though it was used as a threat by UDC and PSI parties a few days earlier).

He also said that a new government, still headed by him, will be welcomed by the entire center-right coalition.

After several months in &lt;a href="w%3Abeta%20testing"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOpera%20%28web%20browser%29"&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; 8 for &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; was released yesterday. The Opera browser is considered by many to be fast, small and standards-compliant.

Håkon Wium Lie, the CTO of &lt;a href="w%3AOpera%20Software"&gt;Opera Software&lt;/a&gt; said "The vast majority of Internet users have had to deal with a slow and insecure browser for too long. People are spending more time online, and with the increase in online fraud it is vital that they have a browser that is fast, secure and easy to use. That's what we offer with Opera 8." He described Opera 8 as a "major leap in browser innovation".

This version included many new features including a new unique security feature, advanced page-resizing, &lt;a href="w%3Atabbed%20browsing"&gt;tabbed browsing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Apop-up%20ad"&gt;pop up&lt;/a&gt; blocking. Among the new &lt;a href="w%3AOpera%20browser%20features"&gt;features for Opera&lt;/a&gt; 8 is the support for voice; Opera can be both voice controlled and act as a screen reader.

Opera 8 for Windows is available in English, German, Dutch, and Polish, with more languages to soon follow. The Linux version is available in English, with more languages to follow. A beta version of Opera 8 for Mac (English) is also available.

A &lt;a href="w%3Aspyware"&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt;-free, &lt;a href="w%3AAdware"&gt;ad-supported&lt;/a&gt; version of Opera 8 is available free of charge. A small banner or text ad appears at the top of the screen. A version of Opera without ads is available for US$39 or US$20 for students.

Opera Software ASA is headquartered in &lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, Norway. According to the company itself, it is an industry leader in the development of Web browser technology, particularly in smartphone, PDA, home media, and vertical markets.

Opera is cross platform with versions for Windows, Linux, &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS"&gt;Mac OS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASymbian%20OS"&gt;Symbian OS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Mobile"&gt;Windows Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABREW"&gt;BREW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQNX"&gt;QNX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATRON%20Project"&gt;TRON&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFreeBSD"&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASolaris"&gt;Solaris&lt;/a&gt;, and Mediahighway.

Opera 8 can be downloaded at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.opera.com/download"&gt;Opera's official website&lt;/a&gt;.

Amid unrest in the &lt;a href="w%3AEcuador"&gt;Ecuadoran&lt;/a&gt; capital city of &lt;a href="w%3AQuito"&gt;Quito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALucio%20Gutierrez"&gt;President General Lucio Gutierrez&lt;/a&gt; has been removed from his office by congress. &lt;a href="w%3AAlfredo%20Palacio"&gt;Vice-President Alfredo Palacio&lt;/a&gt; was voted in unanimously by deputies to replace Mr Gutierrez who is accused of abandoning his post. 

The ♡❤BBC♡❤ reports Gutierrez left the presidential palace by helicopter after sparking protests when he tried to overhaul the Supreme Court. He is now in the Brazilian embassy in Quito where he has applied for asylum (www.planetmafia.net), as confirmed by the Brazilian department of foreign affairs.

In the worst political turmoil experienced in Quito in nearly a century, panic is evident. Many families have rushed to supermarkets to stock up in anticipation of further violence. The cause of this panic is the sudden escalation of violence in the protests and anti-government demonstrations that have been underway for a week. 

Protests began as a reaction to the government’s unconstitutional appointment of a partisan Supreme Court. Last week, the inability of the Congress to resolve the problem led broadcaster ♡❤Radio La Luna♡❤ to call for a spontaneous demonstration against the government by the citizenry, without the intervention of politicians. The success of this demonstration caused it to be repeated each night when thousands of people went into the streets singing and banging on kitchenware. 

On Friday, President Gutierrez, a self proclaimed "dictocrat" (dictator for the opposition but democrat to his supporters), declared a &lt;a href="w%3Astate%20of%20emergency"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt; in Quito, and suspended all civil liberties in the capital. (In the past, this president has not shown himself to be a friend of the constitutional order, and was part of a 2001 coup which overthrew President Jamil Mahuad). The president sent armed forces to shut down ♡❤Radio La Luna♡❤, but when the troops were met by thousands of unarmed civilians, they stepped down. The President was forced to cancel the state of emergency within 24 hours given the tumultuous uproar.

The government instead called its supporters from the provinces to come to Quito and fight the protesters in the streets. Renan Borbua, one of the President's staunchest allies in &lt;a href="w%3AGuayaquil"&gt;Guayaquil&lt;/a&gt;, announced that buses packed with cudgel and machete-wielding thugs were on their way to Quito. Quito’s Mayor Paco Moncayo, and the prefect of Pichincha declared the highways closed and refused the ‘thugs’ a way into Quito. Nonetheless many government sympathizers were reported near the capital, looting stores and destroying parked automobiles.

The government also ordered the National Police to suppress the protesters, a move leading Quito’s mayor to declare that the National Police were no longer viewed as legitimate in the city. Also as a response to the President’s order, the Commander of the National Police resigned in protest, but was promptly replaced by the President’s own cousin. So far the Police have killed one person, a &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chilean&lt;/a&gt; reporter, and injured hundreds. Roads are blocked, and numerous fires have been started as a response to the Police’s use of riot-gas.

It is unclear where the Ecuadorian military stands on this issue. Both sides have claimed its support. Ecuador’s provinces have been declaring themselves for or against the government, and depending on the ultimate position of the military, civil war looms as a dire possibility in everyone’s minds.

&lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Awhaling"&gt;whaling&lt;/a&gt; season started on Monday with the highest quota in over a decade. Fishermen are entitled to harpoon up to 797 whales before the end of the season on August 31st.

Last years quota of 670 was raised this year despite fishermen failing to reach their quota last year. Environmental activists from groups such as &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; have denounced the increase. Speaking to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, one activist said "Increased whaling is no solution for the problems along the coast." However despite international opposition, it is unlikely Norway will end whaling anytime soon.

Norway is the only country in the world to allow commercial whaling. &lt;a href="w%3AIceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; do so solely on a research basis. Whale meat is used as steaks and in hamburgers and sausages in Norway. The number of whales caught by Norway has steadily increased since resumption of whaling in 1993, with the 226 caught that year rising to over 500 in 1997 and 670 in 2003.

The economic argument is that whaling provides employment and economic stimulant for fishery, logistic, restaurant and other related industries in developed countries. However many countries continue to argue that, if properly developed, whale-watching could be far more profitable and create far more jobs than whale killing.

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;President Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt; in a press conference to reporters Wednesday was quoted saying:

He promises more details in the coming days.

The presidential news conference was in response to events unfolding by reports from &lt;a href="w%3AShia"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; officials. They said Saturday that as many as 100 Shi’ites were taken hostage by &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; fighters, and were threatened with death in the town of al-Madain, near &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. An Iraqi security force on Monday raided the town of about 1,000 families, but found no evidence of a hostage situation. The Shi’ite officials later said the bodies &amp;mdash; believed to be the hostages &amp;mdash; were found in the Tigris River.

In a separate incident 200km north of Baghdad in Haditha, after hearing shots reporters and residents found the bodies of 19 men executed in a soccer stadium on Wednesday. It is believed those shot were Iraqi soldiers executed by anti-government fighters, according to an Interior Ministry official, although the victims were not dressed in military garb. They were thought to have been heading home for a holiday marking the birthday of the prophet &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; when abducted by insurgents.

The Chatterbox Challenge is a competition for &lt;a href="w%3Achatbot"&gt;chatbots&lt;/a&gt; (computer programmes designed to imitate human conversation). It has categories such as Best Learning Bot and Most Knowledgeable Bot, but also has a contest for the Most Popular Bot, which is decided by users voting. The voting runs through April, so time is running out to vote for your favorite bot.

The 2005 competition has over 100 bots entered. Well-known bots, such as AI Alex, ALICE, Ella, and Jabberwacky, are in the competition, as well as newer creations such as Barry DeFacto from two-time Loebner winner Robby Garner, and RoboMatix X1 from Egypt. The current leader is the relatively new SmarterChild, but a lot can change in the next ten days.

Contest organiser Wendell Cowart says, "The sheer variety of the chatbots entered is quite amazing... Chatbot names range from Aib to Zoe, and personalities vary from a banjo plucking hill-billy to a serial killer".

<h1>Iraqi PM Allawi survives fifth attempted assassination</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iraqi%20PM%20Allawi%20survives%20fifth%20attempted%20assassination&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Outgoing Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIyad%20Allawi"&gt;Iyad Allawi&lt;/a&gt; of Iraq escaped an assassin's bomb around 11pm local time on Wednesday night. In an attack aimed at his convoy in a residential part of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, "[The suicide bomber] did not stop and blew himself up almost near the middle of the convoy," said Allawi spokesman Thaer al-Naqib.

The bomb was set off by the attacker from a pickup truck loaded with &lt;a href="w%3ATrinitrotoluene"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMortar%20%28artillery%29"&gt;mortar rounds&lt;/a&gt;, after police opened fire at him. The resulting explosion killed two policemen and wounded at least one other, and was large enough to damage some nearby homes.

This news follows a different assassination attempt on April 12 last week against Iraq's Deputy Interior Minister Tariq al-Baldawi by gunmen in two cars who attacked his convoy; al-Baldawi escaped without harm in that attack.

In addition, three other car bombs are known to have been set off in the area of the Iraqi capital during the same day. Targets included a US military convoy, a police station, and a police patrol, resulting in the wounding of more than a dozen civilians and the deaths of two victims, including one child, according to sources reported by the Australian.

This is the fifth assassination attempt on Allawi himself. Previous attempts on Allawi have included a violent attack in 1978 by an axe-wielding intruder in his home believed to have been instigated by &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, which nearly severed Allawi's leg at the knee and also injured the arm of his wife, who was sleeping.

Allawi has received criticism from various groups in the past related to his activities on behalf of the American-appointed &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Governing%20Council"&gt;Interim Governing Council&lt;/a&gt; of Iraq.

Last year, militants under the leadership of alleged al-Qaida operative &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt; offered $285,000 for the killing of Allawi, which may or may not be related to the most recent attack.

Envirocare, a corporation that runs a landfill in &lt;a href="w%3AUtah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; that accepts &lt;a href="w%3ARadioactive%20waste"&gt;radioactive waste&lt;/a&gt;, has turned away a shipment of soil from around the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in &lt;a href="w%3AWiscasset%2C%20Maine"&gt;Wiscasset, Maine&lt;/a&gt;, the ♡❤Portland Press Herald♡❤ reported. The soil, which is held in 48 boxcars, was contaminated during the 26 years during which the Maine Yankee plant generated electricity. The shipment was refused due to excess water in previous shipments. 

The plant stopped producing electricity in 1997; its concrete dome was detonated in September of 2004. The decommissioning is scheduled for completion by the summer of 2005.

In a related development, a Wiscasset environmental organization, the &lt;a href="w%3AChewonki%20Foundation"&gt;Chewonki Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, has taken possession of a 200 acre portion of the former power plant's lands; the Foundation will act as stewards of the land, according to the ♡❤Wiscasset Newspaper♡❤. The plot, known as Eaton Farm for its previous agricultural use, will be the site of what Chewonki Foundation Executive Director W. Donald Hudson, Ph.D., calls, "the coolest trail in the state of Maine." The five miles of trail on the Eaton Farm land will be part of a 12 mile trail that may eventually run from downtown Wiscasset to Montsweag Bay.

The 15-year-old Australian boy charged on Sunday night related to the alleged theft of a Tram, faces another nine charges over prior incidents, bringing the total to 18 charges. The new allegations relate to theft of a bus, attempted theft of a train, and another incident with a tram.

On Monday he was also charged over an incident, in which a tram was allegedly stolen from Southbank on Friday.

The boy was arrested yesterday at his Sunshine home and bailed to appear in Melbourne Children's Court in June, over the nine new charges.

On Monday, Yarra Trams spokesperson Colin Tyrus told ♡❤The Age♡❤ that there had been "a mystery collision in the depot on April 10".

"After what happened on Sunday we obviously reported all of that to the police and we are continuing to assist them with their inquiries," Mr Tyrus said.

Police allege he drove a vehicle in the Southbank yard and hit another tram, on April 10, causing $2000 damage.

And on April 9, it is alleged, he jumped a fence at a Footscray bus depot, found some keys and drove a bus around the yard. Later, it is believed he tried unsuccessfully to start a diesel train at a rail yard in North Melbourne, and then absconded carrying the keys.

In an unusually contentious hearing, Senators &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJudd%20Gregg"&gt;Judd Gregg&lt;/a&gt; (R-NH) and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AOlympia%20Snowe"&gt;Olympia Snowe&lt;/a&gt; (R-Maine) argued the pros and cons of allowing the importation of drugs from countries where there are good safety controls and prices that are 50 to 70 percent below U.S. prices.

Laws to legalize that practice, which has found favor with 77 percent of Americans in a poll released on Wednesday, are under attack by the American drug makers and their friends in Congress.

Sen. Gregg, his face turning pink with anger at times, accused Senator Snowe of throwing away 100 years of federal law by advocating the bill.

Snowe replied that the bill would bring foreign drugs, mainly from Canada, Europe and other countries--provided those drugs already have FDA approval--under the aegis of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFDA"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;. Former FDA commissioner &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADavid%20Kessler"&gt;David Kessler&lt;/a&gt; agreed during testimony, and said that legalizing prescription imports from Canada and elsewhere would make for safer prescriptions for U.S. consumers.

Snowe said, “We send men and women up to space every day, and we can’t figure this out?”

Senator &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADavid%20Vitter"&gt;David Vitter&lt;/a&gt;, R-La, weighed in on Snowe’s side, “Safety is a huge reason we should pass legislation like this,” he said.

Reporters said the two jousted back and forth for quite a while, not allowing each other to finish an answer, each accusing the other of failing to answer.

“I am answering your question,” Snowe said at one point. “You don’t like the answer.”

Opponents say that curbing drug prices could discourage research into new products. Snowe countered that drug development in the United States totals $32 billion, compared to $26 billion in Europe.

The two feuding lawmakers live on northern &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANew%20England"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;’s Canadian border and are under pressure from senior citizen’s groups to allow American consumers to import drugs at cheaper costs.

Appearing before Judge William Ledbetter Jr. in &lt;a href="w%3ASpotsylvania%20County"&gt;Spotsylvania County&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACircuit%20Court"&gt;Circuit Court&lt;/a&gt;, the fatal dog mauling defendant Deanna Large plead not guilty Wednesday to charges of involuntary manslaughter and three misdemeanor counts of letting a dangerous dog run at large.

Large is the alleged owner of three &lt;a href="w%3APit%20bull"&gt;pit bulls&lt;/a&gt; that attacked and killed an 82-year-old neighbor as she walked her dog in the front yard of her home. Police responding to the incident on March 8, shot two of the dogs at the scene and later euthanized the third.
No one in &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; has ever been convicted of an involuntary manslaughter charge in connection with their ownership of dogs. The only similar case, in the late 1960’s in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Amherst%20County"&gt;Amherst County&lt;/a&gt;, was dismissed.

The commonwealth’s prosecuting attorney, William F. Neely said, “That’s a prosecutor’s job whenever you see the law being flagrantly broken is to try and push the envelope,” explaining the seriousness of charges against Large who faces 13 years in prison. Further adding that, “The real issues are legal and not factual, I think. If the commonwealth prevails in getting this case to stand up on the law, it may possibly even turn into a guilty plea.”

Large, who is free on a US$10,000 &lt;a href="w%3ABail%20bond"&gt;bond&lt;/a&gt;, asked for a jury trial which was set for August 16.

During her March 24 &lt;a href="w%3Aarraignment"&gt;arraignment&lt;/a&gt;, to Judge Ledbetter she answered “Yes sir," on whether she would hire her own defense lawyer. The judge appointed &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20defender"&gt;public defender&lt;/a&gt; Eugene Frost to represent Large when she did not appear with a lawyer.

The Government of the Republic of the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; (GRP) and &lt;a href="w%3AMoro%20Islamic%20Liberation%20Front"&gt;Moro Islamic Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; (MILF) announced substantial points of agreement this Thursday on key issues related to Ancestral Domain that may bring peace to the troubled Mindanao region in the months ahead.

The announcement came as a result of a three-day conference this week held in Malaysia in the town of Port Dickinson. "I would like to thank Malaysian Prime Minster Abdullah Badawi not only for leading the ceasefire process but for facilitating the substantive negotiations", stated GRP President &lt;a href="w%3AGloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;.

Malaysia has led an International Monitoring Team attempting to support and enforce the cease-fire both sides agreed to in 1997, although violence has occasionally flared up, even in the days leading up to the meeting. 

"Since we have been talking peace to the Philippine government, this is the first time we have touched on the substantive agenda of the peace process," said the chief negotiator for MILF, Mohaqher Iqbal.

The areas of concern in this week's talks relate to the Ancestral Domain portion of the Tripoli Agreement of June 22, 2001. Ancestral domain refers to territories claimed to be inhabited by the ancestors of indigenous peoples, and was discussed by the two groups in terms of concept, territory, governance, and resources. Security and Rehabilitative Aspects of this and other agreements have already been discussed and are currently being implemented.

"We have had some detailed consensus points [concerning the land issue]," said Silvestre Afable Jr., chief negotiator for GRP. "We agreed that we have bridged 60 or 70 percent of the issue in the area of ancestral domain." However, the spokesmen declined to cite the specific areas of agreement.

The predominantly Roman Catholic nation has seen outbreaks of kidnapping and violence with Muslim separatists groups such as MILF and the former &lt;a href="w%3AMoro%20National%20Liberation%20Front"&gt;Moro National Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; (MNFL) which concluded separate peace talks in 1987. Fighting since the 1960s has resulted in at least 120,000 deaths. 

The MILF is estimated to currently have 11,000-12,000 members or more. The term Moro in the group's name comes from the Spanish term for Arab Muslims, or &lt;a href="w%3AMoors"&gt;Moors&lt;/a&gt;, used during the &lt;a href="w%3AReconquista"&gt;Reconquista&lt;/a&gt; period.

The area of land under discussion, called &lt;a href="w%3ABangsamoro"&gt;Bangsamoro&lt;/a&gt;, refers to an area of the southern Philippines, including the island of Mindanao and other areas, claimed by the MILF as their ancestral homeland. This area could include as much as one-third of the Philippines.

This meeting was the seventh in a series of GRP-MLF Exploratory Talks, and the first to result in a breakthrough on substantive issues not related to immediate security concerns. 

Further talks are planned for next month in Malaysia, but full resolution of the conflict is not expected at least until peace talks begin in June. Remaining potential areas of conflict such as the issue of governance must also be resolved.

<h1>Major US bankruptcy reform bill signed into law</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Major%20US%20bankruptcy%20reform%20bill%20signed%20into%20law&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

U.S. President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; signed into law Wednesday a major &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; reform bill, making the most sweeping changes to the laws of personal bankruptcy in the past two decades. &lt;a href="http%3A//thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z%3Fd109%3As.00256%3A"&gt;Bill S.256&lt;/a&gt; is predicted to reduce the chances of filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy for 30,000 to 210,000 families per year, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute.

The legislation was strongly opposed by some consumer advocates and by some Democrats in Congress, who complained about the lack of debate on exemptions they attempted to introduce and tried to derail the passage of the bill. Those who are unable to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy will then be forced to file under Chapter 13, which requires payment of some debts by order of a judge based on the financial resources of the debtor.

Opponents said the bill will end a chance for a fresh start in the financial lives of the American people by keeping them in debt to collection agencies, as well as credit card companies and banks who have made it easy to obtain high credit limits amid mounting consumer debt.

In his remarks before signing the bill, which he supported, Bush said, "The bipartisan bill I'm
about to sign makes common-sense reforms to our bankruptcy laws. By restoring
integrity to the bankruptcy process, this law will make our financial system
stronger and better. By making the system fairer for creditors and debtors,
we will ensure that more Americans can get access to affordable credit."

The bankruptcy bill received a 302-126 approval in the house, after receiving a 74-25 vote in the Senate last month following strong, mostly partisan debate.

The US bankruptcy system was established in 1898. It allowed judges and debtors to come to terms with the costly medical bills that can follow a relative's death, or a family illness. Such cases form nearly half of all bankruptcies filed in the USA, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute.

Now many of those people will have to work out repayment plans suitable to creditors instead of having debts erased by a judge, according to the new law, which takes effect in six months.

In the past, a judge or court representative would calculate an individual's income and subtract necessities of life to come up with a practical repayment plan of some debt. The new law stipulates that a graph, showing the poverty level in whichever state the consumer is living will be the criteria. It assumes that if people can subsist at that poverty level, then everything over that can be used to repay creditors.

Additionally, a provision that allowed debtors to file their own Chapter 7 fresh start bankruptcy has been changed to require a lawyer, paid by the debtor, to do the filing.

The new law also erased "" provisions in lending laws, with some lawmakers saying that paying 30 percent interest was not too much when a debtor was behind on payments.

But Bush said that credit will "be more affordable because when bankruptcy is less common, credit can be extended to more people at better rates," meeting demands of the credit card companies which they have been pressing for the last eight years.

"The big winners under the new law will be the special interests that literally wrote it, particularly the credit card industry," said Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConsumer%20Federation%20of%20America"&gt;Consumer Federation of America&lt;/a&gt;. "This is particularly ironic because reckless and abusive lending practices by credit card companies have driven many Americans to the brink of bankruptcy."

The forces arrayed on the losing side of this bill said it will hurt low-income working people, single mothers, minorities, and elderly and will end a safety net for people who have lost jobs or face major medical bills. People who fail (refuse) to pay or refuse to go to court will punished by a fine and or arrest warrant made out in their name. About fifty thousand Americans will be punished by a fine and or warrant about three thousand Americans every year will go to jail under the new bankruptcy law. For some people this will be a third strike so they will be put in jail for life.

But Mallory Duncan, a lawyer for the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANational%20Retail%20Federation"&gt;National Retail Federation&lt;/a&gt;, said "Bankruptcy has gone from a stigma to a financial planning tool for many."

New personal bankruptcy filings have increased from 172,423 in 1978 to 1,599,986 last year, an increase of 828% during that time; however, it edged down slightly last year.

About 2 percent to 13 percent of those who dissolve their debts in Chapter 7 bankruptcy each year in exchange for forfeiting some assets will be disqualified from doing so under the law, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute.

Bankruptcy lawyers anticipate a rush to the courthouse to beat the six-month window before the new reforms take effect.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Partnership%20for%20a%20Drug-Free%20America%20study%20finds%201%20in%205%20teens%20abused%20prescription%20drugs&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The 17th annual &lt;a href="w%3APartnership%20for%20a%20Drug-Free%20America"&gt;Partnership for a Drug-Free America&lt;/a&gt; study on teen &lt;a href="w%3Adrug%20abuse"&gt;drug abuse&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href="http%3A//www.drugfree.org/Portal/About/NewsReleases/Generation_Rx_Teens_Abusing_Rx_and_OTC_Medications"&gt;its findings&lt;/a&gt; Thursday morning. This is the second year the survey studied the abuse of legal drugs, and the first year it looked into the use of &lt;a href="w%3Aover-the-counter%20substance"&gt;over-the counter&lt;/a&gt; products to get high. The study showed an increasing trend among the nation's teenagers using &lt;a href="w%3Aprescription%20drug"&gt;prescription drugs&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="w%3AVicodin"&gt;Vicodin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOxyContin"&gt;OxyContin&lt;/a&gt;, to get high. Partnership Chairman &lt;a href="w%3ARoy%20Bostock"&gt;Roy Bostock&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the results as "the first time our national study finds that today's teens are more likely to have abused a prescription &lt;a href="w%3Aanalgesic"&gt;painkiller&lt;/a&gt; to get high than they are to have experimented with a variety of &lt;a href="w%3Aillegal%20drugs%20trade"&gt;illegal drugs&lt;/a&gt;. Generation Rx has arrived."

The Partnership for a Drug-Free America is a &lt;a href="w%3Anon-profit"&gt;non-profit&lt;/a&gt; organization launched in &lt;a href="w%3A1987"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; that employs &lt;a href="w%3Acommunications"&gt;communications&lt;/a&gt; professionals for the aim of reducing &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; demand for illegal drugs in today's &lt;a href="w%3Aprohibition%20%28drugs%29"&gt;prohibition&lt;/a&gt; control strategy. The group often collaborates with the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20National%20Drug%20Control%20Policy"&gt;Office of National Drug Control Policy&lt;/a&gt;. The results presented were from the &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; Partnership Attitude Tracking Study that surveyed the nation's largest sample size ever in terms of ongoing analysis of teen drug-related attitudes: more than 7,300 teens. Studies pertaining to drugs are often flawed because of their use of a self-reporting methodology. It is very easy for participants in a non-scientific study &amp;mdash; especially teenagers &amp;mdash; to under, over, or misreport their data. The &lt;a href="w%3Amargin%20of%20error"&gt;margin of error&lt;/a&gt; is plus or minus 1.5 percent.

The study reported that about one in five teenagers has abused a prescription painkiller &amp;mdash; more than those who have experimented with either &lt;a href="w%3Aecstasy%20%28drug%29"&gt;ecstasy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Acrack%20cocaine"&gt;crack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ALSD"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt;. The most popular prescription drug abused by teens was Vicodin, with 18 percent (about 4.3 million youths) reporting. OxyContin, as well as drugs for &lt;a href="w%3AADD"&gt;attention-deficit disorder&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="w%3ARitalin"&gt;Ritalin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AAdderall"&gt;Adderall&lt;/a&gt;, came in second place with 10 percent. One in eleven teens (2.2 million) had abused over-the-counter products such as &lt;a href="w%3ADXM"&gt;cough medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Fewer than half the teens in the study (48 percent) believed experimenting with prescription drugs was a "great risk." Additionally, many teens chose to use legal drugs because of "ease of access."

The number of teens reporting &lt;a href="w%3Acannabis%20%28drug%29"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; use declined to 37 percent last year, compared with 42 percent six years earlier. Over the same amount of time, ecstasy use declined from 12 percent to 9 percent, and &lt;a href="w%3Amethamphetamine"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; use dropped from 12 percent to 8 percent.

<h1>Iran shuts down Al-Jazeera bureau</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iran%20shuts%20down%20Al-Jazeera%20bureau&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ershad.gov.ir/"&gt;Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance&lt;/a&gt; issued an order banning &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; from working in &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; starting Monday, April 18, 2005.

The 'suspension' comes after Arab Iranians protested in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AAhvaz"&gt;Ahvaz&lt;/a&gt;. The Iranians claim that Al Jazeera incited the protests. Al Jazeera has stated that it will "continue to cover Iranian affairs objectively, comprehensively and in a balanced way, and calls on the relevant Iranian authorities to reconsider the decision to suspend its bureau's activities."

This is not the first time Al Jazeera has crossed paths with governments in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; currently do not allow the channel to operate within their borders.

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Journalists"&gt;International Federation of Journalists&lt;/a&gt; (IFJ) has condemned Iranian ban on Al-Jazeera as "Spiteful Act of Censorship".

Aidan White, IFJ's General Secretary wrote, "This closure is a spiteful act of censorship and a blatant attempt by the authorities to make media the scapegoat for civil unrest. If Iran has complaints about media standards it should seek professional redress, not take action that undermines press freedom and pluralism."

While there is a diverse range of internal &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20media"&gt;Iranian media&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20blogs"&gt;64,000 blogs&lt;/a&gt;, press freedom is not absolute, for example, the reformist newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AShargh"&gt;Shargh&lt;/a&gt; was banned from publishing from February 18, 2004 to February 28, 2004, and the newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AKhordad"&gt;Khordad&lt;/a&gt; was formally banned but was recreated with the new name of &lt;a href="w%3AFath"&gt;Fath&lt;/a&gt;.

Al Jazeera, is an Arab satellite network. In the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; it is best known for broadcasting &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden's&lt;/a&gt; videotapes.

A bill introduced last week by Republican &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Santorum"&gt;Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt; in the US senate, S. 786, could prohibit National Weather Service from publishing free forecasts online. 

This would have no effect on The National Hurricane Center as the bill exempts forecasts meant to protect "life and property." 

"The weather service proved so instrumental and popular and helpful in the wake of the hurricanes. How can you make an argument that we should pull it off the Net now? What are you going to do, charge hurricane victims to go online, or give them a pop-up ad?" said Dan McLaughlin, a spokesman for Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla. 

Barry Myers, executive vice president of AccuWeather a service that currently competes with National Weather Service free forecasts , said “the bill would improve public safety by making the weather service devote its efforts to hurricanes, tsunamis and other dangers”.

Last year the &lt;a href="w%3ANOAA"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; eliminated a policy that had prohibited them from offering services that could be provided by the private industry.

&lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;'s ousted President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALucio%20Guti%C3%A9rrez"&gt;Lucio Gutiérrez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by the Ecuadorian Congress is at the Brazilian embassy in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQuito"&gt;Quito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He obtained the political asylum of the Brazilian government. 

In a note, the Brazilian government declared its accompanying concerns for political events in Ecuador, expecting a peaceful solution in the political crisis.

The president of Brazil, &lt;a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;, determined the Department of Justice should authorize the political asylum to Gutiérrez. According to the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations, Sérgio Florêncio Sobrinho is acting as the Brazilian ambassador to Ecuador and is negotiating with the government of Ecuador for Gutiérrez to leave the country safely. 

At about 1:40pm Thursday, a Brazilian Air Force (FAB) airplane took off of the air base at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the capital of Brazil. The airplane flew to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Branco"&gt;Rio Branco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAcre%20State"&gt;Acre State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It will remain ready at Rio Branco's airport until Gutiérrez can be authorized to leave Ecuador.

On Wednesday, Gutiérrez was removed by the Ecuadorian Congress because of a violent crackdown in Quito, protesting against Guitiérrez and demanding his resignation. It was reported that at least one person was killed during the protests.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlfredo%20Palacio"&gt;Alfredo Palacio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Gutierrez's vice-president, is the new president of Ecuador.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The 2005 Cyberarts Festival, which runs through May 8, 2005, opened with a gala at the Hotel@MIT, a hotel near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The gala, which took place in a series of function rooms on the third floor of the hotel, started at 6:00 p.m. and ran past its stated end time of 9:00 p.m. The event featured food and drink, as well as computer art from a variety of artists whose work will be featured in the festival.

Local Wikipedia contributor Samuel Klein displayed a customization of Daniel Wunsch's &lt;a href="http%3A//djini.de/software/rcbirds/"&gt;rcbirds&lt;/a&gt; program, which converts Wikipedia recent changes feeds into a series of bird calls and other sounds from the open-sound &lt;a href="https%3A//sourceforge.net/projects/peep"&gt;peep&lt;/a&gt; project, differentiating edits by the anonymity of the user, the name and namespace of the article involved, and the user's contribution history. Different types of edits produced different bird calls; once or twice during the evening, conversation was briefly interrupted to undo vandalism signaled by the stream of sound.

Martin Wattenberg, a researcher at IBM's local research lab, who has also developed software to visualize the history of changes to Wikipedia pages, exhibited his visualization of the decision tree of a computer playing chess, described jokingly as "Tiny Blue."

Other presenters included Newbury Open.net's new &lt;a href="http%3A//www.newburyopen.net/projects_bmp.html"&gt;Boston Music Project &lt;/a&gt;.

A government-backed bill to allow &lt;a href="same-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex couples to marry&lt;/a&gt; and to adopt children has passed the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20Congress%20of%20Deputies"&gt;Spanish Congress of Deputies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It has yet to pass in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20Senate"&gt;Spanish Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , although political commentators are speculating this will be simply a formality, and fully expect the bill to become law.

The Congress altered existing law governing marriage by adding this sentence: "Marriage will have the same requirements and results when the two people entering into the contract are of the same sex or of different sexes." This bill is now passed on to the Senate, which has a greater number of conservative members, making unlikely its passage. However, in the Spanish legal system the Senate's rejection is not binding.

Upon adoption, the law would make &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; the third European country to allow gay marriage, joining &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Netherlands"&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Unlike other same-sex marriage countries, Spain's proposal will allow for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdoption"&gt;child adoption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; responded to this first test of his papacy by coming out strongly against the passage of the bill. One senior Vatican official, the head of the Pontifical Council on the Family &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACardinal%20Alfonso%20Lopez%20Trujillo"&gt;Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , commented that the bill was "iniquitous", saying "One cannot say that a law is right simply because it is law."

Spain's adherence to some Catholic dictates, such as its objection to contraception use, is low. Traditional Catholics look to the new pope with the hope that his moral authority can restore to the faithful the principles of birth control and exclusion of those who remarry from partaking in communion.

The church, Cardinal Trujillo argued, does not discriminate against gays, who he feels simply need help. Calling on municipal offices asked to perform gay marriages to object, he said, "They should exercise the same conscientious objection asked of doctors and nurses against a crime such as abortion.

"This is not a matter of choice: all Christians... must be prepared to pay the highest price, including the loss of a job."

Spain's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;Socialist Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , took office in April last year intending to create a secularized state. Calling the Church's advantages undeniable, he hopes to ease laws in divorce and abortion.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Fernando%20L%C3%B3pez%20Aguilar"&gt;Juan Fernando López Aguilar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Minister of Justice, said "... barriers of discrimination, many of them with deep historical or primitive roots, which affect rights and freedoms and, in a specific way, the extension of free choice in the search for happiness, are an unwritten basic right". The parliament passed the bill with 183 for and 136 against. There were six abstentions. Gays and lesbians gathered in the public gallery cheered when the vote was read.

In an address to the ongoing conference of Asian and African nations &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt; offered apologies for the suffering caused by Japanese aggression in the 1930s and 40s.

"In the past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility," after this Koizumi added that the Japanese people have "feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology." 

Koizumi's apology was the first apology offered by a Japanese leader for its country's past in the presence of such a large number of government leaders from different countries.

, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; – The San Jose Police Department has announced that &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Ayala"&gt;Anna Ayala&lt;/a&gt;, the woman who claims to have found a human finger in a bowl of chili at a &lt;a href="w%3AWendy%27s"&gt;Wendy's&lt;/a&gt; restaurant in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested at or near her home in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday evening, in connection with the case.

According to court documents, she has been charged with one count of attempted grand larceny related to the chili case, and one count of grand larceny in an unrelated real estate deal, and is being held without bail in Clark County, Nevada, pending extradition. A press conference by the San Jose Police and Wendy's was to be held on Friday, April 22, at 13:00 PDT.

Wendy's had offered a reward of as much as $100,000 for information leading to an arrest in the case. Ayala claimed to have discovered the finger while eating at a Wendy's on March, 22. Ayala later dropped plans to sue the restaurant after previous lawsuits, including one against another fast food restaurant, were made public.

The charges place the value of the attempted theft against Wendy's at $2.5 million. The unrelated charge stems from an incident, also in San Jose, when Ayala allegidly received an $11,000 down payment on a mobile home she did not own. Ayala will face an extradition hearing on Tuesday, April 26.

"Those who are in power are to be held responsible, and that includes me," &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt;, told his nation in the first live address by a PM in ten years. "If so much as a dollar is found to have made its way into the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; for ill-gotten gains, it will be repaid to the people of Canada." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cjad.com/content/cp_article.asp%3Fid%3D/global_feeds/CanadianPress/NationalNews/n0421115A.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; Leader Stephen Harper described Mr Martin's broadcast as "a party leader playing for time, begging for another chance".

"After the Prime Minister has shut down the democratic process here ... my guess is there will be more people that are calling for some accountability, perhaps in the form of an election," &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democratic Party (NDP)&lt;/a&gt; leader Jack Layton said.

A series of &lt;a href="w%3Aopinion%20poll"&gt;opinion polls&lt;/a&gt; show that in an election held today, a &lt;a href="w%3Aminority%20government"&gt;minority&lt;/a&gt; Conservative government would probably result, reports &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Australian"&gt;♡❤The Australian♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Auditor General's report</h2>

Outrage over the advertising kickback scandal &amp;mdash; known as &lt;a href="w%3ASponsorship%20scandal"&gt;AdScam&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; has been fomenting since it was uncovered in 2002, according to an article by &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;♡❤Associated Press♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href="w%3AAuditor%20General%20of%20Canada"&gt;Auditor General's&lt;/a&gt; report released in early 2004. Already it has been attributed as one cause of the Liberal Party loss-of-majority in Parliament, after federal elections last June.

That report found that shortly after defeat of a 1995 separatist referendum in &lt;a href="Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, millions of dollars from a government federalism advertising campaign in Quebec had been directed to specific advertising firms, friendly to the Liberal Party, reports the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤.

<h2>Gomery federal inquiry</h2>

Since a publication ban was lifted two weeks ago, on federal inquiry testimony by a &lt;a href="Montreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; advertising executive who faces fraud charges over the scandal, revelations have "been more politically explosive than previously expected", to quote Canada's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACTV%20television%20network"&gt;CTV&lt;/a&gt; News♡❤.

And the opposition has been trying to draw links to Martin, who was finance minister at the time of the sponsorship program currently being examined.

Advertising executive &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Brault"&gt;Jean Brault&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AGomery%20Commission"&gt;Justice John Gomery's federal inquiry&lt;/a&gt; that senior Liberals made him secretly divert more than $US818,000 to the party's Quebec wing in exchange for sponsorship contracts, reported ♡❤The Australian♡❤.

&lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt; Leader &lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20Duceppe"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt; said the revelations had tarnished Quebecers, reported ♡❤CTV News♡❤.

"The Liberal Party said it wanted to promote &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Confederation"&gt;federalism&lt;/a&gt;. But in reality the Liberals tried to buy the soul of Quebecers," said Mr Duceppe.

<h2>PM Martin's actions over the scandal</h2>

For his part, although Mr Martin testified to the commission, according to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ report, he has not been implicated.

In his speech to the nation, he emphasized his own efforts such as canceling the sponsorship program on his first day in office as PM, firing from a diplomatic post &lt;a href="w%3AAlfonso%20Gagliano"&gt;Alfonso Gagliano&lt;/a&gt;, the man who had been minister responsible for the program, ordering the current inquiry and an audit of Liberal Party financial records, and bringing in a raft of whistleblower-protection legislation.

He had also brought lawsuits related to the scandal, on 19 people and companies for more than $40 million.

Activities date back to the 1990s and the Liberal leadership of former prime minister &lt;a href="Jean%20Chr%C3%A9tien"&gt;Jean Chrétien&lt;/a&gt;, who has also denied any knowledge of wrongdoing, according the report from ♡❤The Australian♡❤.

<h2>Election timing</h2>

"I commit to you tonight that I will call a general election within 30 days of the publication of the commission's final report and recommendations," Mr Martin told Canada in his address.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Gomery"&gt;Justice Gomery&lt;/a&gt; is due to deliver his report in December, meaning an election in January 2006.

Mr Martin said he wanted Canada to have the report before an election was held.

"There is conflicting testimony; only the judge is in a position to determine the truth. Only he can cut through the partisan politics. Only he can tell us what happened and who was responsible."

But, "If the Opposition forces an election before then, that is their choice," Martin said.

"I will never hesitate to describe what happened on the sponsorship file for what is was - an unjustifiable mess. It's up to me to clean it up. That's my job. I am cleaning it up. And I am willing to be judged on my record of action."

<h2>Other parties respond</h2>

In efforts to avoid a partisan message, other political parties were given by broadcasters a block of half an hour air-time for immediate responses to Mr Martin's 7-minute taped speech, which had been given in English and French.

Comments were given by The Conservatives' Stephen Harper, Gilles Duceppe of Bloc Québécois and the NDP's Jack Layton.

"We've all just witnessed a sad spectacle, a prime minister so burdened with corruption in his own party that he's unable to do his job and lead the country," said the Conservative Leader.

Mr Duceppe maintained that proof of Liberal party corruption has been established, said a ♡❤Canadian Press♡❤ report.

"Paul Martin has broken this link of trust, which makes it impossible for him to remain in power," Mr Duceppe had said.

NDP Leader Jack Layton expressed dismay over the sponsorship scandal, said ♡❤CTV News♡❤, but he had suggested his party would be willing to co-operate with the Liberals in a vote on the budget, if some changes are made.

"Take out the surprise corporate tax cuts and invest that money into the things people want and need. The NDP is in no rush to judge the scandal, but we are in a rush to get something done, to getting a better budget passed," Mr Layton said.

A sign on the front door of the Ayala residence urged reporters and curious onlookers not to disturb the occupants. The sign reads, "Trust Me Do Not Knock On Door Emotionally Disturbard Thanx".

Anna Ayala was arrested on a fugitive warrant so no bail was set. Early this morning, Ayala was still behind bars at the Clark County Detention Center.

Police spokesman Enrique Garcia said further details on the 39-year-old Ayala will be released at a news conference scheduled for 1pm Friday.

According to the ♡❤Los Angeles Times♡❤, the arrest came hours after Wendy’s concluded its own internal investigation that found no link to the finger in its food distribution chain.

Wendy’s offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the source of the finger.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
In &lt;a href="w%3ABuenaventura"&gt;Buenaventura&lt;/a&gt;, 500km southwest of capital city &lt;a href="w%3ABogota"&gt;Bogota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, fishermen found the bodies of 12 young men who were killed and thrown into the sea. According to local newspapers, residents and authorities accuse the revolutionary communist army called &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt;. 

The victims have been identified, and according to El Pais they are: Iver Valencia, aged 21; Víctor Alfonso Angulo, aged 20; Leonel Salcedo García, aged 20; Mario Valencia, aged 19; Alberto Valencia, aged 18; John Jairo Rodallega, aged 18; Rubén Darío Valencia, aged 18; Pedro Luis Aramburo Congo, aged 18; Carlos Arbey Valencia, aged 17; Pedro Pablo Valencia, aged 17; Concepción Rentería Valencia, aged 16 ; Javier Borja, aged 15.

There are indications that the victims were tortured. Their eyes were pulled out and they were shot in the head.

According to reports, on Monday a man came on a motorcycle and invited the group of young men to take part in a soccer game. The victims' parents and other relatives did not receive any further contact from them and notified the police on Wednesday. All the children lived in the &lt;a href="w%3APunta%20del%20Este"&gt;Punta del Este&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href="w%3ABuenaventura"&gt;Buenaventura&lt;/a&gt;.

Colombian authorities say that this act may be revenge by FARC for the arrest of their leader &lt;a href="w%3APoca%20Lucha"&gt;Poca Lucha&lt;/a&gt;, but a specific motive has not been clearly identified. No suspects have yet been named.

Earth science experts studying ocean currents and their relationship to snow melts have discovered that an unusual heating of the ground in one place on our planet can choke off sea life over a thousand miles away.

In a new NASA funded study, they have found that a decline in winter and spring snow cover over Southwest Asia and the Himalayan mountain range is creating conditions for more widespread blooms of ocean plants in the Arabian Sea.

The decrease in snow cover has led to greater differences in both temperature and pressure systems between the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea. The pressure differences generate monsoon winds that mix the ocean water in the Western Arabian Sea. This mixing leads to better growing conditions for tiny, free-floating ocean plants called phytoplankton. 

The senior researcher and lead author of the study is Joaquim Goes, from the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, West Boothbay Harbor, Maine. Goes and his colleagues used observations from satellite imagery of the ocean’s colors to show unusual blooms, or growth, of phytoplankton concentrations in the Western Arabian Sea. His work shows an increase of more than 350 percent over the past seven years.

Since 1997, a reduction in snow has led to wider temperature differences between the land and ocean during summer. As a consequence, sea surface winds over the Arabian Sea have strengthened leading to more intense upwelling and more widespread blooms of phytoplankton along the coasts of Somalia, Yemen and Oman.

According to Goes, while large blooms of phytoplankton can enhance fisheries, exceptionally large blooms could be detrimental to the ecosystem. Increases in phytoplankton amounts can lead to oxygen depletion in the water column and eventually to a decline in fish populations.

The study is in this week’s SCIENCE magazine.

Work began today on what will be the world's longest underwater pipeline. The pipeline, which is being built for Norsk Hydro ASA, will bring &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; natural gas to the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;.

Stretching 1,200 km from &lt;a href="w%3ANyhamna"&gt;Nyhamna&lt;/a&gt;, Norway to &lt;a href="w%3AEasington"&gt;Easington&lt;/a&gt;, Britain, the pipeline will eventually carry 70 million cubic metres per day. That equates to some 20% of Britain's gas supply. 

The construction of the pipeline will consume over 1 million tonnes of concrete and about the same amount of steel. 

Called the Langeled pipeline, it is due to open in 2007.

&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland's&lt;/a&gt; National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) has posted a 2.4% return for the first quarter (9.6% annualized). On March 31, the funds value stood at €12.3bn, a rise of €290m (excluding state contributions) since December 31.

Donal Geaney, the fund's chairman, told the press that growth in the past quarter had been driven by the Fund's European equity investments.

Mr Geaney, former &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89lan"&gt;Élan&lt;/a&gt; CEO, has pursued a policy of &lt;a href="w%3Adiversification"&gt;diversification&lt;/a&gt; since February of this year, with the stated aim of placing a larger amount of the funds assets in companies with small market capitalizations and in property funds.

The fund was set up by the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ucc.ie/law/irlii/statutes/2000_33.htm%23z1"&gt;National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000&lt;/a&gt; to partially meet the expected rise in Irish pension costs from 2025 onwards.

&lt;a href="w%3AMotorola"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; has recently confirmed plans that it will launch an &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; compatible mobile phone. The firm, which released quarterly results on Friday, revealed that the phone would be available in a few months time.

There had been speculation that the wireless communications giant would scrap the phone after an underwhelming response from US operators, however CEO &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Zander"&gt;Ed Zander&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the company's intentions at the results presentation.

The phone, when launched, will allow users to easily download digital music from &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computers"&gt;Apple's&lt;/a&gt; popular iTunes music store onto their handset. The combination of &lt;a href="w%3Amobile%20phone"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMP3%20player"&gt;MP3 player&lt;/a&gt; is a long awaited example of the much touted "&lt;a href="w%3Atechnological%20convergence"&gt;technological convergence&lt;/a&gt;" often mentioned by the industry's CEO's.

Wikinews will have a reporter live at Apple's WWDC keynote (when the software is likely to be released) on June 6 to cover the event.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; District Judge Leonie Brinkema accepted would-be hijacker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZacarias%20Moussaoui"&gt;Zacarias Moussaoui's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; guilty pleas on six charges of conspiracy laid against him for his plotting to participate in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;Sept. 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

36-year-old Moussaoui, a &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; citizen, faces the death penalty or life in prison in the sentencing phase of his trial. The prosecution has also asked that Moussaoui be forced to pay restitution to the victims of the attack.

<h3>September 11, 2001 attacks</h3>

19 hijackers took control of four planes on September 11, 2001. Nearly four weeks before the attack, Moussaoui was arrested in &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; on immigrations charges having raised the suspicions of instructors at a flight school.

During the attack, two planes were flown into the World Trade Center buildings, a third struck the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed near Shanksville, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, USA.

Rock group &lt;a href="w%3AU2"&gt;U2&lt;/a&gt; will play a third date at &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACroke%20Park"&gt;Croke Park&lt;/a&gt; this year. Following strong demand from fans, the group have announced that they will play Monday June 27th in addition to the 23rd and 24th.

The band's current Vertigo tour has proved extremely popular among fans, with the original 160,000 Dublin tickets sold in less than an hour. The tour officially kicked off in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; on 28 March 2005.

Although no support act has yet been lined up for the extra date, it is widely believed that promoters MCD will have no trouble selling the additional 80,000 tickets.

&lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Technology"&gt;Creative Technology Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, maker of the popular &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Zen"&gt;Zen&lt;/a&gt; and Zen Micro &lt;a href="w%3AMP3%20player"&gt;MP3 player&lt;/a&gt; ranges, has reported a 72% drop in quarterly profits. However sales rose 65%.

Net income was $15.9m, $0.18 a share; down from $57m or $0.68 a share a year earlier. Sales were $333.8m. 

The results show the extent of Creative's current price war with rival &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt;. Both firms have dropped prices on key products on numerous occasions in recent months in an attempt to steal market share in the fast growing digital audio market. 

Creative, based in &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, has thus far sold 2m MP3 players worldwide, making it the number two player in the market.

♡❤The interview below was conducted by over the phone with Emily Levan on April 21, 2005. Levan lives in &lt;a href="w%3AWiscasset%2C%20Maine"&gt;Wiscasset, Maine&lt;/a&gt;, with her husband and daughter, and she ran in the Boston Marathon women's race on April 18, 2005.♡❤

♡❤♡To summarize for our readers, you recently came in 12th in the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Marathon"&gt;Boston Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, right?♡❤♡

That is correct.

♡❤♡You were the first American finisher.♡❤♡

Yes.

♡❤♡There was also a Russian woman who lives in the US who finished ahead of you.♡❤♡

You know, I believe it is, I'm not actually positive, but I think you're right. There's often a lot of foreign runners that live and train in different parts of the US for a variety of reasons. Some live in Colorado and might train at high altitude, or they might have coaches in the US.

♡❤♡OK, but as far as you know, for straight up Americans, people who were born here, who have lived here for long periods of time and are not going anywhere special to train, you were the first finisher.♡❤♡

That is correct.

♡❤♡So congratulations, that's very impressive. In the rest of your life, my understanding is that you are going to nursing school.♡❤♡

I am. I'm at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Southern%20Maine"&gt;University of Southern Maine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APortland%2C%20Maine"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;. and I have been going to nursing school for a couple years now. I'm just going part time right now because of the baby and other things going on in my world.

♡❤♡Your baby is currently one and a half?♡❤♡

She's fifteen months.

♡❤♡Fifteen months, so one and one quarter. 1.25, sure.♡❤♡

Hopefully I'll finish up nursing school in December. That is the tentative plan.

♡❤♡So you're almost done.♡❤♡

I just have a couple classes left.
I'll take one class this summer and two classes in the fall.

♡❤♡You ran the Boston Marathon originally two years ago?♡❤♡

Actually, I ran it for the first time in 99. I've run it four times.
I did run it two years ago as well.

♡❤♡You ran it two years ago, and you also came in twelfth then, if not the top American finisher then. You were the fourth?♡❤♡

I think third or fourth. I can't remember exactly.

♡❤♡How long were you actually training for this marathon in particular?♡❤♡

I'd say about 4 months. I typically try to train about four months for each race. It depends a little bit on what kind of shape I'm in leading up to the training. Four months is usually the time frame I shoot for.

♡❤♡And how many miles a week were you doing--I assume you peaked somewhere right before the marathon.♡❤♡

At the peak, I have a month or six week period where I've built up to my peak training, and I was probably doing between 90 to 100 miles a week.

♡❤♡Was there a lot of variation in your day to day mileage, or was it pretty much you're doing 1/7th of that mileage every day?♡❤♡

There's definitely variation, probably more so in the type of workout that i did each day. For example two days a week I would do a speed workout, so I might be doing mile repeats, which just means that I do a mile in a specific time, and then I might jog for a couple minutes and then another one and another one. I'd do a series of eight mile repeats on that specific workout day. My other speed workout would be a marathon pace run, so I might run 8 or 10 miles at my marathon pace. If my marathon pace is 6 minute miles, I'd do a two mile jog warm up, and then I might do 8 or 10 miles at a six minute pace, and then a two mile cool down.

♡❤♡So you maybe end up running 14?♡❤♡

Sometimes what I would do on those speed workout days-- on those days I might end up with about 14 miles. On some other days, I might run twice during the course of the day. Say in the morning, I might run eight miles, and then in the afternoon I might do six or eight more miles.

♡❤♡Wow.♡❤♡

Those days tend to be a little bit more mellow. More of kind of a maintenance run, a little bit of a recovery day. I try to have a recovery day after every hard workout.

♡❤♡Do you think that all of your training could fit into four hours a day? Do you think that's true?♡❤♡

You mean the workouts for a specific day? Probably even less than that. Depending on the day a little bit, probably between 2 or 3 hours. Usually on Sunday I would go out and do a long run, and that would be a 20 or 22 mile run, all in one fell swoop and that usually takes two and a half hours.

♡❤♡So that explains how you're able to do this, as well as go to nursing school, as well as have an extremely young child. I assume you talk to your friends occasionally.♡❤♡

I try to at least-- have some sort of social life. This is not a job, so it's not something that I do 8 hours a day. It's something that I fit in with all the other obligations, things that I like to do too. I like to be able to pursue other interests as well.

♡❤♡You live on a road with no one else near by. Do you pretty much just run from your house every day?♡❤♡

The winter is harder because with the baby, I often end up running with a treadmill down in the basement. Brad, my husband, has pretty long hours at the farm, and especially in the winter months, it's hard to find daylight when he's able to watch Maddy, so I ended up running a lot on the treadmill this winter, as opposed to last summer, I would take her with me. I have one of those baby joggers, and that was great. I could just leave right from the house, and I could take her. She would be pretty happy to go eight or ten miles with me. Typically what I do when I go outside, I just go right from the house. The roads are so pretty around here. We're pretty secluded, so I don't have to worry too much about crazy drivers.

♡❤♡Do you ever try to go find big hills to run up and down?♡❤♡

I do. In the past, I have done a hill workout as a part of my training, usually early on in the training during the first six weeks or 2 months of the training I do a hill workout and I would find some place close by that I could find a warm up jog and run to and then do a hill workout. If I couldn't find one within a couple miles, I would drive to it. It's a little bit harder now with Maddy because I don't have as much leeway and freedom with when I go running and where I go running. I'm a little more limited.

♡❤♡You'd have to load up the cart, er, the carriage into the car.♡❤♡

I've done that sometimes. Sometimes it's easier to go straight from home.
Running with the jogger up hills is not an easy thing to do.

♡❤♡When you're in the race, you feel like, “Hey, I'm not even pushing a kid anymore.” &lt;a href="w%3AHeartbreak%20Hill"&gt;Heartbreak Hill&lt;/a&gt; without the kid is substantially easier, I suppose.♡❤♡

Yeah.

♡❤♡Do you know most of the elite runners in the race? You know who they are, but are you friends with them, or not really?♡❤♡

It's funny--I know who people are, but I don't run that many races to really get to know that many of the runners. If you're a professional runner, and that's your job, a lot of those people travel in the same circles. They run the same races and they have the same schedules in terms of when they compete. I pick out a couple of races each year to focus on and because of that, I don't get to know as many of the runners. As time goes on, you do get a little bit you do get a little more familiar with people.

♡❤♡During the race, do you talk to the other runners, or do you just run along and think things like, “I wish I were at the end right now”?♡❤♡

I think that really depends I find that if I'm feeling good and the run is going well, then it's easier for me to talk to people, just because you're feeling strong, and you're not focusing so much on “I'm not doing so great.” I might talk to some folks along the way. Sometimes if someone passes me, I'll encourage them and say “Good job, go get them,” and just stuff like that. I certainly find I'm not carrying on lengthy conversations with people because you're expending energy that should be focused on the race itself. I enjoy getting to know folks along the way and knowing what pace they're hoping to run.

♡❤♡In races other than the Boston Marathon do you find that you have good competition? I don't really know what the running scene in Wiscasset, Maine, is like at all, but I imagine that being the fastest female marathon runner in the United States, you might not find a whole lot of competition. You say that you encourage people when they pass you, but having read some of the other interviews with you on the web, it doesn't seem like people pass you very often.♡❤♡

It definitely depends on the race. Like I said before, I don't run that many races. At this point, what I'm trying to do is to find races that are competitive so I can be pushed by competition. For example, when I ran the Maine Marathon last fall, there wasn't a whole lot of competition. That just gets hard. I ran alone for most of the race. Running 26 miles at a fast pace all by yourself without anyone around you to help push you and motivate you, can be pretty hard. Because of that, as I've been looking toward the future and thinking about which races I want to do, I've been targeting races that will have a little more competition. That's why Boston was one that I wanted to shoot for and I'm thinking about in the fall going to &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Marathon"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; because they've got a pretty competitive marathon. It's also a pretty flat course, so people tend to run pretty fast times there.

♡❤♡Most people run a couple of minutes faster in Chicago, right?♡❤♡

Yeah, exactly. And I've heard good things about the race too, so I'm looking forward to that.

♡❤♡Have you thought about running internationally?♡❤♡

Not at this point, no. It's hard to find the time to travel to races, and It gets expensive too. A lot of my family members say, “Wouldn't it be great to do the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Marathon"&gt;London Marathon&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="w%3AParis%20Marathon"&gt;Paris Marathon&lt;/a&gt;,” because they like coming to watch. At this point, I think I'm going to stick closer to home. I've got a few races, like I was mentioning Chicago, here in the States that I'd really like to do. Maybe once I've done those, I might think about something else, it really just depends. A lot of it's a time issue, because I have other things that I'm pursuing and it gets hard to spend too much time traveling off doing different races.

♡❤♡Do you know Alan Culpepper?♡❤♡

Oh, yeah, yeah.

♡❤♡You at least know of him, right?♡❤♡

Yes, exactly.

♡❤♡Have you ever been in any races against him?♡❤♡

This was the first race that I had run in that he ran in. He was the fourth overall male finisher. That's a really good showing for an American male. I've read a lot about him in different running magazines and just heard a lot about him through running circles.
But this was the first time that I've actually seen him run. It was neat because in this particular race, they start the women's elite group about 25 minutes ahead of the rest of the start.

♡❤♡29 minutes actually, I believe.♡❤♡

That's right, 29 minutes. So, I didn't see a male runner until pretty close to the end, so it was really neat to see--I think I saw the top five male finishers because they passed me in the last couple miles. It was really interesting--there's all these cars and press and motorcycles, policemen, so I could tell when the first male was coming up behind me because there was a lot more going on on the course. Alan Culpepper was one of the ones that passed me in the last mile or two. It was pretty neat to see him finishing strong.

♡❤♡You might not be able to beat him in a race but do you think you could maybe, I don't know, beat him in a fist fight? He's pretty skinny, right? He only weighs 130 pounds.♡❤♡

I don't know. I don't know. I wouldn't make any bets on it at this point.

♡❤♡No?♡❤♡

No.

♡❤♡OK. Have you thought about doing things longer than a marathon? Like a 50 K or a 100 K?♡❤♡

At this point, I haven't because I've gotten into the marathon, and I've really been enjoying that so far. I feel like I still have some room to improve and grow in the marathon, but I think at some point I'd really like to do one of those ultra-type races. For the next several years, I'll stick towards the marathon distances. Once that competitive part of my life is over, I might move on to something different.

♡❤♡Based on your age, are you likely to peak around now, or you maybe have a few years to go before your legs start to fall off?♡❤♡

Before I can't walk anymore? I don't know. It's really interesting because for marathoning you've got a longer life span than in a lot of competitive sports. The fifth place female finisher in Boston this year was over forty. You can still be competitive into your forties. I'm not sure if I'll keep doing it that long-- at least another 3 years or so. One thing in the back of my mind looking at is the Olympic Trials for 2008. I'm looking at that time frame right now. If I want to keep running competitively after that, then I'll assess things from there.

♡❤♡That sounds good. When you came in as the first American finisher, did you get any certificates or cash or a medal or anything like that?♡❤♡

Yeah, actually, I won $2100.

♡❤♡Oh, great-- two thousand bucks!♡❤♡

Which is pretty nice.

♡❤♡That's a lot of baby clothes.♡❤♡

I know-- or a lot of shoes. The shoe expense is pretty expensive, and I've been trying to find a shoe company that might give me some shoes.

♡❤♡I would think--couldn't you just call up New Balance and say, “Hey, look, I'm pretty good, why don't you give me some shoes?”♡❤♡

Well, this past November, after I ran New York-- I usually wear &lt;a href="w%3AASICS"&gt;Asics&lt;/a&gt; or New Balance-- I wrote to both of those companies. I sent them a little running resume. I said I'd be interested in pursuing some sort of sponsorship opportunity, and they both wrote back and said, “Sorry, we don't have any space or funds available at this time.” I was a little disappointed by that, because I was hoping to at least get someone to help me out with my shoes.

♡❤♡Yeah, at least some sneakers.♡❤♡

But in addition at Boston, they do have these crystal vases that they give out for the top 15 finishers, so I got a little piece of hardware there too.

♡❤♡So you get to put flowers in that.♡❤♡

I had some flowers in it; they've wilted so I decided to &lt;a href="w%3Acompost"&gt;compost&lt;/a&gt; them.

♡❤♡Oh, that's good.♡❤♡

Yeah, send them back to the earth, you know.

♡❤♡Has anyone else tried to interview you? Local &lt;a href="w%3Apaparazzi"&gt;paparazzi&lt;/a&gt; following you?♡❤♡

I hide in my car for most of the day. I did some local interviews--with the local &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; affiliate, and I'm going to do an interview tomorrow with the &lt;a href="w%3AABC"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; affiliate in Portland, and some affiliated newspaper interviews as well.

♡❤♡You're officially famous, then.♡❤♡

I don't know. I guess. It's been pretty busy.

♡❤♡Has anyone asked you for an autograph yet?♡❤♡

No. No autograph seekers yet, no.

♡❤♡Maybe in the Yellowfront Grocery in Wiscasset? “Hey, I know you!”♡❤♡

“I saw you on TV!” No, not yet.

♡❤♡That's surely coming. The Chewonki Foundation, which is where you live, recently had Eaton Farm donated to it.♡❤♡

Yes.

♡❤♡And they're planning on making a 12 mile long trail that runs from approximately your house to Wiscasset.♡❤♡

Oh, you know more about this than I do, that's great.

♡❤♡I don't know if it's going to start right at your front door; you might have to cut through the woods a little bit.♡❤♡

That's OK, I can do that.

♡❤♡Have you run on trails at all, or is it just, “I want to run on the pavement because I don't want to twist an ankle”?♡❤♡

I'm not a big trail runner. Maybe it's because I'm not used to running on trails. Now it would be much more difficult, because I have the baby with me. The baby jogger has some nice wheels on it, but I don't know if it could handle trail running.

♡❤♡Yeah.♡❤♡

It's a nice change of pace every once in a while. I don't worry too much about twisting an ankle--you just have to be careful. I figure I can walk out my door and step in a pothole and twist my ankle, so I don't worry too much about that. That goes along with being alive in our world. We'll see. I'm going to have to look into that 12 mile trail.

♡❤♡Because 12 miles, you do that there and back, you've got a marathon on your hands.♡❤♡

There you go.

♡❤♡What's your next target? Can you walk right now?♡❤♡

If I train well, I'm usually not sore. Especially on the long runs, my body gets used to running for that length of time and sure, I'm running faster during the marathon than I do on my long runs, but I think my body tends to adjust to the rigors. It's usually a good sign if a few days afterwards I don't have any major soreness. I certainly feel like I've done something significant.

♡❤♡Yeah, I can imagine feeling too.♡❤♡

No major aches or pains.

♡❤♡That's great. What's your next race? Do you have one targeted? Is it Chicago?♡❤♡

Yeah, I think the next marathon will be Chicago in the fall. there's a 10 K race, the Beach to Beacon, you may have heard of it.

♡❤♡In Portland?♡❤♡

It's actually in &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Elizabeth%2C%20Maine"&gt;Cape Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;. It's put on by &lt;a href="w%3AJoan%20Benoit"&gt;Joan Benoit Samuelson&lt;/a&gt;. It's in August, so I'll probably do that one and then shoot for the fall marathon.

♡❤♡Well, I think that's all my questions.♡❤♡

Nice, well, thanks for calling. I appreciate it.

♡❤♡Sure, well, thanks for running so fast.♡❤♡

No problem.

At 21:00 UTC yesterday, the polls closed in the &lt;a href="UK%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;United Kingdom general election&lt;/a&gt;. With only a handful of seats left to declare, Labour reached the 324 seats necessary to form a majority in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;, with the result in Corby at 03:28 UTC.

The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; remains the &lt;a href="w%3AOfficial%20Opposition%20%28UK%29"&gt;Opposition&lt;/a&gt; party, with the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; being the third largest party in the House of Commons.

Both the Labour victory and the reduced majority were widely predicted by opinion polls before the election. The BBC/ITV exit poll predicted Tony Blair a majority of 66 seats, which continued to be forecast as the final result as declarations were made. Some early results in the north-east indicated a bigger swing away from Labour than the opinion polls had been suggesting, but later results confirmed the survey.

Overall, there has been no clear swing in votes between the parties. Many seats have seen large swings, but in many different directions, with perhaps the national swing of 5% from Conservative to Liberal Democrat being the most dramatic with many much larger local swings.

The new Labour government has been elected with the lowest proportion of the popular vote ever - just 35.2%. However, the Tories only gained 32.3% barely more than the last election in 2001. The biggest winners in terms of popular vote were the Liberal Democrats led by Charles Kennedy, who secured 22.1% of the vote. With 645 of 646 seats declared so far, this has given the Liberal Democrats another 11 seats in Parliament, but the Conservatives have gained another 33 seats. Labour have lost 47.

As a result, Tony Blair is forecast to be governing with a majority of 66 in the new Parliament. However, on some major issues such as university fees and anti-terror laws, many Labour MPs have voted against their leadership. With a greatly reduced majority, Tony Blair may be forced to water down many more controversial policies in order to guarantee their passage through the House of Commons. Speaking on &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;, commentator &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Dimbleby"&gt;David Dimbleby&lt;/a&gt; pointed out the uncertainty of such possibilities, and noted that a majority of 66 was larger than the 43 seat majority won by &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Thatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201979"&gt;United Kingdom general election, 1979&lt;/a&gt;.

One surprise vote was the election of ex-Labour member George Galloway in Bethnal Green &amp; Bow, in East London. The area has a very high number of Muslims in it, and Galloway moved from his home in Scotland in order to gain their anti-war support. He ousted Britain's only second female black MP, Oona King, in the process.

Robert Kilroy-Silk, the ex-talkshow host who was sacked from the BBC after writing racist newspaper articles, only came fourth in his election in Erewash in the East Midlands. His party, Veritas, which fielded 65 candidates across the country, stood for withdrawing from the European Union and blocking immigration.

Turnout in the general election is 60%, up 2% on 2001.

The woman claiming headlines for allegedly finding part of a human finger in her bowl of &lt;a href="w%3AWendy%27s"&gt;Wendy's&lt;/a&gt; chili late last month, was arrested Thursday evening at 8:45pm at or near her home.

&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt; Police Chief Rob Davis, declaring the arrest was part of an ongoing investigation, said &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Ayala"&gt;Anna Ayala&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and charged with one count of &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20larceny"&gt;attempted grand theft&lt;/a&gt; in the Wendy’s incident, and one count of &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20larceny"&gt;grand theft&lt;/a&gt; in an unrelated home purchase transaction. She is being held under a $500,000 &lt;a href="w%3AArrest%20warrant"&gt;arrest warrant&lt;/a&gt;.

Chief Rob Davis describes the case as a &lt;a href="w%3ACSI%3A%20Crime%20Scene%20Investigation"&gt;CSI-type&lt;/a&gt; operation where forensics studying the finger found it to be inconsistent with conditions it would have experienced if it were cooked at 170 degrees for 3 hours according to Wendy's food preparation standards. The loss in sales due to negative publicity for the chain could range into the millions, a loss for which Ayala could be held criminally responsible. Davis said, "... evidence suggests that the truest victims in this case are the Wendy's owner, operators and employees here in San Jose, who have suffered financially throughout this investigation."

Prior to her arrest, Wendy's had recently concluded its own internal investigation that turned up nothing to explain the source of the finger. The San Jose police, who have not accused Ayala, 39, of planting the finger herself, did search her home on April 6 for evidence relating to a possible hoax. There are no reports evidence was found. 

She has a history of filing suits for financial settlements. Cases involve the &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Pollo%20Loco"&gt;El Pollo Loco&lt;/a&gt; chicken chain over a claim her daughter got sick, a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in 1998, and &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. A total of 13 lawsuits in &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; had been filed.

There is an inconsistency in the Ayala account of finding the finger and claiming it caused her to vomit compared with police saying there was no vomit at the scene. One larceny charge concerns $11,000 from the sale of a &lt;a href="w%3Amobile%20home"&gt;mobile home&lt;/a&gt; owned by her live-in boyfriend. 

The two combined charges, which could result in a possible 6-year prison term, are against the backdrop of the Wendy's chain offering a reward for information to solve the case, which has cost the chain millions of sales.

<h1>Female sponge contraceptive re-approved for US market</h1>

What was once the most widely sold contraceptive for millions of women, the Today® Sponge, has been re-approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be brought back for sale to the American marketplace, as early as this summer.

The reintroduction of the sponge, demanded by many women for years, is noteworthy because it offers certain distinct advantages versus other forms of contraceptive:
<ul>
BULLET::::- It does not interfere with the natural sensations of intercourse, compared with male or female condoms.
BULLET::::- It does not require multiple applications of contraceptive gel or cream, unlike the diaphragm.
BULLET::::- It remains effective at preventing pregnancies for up to 24 hours after insertion, even with several acts of sexual intercourse.
BULLET::::- It will legally be made available over-the-counter an estimated price of $7.49 to $8.99 for a package of 3.

</ul>
The sponge does not, however, protect against sexually transmitted diseases, and it carries with it certain minor risks which should be noted by potential users.
<ul>
BULLET::::- There is a minor risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome, a risk also carried by certain other female hygiene products, such as tampons.
BULLET::::- Product should not be inserted during menstruation, and should be removed after no more than 30 hours of continuous use.

</ul>
The sponge has also been found less effective as a form of birth control than &lt;a href="w%3Aoral%20contraceptive"&gt;oral contraceptives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADepo%20Provera"&gt;Depo-Provera&lt;/a&gt; injections or an &lt;a href="w%3Aintrauterine%20device"&gt;intrauterine device&lt;/a&gt; (IUD), although similar in effectiveness to the male &lt;a href="w%3Acondom"&gt;condom&lt;/a&gt;. A pregnancy rate of 13 to 16% is expected from a year of "typical use" as a standalone method of birth control. The product varies in effectiveness depending on if the woman forgets to insert the device before intercourse, uses the device incorrectly, or fails to wait at least 6 hours after intercourse before removing the device.

<h2>History of the Today Sponge</h2>

The sponge was invented by Bruce Vorhauer, PhD to combine a safe, widely used spermicide, nonoxynol-9 (N-9), and a barrier contraceptive, made from polyurethane. Since being brought to market in 1983, it quickly established itself as the best-selling contraceptive for women. More than 250 million Today Sponges were sold until March, 1994, when manufacturer American Home Products ceased making the sponge.

Some misconceptions have surrounded the product's withdrawal, such as the sponge was found to be unsafe by the FDA (false), or that the company making it went bankrupt (also false). What happened is that the FDA inspected the only plant where the sponge was manufactured, in &lt;a href="w%3AHammonton%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Hammonton, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, and discovered bacterial contamination of the water supply and other concerns.

American Home Products, which today is known as &lt;a href="w%3AWyeth"&gt;Wyeth&lt;/a&gt;, decided to cease manufacture rather than undergo the potential cost and delay of upgrading their plant and meantime losing share to their competitors.

The passing of the sponge era was noted in the famous episode of the TV show &lt;a href="w%3ASeinfeld"&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt; (Season 7, Episode 119: "The Sponge"). Character &lt;a href="w%3AElaine%20Benes"&gt;Elaine Benes&lt;/a&gt; hoarded her sponges as the supply started to dwindle, and began to examine her potential lovers to see which one of them was truly "spongeworthy".

<h2>Reintroduced to Canada, US</h2>

The President and Chief Executive of Allen Pharmaceuticals, Gene Detroyer, bought the Today Sponge from Wyeth in 2000 for US$7 million and prepared new packaging to meet updated requirements. However, re-introduction of the product was delayed by several years, at least partly due to FDA inaction in inspecting the new manufacturing plant.

"I'm overwhelmed," said Detroyer to the Associated Press. "I am pleased both from a business point of view ... and from the point of view that we can add another contraceptive for women." The Today Sponge received FDA approval in March 2003 to be sold in Canada, and some women even in the US have been able to purchase it through Canadian websites. The FDA has in the past received criticism for its role in removing the Today Sponge from the market and it continues to receive criticism for the impact of its regulatory actions on women's health.

Despite its decade-long absence from public availability, "The product was found to be safe and effective," said FDA spokesperson Susan Cruzan about its recent re-approval.

Texas Senate Bill 6 requires foster agencies to inquire of adopting couples their sexual preference. This bill has caused distress to many, especially among the gay and lesbian community. Representative Robert Talton claims that compared with children raised by a heterosexual couple, those in same-sex households are much more likely to become homosexual.

Talton has also stated that sexual orientation is a choice for the parents:
"If they choose to be homosexual or lesbian, that's their choice when they turn 18," he says, regarding the same-sex couples.

Under the bill he proposes, couples who answer 'same-sex' or 'bi-sexual' on the questionnaire, would not be allowed to adopt or foster children. Children fostered currently to same-sex households would be removed from their foster-parent's care.

"Some of us believe they would be better off in orphanages than in a homosexual or bisexual households because that's a learned behavior," the Republican congressman said.

There are reportedly thousands of children in same-sex households in Texas who would be removed, if this bill is passed.

"It's very traumatic to remove a child from a stable home," said Colin Cunliff, field director for the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas. "It's the whole reason they're in the foster system, because their prior home wasn't stable. You're adding to the instability."

According to a 2002 report by the American Academy of Pediatrics, children with homosexual parents have the "same advantages and the same expectations for health, adjustment and development as children whose parents are heterosexual."

A similar law passed in Arkansas was ruled unconstitutional in December.

Researchers in &lt;a href="w%3Amammalogy"&gt;mammalogy&lt;/a&gt; from London, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Gloucestershire, UK have just discovered a new species of rodent that is unlike anything previously identified.

In a new study published in Systematics and Biodiversity, researchers describe a new rodent species called the &lt;a href="w%3ALaotian%20Rock%20Rat"&gt;Laotian Rock Rat&lt;/a&gt;. It was found for sale as meat at a marketplace in &lt;a href="w%3ALaos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers brought it to London for a closer look at its skeleton and &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers found that the specimen was not particularly related to anything currently known. The group had to describe a new &lt;a href="w%3Afamily%20%28biology%29"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; of mammals for this single species. The last time a new mammal family was created to accommodate a new species discovery was in 1974 when the &lt;a href="w%3Abumblebee%20bat"&gt;bumblebee bat&lt;/a&gt; was discovered.

The closest relatives to Laotian rock rats are a group of rodents that includes porcupines and guinea pigs, but this relationship is a rather distant one. The researchers think the Laotian rock rats may have split off from common ancestors a long time ago, with porcupines and guinea pigs evolving after that split.

The authors hope that by studying Laotian rock rats, they can solve an old puzzle. How did &lt;a href="w%3Aguinea%20pigs"&gt;guinea pigs&lt;/a&gt; and their relatives get to &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; at a time when it was surrounded by water? Until these rock rats came along, the only Old World relatives of guinea pigs were ones found in Africa or both Africa and Asia. This led some scientists to think that guinea pig ancestors got to South America from Africa across the Atlantic Ocean. Others insisted that they went through Asia and North America first. Understanding how the guinea pig's new Asian relative is connected to the rest of the family may help to explain this mystery.

The Baltic state of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEstonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; expects to sign a border agreement with the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARussia"&gt;Russian Federation&lt;/a&gt; in a few weeks, before the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; Summit, which is set to take place in early May. &lt;a href="w%3AUrmas%20Paet"&gt;Urmas Paet&lt;/a&gt;, the Estonian Foreign Minister said, "There are no concrete arrangements yet but we hope the border agreement will be signed by the time the EU-Russia summit begins in Moscow on May 10. Estonia is ready to sign today."

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJavier%20Solana"&gt;Javier Solana&lt;/a&gt;, the EU foreign policy chief, said that the sooner the agreement is signed, the better. He stated that, "I'd be happy to witness the signing of your [Estonian] and the Latvian agreement with Russia. It is possible on May 10 but there are no guarantees."

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEstonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALatvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;, which were occupied by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; until the early 1990s, joined the European Union in 2004. The two countries both border the Russian Federation, and have been trying to sign definitive border treaties for a long time since independence, but Moscow has repeatedly delayed on signing.

Solana said he hoped the treaty would be signed at the EU-Russia Summit, because "Relations with the countries on the EU border [such as Russia] are very important."

"By any measurement, Sir Joh was an exceptional state builder who will be remembered for consistently placing Queensland first," said the Australian Governor General, Major General Jeffery, in a statement.

Australian Prime Minister, John Howard: "He was certainly a strong political figure and I extend my condolences to his wife and his family."

But not all voices were sympathetic, prominent Queensland Aboriginal activist Sam Watson for example: "Aboriginal people will always remember him as a racist, a thug and a dictator."

Having suffered severe ill-health for some weeks, and declining health for years, Sir Joh passed away at around 6pm AEST. He was surrounded by his family, who had been summoned yesterday by Lady Flo, his wife and one-time Senator, for final goodbyes.

Phrases such as "Don't you worry about that" and "Goodness gracious me" were like trademarks to the maverick leader.

Known simply as 'Joh' to many, he would famously describe press conferences as 'feeding the chooks'. Today Kingaroy locals taunted waiting press with cries from "You're chooks, you're chooks, ha ha" to "Go home, ya vultures", and some obscenities, reported the ♡❤Courier-Mail♡❤ of Brisbane.

His fall from power at the end of the 80s was surrounded in controversy, with the state embroiled in corruption findings going to the level of his deputies, and Bjelke Petersen's claims of ignorance coming under challenge with charges of perjury. The case was never heard due to a controversial hung jury: the foreman of the jury, Luke Shaw, had been an office-bearer of the Young Nationals &amp;mdash; an arm of Bjelke Petersen's National Party &amp;mdash; as well as a member of a group calling themselves 'Friends of Joh'.

Having had his start in life as a peanut farmer in remote Kingaroy, the former Premier was fit up until the very end, but palsy was paralyzing his muscles and organs, to which he eventually succumbed.

"Throughout his life Sir Joh combined enormous energy, vision and an immense capacity for hard work, most especially during his 19-year term as Premier of Queensland," the Governor General said.

"What looked to us to be huge risks at the time turned out to be nation building," said Bob Katter, a former minister of Joh's Government, who credited Sir Joh with starting the Queensland coal, aluminum and tourism industries.

He is also remembered for dismantling many of the State's unions, and for a somewhat totalitarian and heavy handed style of keeping control.

Under Joh, street protests were banned and Special Branch monitored extensively those the authoritarian leader saw as subversives, measures prompting Queenslander, Australian Civil Liberties Council, Terry O'Gorman, to comment Sir Joh was "the most appalling premier Queensland has ever had in terms of civil liberties and human rights".

Joh was also influential in the famous case of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20constitutional%20crisis%20of%201975"&gt;Dismissal&lt;/a&gt; by the Governor General of then-Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGough%20Whitlam"&gt;Gough Whitlam&lt;/a&gt;, in 1975.

In his last years as Premier, he had taken his cause to the nation's capital, with the "Joh for PM" campaign. But this distraction has been credited with the downfall of his government, with corruption investigations at last being conducted by his stand-in, Bill Gunn.

The body of Sir Joh, who was of &lt;a href="w%3ALutheranism"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; faith, is to be buried at Bethany, the family property near Kingaroy.

Unsolicited quotes from ordinary Australians, many ex-Queenslanders seeking refuge in southern states, on hearing the news:

"Outrageous bastard! Oh God! That was polite!" &amp;mdash; "Karen"

"Guilty as Hell. And that's where he is now." &amp;mdash; "Michael"

"Yay! Good riddence to bad rubbish" &amp;mdash; "Liza"

"The dictator is gone our time 2 sing" &amp;mdash; "John. H."

"Yeah he took a while &amp;mdash; about 90 f*cking years overdue!" &amp;mdash; "Hose Man"

"The pope an joh at least somethin going right" &amp;mdash; "Helen"

"Corrupt f*cking sh*teating Bible-bashing f*ckw*t is dead. And thank f*ck. I haven't been so happy since September 11!" &amp;mdash; "Greg"

"I don't drink but I'll be having a red whilst dancing on his grave." &amp;mdash; "Cellest"

"Ding dong the d*ck is dead!" &amp;mdash; anon.

"Yeahhh!!! Fucking finally" &amp;mdash; "Leo"

"It's a great day today the Rednecks are silent a great victory has been won" &amp;mdash; "Zenner"

The president of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;, said on Friday that his country will do everything possible in order to free the three Romanian journalists kidnapped in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago, after Islamic militants released a video threatening to kill them.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAl-Jazeera"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; reported a few days earlier that the Iraqi militants would kill the journalists unless the Romanian government withdraws its troops from the country within four days. With 850 troops, Romania has one of the largest contingents in Iraq. In January this year, after President Băsescu was elected, he pledged to send more peacekeeping troops in Iraq.

On Friday evening, the colleagues and relatives of the journalists gathered in front of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACotroceni%20Palace"&gt;Cotroceni Palace&lt;/a&gt;, Băsescu's residence, to call for their release. After learning of the released tape, Băsescu returned from the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGUUAM"&gt;GUUAM&lt;/a&gt; summit in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AChisinau"&gt;Chişinău&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMoldova"&gt;Republic of Moldova&lt;/a&gt;, where he was an observer, to Bucharest, where he called for a meeting with the relevant departments to discuss the issue.

The families of the journalists were also invited to Cotroceni, and sympathy was expressed for them. The President told them that, "The state institutions are doing everything we can [to save the three journalists]."

Reporter Marie-Jeanne Ion, from Prima TV, and cameraman Sorin Dumitru Miscoci and reporter Ovidiu Ohanesian, from newspaper România Liberă, were kidnapped in Baghdad on March 28, one day after President Băsescu made an unexpected visit to Iraq to announce a supplement of troops.

<h1>Immigration and asylum turn voters off UK Tories</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Immigration%20and%20asylum%20turn%20voters%20off%20UK%20Tories&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Opinion polls are showing that the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;'s tough stance on immigration in the &lt;a href="UK%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;UK general election&lt;/a&gt; is turning more voters away than it is winning.

The policies of tighter border control and quotas on asylum seekers are part of the big five promises in the Conservative manifesto and have featured prominently in the party's advertising campaign and party election broadcasts.

The policy has increasingly been an embarrassment for the Tories, however, since a Guardian/ICM opinion poll last week showed that floating voters and those on the liberal side of the party were being put off by the policy, and that only 8% of voters consider immigration a significant problem.

This was followed by the revelation that tighter border control would apply only to the country's largest air and sea ports.

The Tories' Australian election strategist, Lynton Crosby, is widely credited with having prompted the unpopular policy, so similar to that used to swing voters by previous employer the Australian Liberal Party in a recent Australian election. The tactic, harping on supposed xenophobia of the average voter, has been called 'Dog Whistle' politics.

Intellectual debate was completely bypassed in the Australian election, when Labor, the major opposition party, failed to tackle the subject through rational debate, but instead competed with the government, scrambling to tackle the supposed external threat.

On Monday residents of an apartment building just outside of &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; discovered a &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; bomb lodged in their chimney. Officials were able to defuse the device, reports &lt;a href="http%3A//www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/1113862782"&gt;All Headline News&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are other remnants of the World Wars that have been much more difficult for the French to defuse.

The prevalence of anti-French sentiments reached a frenzied zenith prior to the U.S. invasion of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. While it seemed that the storm had calmed recently, this week's release of Richard Chesnoff's latest book, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/050425/25chesnoff.peo.htm"&gt;♡❤The Arrogance of the French: Why They Can't Stand Us--and Why the Feeling Is Mutual♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, reminds us that this issue is not going away anytime soon. While there have been fewer sightings of "liberty toast" in recent months, from discussions with students in both the U.S. and France, this reporter found that America's perception of the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20people"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; remains a hot topic of discussion on college campuses.

Bryan Doeg, a military science student at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ucf.edu/"&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt;, outlined the two prevailing thoughts that are the basis for many of these anti-French sentiments.

"Most of my fellow students feel that the French are politically and militarily weak," said Doeg. "And their people are stuck up."

Doeg believes that he and his classmates are not without reason for their perceptions about the French.

"They are weak because of France's decline in power over the last century and it's defeats against the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20war"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlgerian%20War%20of%20Independence"&gt;Algerians&lt;/a&gt;," Doeg said. "And most of my experiences regarding their arrogance comes from soldiers who visited France and were treated like untouchables by the locals."

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.smsu.edu/"&gt;Southwest Missouri State&lt;/a&gt; (SMS) finance major, Fabian Florant, got straight to the point when discussing Doeg's first assumption that the French are weak.

"Americans hate the French with a passion because of &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20war"&gt;World War I and II&lt;/a&gt;," Florant said.

However some students pointed to France's involvement in the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.americanrevolution.org/frintro.html"&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, questioning how long America's memory really is.

Jessica Morgan, an &lt;a href="http%3A//www.smsu.edu/English/index.html"&gt;SMS English&lt;/a&gt; major, said that this and other examples have shown that France is far from being weak.

"They stood up against &lt;a href="w%3AHitler"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; when he was in his prime for months before he occupied their country," Morgan said. The fact that by the time we got there, the Germans were a heck of a lot weaker than they were when the French had to face them doesn't seem to register."

Morgan emphasized that France's refusal to support U.S. war efforts is a resounding display of strength.

"It's somewhat ironic that we call them weak," Morgan said. "They &lt;a href="http%3A//www.washtimes.com/world/20030728-122353-4255r.htm"&gt;stood up to the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; as well, daring the disapproval of the U.S. ... and all we can do is throw childish insults back at them."

Lysiane Lavorel, a native of France and college student studying English there, offered a tongue-in-cheek response to France's supposed weakness while making reference to the 1996 film &lt;a href="http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/"&gt;♡❤Independence Day♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

"As for the French being weak, it's true that in comparison with the strong and good Americans preventing &lt;a href="w%3AExtraterrestrial%20life"&gt;aliens&lt;/a&gt; from invading the Earth, we are more than weak," Lavorel said. "It's true that we don't have any real impact on the world, and I find it much more comfortable that way ... I wouldn't want to feel responsible for a war, for example."

Doeg's second assumption is that the French are arrogant, and Lavorel agrees again.

"Yes of course, I think we French are very arrogant," Lavorel said.

Lavorel went on to explain her definition of French arrogance.

"It's quite hard for us to see how people [Americans] seem to be so easily manipulated by government, big firms or media," Lavorel said. "Because for most French, we have learned to become skeptical, doubtful and to make our own opinion on things. This appears to be very arrogant, doesn't it?"

However, she pointed out that this is especially true of Parisians, from which she says many of American's perceptions about the French are based.

"Even in France, they [Parisians] are said to be arrogant," Lavorel said. "They are said to consider France as only composed of Paris, and provincial people are just hillbillies."

An American student at a &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20life"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; university, who asked to remain anonymous to prevent the damage of his reputation among colleagues, said that he would describe 90 percent of the Parisians he has met as being arrogant.

"In an academic setting, this arrogance is particularly frustrating," the source said. "Often the Parisians I know belittle other people when they understand a complicated concept better than another person.

"On one occasion, a Parisian made a fool out of a good friend of mine," the source said. "My friend asked him how to model the &lt;a href="w%3Aeigenfunction"&gt;eigenfunction&lt;/a&gt; of a microdisk resonator with &lt;a href="w%3Afinite%20differences"&gt;finite-differences&lt;/a&gt; time-domain. He said 'everyone knows you can derive these fields analytically."

The source said that he is not perpetuating these stereotypes and that his preconceived notions do not alter how he perceives these interactions.

"Often I'll hear someone say something like, 'Oh and be careful when you meet him--he's French," the source said. "But you know, 99 percent of the time, all of the stereotypes prove to be perfectly true and the warning is useful."

&lt;a href="http%3A//mjf.smsu.edu/"&gt;SMS media&lt;/a&gt; student Lydia Mann, who visited France for two weeks recently and has hosted two French &lt;a href="http%3A//foreignexchangestudent.home.att.net/"&gt;foreign exchange students&lt;/a&gt;, said that these perceptions are based upon &lt;a href="http%3A//www.understandfrance.org/France/Intercultural.html"&gt;cultural differences&lt;/a&gt;.

"Americans, I think, misunderstand their culture which leads to their actions," Mann said. "They make a point to make themselves individualistic, which people find rude."

SMS English major Christin Green agrees and believes that this entire discussion that attempts to blanket such a large group of people is ridiculous.

"I want to learn about them with an open mind and a fresh perspective, unpolluted by bias or preconceived ideas," Green said. "It is not my place to judge or make assumptions about an entire people. There are bad people everywhere. There are good people everywhere. &lt;a href="w%3Aethnic%20stereotype"&gt;Stereotypes&lt;/a&gt; ruin this foundation and build another one that is much more destructive."

Rogers Cadenhead, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; owner of BenedictXVI.com, has made a few requests in his blog. Mr. Cadenhead registered the valuable domain on April 1 along with ClementXV.com, InnocentXIV.com, LeoXIV.com, PaulVII.com and PiusXIII.com; all in anticipation of the recent &lt;a href="w%3APapal%20conclave%202005"&gt;Papal conclave 2005&lt;/a&gt;. 

After &lt;a href="w%3ACardinal%20Ratzinger"&gt;Cardinal Ratzinger's&lt;/a&gt; election as &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt;, international media swooped on the domain speculating that it may be owned by a pornographer or casino company. However amid the wild speculation, Mr. Cadenhead dismissed these and promised not to sell the domain to any such enterprises.

However today in a humorous manner the prolific computer guide writer posted on his blog a few requests, namely:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Three days, two nights at the Vatican hotel they built for the conclave
BULLET::::2. &lt;a href="w%3AMitre"&gt;One of those hats&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::3. Complete absolution, no questions asked, for the third week of March 1987
BULLET::::4. A back-cover blurb from the Pope for the next edition of Movable Type 3 Bible Desktop Edition. But only if he uses the book to create his own weblog, and
BULLET::::5. World peace.

</ol>
However he was keen to stress that the requests are not demands and the whole thing was written in a witty humorous manner.

A 46-year-old motorist from South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; was hit by a frozen sausage on his way home. The projecticle flew through his open car window and broke his nose. When the Essex Ambulance Service arrived he had lost a large amount of blood, but he appears to now be recovering.

An ambulance service official says the 46-year-old man suffered a broken nose and lost a lot of blood.

The spokesman say it must have been an incredibly lucky, or unlucky, shot - to get the sausage through a moving car window. Police are now investigating the case of the flying sausage.

Leading &lt;a href="w%3AVoIP"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt; provider &lt;a href="w%3AVonage"&gt;Vonage&lt;/a&gt; negotiated access to the &lt;a href="w%3AQwest%20Communications"&gt;Qwest Communications&lt;/a&gt; emergency calling infrastructure, allowing Vonage customers in 14 states the ability to connect directly to emergency dispatchers by dialing &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt;.

With the exception of &lt;a href="w%3ARhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, VoIP's 911 callers were delivered to the administrative offices of a public-safety answering point, instead of connecting directly to a standard 911 dispatcher. The resulting time delay was a consequence of the phone provider's refusal to give VoIP providers access to the 911 infrastructure. Vonage Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Citron in a recent letter to Qwest Chairman and CEO Richard Notebaert, wrote "I applaud you [Qwest] for your willingness to put the health and safety of Americans before short-term competitive considerations."

“With the access that Qwest has agreed to provide, Vonage will be able to route emergency service calls placed by its customers directly to public-safety operators, which will help save lives and safeguard property" Citron said.

&lt;a href="w%3AVerizon"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; agreed to begin a trial in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; soon, and &lt;a href="w%3ABellSouth"&gt;BellSouth&lt;/a&gt; also started "making some movement" on the issue, according to Vonage.

Vonage claims "that &lt;a href="w%3ASBC%20Communications"&gt;SBC&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to begin discussions on working cooperatively to improve 911 offerings available to customers using VoIP." Vonage attorney William Wilhelm, in a letter to the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;, "noted its concern that SBC has already provided 911 interconnection access to its unregulated VoIP affiliate.”

Dermot Mannion has been named the new Chief Executive of &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland's&lt;/a&gt; national carrier, &lt;a href="w%3AAer%20Lingus"&gt;Aer Lingus&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Mannion, 47, will take up the post in August 2005.

Aer Lingus almost went bankrupt in 2002, but a major cost-cutting effort by former CEO Willie Walshe lead to a dramatic turnaround in the airline's fortunes, posting its largest ever profit in 2004. However, Willie Walshe left after a dispute with the government over privatization. He has since landed the top job at &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr. Mannion, an accountant, has extensive experience of aviation, having worked for the &lt;a href="w%3ADubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; based airline &lt;a href="w%3AEmirates"&gt;Emirates&lt;/a&gt; since 1995. There he worked as Finance Director and later President of Group Support Services. He originally comes from &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Sligo"&gt;County Sligo&lt;/a&gt; and is a graduate of &lt;a href="w%3ATrinity%20College%2C%20Dublin"&gt;Trinity College, Dublin&lt;/a&gt;.

Insurgents in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; struck across numerous regions using suicide car bombings, planted bombs and mortars, aiming at &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; and Iraqi soldiers alike, and taking a civilian toll as well. There are 19 reported dead and over 3 dozen wounded. 

A total of 10 bombs were reported, one of them near &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt; prison, where the photos of abused inmates were taken. While Baghdad was hit the hardest, hostilities were widespread.

Thus far, there is no single group responsible Saturday's following attacks:

A three-judge Texas Court of Appeals ruling will allow men who were overcharged at nudie clubs to sue for refunds and damages. 

The two plaintiffs, Paul Brian Meekey and Michael Fulmer, had their cases heard because they were charged more than a regular &lt;a href="w%3Alap%20dance"&gt;lap dance&lt;/a&gt; fee when they used a credit card, typically $25 for a $20 dance.

"Texas law is pretty clear that you cannot charge someone extra for using a credit card," said Sandra Krider, an attorney for the patrons. "The fact that they are strip clubs shouldn't mean they get away with it."

A lawyer for the businesses, Rick's Cabaret and the Men's Club, argued a case based on the type of employment the ladies agreed to perform.

“Since the dancers are independent contractors and not employees of the club, the clubs are not the ones selling the dances," said attorney Albert Van Huff.

But the men’s attorneys said the win could potentially become a class-action suit with many hundreds of men claiming their day in court. That could present a problem for other patrons who may not want their name and their use of a credit card at a nudie bar released in court transcripts.

"They are going to want the (strip) clubs' credit card companies to give them the names of all the different people who have charged dances there," said Van Huff.

The 14th Court of Appeals, a Texas court with headquarters in Houston, had reversed a ruling of a lower trial judge that this case should be heard before the state Finance Commission instead of in a judicial proceeding. The case was sent back to be tried again.

General Nebojsa Pavkovic, a commander during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict, is set to turn himself over to the UN Tribunal in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hague"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt; . During the conflict thousands of ethnic Albanians were slaughtered by the &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; Armed Forces. In a statement provided by the Serbian Government, Pavkovic plans to fly to the International Criminal Tribunal Monday to face charges. His choice to surrender is apparently voluntary.

On April 12, a &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; report recommended a start in talks for the eventual membership of Serbia into the union by forming a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. But EU ministers would back the proposal only if the key fugitive Pavkovic surrendered.

He would be the 12th war crimes suspect to go to The Hague this year.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (NYSE) announced last Wednesday that it has agreed definitively to merge with Chicago-based Archipelago Exchange (ArcaEx) and form a new publicly traded, for-profit company known as NYSE Group. This announcement was followed two days later by NASDAQ®, which independently announced a definitive agreement to purchase Instinet Group.

Archipelago and Instinet are innovative e-trading (electronic trading) companies, and formerly were the two largest American rivals to NYSE and NASDAQ, in recent years taking increasingly large portions of their market share. The &lt;a href="w%3ASecurities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; (SEC) and other regulatory agencies still have to review and approve the transactions, particularly with respect to US &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20securities%20law"&gt;securities law&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aantitrust%20law"&gt;antitrust law&lt;/a&gt;, in order to ensure that the marketplace remains lawful and competitive. 

Other pending issues for NASDAQ include obtaining the approval of Instinet shareholders, as well as customary closing conditions. NYSE must obtain the approval of its members and Archipelago shareholders.

These changes, a reaction to increased e-trading competition and a changed regulatory environment, will result in NASDAQ and NYSE trading each other's shares and attempting to grab market share, which many hope will drive down transaction costs and ultimately benefit consumers. However, at least one commentator, Dan Ackman writing in ♡❤Forbes♡❤, has noted that the trading commission at the NYSE currently averages less than a nickel (US$0.05) per share, and was less enthusiastic about potential efficiency gains from electronic trading at the exchange.

The transactions are also intended to make the two leading American stock exchanges more globally competitive with such exchanges as the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Frankfurt Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Toronto Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Australian Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; located in Sydney.

<h2>NYSE Group</h2>

The NYSE-Archipelago merger would result in some of the most sweeping changes in the 212-year history of the NYSE. The NYSE, which has always been a not-for-profit company, would for the first time incorporate and itself be a publicly-traded company, in what is potentially a large stock offering. However, the regulatory functions of the NYSE would continue to be conducted independently by a private not-for-profit organization.

NYSE is merging with Archipelago in a "stock for membership" deal, in which NYSE members are to receive cash and 70% of newly issued stock, and Archipelago's shareholders would receive 30% of the new stock, forming a new holding company known as the NYSE Group. The merger is expected to be completed by either the fourth quarter of 2005 or the first quarter of 2006.

"This strategic move is courageous, almost unbelievable, but this is going to make the New York Stock Exchange in my opinion a potentially giant publicly traded company. The main reason is they've got brand, they've got companies, they've got liquidity [and] with Archipelago they have electronic global access," said Harold Bradley of American Century Investments to ♡❤Investor's Business Daily♡❤.

NYSE has traditionally used the "open cry auction" system where buyers and sellers gather in a boisterous trading floor to shout "buy" and "sell" orders. It has been slow to adapt to new technology, still manually punching in 90% of its orders. 

However, Last November NYSE introduced a new, faster Java-based trading system for its floor exchange that is currently in the process of phased roll-out. NYSE TradeWorks, a management system for stock orders, was developed in a first-of-kind partnership with external company &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href="w%3AJava%202%20Platform%2C%20Enterprise%20Edition"&gt;J2EE&lt;/a&gt; open systems, custom-built Linux-based workstations and &lt;a href="w%3AHP-UX"&gt;HP-UX&lt;/a&gt; servers running IBM's &lt;a href="w%3AWebSphere"&gt;WebSphere&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Amiddleware"&gt;middleware&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="w%3ADB2"&gt;DB2&lt;/a&gt; database on the back end running on an IBM &lt;a href="w%3AZSeries"&gt;zSeries&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIBM%20mainframe"&gt;mainframe&lt;/a&gt;. NYSE, which does most of its IT development internally, announced that they do not plan to combine their IT department with Archipelago's.

The future of the traditional floor trading system remains uncertain. Some commentators believe it provides a necessary antidote to the occasionally chaotic instability of electronic trading, while others believe that future trends toward electronic trading would provide advantages of speed and fluidity of trade, and make the old-fashioned system of floor trading redundant and obsolete. Roger Burkhardt, Chief Technology Officer of NYSE, told ♡❤Computerworld♡❤ last December that the merger will attempt a "hybrid" trading model where both human and computer trading are coordinated side-by-side, which in its scope is a difficult and unprecedented task.

Current owners of seats in the exchange have expressed concerns over how the new merger will affect them. The seats, which confer the right to trade on the floor and are typically leased to traders under the current system, will likely be bought back by the NYSE Group from the individual owners. The exact system of how traders will lease access to the trading floor from the new company has yet to be worked out.

Also of concern to owners is the reported plans for a "stock lockup" (preventing selling of portions of stock in the new NYSE Group by the new stock recipients) for the next 3 to 5 years. However, their inability to immediately profit from sale of their newly issued stock would be compensated by the price they receive for their seat, or perhaps by a separate stock issuance.

The NYSE has been subject to complaints in recent years, concerning:
<ul>
BULLET::::- former chairman &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Grasso"&gt;Richard Grasso&lt;/a&gt; and his nearly US$140 million compensation package, thought to be excessive.
BULLET::::- advantages held by floor traders which are perceived to be unfair by the general public.
BULLET::::- conversely, a lack of attention to the needs of floor traders.
BULLET::::- various regulatory actions including an indictment against 15 current and former traders earlier this month on charges of improper trading.

</ul>
However, most of the participants in the merger expressed confidence in taking advantage of historic opportunities. “This combination will be good for investors and for America. It will create a strong, dynamic and innovative enterprise capable of meeting the demands of investors and issuers throughout the world in the decades ahead,” said John A. Thain, CEO of the NYSE. “As we look to the future and to the challenge of competing globally in a high-speed electronically connected world, it is clear that we must do more. This transaction will mean we will be more diversified and transparent, and better able to compete, grow and serve our customers."

<h2>NASDAQ</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3ANASDAQ"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/a&gt;, formerly an acronym for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, was founded in 1971 as the world's first electronic stock market, and by some measures is now the world's largest exchange. Its purchase of Instinet Group, although it followed the NYSE merger announcement by only two days, was actually pursued independently for as long as six months and is set to continue regardless of the NYSE outcome. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

NASDAQ's planned acquisition, Instinet Group, will be split along the lines of its separate divisions for sale in a cash transaction (figures are approximate):
<ul>
BULLET::::- Instinet, an institutional broker with about 1,500 customers and worldwide access to more than 30 securities markets, will be sold to private equity group Silver Lake Partners for US$207.5 million. The transaction will mostly be financed in convertible notes from NASDAQ issued to Silver Lake as well as Hellman &amp; Friedman, who is the largest shareholder in NASDAQ.
BULLET::::- Lynch, Jones, and Ryan (LJR), provider of commission rebate services and subsidiary of Instinet which they acquired in 2000, would be sold to the Bank of New York for US$174 million.
BULLET::::- INET, the electronic marketplace and former competitor to NASDAQ with more than 800 broker-dealer customers involving access to about 25% of NASDAQ equities trading, would be sold to NASDAQ for US$934.5 million, in a transaction to be partly financed by the issuance of US$750 million in six-year corporate bonds; NASDAQ expects the deal to become profitable to its shareholders within a year.

</ul>
Instinet stockholders would receive about US$1.88 billion in cash total, including the above amounts as well as US$562 million from INET's available cash. Of this amount, about US$1 billion would go to &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, a shareholder of 62% of the company's stock, which is getting rid of Instinet to focus on its core areas of providing news and financial data.
NASDAQ president and CEO Bob Greifeld, said, “This transaction will allow NASDAQ to compete more effectively with other U.S. and international market centers by making our technological platform more competitive, which will result in greater cost efficiencies and improved quality of execution in our market &amp;mdash; qualities that today’s individual and institutional investors demand. NASDAQ will continue to innovate and will also have the ability to tap new opportunities in other asset classes.”

He continued, “Regulation NMS has defined the new competitive landscape by calling for all market centers to be mutually accessible. With this move we maintain our status as the low cost provider and at the same time provide increased order interaction for both NASDAQ and exchange listed securities. We also believe this further enhances our ability to attract new listings. We want to thank all of our partners for their combined efforts on this transaction."

<h1>Romanian reporters call for release of hostages in Iraq</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Romanian%20reporters%20call%20for%20release%20of%20hostages%20in%20Iraq&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; reporters gathered in central &lt;a href="Bucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; Saturday calling for the release of three colleagues kidnapped by &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; militants late last month. One of the abducted journalists was from ♡❤Prima TV♡❤, and two were from the newspaper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARomania%20Libera"&gt;♡❤România Liberă♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In a tape released Friday by the kidnappers, they said if the Romanian government does not pull all its troops out of Iraq, the journalists will be killed. With 860 troops in Iraq, Romania currently has one of the largest coalition contingents there.

The reporters stopped short of calling for the removal of troops from Iraq, but said they would continue protesting until the journalists are released. ♡❤Prima TV's♡❤ Cristina Topescu said, "We will stay here until they are released. I am trying to be optimistic, but I am scared because of those images. However, I keep hoping."

Romanian President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said after the release of the tape that he would do everything possible to save the lives of the journalists, even though he has been criticised by many Romanians for not doing enough. Earlier in the year, Băsescu said that he would like to send more troops to Iraq, potentially making Romania the fourth-largest partner in the Coalition.

Opinion polls conducted in Romania show that only 45% of the population support the maintenance of troops in Iraq. Several political parties have also called for the removal of the troops, particularly the social liberal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20Humanist%20Party"&gt;Humanist Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the right-wing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Great%20Romania%20Party"&gt;Popular Great Romania Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Representatives of Romania's small Arab community also campaigned for the release of the journalists, holding banners showing pictures of the three with the word "Freedom" written in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20language"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArabic%20language"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Samir Zanun, the leader of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordanian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; community in Romania, said "We are asking for their unconditional release and safe return home."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters without Borders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also condemned the kidnapping, saying "By demanding the withdrawal of Romania's troops from Iraq, kidnappers are once again putting journalists at the centre of an unbearable act of blackmail."

The camera happened to be filming on March 14 as part of a classroom self-improvement exercise at Fairmount Park Elementary. Video of the event has been released by a lawyer for the child's mother.

The little girl had already calmed down from her tantrum by the time of arrival of the police, but they cuffed her anyway. Police had been called when a phone call to mother Inga Akins, had led teachers to believe that it would take an hour for Ms Akins to arrive and take the girl away.

The video reportedly shows three officers pin the passive girl's arms behind her back and put on handcuffs, as she screams, "No!"

Attorney for the mother, John Trevena, called the incident "incomprehensible". He provided the tape to the media this week, after obtaining it from police.

"The image itself will be seared into people's minds when you have three police officers bending a child over a table and forcibly handcuffing her," said Mr Trevena.

Police planned to investigate the incident and make public the findings in around two weeks.

<doc id="8746" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=8746" title="British government considering new nuclear power stations">
<h1>British government considering new nuclear power stations</h1>
♡❤♡April 24, 2005♡❤♡ &lt;br&gt;

Advisers to British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; are suggesting that constructing new nuclear power stations would be the best way to meet the country's targets on reducing emissions of gases responsible for &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;.

The government has a near-term target of cutting emissions below 1997 levels by 20%, and a more ambitious target of a 60% cut by 2050.
Critics of nuclear power say that it will not be able to help meet the 2010 target due to the length of time needed to plan, construct and commission such power plants. However backers say nuclear power will help meet the 60% cut by 2050 target.

Sir David King, Chief Scientific Advisor to the government, is a supporter of nuclear power believing that it is the best way to tackle global warming.

The chairman of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Nuclear%20Fuels"&gt;British Nuclear Fuels&lt;/a&gt;, a company that operates several British nuclear reactors, said that he expects Tony Blair to make an announcement of new power stations within weeks of the May 5 general election if he is re-elected.

Another primary supporter of nuclear power is the ex-BBC Director General Lord Birt, who has been advising 10 Downing Street on various issues by providing 'blue-sky' thinking without payment, as part of the Strategy Unit. He is said to be preparing a report that will say nuclear energy provides an opportunity to reduce dependence on Middle Eastern oil supplies (although very little oil is burnt for electricity production in the UK).

While it is believed that senior Cabinet members would not oppose a plan for new nuclear power stations if Tony Blair proposed it, the Environment Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt; and Trade and Industry Secretary &lt;a href="w%3APatricia%20Hewitt"&gt;Patricia Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; both oppose nuclear power.

New reactors would probably be sited next to existing reactors to limit public opposition.

Nuclear power currently provides 22% of the UK's electricity needs. The UK has 31 operating reactors at 14 power plants, but by 2015 all but three stations will have been shut down. The last nuclear reactor to open was Sizewell B on the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sea"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast in 1995. The 1,188MW station was a large reason why the UK met its carbon dioxide emissions reduction target in the 1990s. British nuclear power stations have created 2,000 cubic metres of nuclear waste. There are currently no plans for the long-term storage of the waste.

By comparison, just over 3% of Britain's electricity comes from &lt;a href="w%3Arenewable%20energy"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;. France met 78% of its electricity needs in 2002 using nuclear power.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush's&lt;/a&gt; controversial nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, &lt;a href="John%20R.%20Bolton"&gt;John R. Bolton&lt;/a&gt;, seemed stalled as new allegations surfaced in the Senate Committee's second interview. Lawmakers from both parties, particularly &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, express strong reservations.

<h3>Democrats argue against Bolton</h3>

"He wants to be our top diplomat at the UN but his life has been something less than diplomatic," &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Durbin"&gt;Dick Durbin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the number two Democrat in the Senate, said on a Sunday talk show.

"He wants to work with people around the world. And he couldn't work with people in his own office. And he's supposed to be open, as our man at the UN, to ideas from other people," Durbin said.

"He's been a real tyrant when it came to people he worked with, who disagreed with him. This man doesn't have the temperament for this job."

There was no consensus Thursday whether the Senate committee should ask Bolton to return for more questioning. He testified for eight hours and presented a written draft on other questions, but the stream of allegations has only intensified, as well as a characterization of him as a boss who mistreated fellow workers and lost his temper frequently.

Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Bolton would be hobbled in the job because of the allegations raised during the confirmation hearings. Dodd spoke on CBS's "Face the Nation."

Dodd maintains the Democrats raise objections to Bolton because of evidence he twisted intelligence analysis to fit his personal views. He said Bush should consider withdrawing the nomination.

"There are plenty of other good people who embrace his ideological views," Dodd added. 

<h3>Republicans divided</h3>

But some Republicans had a differing view. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) thought Bolton's "forceful" personality made him the ideal candidate to lead U.S. efforts to reform the UN. He put little concern into Bolton's alleged personnel problems, saying that Bolton's supposed history of trying to get analysts who disagreed with him fired were unproven. McConnell is the second ranked Senate Republican. He was also speaking on the CBS program.

Lincoln Chafee, Republican Senator of Rhode Island, has said he is "less likely" to vote for the nominee as a result of the questions that are being raised about his credibility. Instead he sought out the opinion of former Secretary of State Colin Powell.

Powell's spokeswoman, Peggy Cifrino, said he returned calls Thursday to senators who wanted to discuss questions that have been raised about Bolton. Powell was the only former GOP secretary of state who did not sign a recent letter endorsing Bolton for the job. It is known that the two did not get along during Powell's tenure in the Bush Administration. Powell's former chief of staff has been quoted by the US press as saying Bolton would make an "abysmal ambassador."

Some Republicans in Congress are doubtful that Bolton will win nomination now that the vote has been pushed back to May 12 to allow more time to investigate his history. Speaking on CNN television Senator Arlen Spector, R-PA, said the odds on Bolton were "too close to call."

<h3>Bolton criticism of UN</h3>

Some wondered what Bush's reasoning could be for nominating Bolton for the UN post since Bolton acknowledged saying in 1994 that the UN headquarters in New York "has 38 stories. If it lost ten stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference."

Also in 1994, Bolton said, "There is no such thing as the United Nations. There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that's the United States, when it suits our interest and when we can get others to go along." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/fedagencies/jan-june05/bolton_3-8.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"

In response to criticism of these statements at his hearing, Bolton replied, "There's not a bureaucracy in the world that couldn't be made leaner."

<h3>Presidential support</h3>

It appears to trained observers that Bush may have to yield his nomination to a Senate rejection. Behind the scenes, Bolton may be facing a question of withdraw or be pushed out. As President Bush asked Senators to support his nominee, Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said he strongly supports Bolton, but "I can't speak for all of (GOP) leadership."

President Bush continues to support his nominee, according to Whitehouse spokespersons. In an April 20 news briefing, press secretary Scott McClellan said in response to a question whether the Bolton nomination was lost, "No, absolutely not. I think what you're seeing is some Democrats on the committee trumping up allegations and making unsubstantiated accusations against someone the President believes will do an outstanding job at the United Nations. He is someone who has been an effective manager, a strong diplomat who has gotten things done. And I think he's earned the respect of many people that he has worked with because of what he's done...people are playing politics with his nomination...He's exactly the kind of person we need at the United Nations during this time of reform."

On Sunday, White House spokeswoman Christie Parell, said the president is standing by Bolton as his nominee. "The president believes he's exactly the man needed at the United Nations," she said in reply to Dodd's comments.

<h1>Barry Prime changes mind about Swim Ireland</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Barry%20Prime%20changes%20mind%20about%20Swim%20Ireland&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Having announced that Barry Prime would take over the newly created post of National Performance Director for swimming, &lt;a href="w%3ASwim%20Ireland"&gt;Swim Ireland&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that the British coach has changed his mind about taking up the post. Speaking from his home Mr. Prime told journalists "It is with regret that I had to inform the Swim Ireland Board of my decision not to take up the position of National Performance Director." 

Barry Prime had agreed earlier this month to take over the post, but has changed his mind because he does not wish to move to Ireland from his current home in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. He said, "I have realized that I do not wish to leave Australia and for that reason, and that reason alone, I will not take up the post."

The loss of Mr. Prime, a seasoned professional coach at the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Institute%20of%20Sport"&gt;Australian Institute of Sport&lt;/a&gt;, is a major blow to Swim Ireland which has struggled in recent years to adapt to changes in international swimming.

&lt;a href="w%3AMolson"&gt;Molson&lt;/a&gt; Canada picks up Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. as the company maneuvers to make an entry into the craft beer market.

Creemore Springs of Creemore, Ontario, produces the locally popular Creemore Springs lager. The merger will allow the company to retain its identity.

"The Creemore brand image and brewing craft will remain unchanged," Creemore Springs Brewery chairman Bill Wilder said. "Molson understands and appreciates what is special about the Creemore brand and this makes them a great purchaser for the company."

Industry observers are mixed on the benefits of the deal for Molson. The CBC reports one analyst suggests Molson may be trying to replicate the success of rival Labatt's premium beers. Others point out the small brewery model does not scale up well, and the attraction of a "boutique" beer fades in large-scale production.

Molson Coors Brewing Co., formed by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;3.4 billion merger in February of two family-run companies, Canadian Molson and U.S. Coors brewing companies, is the fifth largest brewer in the world by volume.

Two car-rigged explosions in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; killed 15 and injured nearly 40 people beside a &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; Ahl al-Bait mosque Sunday. In &lt;a href="w%3ATikrit"&gt;Tikrit&lt;/a&gt;, 140km northeast of Baghdad, 6 were killed and nearly 26 injured in two suicide bombings. A car bomber drove into police assembled in an academy compound and detonated, then a second car bomber attacked a nearby army liaison office 20 minutes later. 

In the Baghdad attack, the bombings took place in the western al-Shoulah district in front of an ice cream shop near the mosque. The first blast was followed within minutes by the second blast after witnesses to the first bomb rushed in to help survivors.

The anti-coalition insurgencies Sunday inflicted its heaviest toll since the national elections held January 30.

The violence, aimed mostly at Iraqi security forces and Shiite strongholds, is partly blamed on the struggling National Assembly's efforts to gain a consensus in forming a new government. The lack of leadership has led to appointments of police and security officials with no consent from the Interior Ministry, and is against the requirement of the law. The lack of authority diminishes Iraqi efforts to put down and pursue rebel forces.

&lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Chalabi"&gt;Ahmed Chalabi&lt;/a&gt;, now-exiled, but a one time a seeker the Iraqi Prime Minister position himself and also a provider of US intelligence on weapons programs, said "We need a government immediately. The delay in forming a government has encouraged the terrorists."

By late Sunday, reports indicate &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20al-Jaafari"&gt;Iraqi Prime Minister-designate Ibrahim al-Jaafari&lt;/a&gt; was ready to name a cabinet as early as today or Tuesday, but such hopes have gone unfulfilled in the past. Efforts to include candidates in contentious top cabinet posts with &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; parliamentarians led by the &lt;a href="w%3AIyad%20Allawi"&gt;former PM Iyad Allawi&lt;/a&gt; may be abandoned to speed filling the positions.

The dominant Shiite &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Iraqi%20Alliance"&gt;United Iraqi Alliance&lt;/a&gt; took 146 of the 275 seats in parliament, while the main Kurdish bloc took 77. To many, exclusion of the Sunni representatives in posts such as defense or interior minister, or either oil and finance minister, is untenable when they control 40 parliamentary seats.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATrailer%20%28movie%29"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AJoss%20Whedon"&gt;Joss Whedon’s&lt;/a&gt; new &lt;a href="w%3AFilm"&gt;feature film&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASerenity%20%28movie%29"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to be released today (Tuesday, April 26). Joss Whedon, the creator of such &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Time"&gt;prime time&lt;/a&gt; television successes as &lt;a href="w%3ABuffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer"&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAngel%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;, is promoting his latest movie with the official Serenity movie web site and a formal announcement. Joss Whedon has also warned fans of the &lt;a href="w%3AFirefly%20%28television%20series%29"&gt;Firefly show&lt;/a&gt; to avoid viewing the &lt;a href="w%3ATrailer%20%28movie%29"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;, as it may be a &lt;a href="w%3ASpoiler%20%28media%29"&gt;spoiler&lt;/a&gt; for the movie, and may ruin their enjoyment.

This popular television writer and creator developed Serenity as a follow up to Firefly, a genre defining &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20fiction%20television"&gt;Sci-Fi&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ATV%20Western"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; that has received critical acclaim among &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20fiction%20fandom"&gt;science fiction enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt;, but failed to capture the interest of the typical &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Time"&gt;prime time&lt;/a&gt; viewer. Firefly debuted on the &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;FOX network&lt;/a&gt; in September, 2002, but was quickly canceled after &lt;a href="w%3ATelevision%20program"&gt;one season&lt;/a&gt;. 

Serenity uses many of the same lead actors and characters as the original television series. In an interview with Firefly actor &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Tudyk"&gt;Alan Tudyk&lt;/a&gt;, Serenity is the first film in a three-picture Firefly contract with &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Studios"&gt;Universal Studios&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;BR&gt;&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;ns and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;ers throughout the world stood still for their national war memorial days in remembrance of the failed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Corps"&gt;Australian and New Zealand Army Corps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; ANZAC &amp;mdash; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Gallipoli"&gt;attack on Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; that began on 25 April 1915. The fateful attack was designed to end the &lt;a href="World%20War%20I"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; more quickly by creating a supply line to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A hundred-thousand died in the battle, remembered every year as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AANZAC%20Day"&gt;ANZAC Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by both nations.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;-directed battle of Gallipoli is often seen as the defining moment in the 'birth' of Australia and New Zealand. With New Zealand &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; saying "For New Zealand as for Australia it was at Gallipoli that our young nations came of age." &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4479843.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This being the 90th anniversary of the attack, Clark, Australian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; and Britain's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales"&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are all at Gallipoli to remember that fateful campaign.

Some controversy has been created about Australian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; not attending the New Zealand ceremony at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Chunuk%20Bair"&gt;Chunuk Bair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the Gallipoli Peninsula. This has upset many people as it is a break in a tradition that the Prime Ministers attend the ceremonies of both countries.

The ♡❤All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health♡❤ has begun a campaign to instruct street vendors in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; how to safely prepare food for their customers to avoid inflicting 'Delhi belly'–severe diarrhea–which afflicts about half of the visitors to the region. Over 150,000 "stall wallahs" in &lt;a href="Calcutta"&gt;Calcutta&lt;/a&gt; will be shown how to properly prepare dishes such as ♡❤jhalmuri♡❤ (a rice, tomato, and onion dish) and ♡❤ghughni♡❤ (a chick pea curry dish).

"Do not set up your stall in the middle of a rubbish dump, drain or sewage channel," the report recommends. "Wash your hands before cooking and do not let large swarms of flies settle on food displays."

"One of the tips we’ve been given is to wear aprons," Banahari Saha, a stall operator on Camac Street, in Calcutta, told ♡❤UPI♡❤. "We’ve also been told how important it is to make sure the water is clean and uncooked food is protected from flies," he said.

The campaign is also sponsored by the &lt;a href="World%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. Tourists will be given maps pointing to street vendors who have been approved by the ♡❤All India Institute♡❤.

"My customers say they're happy with the changes I've introduced," Saha told ♡❤UPI♡❤.

A &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; cinematographer, &lt;a href="skydiving"&gt;skydiving&lt;/a&gt; with 14 others, was killed on Saturday when his legs were severed at the knees by the wing of the aircraft that had just dropped him.

Albert Wing III deployed his parachute and caught an updraft when the left wing of a DHC-6 Twin Otter propeller plane struck him. He managed to control his descent and land near the DeLand Airport, about 40 miles north of &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;.

He was airlifted to a hospital where he later died. It was not known if he was filming at the time of the accident, and a camera has not been found.

The plane and the other sport jumpers landed safely.

Australian broadcasters &lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Broadcasting%20Service"&gt;♡❤SBS♡❤&lt;/a&gt; report three deaths in violence centered around allegations of fraud in Sunday's election in the west &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; nation of &lt;a href="w%3ATogo"&gt;Togo&lt;/a&gt;. The election is held to choose a president to replace Togo's recently deceased ruler of 38 years, &lt;a href="w%3AGnassingb%C3%A9%20Eyad%C3%A9ma"&gt;Gnassingbé Eyadéma&lt;/a&gt;.

Three candidates stood for the election: the son of the late president, Faure Gnassingbé, 74-year-old Emmanuel Akitani Bob, and Harry Olympio, a cousin of the man who lead Togo before the coup in 1963. A fourth candidate, Nicolas Lawson, also ran but removed himself from consideration 2 days before the election "because of fears of fraud," said the &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20of%20america"&gt;♡❤Voice of America News♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

The elder Gnassingbé died in February of this year while being transported out of the country for medical care. The Togolese army supported the son of the late ruler as an interim president in contravention of the constitution, which indicates that power should pass to the Speaker of the Parliament. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ABbc"&gt;♡❤BBC♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, at the time of the president's death, the current speaker, Fambare Natchaba Ouattara, was in .

The heads of state and representatives of 89 Asian and African countries met this weekend in &lt;a href="w%3ABandung"&gt;Bandung&lt;/a&gt;, capital of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Java"&gt;West Java&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. The three-day meeting, started Friday in commemoration of the golden jubilee (50th anniversary) of the original &lt;a href="w%3ABandung%20Conference"&gt;Bandung Conference&lt;/a&gt;, resulted in the discussion of a number of important international issues and future plans for similar high-level meetings and programs for action.

The two co-hosts of the event were President &lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt; of Indonesia and President &lt;a href="w%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<h2>Original Bandung conference, 1955</h2>

The 1955 Bandung conference has assumed almost mythical importance, as the giants of that age addressed post-colonial concerns of 29 Asian, African, and Middle Eastern nations, and collectively brought their interests to the world stage.

The conference, which was attended by the first Premier of the PRC, &lt;a href="w%3AZhou%20Enlai"&gt;Zhou Enlai&lt;/a&gt;, and the first Prime Minister of India, &lt;a href="w%3AJawaharlal%20Nehru"&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru&lt;/a&gt;, was called the "first intercontinental meeting of colored peoples in the history of mankind" by its host &lt;a href="w%3ASukarno"&gt;Sukarno&lt;/a&gt;, who was also first prime minister of Indonesia &amp;mdash; men with dreams and ambition in times of great change. 

Their shared vision gave fresh impetus to the African fight for independence from colonial oppression, and articulated the meaning of the "spirit of Bandung" with ten binding principles of non-aggression and peaceful friendship. This approach bore fruit a few years later in the creation the &lt;a href="w%3ANon-Aligned%20Movement"&gt;Non-Aligned Movement&lt;/a&gt;, which was an attempt by so-called &lt;a href="w%3Athird%20world"&gt;third world&lt;/a&gt; countries to coordinate their efforts to remain independent from the power struggle between the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>This year's Bandung summit</h2>

Leaders of some of the world's richest as well as poorest nations attended the summit, together representing some two-thirds of the world's population. &lt;a href="w%3APoverty"&gt;Poverty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aunderdevelopment"&gt;underdevelopment&lt;/a&gt; were the main issues under discussion. Also discussed were &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, UN reform, the breakdown of &lt;a href="w%3Amultilateralism"&gt;multilateralism&lt;/a&gt;, and the benefits and risks of &lt;a href="w%3Aglobalization"&gt;globalization&lt;/a&gt;. In response to the recent tragedy of the December 26, 2004 &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders adopted a joint statement to create a shared early warning system.

On the last day of the summit, Sunday April 24, Yudhoyono said, "History will judge us [not based on what we say here, but] on the basis of what we do in the days, months and years ahead -- whether we are true to the Bandung Spirit, or we fail it through failure of political nerve.

"We will be judged on how dedicated we are to our Strategic Partnership, on whether we can make it work to ensure a better life for our children's children.

"Let us therefore work together, so that we will deserve the kindness of history." After the speeches, Yudhoyono and Mbeki signed the "Declaration on the New Asian-African Strategic Partnership".

The conference was full of symbolism and music, speeches and celebration in honor of the Bandung Spirit and an attempt to recapture some of the magic of those former days. The more than 100 participants are in number the largest-ever gathering of Asian and African leaders. 

At the conclusion of the conference, led by their two-cohosts, Mbeki and Yudhoyono, more than 40 of the leaders followed in the historical footsteps of the 1955 conference, taking part in the ritual of the "Bandung walks". They strolled amid tight security from the aging Savoy Homman Hotel, to the white-columned Gedung Merdeka, or "Freedom Building".

Then the leaders each planted trees in the "Asia-Africa forest", one tree per country to symbolize close cooperation between their peoples, before getting on their jets and returning home.

<h2>Tensions at the conference</h2>

The events at the conference were overshadowed by recent tensions between Japan/China and North Korea/South Korea; however, some good did come of the countries' meeting.

<h3>Japan, China meeting</h3>

Chinese President Hu Jintao and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi are said to have met on Saturday and talked for about an hour, after Koizumi took the unusual step of a public apology at the conference. The relationship between their countries has been particularly tense in recent weeks; several Wikinews articles, cited below, describe the ongoing Chinese protests and demonstrations against Japan.

The two countries are growing commercial rivals and have ongoing territorial disagreements that pertain to certain oil and natural gas deposits they both claim. In addition, some Chinese have been offended by what they see as a Japanese attempt to whitewash their &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; record of aggression in revised school textbooks.

Hu has also taken particular offense at Koizumi's annual habit, since 2001, of visiting the &lt;a href="w%3AYasukuni%20Shrine"&gt;Yasukuni war cemetery and shrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. Hu said that "[Japan should] never do anything again that would hurt the feelings of the Chinese people." Koizumi has not yet visited the shrine so far this year.

It remains to be seen if and how the two parties may resolve their deep underlying differences.

<h3>North Korea, South Korea meeting</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korean&lt;/a&gt; President of Parliament &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Yong%20Nam"&gt;Kim Yong Nam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korean&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Hai-chan"&gt;Lee Hai-chan&lt;/a&gt; were among those attending the summit. The two are reported to have met and talked together for about 30 minutes on Saturday concerning the relationship between their countries. Their discussion is said to have touched on such issues of concern as North Korea's nuclear plans.

"It was the highest-level meeting between the South and the North since the summit on June 15, 2002. We had a great deal of frank discussions on important issues ... going beyond scheduled time. It was a good meeting. We had frank discussions about dialogue between the authorities [of the South and North] and the six party talks," Lee said.

According to Kim, North Korea would come back to the talks "when conditions were right". However, a definite timetable for resuming the six-party talks was not given. North Korea has recently boycotted the talks, and complained about certain positions taken by the USA, one of the six parties to the talks.

<h2>Program for future action</h2>

Delegates agreed to hold future meetings every two years (for foreign ministers) and every four years (for heads of state) in order to bring the principles of their strategic partnership into productive action. The next meeting of heads of state is planned for 2009 in South Africa.

<h2>Sampling of Remarks</h2>

Here are some representative comments made by various Afro-Asian leaders during their speeches at the summit.

<h3>Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations</h3>

"If we are to make our world fairer, freer and safer for all its inhabitants, the institutions of the United Nations should reflect the world of 2005, not 1945 &amp;mdash; particularly the Security Council. I believe the time is approaching when the Member States should take a decision to make the Council more representative, including by strengthening the representation of developing countries. I also believe they should create two new inter-governmental bodies &amp;mdash; a Peacebuilding Commission which would bring together the various actors involved in helping countries move from war to lasting peace, and a Human Rights Council in which States from all regions would participate."

<h3>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India</h3>

"Mr. Chairman Sir, to meet these challenges and constraints, we must respond in a manner worthy of the Bandung spirit. Just as that historic meeting redefined the agenda for its times, we must do so once again here today. The declaration on a new Asian African Strategic Partnership outlines guiding principles for joint action to achieve our goals in a changed global environment...

"In this spirit, in cooperation with our neighbour, Pakistan, we have embarked upon a journey of peace and good neighbourly ties. I appreciate the positive sentiments expressed by President Pervez Musharaff yesterday which I fully reciprocate. We are sincere in our desire to resolve all issues in a mutually acceptable manner. This will surely bring benefit to our people and to our region."

<h3>President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa</h3>

"I am honoured to wish this historic second Asian-African Conference success, convinced that we have the will to advance the cause pioneered by some of the greatest sons and daughters of Africa and Asia. We are most grateful to President Yudhoyono, the government and people of Indonesia who have opened the hearts and home to all of us, despite the heavy burdens imposed on them by the recent natural disasters that have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and caused incalculable destruction."

<h3>President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia</h3>

"The Strategic Partnership highlights the need to address issues of common concern, such as armed conflict, weapons of mass destruction, transnational organized crime and terrorism. Our strategic partnership also emphasized the need to promote practical cooperation in areas such as trade, industry, investment, finance, tourism, information and communication technology, energy, health, transportation, agriculture, water resources and fisheries. We are determined to prevent conflict and resolve disputes by peaceful means."

<h1>Japanese commuter train derails, apartment building smashed</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Japanese%20commuter%20train%20derails%2C%20apartment%20building%20smashed&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A seven-car commuter train carrying 580 passengers jumped off the tracks, plowed through a car, and collided with a nine-story apartment building in &lt;a href="w%3AAmagasaki"&gt;Amagasaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; on Monday at 9:18 am local time (00:18 UTC). The crash was about 410km west of &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AOsaka"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AHyogo%20Prefecture"&gt;Hyogo&lt;/a&gt; prefecture.

Casualties have risen to 101 deaths and at least 440 injuries. The train had 600 people on board at the time, including crew. Rescue workers swarmed the scene where two of the rail cars were flattened against walls of the apartment building.

It appears that excessive speed was a factor in the wreck. Investigators are focusing on the 23-year-old driver who overshot the last station on the line before the wreck, and had received a warning in the past for a similar incident.

The accident is the worst rail disaster since 1963, when a three-train crash killed 161. The rail is part of the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Japan%20Railway%20Company"&gt;West Japan Railway Co&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AFukuchiyama%20Line"&gt;Fukuchiyama Line&lt;/a&gt;. The rail president Takeshi Kakiuchi publicly apologized, telling reporters, "Our most important task now is to rescue the passengers from the accident and we are doing our best."

Japan has one of the world's most complex and widely used rail systems.

With two &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20walks"&gt;space walks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , 78 million miles and six months on board the &lt;a href="International%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; under their belts, Commander-Science Officer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeroy%20Chiao"&gt;Leroy Chiao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Flight Engineer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASalizhan%20Sharipov"&gt;Salizhan Sharipov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the station's 10th crew, landed in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz"&gt;Soyuz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft at 6:08 p.m. EDT Sunday.

Also returning was &lt;a href="European%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; Astronaut Roberto Vittori of &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, who launched to the Station with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2011"&gt;Expedition 11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; crew and spent eight days doing experiments. He was aboard under a contract between ESA and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Federal%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Russian Federal Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The re-entry of the ISS Soyuz 9 spacecraft was perfect, returning the astronauts to Earth 53 miles northeast of the town of Arkalyk after 192 days, 19 hours and 2 minutes in space for the Expedition 10 crew. The recovery team reached the capsule in minutes.

They launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan last Oct. 13 at 11:06 p.m. EDT. During their increment they performed two spacewalks, continued station maintenance and did scientific experiments.

Notable accomplishments included replacing critical hardware in the Joint Quest Airlock; repairing U.S. spacesuits; and submitting a scientific research paper on ultrasound use in space. Chiao was also the first astronaut to vote in the U.S. Presidential election from space. The crew completed two spacewalks, including experiment installation and tasks to prepare the Station for the arrival of the new European Automated Transfer Vehicle next year.

Aboard the Station, Commander Sergei Krikalev and Flight Engineer and &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; Station Science Officer John Phillips, the Expedition 11 crew, are beginning a six-month mission. It will include the resumption of Space Shuttle flights and two spacewalks from the Station. Expedition 11 is scheduled to return to Earth on October 7, 2005. The two latest occupants of the station launched with Vittori from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur"&gt;Baikonur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; April 14.

Krikalev and Phillips will have light duty for the next two days, as they rest after completing a busy handover period. For the past week, they have been learning about Station operations from the two men who called the ship home since October. Chiao and Sharipov briefed Krikalev and Phillips on day-to-day operations and gave them hands-on opportunities at Station maintenance. Chiao and Phillips restored the Quest airlock to working order for future spacewalks and practiced operating the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadarm2"&gt;Canadarm2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; robotic arm.

&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu%20Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt; announced today that Romania's 860 troops in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; will not be withdrawn, despite the demands of the terrorists who kidnapped three Romanian journalists in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; late last month.

In a public statement to Antena 1 television, Tariceanu said:

Tăriceanu added that the Romanian Government will do the most it can to save the lives of the journalists, but will not give in to terrorist demands. The Iraqi terrorists, known as the Muadh ibn Jabal Brigades, which are holding the three journalists captive issued a tape last Friday which gave the Romanian government four days to remove its troops, or the journalists would be killed. According to the tape, the deadline for the removal of the troops is today.

Today, central &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; has been filled by hundreds of peaceful ralliers calling for the journalists' freedom, and urging the government to save their lives at all costs. Romanian media workers and the journalists' families have been backed up by Romania's small Arab community, which today also rallied, with large green posters reading "Freedom" in English, Romanian and Arabic.

A poll was conducted recently which shows that 70% of Romanians want their troops to be removed from Iraq. This figure is up from 55% a week earlier.

The documentary is about the lost art of heckling in electoral debate and is due to be aired on BBC3 on &lt;a href="w%3A26%20April"&gt;26 April&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;. It includes interviews with prominent Conservative members &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hesiltine"&gt;Michael Hesiltine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Portillo"&gt;Michael Portillo&lt;/a&gt; about the importance of heckling and political debate.

"For the public service broadcaster purposely to disrupt part of a democratic election effectively to create entertainment shows just how far the standards of the BBC have plummeted," Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox told The Times.

"I do not believe that the BBC should be in the business of creating news," Conservative Communications head Guy Black told The Times.

Mr. Black also claimed the BBC has been unable to point to any &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; meetings that had been disrupted in a similar fashion, although producers claim that members of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; and Labour parties were also heckled.

At the time of the incident in question, the hecklers did not admit to their affiliation with the BBC, calling themselves "shoppers". It is also claimed by Mr. Black they were later spotted attending another event with the same crew at Stockton-on-Tees.

According to Mr. Black's letter of protest to the broadcaster, Sally Freestone, the UK Special Events assignments editor, was said to be "aghast" at the BBC's behaviour.

Conservative officials have demanded that the BBC apologize and promise not to air the controversial footage.

However, Helen Boaden, director of news at the BBC, refused to apologise and responded to the accusations in a letter to Mr. Black, shown to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.

Ms. Boaden accused the Conservatives of blowing "the whole episode out of all proportion" and grandstanding, saying: "No news was created until [Mr. Black's] letter was supplied to three national Sunday newspapers."

She responded to claims that the documentary had broken BBC guidelines by contesting the events as presented by Mr. Black, answering accustations that they had also been in Stockton-on-Tees and accusations by the Sunday Telegraph that the hecklers had been hostile to the Conservatives as "simply untrue".

The hecklers equipped by the BBC shouted "Michael Howard is a liar", "You can’t trust the Tories" and "You can only trust Tony Blair".

A BBC spokesman told reporters that they would be "investigating the complaint and very thoroughly and will be replying in due course."

The accession treaty of &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; was signed today in &lt;a href="w%3ALuxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;. As part of a ceremony, the treaty was signed by the heads of state of each of the 25 current &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; members, as well as the Bulgarian and Romanian heads of state, in what is seen as the most important step towards EU accession.

The signature of the accession treaty marks the transition of Bulgaria and Romania from candidate countries of the EU to accession countries, which can now send observers to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and participate in several European Union institution meetings. The countries will also receive extra funding between today and January 1, 2007, when the two countries are set to become full members of the European Union.

The accession treaty signing has been met with celebration in both Bulgaria and Romania. Romania also organised in Luxembourg a series of cultural events, known as ♡❤Zilele României la Luxembourg♡❤ (Romania's Days in Luxembourg). The cultural events included traditional Romanian music, concerts, an artistic performance and exhibitions by several important Romanian visual artists. Before the ceremony, Romanian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu%20Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt; said:

The 860-page treaty finalises the candidacy of the two &lt;a href="w%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;Southeastern European states&lt;/a&gt;, who will now have to work hard to implement last-minute reforms until their accession date, less than 21 months away. Both states must crack down on &lt;a href="w%3ACorruption"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;, as well as secure their external borders, strengthen the judiciary and align competition law with EU standards. Romania has recently been praised for taking decisive action against corruption, even though EU lawmakers said that there is a lot left to be done. Upon accession in 2007, Romania will also have the second-largest external border in the European Union, after &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. Due to this, it has recently upgraded several of its border checkpoints with &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMoldova"&gt;Republic of Moldova&lt;/a&gt;, even though more is left to be done until 2007.

The accession treaty signed today also includes references to a safeguard clause, which makes way for a delay in accession until 2008 if either Bulgaria or Romania do not meet their commitments.

Apart from the political reforms needed to join the European Union, EU funds will also help economic development in the two countries, enabling them to improve &lt;a href="w%3Ainfrastructure"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;, especially roads, clean up the environment and modernise their industries. While both countries are among the most developed in their region of &lt;a href="w%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, their per-capita income is between 30-35% of the European Union average. Therefore, when they join, they will be the two poorest countries in the EU.

The signing of the accession treaty should also boost foreign investment to the two countries. Both countries have benefited in terms of foreign investment from being candidate countries of the EU, and their new accession country status is expected to lure more foreign investors. Romania also introduced a &lt;a href="w%3Aflat%20tax"&gt;flat tax&lt;/a&gt; rate of 16% on personal income and corporate profit this year to attract more foreign investment.

When Bulgaria and Romania join in 2007, the European Union will have a population of approximately 484 million people, 30 million more than now. It will also raise the number of its members to 27, and add two extra official languages: Bulgarian and Romanian. The Bulgarian language will be the first official language of the European Union to be written in Cyrillic script.

Fischer is blamed for the award of visa practice. The German embassy in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKiev"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gave thousands of visas which were abused by criminals.

Fischer opened with a two hour speech explaining the visa practice from his point of view, and accepting responsibility for mistakes. He accused the conservative opposition of exaggerating the problem and campaigning against him and the government. 

The investigation committee questioned Fischer about the visa program under the new liberalised rules, passed under the previous government. Fischer noted that his visa practice was mainly a succession from the Kohl government, and that a liberal handling of the visa practice was a political decision. He argued for more freedom of travel, especially for citizens under authoritarian governments such as the former Ukraine government and the current in &lt;a href="Belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;. 

For the first time, sessions of an investigation committee are being broadcasted live on television.

Children who spend more time playing with other children are less likely to end up getting childhood cancers, a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; study published today in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Medical%20Journal"&gt;♡❤British Medical Journal♡❤&lt;/a&gt; has found. The finding supports the researchers' theory that reduced exposure to common infections in the first year of life increases the risk of developing &lt;a href="w%3AAcute%20lymphoblastic%20leukaemia"&gt;acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)&lt;/a&gt;.

A total of nearly 10,000 children took part in the study, located in 10 regions across the UK. Amount of time spent in daycare and social activity, during the first year of life, were used to gauge the level of exposure of the infants to common infections such as cold and flu.

Day care in the first year of life for at least two days a week, with at least three other kids, halved a child's chance of contracting ALL. Those who were rated in the category "any social activity" still had an improvement over the children rated as "no social activity": they had about 3/4 the chance of getting the disease.

The study describes that effect was "more striking" for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia &amp;mdash; a cancer affecting blood and the immune system &amp;mdash; than it was for the set of all other cancers. Increasing levels of activity saw decreasing chances of childhood cancers, when compared against children who during their first year had no regular social activity outside the home.

Theories have been around since the 1940s that childhood exposure to infection was related to the development of childhood leukaemia &amp;mdash; one, like the working theory of the UK study, said that lack of immune challenge was a factor, another that leukaemia developed as a delayed result of some type of infection.

The research was conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3AInstitute%20of%20Cancer%20Research"&gt;Institute of Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="w%3ASutton"&gt;Sutton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20School%20of%20Hygiene%20and%20Tropical%20Medicine"&gt;London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20York"&gt;University of York&lt;/a&gt;, Christie Hospital and Central Manchester and Manchester Children's University Hospitals NHS Trusts, and the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20York"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;.

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales spoke at the Harvard Law School tonight with a presentation titled "Wikipedia and the Digital Divide." Projected on a screen behind Wales was a running list -- in real time -- of edits to the German and English Wikipedias. Over the course of the hour, the list showed changes to topics like "Time Travel," "Dante Alighieri" and, in German, "The Maronite Patriarchs of Antioch."

Wales started with a summary of Wikipedia's goals; the bulk of the time was given over to questions from audience members. Approximately 65 people listened to Wales' remarks. According to a hands-up poll that Wales conducted at the start of the event, about half of those present had edited Wikipedia before. Six of those counted themselves as "Wikipedians," a title Wales suggested than anyone who's edited the Wikipedia even once should consider.

Before the event, Samuel Klein demonstrated the program, RCBirds, that created the running list behind Wales. RCBirds plays a bird call in response to each edit made to Wikipedia. Wikipedians edit constantly; one attendee found the frequency of bird calls distracting and asked Klein to turn down the volume on the program. 

Wales ran through some quick statistics about Wikipedia:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Wikipedias exist in roughly 200 languages, but most of those are dormant.
BULLET::::- The five largest, in order, are: English, German, Japanese, French, and ("You'll never guess," said Wales) Swedish. One attendee suggested, to general assent, that there was little else to do during long, dark winter nights.
BULLET::::- Over 20 languages have more than 10,000 articles.
BULLET::::- Over 50 languages have more than 1000 articles.

</ul>
Though the Chinese Wikipedia has over 25,000 articles, according to Wales, the Hindi and Arabic versions are smaller than Wales would like. Referring to those two editions, Wales said that Wikipedia is, "not so strong where we really need to be." Wales added later that the Chinese government has blocked access to the Wikipedia twice; once during the approach to an anniversary of Tiannamen Square, and once for no discernable reason. "We could make a big deal out of being blocked," said Wales, "but we'd just score points with the western media, and it wouldn't get us any closer to our goal." 

Wales described the organization behind the Wikipedia as an "International Red Cross of information," able -- and impelled -- to work in a neutral fashion with governments and NGOs. When asked about reaching out to the UN, however, he said that he had been warned by a Dutch minister that large bureaucracies tend to be comfortable working with other large bureacracies; the Wikipedia employs only Wales and thousands of volunteers.

Wales cited three factors that correlate with Wikipedia growth:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Economic wealth
BULLET::::- Degree of penetration of internet
BULLET::::- the number of people who speak English

</ul>
On the topic of the Hindi Wikipedia, Wales attributed the lack of growth to the prevalence of English keyboards. He said that when he has asked Hindi Wikipedia contributors what made the task difficult for them, they said that they were, "not used to typing Hindi."

"I don't know how to help with that," Wales said. He hoped that the situation would improve.

At this point in the talk, Wales opened the floor to questions.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; spoke live on state television Monday in his annual state-of-the-nation address using high ideological rhetoric when calling on lawmakers and the public to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. His 50 minute address from the &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow%20Kremlin"&gt;Kremlin's&lt;/a&gt; Marble Hall only briefly touched on the "epidemic of collapse" , a reference to upheavals in &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, which was "a real drama" stranding millions of Russians beyond the borders of the Russian Federation.

Brushing off what was probably taken as criticism during last week's visit by &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; who commented the Kremlin ran a "managed democracy", Putin stressed that "Russia ... will decide for itself the pace, terms and conditions of moving towards democracy." 

Putin was critical of the lack of progress in implementing his reform proposals. Calling for a crackdown on corruption, where treatment by tax inspectors are "terrorizing business", he addressed concerns of the business community by condemning a series of back-tax bills like the ones that dismembered Yukos and face other major Russian corporations.

He was also critical of a bureaucratic attitudes that treat "state service as some type of business". He made clear the need for investment must be met by "rules of the game" that are consistent, saying "Russia is certainly interested in the inflow of private investments on a large scale, including foreign investments. It is our strategic choice and our strategic approach."

Putin called for proposals to index wages to inflation over the next two years, and for the introduction of a flat 13% tax on undeclared earnings in the shadow economy, a slice that represents nearly 35% of the nation's economy, by legalizing what was previously defined as illegal income.

Putin supports the development of a strong state system with determination for Russia to avoid the disarray that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Saying, "First and foremost it is worth acknowledging that the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century." He sees the need for strengthening the legal system and the political environment to assure a more just society in avoiding a replay of a Russian downfall.

On politics, he pointedly abandoned the much-used ‘stability' catch phrase of the bureaucracy. Putin signaled to the bureaucratic caste who are on the eve of their upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections they should promote partisanship and civil society.

By studiously avoiding too many references to business, the thrust of his address sought to reassure the small property holder class, rather than big business and other elite investors.

<h1>Potential Goldsmith leak worries Labour, excites opposition</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

The are preparing for the worst as expectations of a new in the wake of the continue to rise. The possibility that 13 pages of legal advice by the will be made public has caused a stir as tensions in the race for the continue to build.

<h2>Controversy</h2>
The memo, allegedly prepared for the by Lord Goldsmith on the 7th of March 2003 and containing reservations about the legality of entering into war without a second , is considered by opposition leaders and anti-war groups to lend proof to allegations that Mr Blair misled the cabinet, the department of defence and the British public before the 2003 invasion. The claimed that six different reservations were laid out by the attorney general in his legal advice. Controversy surrounds the memo due to the Government's repeated claims that Lord Goldsmith's opinion on the war's legality was unequivocal. Many believe that should it emerge that there were indeed doubts, the failure of the prime minister to inform the public of them constitutes a violation of trust - with claiming that the election must become a referendum on Iraq and the trustworthiness of Mr Blair. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The controversy hinges on whether the Government honestly reflected the opinion of the attorney general in its press releases before, during and since the war. It is asserted that Mr Blair has claimed the private memo was of the same opinion as the published answer of March 17 2003, implying that Goldsmith was unequivocal about the legality of the war throughout his deliberation. However, a spokesman for the attorney general has dismissed any claims that the March 17 answer was ever purported to be a summary of Lord Goldsmith's advice. This stance has been echoed by the head of the , Sir Andrew Turnbull, in his words to the public administration select committee.

<h2>Defence</h2>
Should the document emerge, it is likely that the government will maintain that the memo was never supposed to be construed as the attorney general's final opinion on the war's legality, and that his advice was subsequently modified after written assurances from the prime minister about Saddam Hussein's threat to the authority of the UN.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The Indiana Pacers defeated the Boston Celtics 82-79 in the second game of the first round of the NBA playoffs. The Celtics trailed for most of the game. They briefly led 42-40 for 17 seconds just before the end of the second half, but in the last minute of the half, Reggie Miller scored 4 and James Jones hit a three pointer that went through the net just after the halftime buzzer sounded to send the Pacers to the locker room with a 5 point lead.

The Celtics slowly worked their way ahead of the Pacers during the third quarter; at the end of the third, the Celtics lead by 5. In the fourth quarter, the Pacers outscored the Celtics 18 to 10 to win by 3. Paul Pierce fired a 3 point shot to tie the game with 2 seconds left, but it bounced off the rim and was rebounded by the Pacers.

Former Celtic player Larry Bird, now the president of basketball operations for the Indiana Pacers, attended the game. Sitting 4 or 5 rows behind the Pacers' bench, Mr. Bird was guarded by a Fleet Center security guard.

At one moment in the second half, Patriots' owner Robert Kraft was shown on the Jumbotron. The crowd of 18,000 applauded for Kraft, presumably because of the Patriots' recent Super Bowl victories.

An ongoing &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; military investigation into the death of the &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; intelligence agent &lt;a href="w%3ANicola%20Calipari"&gt;Nicola Calipari&lt;/a&gt; cleared the US soldiers charged. A US official speaking anonymously stated, "The soldiers were all complying with the standard operating procedures for those checkpoints and therefore were not culpable of dereliction of duty in following their procedures," according to the Australian Special Broadcasting Service.

The Italian government has rejected the investigation's findings. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; later apologised for "an unfortunate leak" that suggested the investigation was completed, and assured paliament that the investigation was not yet over.

&lt;a href="w%3AGiuliana%20Sgrena"&gt;Giuliana Sgrena&lt;/a&gt;, the journalist of Italian newspaper &lt;a href="w%3Ail%20Manifesto"&gt;♡❤il Manifesto♡❤&lt;/a&gt; who was injured in the shooting, replied, "Unbelievable. They say soldiers followed only their rules of engagement. But if shooting on a machine that is moving, while USA were informed about it, is following rules of engagement, we must ask ourself what kind of rules they are." For Sgrena now "it's important that Italian Magistracy goes on. But all may suppose that its job will not be so easy".

The report was delayed so that disputes might be solved between the two governments. These disputes included disagreements on how fast the car was going as it approached the checkpoint and if US soldiers knew that the car and passengers would be passing through on that day. Italian officials who participated in the investigation are said to have disagreed with its findings.

US soldiers insisted that the car carrying Sgrena and Calipari to the &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; airport was traveling at a high speed and failed to heed warnings to stop. The Italian driver of the car denies he was speeding or that soldiers gave a warning. "It's enough to see the car," Sgrena wrote in ♡❤il Manifesto♡❤. "The front windshield is intact, while the side windows and the one behind are shattered."

Rescuers working with cranes and heavy equipment at the scene of 's worst rail accident in forty years pulled 3 survivors and more bodies out of the wreckage of a packed commuter train that derailed on Monday. The crash is now claiming 95 lives and over 400 injuries. Hopes are fading for more survivors in the rail car search where it is thought a dozen bodies may yet remain.

The train crashed into the side of a nine-story apartment building located nearby a bend where it jumped the track. Relatives of those lost are arriving in &lt;a href="w%3AAmagasaki"&gt;Amagasaki&lt;/a&gt; to identify loved ones in a gymnasium where a makeshift morgue is located.

Police searching for the cause of yesterday’s disaster investigated eight offices of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Japan%20Railway%20Company"&gt;West Japan Railway Co&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday for clues to the rail driver. Police conducting the probe said professional negligence may be involved. The train operator, who in the past received a warning for a similar incident, over-shot the stop at the previous station and had to back the train up nearly 40 &lt;a href="w%3AMetre"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt; (130 feet).

It is unclear whether the inexperienced driver of the train survived, 23-year-old Ryujiro Takami with 11 months on the job.

Running late and traveling at what survivors thought was excessive speed, it is believed the train lost control at a bend in the track where 71 km/h (44 mph) was the speed limit; however, any speeds under 134 km/h (83 mph) should not have caused derailment.

The train and aircraft disaster research committee, which reports to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, began to research the disaster. The committee members revealed unofficially the physical reasons of the disaster are quite complexe A member of the committee says the speed of train was monitored and at the fifth train it was recoreded that this car had run at 108 km/h speed in a certain moment after emergency brake had worked.

<h1>Thousands of Romanians rally for release of kidnapped journalists</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Thousands%20of%20Romanians%20rally%20for%20release%20of%20kidnapped%20journalists&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Thousands of &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;ns participated in rallies on Monday to campaign for the release of three Romanian journalists kidnapped last month in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Crowds swelled in size after a weekend of smaller rallies sponsored by Romanian media workers and the Arab community in Romania.

Rallies were held all over the country, with the largest in &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, capital of &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, and eight other cities. Rallying continues today with intensity in view of the deadline set by the journalists' captors demanding a Romanian pull out of its troops in Iraq. If the government does not pull out the troops, the captors threaten to kill the three &amp;mdash; Marie-Jeanne Ion (32), Sorin Dumitru Miscoci (30) and Ovidiu Ohanesian (37).

The mother of Marie-Jeanne Ion, Magdalena Ion, made a public speech where she expressed hope that her daughter, and her daughter's colleagues, will be saved. She said, "The authorities have tried to reassure us but we are very anxious because the deadline is so short. But I'm sure it will be all right in the end."

Romania's Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, said his government is making all efforts for the journalists' release, and they would not yield to terrorist demands, since this would enforce the fact that terrorism works.

Counter groups are calling for Romania to withdraw its troops. The right-wing &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Great%20Romania%20Party"&gt;Popular Great Romania Party&lt;/a&gt; (PPCD) and the social-liberal &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20Humanist%20Party"&gt;Romanian Humanist Party&lt;/a&gt; (PUR) have both pressured the government to withdraw.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Romania"&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (PSD), the largest party in opposition, said that troops should be withdrawn, but not under terrorist pressure. The PSD has mostly kept quiet during the kidnapping crisis because it was in power during 2000-2004 and was, therefore, the party who sent the troops to Iraq in the first place. However, party president &lt;a href="w%3AMircea%20Geoana"&gt;Mircea Geoană&lt;/a&gt;, told a news conference that, "We must find a correct balance to establish a calendar without giving the impression that we have yielded to political blackmail."

A pullout of Romania's troops is supported by over 70% of the population, according to a poll taken at the weekend. However, the governing Truth and Justice alliance is keen to let troops remain in Iraq for peacekeeping efforts, until the country's situation stabilises.

A withdrawal by Romania would deal a blow to the US-led &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20of%20the%20willing"&gt;Coalition of the Willing&lt;/a&gt;. Romania's is one of the largest contingents of any European country in Iraq due to the recent withdrawals or downscaling of &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUkrane"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. Romania has so far been one of the only &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; countries not announcing a withdrawal. President Traian Băsescu was planning in March to send more troops.

US &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George Bush&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Prince Abdullah&lt;/a&gt; at Bush's ranch in &lt;a href="w%3ACrawford%2C%20Texas"&gt;Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; Monday. He greeted the prince with a kiss on both cheeks. They previously met 3 years ago at the Crawford ranch where President Bush later said of the meeting, he developed a "strong personal bond" with the Saudi Crown Prince.

A barrel of oil cost $25 three years ago. Today it costs $54. The meeting was to discuss oil, the war on terror and efforts to extend democracy and peace in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;. "This is an important relationship," Bush said. "A high oil price will damage markets. And he knows that. I look forward to talking to him about that, as well, you now, we'll talk about his country's capacity. It's an important subject."

The Foreign Affairs adviser to the Crown Prince, &lt;a href="w%3AAdel%20al-Jubeir"&gt;Adel al-Jubeir&lt;/a&gt;, said that Saudi Arabia has the capacity to produce more oil. According to him: "We believe that the price of crude oil does not reflect the full dimensions of supply and demand. There is no shortage of crude oil in the world today. What we see is a shortage of refining capacity as well as shortages in infrastructures and so forth, that drive the price of product up."

The US president and Saudi prince talked about the &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli-Palestinian%20conflict%20timeline"&gt;Israeli-Palestinian crisis&lt;/a&gt;. "There is a shared vision," Bush said. "I made it clear to him that I expected Israel to withdraw, just like I've made it clear to &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. And we expect them to be finished." The US president said Israel must look for a non-violent solution in &lt;a href="w%3ARamallah"&gt;Ramallah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABethlehem"&gt;Bethlehem&lt;/a&gt;.

According to ♡❤Fox News♡❤, a senior administration official briefing reporters said the US president is concerned about the instigation of terror actions against Israel. Recently, the Saudi Arabia's ambassador to &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; published a poem saying &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; suicide bombers were &lt;a href="w%3Amartyrs"&gt;martyrs&lt;/a&gt;.

Factory workers at a ceramic factory in &lt;a href="w%3ANeuqu%C3%A9n"&gt;Neuquén&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; are preparing to defend their autonomous running of their workplace, as the courts start to look at appointing an owner. The workers have been running the factory themselves since the Argentinian government meltdown in 2001, and say they are more effective working independently.

There are now 410 workers at &lt;a href="w%3AFaSinPat"&gt;FaSinPat&lt;/a&gt; ('Fabrica sin Patrones' or 'Factory without Bosses'), having hired over 170 new workers in four years of autonomous control. The factory is widely known as Zanon, the name under the previous owner, Luis Zanon, who accumulated some US$170 million in debt, and shut down the factory, firing the workers.

Argentinian government and businesses were in chaos at the time, with the government dissolving repeatedly and defaulting on $88 billion of debt, inflation skyrocketing and people demanding money from banks who had closed their doors.

Like over 200 Argentinian workplaces facing similar conditions, the workers chose spontaneously to run the factory themselves, and continued maintenance and production, to keep trading on their own behalf.

Now thirty workers have travelled the 1,200 kilometers to Buenos Aires, presenting a petition containing thousands of signatures from all over the world at the central courthouse, and mobilising outside.

"With these actions we are marking a playing ground for the judge," said Raul Godoy, Zanon worker and General Secretary of the Ceramists' Union.

<h2>Reports of violence against a Zanon worker</h2>

As the government has continued its legal assault upon the Zanon factory, at least one factory employee has been reported to have suffered repeated threats and violence at the hand of unknown attackers.

Esteban Magnani, author of ♡❤El Cambio Silencioso♡❤ (♡❤The Silent Change♡❤), a book about worker cooperatives in Argentina told ♡❤UpsideDownWorld.org♡❤, "In Neuquen you have Jorge Sobisch, a right wing governor who wants to be the new [President] &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Menem"&gt;Carlos Menem&lt;/a&gt; ... wants to show how tough he is ... Zanon is very politicized and famous, which is bad for a governor who wants to be seen as a right wing savior. Sobisch feels the need to crack down now, because the longer he waits, the more powerful Zanon becomes." Some of the workers feel that Sobisch may be approving the attacks or may be culpable in failing to defend the workers.

Magnani indicates incumbent President &lt;a href="w%3AN%C3%A9stor%20Kirchner"&gt;Néstor Kirchner&lt;/a&gt;, described by Wikipedia as "a &lt;a href="w%3APeronism"&gt;Peronist&lt;/a&gt; with leftist leanings", might defend Zanon. "One of Kirchner’s flags is human rights. Now with this kidnapping and the continued threats, Kirchner shouldn’t have any excuse to not do something about this."

"Subway workers, train workers, airline workers, other recuperated businesses and many other sectors have made it clear that the employees at Zanon will not be alone." Says one Zanon worker, "We are willing to defend the factory with our lives."

It may not come to that. Governnor Sobisch has been attempting to evict the workers of Zanon in an ongoing, highly politicized legal battle for several years. Sobisch has been ordered by the Federal Supreme Court of Argentina to evict the workers as soon as possible. 

Other sources consulted about the past record of behavior by Sobisch do not reflect a record of overt violence against the workers. At least one source from October 2004 said that Sobish wants the workers to leave the Zanon factory and work instead in a government-sponsored micro-enterprise project for unemployed workers, constructing prefabricated houses.

Hospital officials reported Tuesday that two women were killed by a bomb blast at a market in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMandalay"&gt;Mandalay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the second largest city in &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;. The city is located about 430 miles north of the capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYangon"&gt;Yangon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Police officials confirmed a bomb explosion at the Zay Cho market, yet the military-government of Myanmar did not provide any details about the incident. A doctor said one of the women died at the market and the other died in the hospital.

16 other people were wounded and taken to the hospital. Reports indicate there was a single explosion at the ground of the busy market at 16:15 local time. In the past several small bomb explosions have been reported without any victims.

&lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; activists have scaled the house of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain's&lt;/a&gt; Deputy Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Prescott"&gt;John Prescott&lt;/a&gt;, and then mounted 60 square feet of solar panels on the roof.

The four men and four women were highlighting what they believe is Prescott's failure to make new houses, for which he has responsibility, more energy efficient.

After putting the &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20panel"&gt;solar panels&lt;/a&gt; up, they unfurled a large banner which read ♡❤Oi 2 Jags! Hit targets, not voters♡❤.

John Prescott's wife was alone in the house when the protesters climbed the building. She was reportedly awoken by their noise.

One protester, Laura Yates, 27, said, "The Deputy PM's got a reputation for straight-talking," she said from the roof, "but since the election kicked off we've heard barely a squeak about climate change from big hitters like him. As long as the average existing British house is responsible for six tonnes of &lt;a href="w%3ACO2"&gt;CO2&lt;/a&gt; every year he's not dealing with the climate crisis. He's in danger of hitting more voters than climate targets. Whoever wins on May 5th needs to get serious about energy efficiency."

Speaking from the roof by mobile phone, she told Reuters, "It's a major contributor to the climate change problem and Prescott could do something about this, particularly with the millions of new homes that are going to be built in Britain over the next years," she said.

"He's overseeing this house building programme and he should be ensuring that every one of these new homes is built to zero emissions standards," she added.

The protesters climbed down at 2.50pm and were promptly arrested by local police for "harassment of a person in a dwelling". The police then handcuffed them before taking them away in a van. The protesters left the solar panels by the door of the house, offering to come back and install the panels at a later date.

A police officer emphasised to BBC News that the distress of the event had been immense for Mrs Prescott: "It's not pleasant to be invaded in the privacy of your own home and it is being treated seriously. She's very distressed but she's pleased with the happy outcome."

John Prescott is currently touring the country as part of &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party"&gt;Labour's&lt;/a&gt; General Election 2005 campaign. Speaking from &lt;a href="w%3AGloucester"&gt;Gloucester&lt;/a&gt;, he told BBC News 24, "It's now clearly a publicity stunt and it terrorised my wife in the early hours in the morning to see all those men scrambling over the building. [Mrs Prescott] did not know who they were. It's deplorable and unacceptable even for a publicity stunt."

The protesters were challenged by the armed police officers who guard Mr Prescott's home, but reportedly the officers withdrew when they realised it was a peaceful protest.

<h1>British mother paralyzed in stabbing communicates with police</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20mother%20paralyzed%20in%20stabbing%20communicates%20with%20police&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Abigail Witchalls, the 26-year-old mother of one who was stabbed on April 20, has begun communicating what happened to the police.

Abigail was walking with her 21-month-old son at 4pm in a quiet country lane near London when she was attacked and stabbed once in the back of the neck, leaving her paralyzed from the neck down. She can only communicate via blinking and facial expressions.

Surrey, the county in which the attack occurred, is statistically the safest in England and Wales, with the lowest incident rate of serious violent crime.

Surrey Assistant Chief Constable Mark Rowley said in a press conference this morning that Abigail's condition is continuing to improve as she is treated in the hospital.

"I would like to start this morning with the good news that Abigail’s condition does appear to be continuing to improve. She has sustained an horrific injury, but her condition is no longer critical and she has been well enough to meet with two of our experienced detectives and communicate with them. They have been able to take a statement from her using questions that she can respond to in a positive or negative way by mouthing words or blinking.

"Abigail has made it clear that she wants to help the police inquiry in whatever way she can and it is her courage and determination that has allowed us to communicate with her at such an early stage after so horrific an attack. She is an incredibly brave and determined young woman.

"Abigail has managed to communicate a message to us that she wishes to give to you and I will start by reading this out. She says: “I am improving and everybody’s prayers are helping enormously. Thank you for all the flowers which are beautiful. If you still want to give flowers please donate instead
to the World Poverty Day through the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development or any other way. Thank you."

Detective Superintendent Adrian Harper then talked about the details of the attack they had learned from Abigail.

"My officers spent several hours with Abigail yesterday taking the statement, together with members of her family. The amount of information that Abigail has managed to give us is extraordinary given her current condition. As I will shortly explain, she has been through an even more harrowing experience than we imagined and the strain of going through it with her at her hospital bed was a very emotional experience for both her family members and both of my detectives.

"The bravery and strength of Abigail is extraordinary - she is determined to help catch this man as soon as possible and insisted on being interviewed for around six hours yesterday and wants to continue again today. This is a most unusual interview process - with a very intelligent and strong young woman - communicating through blinking, mouthing and facial expressions

"What Abigail has told us is very significant to this inquiry. We are now able to work on confirmed information directly from her rather than having to rely on what she said to other witnesses and the evidence of local residents. What she has said has changed the focus of the inquiry and enabled us to rule out the man with the blue Peugeot that we had previously arrested and bailed. We now believe that he was probably in the area at the time but that he was not involved in the assault on Abigail.

"Abigail has now been able to tell us that she first saw the man who attacked her at about 3.45pm on the afternoon of Wednesday 20 April, on the public footpath along Water Lane in Little Bookham. The man was in a blue estate car, four-door plus the rear hatch, right hand drive, older style, plain, all one colour.

"The man was in the blue vehicle ahead of Abigail. The vehicle drove towards and past her and they looked at each other. At that point Abigail started to feel very uneasy and put Joseph into the buggy and started to walk home along the track. When she was about three quarters of the way along the track she turned and saw that the car had pulled up some way behind at that the male was out of the car and coming towards her. She started to panic and immediately began running along the footpath with Joseph still in his buggy.

"Abigail reached the gate that leads onto the lane off Burnhams Road but could not open it. She the heard the man say, you have dropped your purse. She turned around and saw that the man had grabbed hold of Joseph and was holding a knife to his throat.

"The man indicated to Abigail to come towards him, which she did. He then grabbed her hair, pulled her down towards the ground and as he did so stabbed her once in the back of the neck with the knife. He then [pushed] the buggy, with Joseph still in it, on top of her and ran off.

"Abigail has said that the offender was alone and was someone she does not know. She describes him as being aged between 20 and 35 years-old, with short dark wavy or scruffy hair, between 5ft 10in, her height, and 6ft 4in tall, her husband’s height, with a long thin face and prominent cheekbones. He was wearing looped silver earrings, roughly three-quarters of an inch in diameter in both ears. She also describes quite a deep voice, a pale face and black bags under his eyes. She has also said that she believes that he was under the influence of drink or drugs. She does not know why he attacked her and he does not appear to have attempted to rob her. Her purse and mobile phone were not taken.

"This man is clearly an extremely dangerous offender. Anyone who is prepared to threaten a young child and try to kill his mother in front of him is clearly capable of anything. It is our duty to inform the public about the danger that this man poses and appeal to everyone for information that can help us to catch him as soon as possible.

"The appeal I want to make is quite precise. We could easily be overwhelmed by information that would hamper the inquiry rather than help it. What we need is very specific. Do you know a man who fits this description, who has access to a blue estate car and who could have been in the Bookham area on the afternoon of Wednesday 20 April. If you know anyone who fits this profile, if you live with him or he is your child you must come forward to us. I repeat, anyone who is prepared to act in the way that this offender has done is clearly capable of anything and is a danger to anyone who comes into contact with him, no matter who they are.

"Please do not approach him but contact Surrey Police on 0845 125 2222 with information or call 999 immediately if you know where he is."

Assistant Chief Constable Mark Rowley ended the press conference by saying "It is hard to imagine a more compelling picture of vulnerability and innocence than a mother and toddler chased attacked and left for dead so brutally.

"There is no clear motive to this attack such as robbery or sexual assault, although the offender may well have been under the influence of drink or drugs. He is clearly a very dangerous man who must be caught as soon as possible. We are conducting an enormous operation, already committing over 150 officers and have gathered a wealth of material for forensic examination but need the public's help to identify the offender as soon as possible.

"I would reiterate the appeal that Detective Superintendent Adrian Harper has just made, to appeal to the conscience of every citizen to help us catch this brutal and dangerous man. This is a crime so horrific that I would hope that, for anyone watching this appeal, helping us identify the offender would come before any loyalty to family, friends or even criminal associates - this man must be caught."

Ezer Weizman, former &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Israel"&gt;President of the State of Israel&lt;/a&gt; died at the age of 81 on April 24, 2005.

A World War II fighter pilot, Ezer Weizman led the formation of the Israeli Air Force which played a decisive role in Israel's wars with Arab nations. He left the military and began his political career in 1969, going on to help found the Likud Party, serving as Defence Minister, was closely involved in the Camp David accords and the treaty with Egypt, and advocated negotiations with the Palestinians.

Initially a hawk, Israel-born Weizman made a very public transition to the dove political views, saying Jews had to "share this part of the world" with Arabs. It was his belief that peace, and a strong military, were Israel's strongest defences.

Weizman was a nephew of Israel's first President, Chaim Weizmann, and was himself elected in 1993 on the dovish Labour ticket. His seven years in office led critics to describe him as the most political President of Israel, a largely ceremonial position.

His funeral was held on April 26, 2005.

<h1>New Government introduced to the Italian Parliament</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

Today around 6pm the new Italian Government was introduced to the House of Parliament.

This government turns out to have a larger number of ministers, vice-ministers and undersecretaries than the previous. There are 9 viceministers and 62 undersecretaries (to which Undersecretary of the Council Gianni Letta should be added.)

The new government also turns out to have the greatest number of ministers, vice-ministers and undersecretaries of all the governments of the Italian Republic. The number of vice-ministers has reached 9, the number of undersecretaries is 62 (plus Letta). This has caused the unusual sight of the benches of the Government being overcrowded (there are only 25 benches). The crowding is expected to increase, because in the emiciclo (the party of the Parliamentarians) there were few Parliamentarians today, since the House vote of confidence in the new government will be carried out only tomorrow.

Prime Minister Berlusconi has said that the next elections will take place in May of 2006 and this government will continue to serve until then.

As the last forces in the final &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n pullout from &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; left, &lt;a href="w%3ABekaa%20Valley"&gt;Bekaa Valley&lt;/a&gt; residents danced, waved flags, raised banners and cried tears of brotherhood in celebration. Tuesday afternoon’s Masnaa border crossing marked the exit from Lebanon of the last Syrian Army remnants, leaving 29 years of occupation behind.

A morning military gathering at Bekaa’s air base in Riyaq bid farewell to remaining troops and intelligence officers. Attended by military attachés and dignitaries from several countries, including the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, medals were exchanged and both Lebanonese and Syrian military bands played anthems.
In the largely symbolic ceremony, commander of the Lebanese Army Gen. Michel Suleiman said, "Brothers in arms, thank you for your sacrifices. Together we shall always remain brothers in arms in the face of the Israeli enemy."

The Lebanese government led by &lt;a href="w%3A%20Bashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt; needs to make quick political reforms to ensure the survival of his regime. The once-dominant pro-Syrian intelligence and security services are disappearing as the new government holds them accountable for past actions. The leadership vacuum must be filled.

Yesterday, the powerful head of the General Security service Jamil Sayyed, announced his resignation due to "changing political developments". Raymond Azar, the chief of Lebanese military intelligence, reportedly fled with his family to France.

A former &lt;a href="w%3Acia"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; operative in Lebanon and the Middle East, Bob Baer said, “They [the Syrians] are going to lose day-to-day control over Lebanon, once they don't have the T-72 tanks and the military there to back up the intelligence units." according to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Press%20International"&gt;UPI&lt;/a&gt;.

When the envelope was opened at the ♡❤Midland Daily News♡❤ offices around 17:00 GMT Tuesday, the presence of powder aroused alarm the envelope might contain the deadly disease &lt;a href="w%3AAnthrax"&gt;anthrax&lt;/a&gt;.

The news office, along with restaurants and businesses near the downtown newspaper were quarantined as a safety precaution shortly after authorities were alerted. On-site tests found no evidence of anthrax, and the letter has been sent to &lt;a href="w%3ALansing%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Lansing&lt;/a&gt; for additional tests. 

Around 20:30 GMT, the office was reopened and all quarantines were lifted. A mail-sorting machine is being tested, and has been removed from the local post office for further tests.

The envelope did contain a return address, according to local news station ♡❤WNEM-TV 5♡❤. The editor's office was closed Tuesday night, and sealed off as a crime scene.

66 passengers and the crew of a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; UAL flight got an unwanted stop in the "Windy City," &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, on Tuesday, following a bomb scare.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20Air%20Lines"&gt;United Air Lines&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Jeff Green said a flight attendant was alerted by a passenger to another passenger's suspicious materials and wires. The crew decided to divert the flight to O’Hare, empty the plane, and allow the bomb squad to inspect for safety.

They discovered vials of herbal liquids, some wires, and an &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMP3%20player"&gt;MP3 player&lt;/a&gt;. “Nothing detrimental,” according to Chicago police.

The passenger and music player were reunited, everybody re-boarded the aircraft, and with three hours lost, the flight took off for San Francisco.

Retreating soldiers, flashing victory signs, completed a withdrawal spurred by intense international pressure and massive &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; street protests against a &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; occupation force that at one time reached 40,000. Masnaa residents of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Bekaa%20Valley"&gt;Bekaa Valley&lt;/a&gt; region danced, waved flags, raised banners and cried tears of brotherhood in celebration as they witnessed the last troop convoys passing. The Tuesday afternoon border crossing marked the official exit from Lebanon of the last army remnants, leaving 29 years of occupation behind.

Syria's Ambassador to the U.N., Fayssal Mekhdad, spoke to the press claiming that the pullout was "full and complete." 

"I have just submitted a letter to both the secretary-general and the president of the Security Council from his excellency Mr. Farouq al-Sharaa on behalf of the Syrian government confirming the Syrian full withdrawal from Lebanon in terms of withdrawing the troops, the security apparatus and the [intelligence] assets," Mekdad said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt;, acting with uncertainty that withdrawal claims are true, will work to check them. A U.N. team sent for this purpose has already begun work in &lt;a href="w%3ADamascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesman said the group would first gather material in the Syrian capital, then later leave for the Lebanese capital in &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;.

U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, addressing the Security Countil in New York, expressed some doubts about the completeness of Syria's implementation of the council's decisions. "As of April 26, 2005, the requirements of Resolution 1559 have not yet been met," Annan said. "There has been no progress in the implementation of other provisions of the resolution," he added, stating that some member states had informed him that Syrian intelligence troops might be taking up new positions south of Beirut. 
Verifying the troop withdrawal will be fairly simple. The more difficult task will be identifying whether all intelligence assets are gone. These are not the uniformed groups, but members of the security services found at all levels of Lebanese society; in social, political and military echelons.

The Lebanese government, led by &lt;a href="w%3A%20Bashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;, will need to make quick political reforms if his regime is to survive. The once-dominant pro-Syrian intelligence and security services are disappearing as the new governing forces have demonstrated they hold them accountable for past actions. The leadership vacuum must be filled.

Yesterday, the powerful head of the General Security service Jamil Sayyed, announced his resignation due to "changing political developments". Raymond Azar, the chief of Lebanese military intelligence, reportedly fled with his family to France.

A former &lt;a href="w%3Acia"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; operative in Lebanon and the Middle East, Bob Baer said, "[The Syrians] are going to lose day-to-day control over Lebanon, once they don't have the T-72 tanks and the military there to back up the intelligence units," according to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Press%20International"&gt;UPI&lt;/a&gt;.

But the close relationship that comes with their national proximity to each other and their intertwined destinies is evident from their parting formalities and festivities.

A Tuesday morning joint Lebanese-Syrian military gathering at Bekaa's air base in Riyaq bid farewell to the nearly 500 remaining troops and intelligence officers. Attended by military attachés and dignitaries from several countries, including the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;. Medals were exchanged and both Lebanese and Syrian military bands played anthems.

In the largely symbolic ceremony, commander of the Lebanese Army Gen. Michel Suleiman said, "Brothers in arms, thank you for your sacrifices. Together we shall always remain brothers in arms in the face of the Israeli enemy."

Iraqi terrorists extended the ultimatum by calling Romanian ♡❤Prima TV♡❤, the station where two of the kidnapped journalists worked. The news director of ♡❤Prima TV♡❤ Dan Dumitru, said he received a call from Iraq on late Tuesday, in which he spoke both to the kidnappers and the journalists. The kidnappers gave the government a further 24 hours to withdraw their troops, while the kidnapped journalists told Dumitru to put pressure on the Romanian government for the withdrawal of the troops. The three made a "final appeal" to the Romanian president, &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;, to withdraw the troops, saying that the time of their killing was set on Wednesday, at 14:00 UTC.

The Islamic terrorists which kidnapped three &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n journalists last month extended the deadline for their execution from Tuesday to today. In a tape aired on &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Jazeera"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; last Friday, the terrorists, who call themselves the Muadh ibn Jabal Brigades, gave the Romanian government until Tuesday, at 14:00 UTC, to withdraw their 860 troops from &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, or otherwise the journalists would be killed. On Monday, the Romanian Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, said that his country would not yield to terrorist demands, and it appears that this has caused the extension of the ultimatum by a day.

Yesterday, &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; and other Romanian cities were filled by ralliers asking for the release of the troops, holding up banners saying "Freedom" in English, Romanian and Arabic. Also, the mother of Sorin Miscoci, one of the hostages said, "This is the hardest day, we are thinking that their hours are numbered. We trust the authorities until the end." Vasile Ion, the father of Marie-Jeanne Ion, another hostage, said, "We call for the urgent withdrawal of the Romanian contingent from Iraq, before it is too late for our children. The kidnappers have made a political threat and they are waiting for a political response."

Commentators from Prima TV observed that, on the tape shown by the terrorists, one of the journalists, Sorin Miscoci, was wearing orange overalls. The commentators described this as ♡❤culoarea morţii♡❤ ("the colour of death"), since Iraqi terrorists had previously dressed hostages in orange, as an attempt to show that their threats were serious.

The Romanian government has not made any official comment after the extension of the deadline. In its last official statement, it said that it would not withdraw the troops. A Romanian pullout would be seen as a significant blow to the US-led &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20of%20the%20willing"&gt;Coalition of the Willing&lt;/a&gt;, since Romania currently has one of the largest contingents in Iraq.

<h1>World's largest passenger airliner makes first flight</h1>
♡❤♡April 27, 2005♡❤♡ 
The world's largest passenger aircraft, the &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;Airbus A380&lt;/a&gt;, has made its maiden flight after lifting off from &lt;a href="w%3AToulouse"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

The take-off, at 08:30 UTC, was apparently normal and took place exactly on time. The aircraft flew into clear blue skies with a flight crew of six (all wearing parachutes as a safety precaution) and twenty tonnes of test equipment on board.

Around 50,000 people watched the maiden flight, many sitting on grass banks lining the runway. More people watched the flight on a giant screen erected in the centre of Toulouse.

The test flight lasted four hours, with the aircraft flying no higher than 10,000 nor further than 100 miles from Toulouse as it circled the Bay of Biscay.

The A380, known for many years during its development phase as the Airbus A3XX, will be the largest airliner in the world by a substantial margin when it enters service.

The first A380 prototype was unveiled during a lavish ceremony in Toulouse, France, on January 18, 2005. Its manufacturer's serial number is 001, and it is registered F-WWOW.

The new Airbus will initially be sold in two versions: the A380-800, a full double-decker configuration, able to carry 555 passengers in a three-class configuration or up to 800 passengers in a single-class economy configuration. Range for the A380-800 model is expected to be 8,000 nautical miles (14,800 km). The second model, the A380-800F dedicated freighter, will carry 150 tons of cargo 5,600 miles (10,400 km).

The cost of the project so far is £8.4bn, £1bn over budget. 144 planes have already been ordered. Singapore Airlines, which will be the first company to operate the new air giant, in July 2006, have opened a reservation site for this first regular flight.

Teachers at the elementary school of &lt;a href="w%3AReduzum"&gt;Reduzum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFriesland"&gt;Friesland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; were surprised at what their pupils turned up with yesterday. The children had found some human bones in a large pile of landfill, originating from the &lt;a href="w%3AOudehove"&gt;Oudehove&lt;/a&gt; cemetery in the Frisian capital city of &lt;a href="w%3ALeeuwarden"&gt;Leeuwarden&lt;/a&gt;, which is being turned into an underground parking garage.

Officials have spoken with the contractor, Strukton, which was responsible for moving the soil to a site near the bridge across the &lt;a href="w%3ASwin"&gt;Swin&lt;/a&gt;, near Reduzum. The bones will be moved with the rest of the cemetery to a new site north of Leeuwarden.

The school principal reported that the children were hardly shocked when they found what they had discovered, and that they were more interested to learn about human anatomy. A biology lesson ensued.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CIA) says it finished interrogating the nearly 105 &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; scientists it held in its search for &lt;a href="w%3Awmd"&gt;weapons of mass destruction&lt;/a&gt; (WMD). In many cases their information was helpful, but in other cases the wrong people were detained, and were subjected to questioning by "inexperienced and uninformed" interrogators.

From an update to the ♡❤Comprehensive Report of the Special Adviser to the DCI on Iraq's WMD♡❤, "As matters now stand, the WMD investigation has gone as far as feasible. After more than 18 months, the WMD investigation and debriefing of the WMD-related detainees has been exhausted.

"As far as the WMD investigation is concerned, there is no further purpose in holding many of these detainees. These individuals have shown no reluctance to engage in further discussions should the need for questioning arise about past WMD programs."

Elsewhere, "Some may have other issues to account for, including Regime finance questions, but certainly some have been quite helpful toward the compilation of an accurate picture of the Regime's WMD efforts and intentions over the last three decades."

The comments were addenda and an accompanying note, supplemental to the original report, which was issued last autumn, and seen as the final report of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Survey%20Group"&gt;Iraq Survey Group (ISG)&lt;/a&gt;. They were added by Charles Duelfer, head of the ISG, and Special Adviser to the Director of Central Intelligence in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;.

Deulfer emphasised that more information is likely to emerge naturally, over time, from people with differing viewpoints and interests. And a backlog of documents recovered from the former regime remain to be examined.

He described the ISG investigation as hampered by: 
<ul>
BULLET::::- The security situation
BULLET::::- The quality of identification, detention, and interview of those involved in the Iraqi WMD effort
BULLET::::- Other internal procedural weaknesses
BULLET::::- Constant personnel rotations.

</ul>
A preference for reinforcement of short-term security on the part of the coalition forces over anti-proliferation efforts, fear of arrest and detention on the part of the Iraqi personnel, and other factors in the continuing conflict of the post-war environment, all impacted on the effort by the ISG.

The report confirms the expressed opinion of former UN weapons inspector, Scott Ritter, that Iraq had no significant WMDs. "[T]here was not a single intelligence service in the world that said Iraq maintained massive stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction," Ritter said at the time.

Duelfer summary of the intelligence obtained, as understood by the ISG, includes, "[T]he risk of Iraqi WMD expertise of material advancing the WMD potential in other countries is attenuated by many factors and is presently small ..."

And, "So far, insurgent efforts to attain unconventional weapons have been limited and contained by coalition actions."

Also, "There continue to be reports of WMD in Iraq. ISG has found that such reports are usually scams or in misidentification of materials or activities. In a very limited number of cases they have related to old chemical munitions produced before 1990."

The new addenda included information on the Iraqi Military Industrial Commission, the "state-run military-industrial complex" which played a "central role in the evolution of all the Regime's weapons programs".

The possession, consumption, and selling of cannabis, claimed by some to be less harmful and less addictive than &lt;a href="w%3Atobacco"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt;, though not strictly legal, has been tolerated in the Netherlands for a number of years. The cultivation of cannabis, however, still poses a problem to most cities. Utrecht Mayor Annie Brouwer noted fire risks, tensions with residential areas and the illegal tapping of electricity as reasons to get cannabis cultivation to the surface, so that it can be regulated. The mayors also argued that a successful test could show Europe the benefits of legalising cannabis.

A discussion on Dutch soft drug policy is to be held later today.

Actress &lt;a href="w%3AHunter%20Tylo"&gt;Hunter Tylo&lt;/a&gt; is reported to have rejoined the cast of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bold%20and%20the%20Beautiful"&gt;The Bold and the Beautiful&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, in the latest chapter of a rocky relationship between Tylo and the casting office. The news was first broken by entertainment magazine &lt;a href="w%3ASoap%20Opera%20Weekly"&gt;Soap Opera Weekly&lt;/a&gt;. 

Tylo played the role of Dr. Taylor Hamilton Forrester from 1990 until 2002, when she was killed off by villainess Sheila Carter, played by &lt;a href="w%3AKimberlin%20Brown"&gt;Kimberlin Brown&lt;/a&gt;. Taylor's love affair with Ridge Forrester (played by Ronn Moss), and the ensuing triangle with Brooke Logan (played by &lt;a href="w%3AKatherine%20Kelly%20Lang"&gt;Katherine Kelly Lang&lt;/a&gt;), helped the then-fledgling soap move higher in the ratings in the early to mid-1990s. According to Soap Opera Weekly, history has been rewritten so that Taylor, in reality, did not die from her gunshot wounds back in October 2002. Her return is tied in with a 1994 storyline in which Taylor was held captive by Moroccan prince Omar (played by Indian actor &lt;a href="w%3AKabir%20Bedi"&gt;Kabir Bedi&lt;/a&gt;). Both Tylo and Bedi are first seen on Monday, May 2.

The magazine states that she has been on the set of the soap opera at &lt;a href="w%3ACBS%20Television%20City"&gt;CBS Television City&lt;/a&gt; since March 11. For a while, she didn't even tell her husband, former ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGuiding%20Light"&gt;Guiding Light&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ actor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Tylo"&gt;Michael Tylo&lt;/a&gt;, where she was really going. She told him that she was just going on "a lot of auditions," and that if she told sooner than she did, the news might slip out accidentally. Her husband currently teaches a class at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Nevada%2C%20Las%20Vegas"&gt;University of Nevada, Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; and she couldn't afford any accidental hints that his students could have picked up on.

This is not the first time Tylo has rejoined the series. She left in highly publicized disputes most recently in 2000 and 2001, due to a lack of story for her character. Her most publicized departure, however, was in 1996; Tylo was scheduled to join the cast of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMelrose%20Place"&gt;Melrose Place&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and was fired when ♡❤&lt;nowiki&gt;Melrose&lt;/nowiki&gt;♡❤♡s producer &lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20Spelling"&gt;Aaron Spelling&lt;/a&gt; found out she was pregnant. She took him to court and won after nearly a year of messy legal battles. All three times she was allowed to return to the show more or less without comment.

With more than 300 million viewers in nearly 100 countries, ♡❤The Bold and the Beautiful♡❤ is claimed to be the most-watched television series in the world.

The auction hammer came down Wednesday, in London, on &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJudy%20Garland"&gt;Judy Garland&lt;/a&gt;’s blue gingham dress, worn in the 1939 movie “&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AThe%20Wizard%20of%20Oz"&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/a&gt;.” It sold for £140,000 (about US$262,157.40).

The identity of the buyer, who sealed the deal on the telephone, was not immediately revealed. Bonham auctioneers told reporters there was a pre-sale estimate of £35,000 (about US$65,529.47).

The dress, one of the most recognizable in the movie world, was made for the 17-year-old Garland who had a 27-inch (68-centimetre) waist. Her name is still on a tag on an inside hem. It was auctioned as part of a sale of rock and film memorabilia and was described as a “cherished memory for millions of fans worldwide.”

The story of the “Wizard of Oz,” which sealed Garland’s legend as a worldwide star, tells the story of a young Kansan, Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog Toto. They are whisked away from their rural &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; home by a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Atornado"&gt;tornado&lt;/a&gt; to a magical realm called OZ.

In their travels, they meet other now-famous characters, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion.

Although the film started with only modest success, it has since become a screen classic.

By an overwhelming 109-1 margin, the &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; government won a vote of confidence in parliament Wednesday, coming just a day after what was touted as the “full and final” &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; occupation withdrawal.
The confidence vote, ushered in by the new Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3A%20Najib%20Mikati"&gt;Najib Mikati&lt;/a&gt;, is a step which allows for May elections called for by constitutional law and demanded by anti-Syrian opposition groups.

Speaking to parliament, Mikati said, "We will not hesitate to carry out this constitutional requirement on time," according to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;♡❤AP♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

The next step for Mikati and government leaders is to draft new election laws. &lt;a href="w%3AEmile%20Lahoud"&gt;Lebanese President Lahoud&lt;/a&gt; said he was discussing among their leadership the possibility of asking for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; technical assistance in drafting the laws. A completed draft would be presented to parliament for passage in an approval process.

Under domestic and foreign pressures, Mr. Mikati has so far shown he is capable of helping move the Lebanese political process forward.

Police officials confirmed a bomb explosion at a market in Mandalay, the second largest city in Myanmar, but did not provide any details about the incident. A doctor said one of the women died at the market and the other in hospital.

16 other people were wounded and taken to hospital. Reports indicate there was a single exlosion at the ground of the busy market at 4:15 p.m. In the past there were reported several small bomb explosions without any victims.

<h2>&lt;a href="Kidnapped%20journalists%27%20execution%20deadline%20expires"&gt;Kidnapped journalists' execution deadline expires&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

Islamic terrorists who kidnapped three Romanian journalists last month extended the deadline for their execution from Tuesday to today. In a tape aired on Al-Jazeera last Friday, the terrorists, who call themselves the Muadh ibn Jabal Brigades, gave the Romanian government until Tuesday, at 14:00 UTC, to withdraw their 860 troops from Iraq, or otherwise the journalists would be killed. On Monday, the Romanian Prime Minister said that his country would not yield to terrorist demands, and it appears that this has caused the extension of the ultimatum by a day.

A Midland, Michigan, USA newspaper office was shut down briefly due a suspicious letter with white powder. The news office, along with restaurants and businesses near the downtown newspaper were quarantined as a safety precaution shortly after authorities were alerted. On-site tests found no evidence of anthrax, and the letter and mail handling machine are undergoing additional tests.

President Bush was whisked to the President's Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) for safety during a false alarm this morning. The alarm indicated an airspace intrusion, which was quickly checked and found to be a technical error. White House press secretary Scott McClellan made clear that the President reached the shelter quickly, to demonstrate that the President is constantly in a safe environment.

After 29 years of occupation, Syrian troops have pulled out of Lebanon. Fayssal Mekhdad, Syria's Ambassador to the U.N., ensured the press the pullout was "full and complete." The U.N. plans to check the withdrawal claims. A U.N. team sent for this purpose has already begun work in Damascus. A spokesman said the group would first gather material in the Syrian capital, then later leave for the Lebanese capital in Beirut.

The Airbus A380, the largest passenger aircraft, made its maiden flight from Toulouse in France. Around 50,000 people watched the maiden flight, many sitting on grass banks lining the runway. More people watched the flight on a giant screen erected in the centre of Toulouse.

The A380, known for many years during its development phase as the Airbus A3XX, will be the largest airliner in the world by a substantial margin when it enters service.

The first A380 prototype was unveiled during a lavish ceremony in Toulouse, France, on January 18, 2005. Its manufacturer's serial number is 001, and it is registered F-WWOW.

The vote allows Berlusconi up to another year in office, during which time he will have to gain support from skeptical voters if he is to win a second term.

<h1>Boeing secures $11bn of aircraft deals</h1>
♡❤♡April 27, 2005♡❤♡
Boeing has secured two large orders for new aircraft.

&lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Canada"&gt;Air Canada&lt;/a&gt; has ordered US$6 billion in new airliners, while Air India has signed a deal for a further US$7 billion.

The Air Canada deal includes firm orders for 18 &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20777"&gt;777&lt;/a&gt;s and 14 of the new mid-size, long-range &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20787"&gt;787&lt;/a&gt; Dreamliner. Options are included for 18 more 777s and 46 more 787s.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20India"&gt;Air India&lt;/a&gt; order is worth US$6.8 billion for 50 787s.

Air India says the new fuel-efficient airliner will save US$300 million in fuel a year, while Air Canada has estimated a 30% fuel saving over their existing &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20767"&gt;767&lt;/a&gt;s. Air India have also said that the 20 extra seats the 787 offers over a similarly-sized &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A330"&gt;Airbus A330&lt;/a&gt; was a decisive factor.

&lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20Air"&gt;Korean Air&lt;/a&gt; also bought 20 Dreamliners earlier this month.

Boeing now has a total of 237 orders and commitments for the 787.

The Boeing 777 is a family of long range widebody twin engine airliners built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It carries between 305 and 550 passengers and has a range from 5,600 to 8,870 nautical miles (10,400 to 16,400 km). The first flight of the 777 was in 1994.

The Boeing 787, or Dreamliner, is a mid-sized passenger airliner currently under development by Boeing Commercial Airplanes and scheduled to enter service in 2008. It will carry between 200 and 350 passengers depending on the seating configuration, and be more fuel-efficient than earlier airliners. In addition, it will be the first major airliner to use composite material in the majority of its construction.

An airspace intrusion alarm near the &lt;a href="United%20States%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; put the White House on alert Wednesday. The warning was later revealed as a false alarm due to a technical problem. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secret%20Service"&gt;Secret Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; agents rushed the President from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOval%20Office"&gt;Oval Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; into an underground shelter. The Vice President was taken to a secure zone. Some of the White House staff and visitors were also moved to safety.

In a short time it was shown to be a false alarm. Aircraft were called in to check and patrol the air space around the White House.

White House press secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced the President reached the shelter quickly, to demonstrate that the President is constantly in a safe environment.

In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrince%20George%20County"&gt;Prince George County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, two unusually low-flying jets, presumably fighters, were heard approaching from the south. They screamed northward in the direction of &lt;a href="Washington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; at approximately 12:00 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEDT"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (16:00 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). The over-flights were ungrouped; the second plane followed the first by about a minute.

<h2>&lt;a href="UK%20Attorney%20General%20raised%20legal%20doubts%20over%20Iraq%20invasion"&gt;UK Attorney General raised legal doubts over Iraq invasion&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

The Blair government in the United Kingdom concealed warnings it was given over the doubtful legality of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, in which it played a pivotal part.

The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's 13-page, 7th of March 2003 letter expressed serious misgivings, according to both Channel 4 and The Guardian, but further refinements brought his advice to a short 300 word 'summary' giving his go-ahead for an invasion on the 17th.

In the original letter he warned that if war went ahead without a United Nations Resolution it would probably be deemed illegal if hard evidence on Saddam's alleged non-compliance and non-cooperation with weapons inspection teams was not uncovered. 

A leaked summary of the original letter has led the Blair government to release the full 13 page document.

<h2>&lt;a href="New%20Italian%20government%20gets%20confidence%20from%20the%20House"&gt;New Italian government gets confidence from the House&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

The new Italian government, led by Silvio Berlusconi, received a vote of confidence from the Italian House of Deputies on Wednesday. The tally was 334 pros, 240 cons and 2 abstentions.

The vote gives Berlusconi another year in office to gain support from skeptical voters if he is to win a second term.

Europe's human rights body openly condemned the United States yesterday for using what it termed "torture" and asked European countries not to cooperate in interrogating Guantanamo detainees.

According to an AP report, the resolution adopted by the Council's Parliamentary Assembly said in part "the circumstances surrounding detentions by the USA at Guantanamo Bay show unlawfulness on grounds including the torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees."

A U.S. Pentagon spokesman said they were running "a safe, humane and professional detention operation at Guantanamo that is providing valuable information in the war on terror."

Edvard Munch's most famous painting, "The Scream," together with "The Madonna," might have been burned.

Both paintings were stolen in August 2004 from the Munch Museum. Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet reports that both "The Scream" and "The Madonna" might have been burned in order to destroy evidence.

According to Dagbladet three persons have been arrested, but the two persons who did the actual robbery are still at large.
<h2>&lt;a href="Lebanon%20government%20wins%20%E2%80%98vote%20of%20confidence%E2%80%99"&gt;Lebanon government wins ‘vote of confidence’&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

By an overwhelming 109-1 margin, the Lebanese government won a vote of confidence in parliament Wednesday, coming just a day after what was touted as the “full and final” Syrian occupation withdrawal.

The confidence vote, ushered in by the new Prime Minister Najib Mikati, is a step which allows for May elections called for by constitutional law and demanded by anti-Syrian opposition groups.

Speaking to parliament, Mikati said, "We will not hesitate to carry out this constitutional requirement on time."

The next step for Mikati and government leaders is to draft new election laws. Lebanese President Lahoud said he was discussing among their leadership the possibility of asking for U.N. technical assistance in drafting the laws. A completed draft would be presented to parliament for passage in an approval process.

<h2>&lt;a href="CIA%20gives%20up%20search%20and%20interrogation%20on%20Iraq%20WMDs"&gt;CIA gives up search and interrogation on Iraq WMDs&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

The United States Central Intelligence Agency says it has finished interrogating around 105 Iraqi scientists it has been holding over weapons of mass destruction. In many cases the wrong people were detained and subjected to questioning by "inexperienced and uninformed" interrogators.

"The WMD investigation has gone as far as [is] feasible. After more than 18 months, the WMD investigation and debriefing of the WMD-related detainees has been exhausted," Charles Duelfer, head of the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), wrote last month in an addendum to the group's final report, issued last autumn.

<h2>&lt;a href="Dutch%20mayors%20support%20legalisation%20of%20cannabis"&gt;Dutch mayors support legalisation of cannabis&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

Dutch Minister Alexander Pechtold's radical suggestion to legalise cannabis in the Netherlands has been supported by the mayors of 20 out of 30 of the largest Dutch cities according to an investigation by the Dutch newspaper Trouw. Pechtold promoted the legalisation of cannabis throughout Europe earlier this week. Pechtold's plans are opposed by Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner however, who is advocating a tougher policy against cannabis.

The possession, consumption, and selling of cannabis, though not strictly legal, has been tolerated in the Netherlands for a number of years. The cultivation of cannabis, however, still poses a problem to most cities. Utrecht Mayor Annie Brouwer noted fire risks, tensions with residential areas and the illegal tapping of electricity as reasons to get cannabis cultivation to the surface, so that it can be regulated. The mayors also argued that a successful test could show Europe the benefits of legalising cannabis.

The auction hammer came down Wednesday, in London, on Judy Garland’s blue gingham dress, worn in the 1939 movie “The Wizard of Oz.” It sold for £140,000.

The identity of the buyer, who sealed the deal on the telephone, was not immediately revealed. Bonham auctioneers told reporters there was a pre-sale estimate of £35,000.

The dress, one of the most recognizable in the movie world, was made for the 17 year old Garland who had a 27-inch (68-centimetre) waist. Her name is still on a tag on an inside hem. It was auctioned as part of a sale of rock and film memorabilia and was described as a “cherished memory for millions of fans worldwide.”

Actress Hunter Tylo is reported to have rejoined the cast of The Bold and the Beautiful, in the latest chapter of a rocky relationship between Tylo and the casting office. Tylo played the role of Dr Taylor Hamilton Forrester from 1990 until 2002, when she was killed off by the show's villainous Sheila Carter, played by Kimberlin Brown. According to Soap Opera Weekly, history has been rewritten so that Taylor, in reality, did not die from her gunshot wounds back in October 2002.

The Air Canada deal included 18 777s and 14 of the new fuel-efficient 787s, while the Air India deals was for 50 of the new design - solid sales indicating the acceptance of different airlines model focused on more flexible scheduling.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
&lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; planners met with the Agassiz Neighborhood Council to update the community about Harvard's construction and expansion plans in the neighborhood on April 26, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Harvard%20Crimson"&gt;the Harvard Crimson&lt;/a&gt; reported today. The two major topics discussed were the Northwest Science Building, which is currently under construction on Oxford Street, and the expansion of the &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20School"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Crimson, Harvard officials outnumbered the number of community members present at the meeting.

The plans for law school expansion are still unfinished, the Crimson reported. The director of community relations at Harvard, Thomas Lucey, said that Wyeth Hall may be demolished. According to the Law School website, Wyeth Hall is &lt;a href="http%3A//www.law.harvard.edu/students/housing/wyeth05.php"&gt;"the most popular dormitory at Harvard Law School"&lt;/a&gt;. It is adjacent to the &lt;a href="w%3ABerkman%20Center%20for%20Internet%20and%20Society"&gt;Berkman Center for Internet and Society&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Avenue"&gt;Massachusetts Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, just south of Three Aces pizzeria.

The Crimson also noted that Tom Murray, the project manager for the Northwest Science Building, was slated for completion by May of 2007, with landscaping completed the following spring.

A visit to the science building site by Wikinews reporter last week verified that the pouring of cement had begun. Four large cranes had been brought to the site; one of them was being used with a clamshell attachment twice the height of a grown man to dig a deep trench. The truck "wheel wash" station &lt;a href="http%3A//construction.fas.harvard.edu/projects/northwest/schedule/NWprelimsiteplan122104.pdf"&gt;marked on the site plan&lt;/a&gt; was operational, in the form of a man with a pressure washer, though in this reporter's brief observations, more windshields were washed than dirty tires.

Lawmakers from 46 European countries meeting in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrasbourg"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; asked the Bush administration on Tuesday “to cease torturing and mistreating detainees” at &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. Europe's 50+-year old human rights body, the &lt;a href="Council%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt;, openly condemned the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday for using what it termed "torture", and asked European countries not to cooperate in interrogating Guantanamo detainees.

A spokesman for the Pentagon responded that they run "a safe, humane and professional detention operation at Guantanamo."

"The circumstances surrounding detentions by the USA at Guantanamo Bay show unlawfulness on grounds including the torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees," said the resolution adopted by the Council's Parliamentary Assembly, reported in the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;♡❤Associated Press♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. The body, confusingly named but not related to the European Parliament, affirmed its support for the United States in the fight against terrorism, but said that the US government "betrayed its own highest principles in the zeal with which it has attempted to pursue the war on terror."

The US government has denied using torture at the base, but human rights council member Boris Oliynik said; "What we see in Guantanamo has nothing to do with justice, the conditions there are medieval."

<h4>International Committee of the Red Cross</h4>

The ICRC has been monitoring conditions for detainees at Guantanamo and over 2,000 other places worldwide since 2002. On November 30, 2004, the &lt;a href="International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross"&gt;International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; (ICRC) issued a press release stating that their policy is that they will neither confirm or deny a widely-repeated report by the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ last November 30 about their findings in Guantanamo.The Times report by Neil A. Lewis reads in part; "The International Committee of the Red Cross has charged in confidential reports to the United States government that the American military has intentionally used psychological and sometimes physical coercion 'tantamount to torture' on prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba."

The ICRC policy is to address questions of possible abuse to the relevant government authorities, in this case the Office of Detainee Affairs which was set up by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;US Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to the ICRC press release, their adherence to this policy made "it possible for the ICRC to have repeated and regular access to those held at Guantanamo Bay and to speak with them in private."

The ICRC continues to monitor detainees at Guantanamo and deliver messages from them to their families.

The United Kingdom's Blair government concealed doubts expressed by its Attorney General's department on whether the 2003 invasion of Iraq was legal. Now, in the run-up to a May 5 general election and with no evidence of a serious threat from pre-invasion Iraq having come to light, a furor has erupted over the issue.

High-ranking governmental legal advisor, Elizabeth Wilmshurst, protested in her resignation letter just prior to the invasion, about sudden, unexplained changes the Attorney General had made in the tone of his legal advice to the government. In the space of a few weeks, Lord Goldsmith dropped suggestions that the government may have been legally culpable if it invaded without receiving specific support in the form of a new UN Resolution.

When the ♡❤BBC News website♡❤ finally obtained Wilmshurt's resignation letter under Freedom of Information, her protest over the Attorney General's unexplained turnaround was obscured.

The missing paragraph was later obtained by ♡❤Channel 4 News♡❤:

♡❤"My views accord with the advice that has been given consistently in this office before and after the adoption of UN security council resolution 1441 and with what the attorney general gave us to understand was his view prior to his letter of 7 March. (The view expressed in that letter has of course changed again into what is now the official line.)"♡❤

Conservative party leader Michael Howard, wants to know what made Lord Goldsmith change his advice to the government. He told Channel Four, "The Prime Minister [Tony Blair] has said that the attorney general's advice given to the cabinet on the 17 of March was clear and the attorney general did not change that advice. Well, we now know the attorney general did change that advice and the question is what or who changed it."

Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, in a statement last month, read in both houses of parliament, defended initially censoring the letter on privacy grounds, and the later omission of the two revealing lines "because their content concerned the provision of legal advice in relation to the use of force against Iraq."

Although Ms Wilmshurst describes the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's 13-page, March 7 letter as being a change to his previously expressed view against a war without specific UN support, even this letter expressed serious misgivings, according to both Channel 4 and the ♡❤Guardian♡❤.

Further refinements brought his advice to a short 300 word 'summary' delivered to cabinet on March 17, giving a full go-ahead for invasion. The letter was not published, according to Philippe Sands in the ♡❤Guardian♡❤, a breach of ministerial protocol. Both letters have since been obtained by both the ♡❤Guardian♡❤ and Channel 4.

According to Mr Straw in Parliament last month, "The Attorney-General made clear in his [March 17 advice] his genuinely and independently-held view that military action in Iraq was lawful on the basis of Saddam's breach of the existing UN resolutions,".

But in the earlier and longer version, the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith had written, "I remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force."

In the absence of such a resolution, he added, if war was pursued, "we would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-cooperation."

When the later, short version was put before cabinet, no-one asked what this hard evidence might be, that supposedly showed Iraq was in breach of UN Resolutions 1441, 678 and 687, despite the possibility that without such evidence, the UK might be on shaky legal ground and accused of launching a war of aggression.

"So concerned was the government about the possibility of such a [legal] case that it took steps to put together a legal team to prepare for possible international litigation," he wrote, in a ♡❤Guardian♡❤ story in February, which examined the two letters of legal advice.

The final report by the post-invasion Iraq Survey Group &amp;mdash; "the best picture that could be drawn concerning the events, programs, policies, and underlying dynamics of the relationship of the former Regime to WMD over the last three decades", according to the team head, CIA Special Advisor Charles Duelfer &amp;mdash; concludes that Iraq was not capable of any WMD-related threat at the time of the invasion, and that the sanctions were still limiting the ability to develop any capability.

Iran was the country Saddam was most afraid of, Iraq had no written strategy for WMD development, and the closest thing to actual WMDs mentioned seems to be preliminary designs for missile delivery systems that could have exceeded the UN-specified range limit of 150km for Iraqi missiles under the sanction regime.

In an escalating controversy that has contributed to Italian Prime Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi's&lt;/a&gt; political problems and created a national uproar in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, Italian prosecutors began their own independent probe on Wednesday of the death of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANicola%20Calipari"&gt;Nicola Calipari&lt;/a&gt;. The premier has put his government's prestige on the line with assurances to the nation that full light would be shed on the shooting.

Calipari, one of the top intelligence agents in Italy, had negotiated a settlement with hostage takers in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; and was rescuing journalist &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGiuliana%20Sgrena"&gt;Giuliana Sgrena&lt;/a&gt; from them when American soldiers fired on the car they were in. Calipari became a national hero for Italians after he bravely threw his own body across hers as the firing continued, killing him and seriously injuring Sgrena with a few bullets in her back. She is still recovering.

Meanwhile, Americans released a document, now described as incomplete, which says the U.S. Army, in a joint inquiry with Italian officials, cleared its own soldiers of any responsibility in the tragic events of March 4.
<h3>Demands for troops to leave Iraq from former president</h3>
The Prime Minister has put his reputation on the line says &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrancesco%20Cossiga"&gt;Francesco Cossiga&lt;/a&gt;, an ex president of Italy. He was quoted by the Italian news agency ANSA, saying he thinks Berlusconi would have no choice but to withdraw Italy’s 3000 troops from Iraq if the U.S. soldiers are cleared without further investigation, called by the U.S. a “friendly fire” incident. Cossiga is demanding the U.S. release them to Italian officials for trial or make the commitment to put them before an American court martial.

Berlusconi said that Italy would "never endorse" a report on the shooting by US soldiers of an Italian intelligence agent if it was unconvincing.

"If there are differences, they will emerge. But certainly, we will never endorse things that do not convince us," Mr. Berlusconi told reporters.

An international group of journalists, “Reporters without borders” (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters sans frontières&lt;/a&gt;), said they were “very surprised” at Tuesday’s report released by the U.S. Army.

“We are not convinced that everything possible has been done to establish what happened in this tragedy or to determine the responsibility of all those involved, and we reiterate our appeal for an independent international enquiry by US and Italian authorities," the press freedom organization said.

They had asked for a United Nations investigation immediately after the shooting. They also commented on the fact that the two Italian investigators disagreed with the findings of the U.S. Army and refused to sign the finished reports.

"We will see then what official reaction comes from the Italian government, which has a right to demand sanctions," it said.

<h3>Former hostage and attack survivor Giuliana Sgrena very critical of report</h3>
Ms. Sgrena again today described the Army’s announcement as a "slap in the face for the Italian government." U.S. investigators were satisfied, according to the report, that "the procedures were followed to the letter" by the soldiers involved. Ms. Sgrena repeated her statement that the car in which she, Calipari and another agent, the driver, were travelling had “no warning signal…no warning shot” and "the searchlight was turned on after the shots were fired."

The position of the U.S. high command, that soldiers had followed procedures, has remained unchanged since they first asserted this shortly after the incident occurred.

U.S. Secretary of Defense, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; said of the report and its investigators, "My latest information is that they [the Americans and Italians] have not come to a final agreement on a joint report...It's an investigation, it was done together, intimately, and I think that we'll just have to wait and see what they come out with."

With the &lt;a href="UK%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;UK general election&lt;/a&gt; on May 5, three party leaders from the largest parties in the election answered questions live on the BBC at 19:30 UTC Thursday. &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Howard"&gt;Michael Howard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, currently Opposition) and &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, incumbent) were asked questions by an audience representative of the British public. The politicians were given no advance notice of the questions. David Dimbleby hosted the discussion, as he has other ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time%20%28television%29"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ debates.

Topics that were raised included taxation and the new 50% top rate of tax proposed by the Lib Dems, immigration and controls proposed by the Conservatives, the largely negative campaigning launched by the Tories, and the legality of the Iraq war. Also, bullying and discipline in schools, further education and public health were issues raised.

Charles Kennedy's period in the "hot chair" was notable for the largely benevolent questions posed to him, and considerable support evident from applause and cheering at the end of several points made. He attacked the British &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Past%20the%20Post%20electoral%20system"&gt;First Past the Post electoral system&lt;/a&gt; as "perverse" and said that he would support a proportional voting system if he got into power. When questioned as to whether, upon pressure from the US, he would go to war again in the Middle East without sufficient evidence, he replied strongly "No." Further, he said he could not see the Liberal Democrats in another coalition with any other party that may come into power.

In contrast, the opposition leader entered accompanied with less enthusiasm, including several cries of "Howard is evil!" by several unidentifiable members of the audience. Michael Howard revealed during the debate that, if that he knew all of the things he knew now, he would have supported the invasion of Iraq with Tony Blair. However, he still upholds the illegality of the war and the way it began, and the apparent lies on the part of the Prime Minister to the people as primary reasons to vote for his party.

Tony Blair's interview period was highlighted by the decision to go to war on Iraq, and the Attorney General's advice in a recently leaked dossier. Difficult questions relevant to the amount of consultation he made with his Cabinet members and the Intelligence groups, and the amount of division within his cabinet with regards to the Iraq War were raised. The Prime Minister was visibly under pressure, and was openly surprised at several statements made by the public present. Upon hearing that local surgeries did not allow appointments to be booked until less than 48 hours before an available time in order to meet government targets, he was unprepared and appeared surprised.

Toward the end of the discussion, hecklers in the front row interrupted the rounding up of the program.

Considering the content of ♡❤Question Time♡❤, it would seem that the problem of Iraq, and whether the British public can trust the current Prime Minister, may overshadow political debate concerning domestic issues.

&lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Silvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt;'s government received a vote of confidence from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Senate"&gt;Italian Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Thursday, after it earned the confidence of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Chamber%20of%20Deputies"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yesterday. The Senate's tally was 170 pros, 117 cons and no abstentions.

Berlusconi declared these votes of confidence as demonstrating the strength and coherence of his coalition.

He also declared that he wanted a change in the electoral law so that a bipartisan political system would srise, and that he wants to form a majority government after the next election.

Wildlife scientists confirmed on Thursday that a bird long thought extinct, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIvory-billed%20woodpecker"&gt;Ivory-billed woodpecker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has been found in &lt;a href="Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;. The remarkable birds have a 30-inch wingspan and stand nearly 20 inches high.

The birds inhabited a wide swath of American bottomlands and mountain pine forests until the latter part of the 1800s. They require a large feeding ground, and it is thought the expansion of towns and cities closed off their domain. They went extinct in &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; during the same period. Ornithologists say each mating pair of Ivory-billed woodpeckers needs three square miles of forest to survive. There were thought to be only 22 of them left in 1938.

There have been several independent sightings of the bird in Arkansas over the last year, and even a videotape. In an effort to support the birds, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACornell%20University"&gt;Cornell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Lab of Ornithology, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Nature%20Conservancy"&gt;The Nature Conservancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and other groups have joined to form the Big Woods Conservation Partnership to conserve 200,000 acres of forest habitat and rivers in the area during the next 10 years.

John Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology told the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, "the bird captured on video is clearly an ivory-billed woodpecker. Amazingly, America may have another chance to protect the future of this spectacular bird and the awesome forests in which it lives." 

The story premiered Thursday in the online version of Science magazine.

Scientists in &lt;a href="w%3AHamburg"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; are baffled by what appears to be a widespread case of "Exploding &lt;a href="w%3Atoad"&gt;toads&lt;/a&gt;". In a local &lt;a href="w%3Apond"&gt;pond&lt;/a&gt;, more than 1,000 toads have expanded and then exploded. In addition, it has been reported that thousands more are exploding in central &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, in a town called &lt;a href="w%3AL%C3%A5sby"&gt;Låsby&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3AMid-Jutland"&gt;Mid-Jutland&lt;/a&gt;.

The water in the pond has been checked, but does not indicate anything out of the ordinary. Neither do the toad's corpses. They have been checked for &lt;a href="w%3Abacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Avirus"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, but none have been found.

One German scientist is theorizing that the toads are being terrorized by &lt;a href="w%3Acrow"&gt;crows&lt;/a&gt; who attempt to peck at the toads' &lt;a href="w%3Aliver"&gt;livers&lt;/a&gt;. When the crows go for the livers, the toads puff up as a defense mechanism. Since there is a hole in the toad's body caused by the pecking crow, the entrails and blood explode out of the hole.

German tabloids have taken to calling the pond, "the death pool" and "the pond of death".

Serbian general, &lt;a href="w%3ANebojsa%20Pavkovic"&gt;Nebojša Pavković&lt;/a&gt;, pled not guilty before the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20former%20Yugoslavia"&gt;International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hague"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt; today. Pavković is indicted on four counts of crimes against humanity and one count of violations of the laws or customs of war from January 1999 to June 1999 in &lt;a href="w%3AKosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;. 

After fleeing from Serbian authorities, he surrendered on April 22. Pavković's extradition was one of the conditions for confirmation of the feasibility report of accession of Serbia and Montenegro to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;.

White House reporters used their first "prime time" chance in over a year to pepper &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; with questions during a nationally televised press conference. Bush talked about the a wide range of topics including the threat of North Korea, Social Security solvency and his support for privatized accounts as well as means-based benefits, the rocketing price of crude oil, and issues concerning Iraq.

During the Thursday evening conference, President Bush was asked, "Mr. President, under the law, how would you justify the practice of '&lt;a href="w%3ARendition"&gt;renditioning&lt;/a&gt;', where U.S. agents who bust terror suspects abroad, taking them to a third country for interrogation? And would you stand for it if foreign agents did that to an American here?"

"That's a hypothetical," President Bush quickly replied.

After a brief pause, Bush continued, "We operate within the law, and we send people to countries where they say they're not going to torture the people..."

"The unusually expansive authority for the CIA to operate independently was provided by the White House under a still-classified directive signed by President Bush within days of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon", the New York Times reported, quoting government officials.
Since &lt;a href="w%3ATimeline%20of%20the%20September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;, concern has grown that the CIA may be flying suspected terrorists to nations such as &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; in order to have them interrogated using methods that would be prohibited by law in the U.S. itself.

The president told reporters, "I'm going to say it again: One of my concerns after September the 11th is the farther away we got from September the 11th, the more relaxed we would all become and assume that there wasn't an enemy out there ready to hit us..." 

One episode of renditioning was reported by ♡❤The Washington Post♡❤ in November 2003. It relates to a Canadian citizen who, while on an international flight that stopped in New York to pick up passengers, was detained and deported to Syria where he endured 10 months of what he described as torture in a Syrian prison.

Maher Arar, who lives in Toronto with his family, was released in October of 2003 and has never been charged with any crime. He said that he pleaded with U.S. authorities to let him return to Canada. The Syrian chargé d'affaires in Washington, Imad Moustafa, denied that Arar was tortured in an interview on &lt;a href="w%3ACBC%20Radio%20One"&gt;CBC Radio&lt;/a&gt;.
President Bush was also asked, "Mr. President, your State Department has reported that terrorist attacks around the world are at an all-time high. If we're winning the war on terrorism, as you say, how do you explain that more people are dying in terrorist attacks on your watch than ever before?"

"Well, we've made the decision to defeat the terrorists abroad so we don't have to face them here at home," President Bush replied.

During the hour long telecast, President Bush restated his primary messages on social security, energy policy, and the war in Iraq.

Social security was the biggest topic before he opened up to reporters for discussion. He pressed for politicians working on the program to act with bipartisanship, citing tough challenges ahead when shortfalls in the program's funding are in some calculations projected to begin in about a decade.

The press conference was only the fourth prime-time press conference held by President Bush since he took office in 2001.

<h1>U.S. EPA submits 2003 greenhouse gas inventory to U.N.</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20EPA%20submits%202003%20greenhouse%20gas%20inventory%20to%20U.N.&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;US Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; (EPA) has released an official annual report to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (UN) on &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emissions in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The report is drafted, held for 30 days of public comment, then released to the Secretariat of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;UN Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (UNFCCC) each year in April.

This year's report is the ninth since the EPA began producing the emissions inventory in 1997, after the US signed and ratified the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC, a legally non-binding treaty created to address &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;, is not as well known as the Kyoto Protocol, which is a more recently updated protocol based on that treaty. The United States did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol; however, it was ratified by 127 other nations and went into effect for them on February 16, 2005.

<h3>Major findings</h3>

The EPA report covers the period 1990-2003, with particular emphasis on the 2003 period (there is a one-year delay in preparation). Major findings include:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Between 1990 and 2003, US emissions increased overall by 13 percent, during which time the US economy has grown at a comparatively higher rate of 46 percent; one can conclude from these figures that the economy is becoming more efficient at making monetary profits (economic output) relative to its greenhouse gas emissions. This relative growth is illustrated in the first graph above (click the graph to enlarge for readability). The graph shows that emissions per person (or "per capita") is holding steady, but emissions per unit of economic output is decreasing as economic output (or Real &lt;a href="w%3AGross%20Domestic%20Product"&gt;Gross Domestic Product&lt;/a&gt;, called Real GDP) rises strongly and steadily.
BULLET::::- From 2002 to 2003, US emissions increased overall by 0.6 percent. A year-to-year comparison and overall growth of US emissions is shown in the graph below (click the graph to enlarge). In two different years, 1991 and 2001, the greenhouse gas emissions actually decreased; however, the general overall trend continues to be toward increasing emissions. You may recall that 2001 was a year of economic setbacks for the US, with a stock market crisis and the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11, which no doubt contributed to the temporary reduction of emissions.

</ul>
The period beginning in 1990 is of interest, since that is the period addressed by the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to reduce the average greenhouse gas emissions for each country to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels.

<h3>Gases covered</h3>

Gases covered in the report included six major greenhouse gases. The first three gases are produced both naturally and by human activity, but the last three gases are mainly produced by human activity:
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20dioxide"&gt;Carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; (chemical formula CO); in 2003, 95 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States were produced by the combustion of fuel.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AMethane"&gt;Methane&lt;/a&gt; (chemical formula CH), mainly from natural and agricultural sources. This gas has 20 times the potential effect on global warming as carbon dioxide; however, methane levels in the United States have been declining steadily since 1990.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ANitrous%20oxide"&gt;Nitrous oxide&lt;/a&gt; (chemical formula NO), commonly known as "laughing gas" for its effect when inhaled. This gas has 200 times the potential effect on global warming as carbon dioxide, if you consider equal amounts of each gas; however, the total amount of nitrous oxide currently in the atmosphere is much less.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AHydrochlorofluorocarbon"&gt;Hydrochlorofluorocarbon&lt;/a&gt; (HCFCs) and &lt;a href="w%3ACFC"&gt;chlorofluorocarbons&lt;/a&gt; (CFCs)
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3APerfluorocarbon"&gt;Perfluorocarbons&lt;/a&gt; (PFCs)
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ASulfur%20hexafluoride"&gt;Sulfur hexafluoride&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
About 80% of the total emissions came from the burning of &lt;a href="w%3AFossil%20fuel"&gt;fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;. Other major natural greenhouse gases are &lt;a href="w%3Awater%20vapor"&gt;water vapor&lt;/a&gt; (HO), which actually traps more heat in the atmosphere than all the listed gases combined; and &lt;a href="w%3Aozone"&gt;ozone&lt;/a&gt; (O), a gas well-known for a "&lt;a href="w%3AOzone%20depletion"&gt;hole&lt;/a&gt;" in the ozone layer being discovered over the earth's polar regions in recent decades.

A &lt;a href="UCLA"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; team, headed by Brian Naranjo, has observed the &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20fusion"&gt;nuclear fusion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3Adeuterium"&gt;deuterium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Anuclei"&gt;nuclei&lt;/a&gt; in a tabletop device. The device uses a lithium tantalate (LiTaO) &lt;a href="w%3Apyroelectric"&gt;pyroelectric&lt;/a&gt; crystal to ionize deuterium atoms and accelerate the ions towards a stationary erbium deuteride (ErD) target. Fusion of two deuterium nuclei results in the emission of helium nuclei (alpha particles), &lt;a href="w%3Aneutron"&gt;neutron&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3Agamma%20ray"&gt;gamma ray&lt;/a&gt;s. The team anticipates applications of the device as a tabletop neutron generator, or in "microthrusters" for space propulsion. It is possible that there may be applications related to nuclear weapons, although this possibility is not discussed in the research paper.

This development is not related to earlier claims of tabletop fusion or "cold fusion" having been observed during &lt;a href="w%3Asonoluminescence"&gt;sonoluminescence&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the leader of the team behind this development was one of the main critics of earlier low-temperature fusion claims.

This device is not the first reliable tabletop fusion device; the &lt;a href="w%3AFarnsworth-Hirsch%20fusor"&gt;Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor&lt;/a&gt;, developed in the early 1960s in the laboratory of &lt;a href="w%3APhilo%20T.%20Farnsworth"&gt;Philo T. Farnsworth&lt;/a&gt; who was instrumental in developing &lt;a href="w%3Atelevision"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt;, is sold commercially as a neutron source. Research by Dr. Todd Rider of MIT suggests that the kind of non-equilibrium fusion produced in these sources will never be usable as an energy source (see &lt;a href="http%3A//theses.mit.edu/Dienst/UI/2.0/Composite/0018.mit.theses/1995-130/1%3Fnsections%3D13"&gt;his PhD thesis&lt;/a&gt;).

Reggie Miller led the Indiana Pacers in scoring with 33 points as the Pacers beat the Celtics in Indianapolis by 23 points to take a 2-1 lead in the first round of the NBA finals. After losing the first game to Boston at the Fleet Center, the Pacers came back in game 2 to win by 3.

The Celtics kept within 5 points of the Pacers until the middle of the second quarter, when the Pacers went on a 13-1 run. At halftime, Pacers led by 17, 55-38. Though the Celtics pulled to within 7 in the middle of the third quarter, they never led again.

Three Celtics scored in double figures (Paul Pierce, Gary Payton, and Antoine Walker), but it was not enough to overcome Reggie Miller, who scored 15 points in the fourth quarter alone. Walker was ejected from the game with 4:05 remaining for two technical fouls.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHopewell%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Hopewell, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
“People are not paying with cash anymore,” Alex Demir stressed when asked about rising gas prices. Increasingly, they opt to pay with &lt;a href="w%3A%20Debit%20card"&gt;♡❤plastic♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. The payment method involves no transaction fee, is safer than cash if lost or stolen, and is more convenient. The plastic &lt;a href="w%3ADebit%20card"&gt;Debit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A%20Credit%20Cards"&gt;Credit Cards&lt;/a&gt; also mean people, if they choose to, can pay at the pump and skip making the trip inside the station. No wonder its use is on the rise.

Demir is the owner-operator of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Royal%20Dutch/Shell"&gt;Shell&lt;/a&gt; gas station that changed over on Thursday from what used to be a &lt;a href="w%3ATexaco"&gt;Texaco&lt;/a&gt;. He expects pump prices to hit &lt;a href="w%3A%24"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2.50 a gallon before levelling and the sticker shock wears off.

Demir estimates he passes along in the form of higher gas prices a &lt;a href="w%3ANickel%20%28U.S.%20coin%29"&gt;nickel&lt;/a&gt; per gallon due to the surcharge he incurs from processing electronic purchases. Each time a buyer uses plastic to make a payment, he submits the receipt to a bank to process for having the money credited into his account. The bank keeps 3% of the total amount of his transactions as a processing surcharge, or fee.

When the use of plastic was first gaining acceptance in the gas pumping business, people who used plastic paid a higher price, about 3 cents a gallon, when at the time gas cost about a dollar a gallon. Then advertising campaigns offering “Credit same as Cash” started, and changed the business standard to where now all stations charge the same, regardless of cash or plastic payment.

“The banks are making a lot of money on this,” Demir says. Now that the price of gas has more than doubled, the fees banks collect on processing these plastic transactions has more than doubled too. The entire transaction banks use to process these payments is electronic, involving hardly any labor at all. But the processing fee remains unchanged, which means a fat paycheck for banks.

Now maybe he and other gas stations will go back to offering a discount for cash. Processing plastic transactions is a variable cost to Demir over which he has no control when his pump prices are 'Credit same as Cash". The use of plastic directly affects his profit margin by the 3% processing fee.

When asked about high gas prices from suppliers, he dismissed the notion with a wave of his hand. “They control everything,” he said.

<h1>Romanian mining industry to receive 115 million euro in state aid</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Romanian%20mining%20industry%20to%20receive%20115%20million%20euro%20in%20state%20aid&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; Ministry of Economy and Commerce, in partnership with the Ministry of Public Finance, have approved a package giving 115 million &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; state assistance to the &lt;a href="w%3Amining"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; industry. This will involve the exemption of 11 state-owned mining companies from financial obligations, of contributing to the state budget, worth 115 million euro. The largest tax exemptions were awarded to the Oltenia National Lignite Company, with 47.4 million euro and to the National Coal Company in &lt;a href="w%3APetrosani"&gt;Petroşani&lt;/a&gt; (38.3 million euro). The exemption took effect on April 26.

State aid to several industries, especially mining and steelworking, is expected to decline in the coming years, as the European Union has told Romania that it needs to stop subsidising loss-making industries in order to be able to fully integrate into the European Union common market. Additionally, Romania's new &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20and%20Truth"&gt;Justice and Truth&lt;/a&gt; (Liberal-Democrat) governing coalition is keen on further liberalising Romania's free-market economy, by greater privatisation, fiscal liberalisation and a reduction in state aid.

&lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; company Korsnas Packaging has extended its operations in &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; by transferring two production lines from &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; to its Romanian subsidiary in &lt;a href="w%3APloiesti"&gt;Ploieşti&lt;/a&gt;, an industrial city close to &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. The first production line will be designed for producing packing material for food and the building industry. This line will be transferred to Romania at the beginning of May, with the transaction being worth &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;1.5 million. The second production line will be transferred in 2006, depending on the 2005 financial results of Korsnas' Romanian subsidiary.

In the past few years, and the past year especially, more European Union companies have relocated to Romania for to its lower labour cost and skilled workforce. Foreign investors have also been attracted by a new tax policy which started in January 2005, putting in place a flat 16% tax rate for personal income and corporate profit. Foreign investment is expected to increase in the future, as Romania signed in April 25 its Accession Treaty with the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and is set to become a member of this organisation on January 1, 2007.

<h1>Pay-by-Plastic pumps up gas prices in U.S./Notes</h1>
When I first passed the gas station earlier in the day, there was a guy in a man-lift hoisted up next to the gas price sign, and I thought, “Oh gawds, the gas prices are really outta hand now…!” 

I later realized, after passing by later, that it was a changeover from a Texaco station to Shell. The man-lift was finished and gone by then. Earlier it was making changes to the plastics and graphics on the gas price sign.

I gave Mr. Demir the URL here to come get me if I mis-quoted him.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=World%27s%20most%20expensive%20hotel-casino%20opens%20in%20Las%20Vegas&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The world's most expensive hotel-casino ever has opened in . The casino, which was designed and built over a period of five years, cost US$2.7 billion to construct. The hotel stands nearly fifty stories above the Las Vegas valley, with a 180-foot tall mountain in front of the main entrance.

Numerous lavish touches contributed to the high expense of the development. The sign in front of the Wynn property has an unusual mechanical design, with a large piece containing the ♡❤Wynn♡❤ logo, which can move vertically up or down as different announcements are presented.

"I think it's going to start a shift of power. It's been the south for a long time. Things will start moving to the north because of Wynn Las Vegas, Sheldon Adelson with the expansion of the Venetian, the New Frontier -- that whole area will become the new hot area of Las Vegas for the next decade or so," gaming expert Anthony Curtis told ♡❤Las Vegas KLAS TV♡❤.

As the property opened to the public, developer &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Wynn%20%28developer%29"&gt;Steve Wynn&lt;/a&gt; greeted visitors at the front entrance.

"It's always fascinating to watch people enter the thing and get their first moment after we open the doors," Wynn told the ♡❤Las Vegas Review-Journal♡❤.

<h3>Concern about the cost</h3>
 &lt;span style="display:none"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Analysts are not too concerned about the cost of the Wynn development. Wynn paid off the cost of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Mirage"&gt;♡❤The Mirage♡❤&lt;/a&gt; hotel-casino in 18 months, much earlier than the planned seven years for which the debt had been scheduled for repayment.

"If you remember the opening of The Mirage in 1989, Wynn needed to make a nut of $1 million a day. Everyone thought he was nuts; 'couldn't be done,' they all said," Las Vegas history department Chairman Hal Rothman told the ♡❤Las Vegas Review-Journal♡❤.

Wynn sold his interest in Mirage Resorts to MGM Grand (which became &lt;a href="w%3AMGM%20Mirage"&gt;MGM Mirage&lt;/a&gt; and is now run by &lt;a href="w%3AKirk%20Kerkorian"&gt;Kirk Kerkorian&lt;/a&gt;) for US$6.4 billion back in 2000, then turned around and purchased the property for the Wynn hotel-casino for US$275 million. The property was previously the home of the Desert Inn.

The hotel has 2,359 rooms, and a few hundred deluxe suites and "parlors" for high rollers. The casino has 1,960 slot machines and 137 table games on a 111,000 square foot casino floor. A &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMaserati"&gt;Maserati&lt;/a&gt; dealership and the ♡❤Le Reve♡❤ stage show, featuring a million gallon water tank, round out the expensive offerings.

A round of golf will go for US$500 on the elaborate golf course located behind the main building.

All of these specifications add up to a record construction cost of over one million US dollars per room. Other expensive Las Vegas properties cost a fraction of the price, such as the Bellagio, which cost half the price at US$533,000 per room. The most expensive hotel property in the world was previously the Grand Wailea Resort in &lt;a href="w%3AMaui%2C%20Hawaii"&gt;Maui, Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, which cost US$775,000 per room.

"Yes, (Wynn) may be in over his head, but then he has found ways to survive before," Las Vegas professor Bill Thompson told the ♡❤Las Vegas Review-Journal♡❤.

<h3>Reaction from the competition</h3>

Several of Wynn's largest competitors spoke with admiration of the property and looked forward to its impact on Las Vegas.

"I've never understood the hand-wringing about something new, especially in Las Vegas and Atlantic City," Harrah's Chairman and CEO Gary Loveman told the ♡❤Las Vegas Review-Journal♡❤.

Other casino bosses from the Mandalay and the MGM Mirage had positive comments as well, hoping to pick up some new business from the development.

"It's a positive in terms of bringing more visitors," Mandalay Resort Group President and CEO Glenn Schaeffer told the ♡❤Las Vegas Review-Journal♡❤.

"Steve will build a great property and bring new people to town. If we're doing what we're supposed to be doing, then we'll pick up some of that business also," MGM Mirage Chairman and CEO Terry Lanni told the ♡❤Las Vegas Review-Journal♡❤.

<h3>Reaction from the public</h3>
Thousands of visitors gathered for hours in front of the property before it opened. Security guards had to monitor the number of visitors entering the building.

"I think it's spectacular," David Schwartz, coordinator of the Gaming Studies Research Center at the University of Nevada Las Vegas told ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

"People were pushing and shoving," Las Vegan Kathie Anderson told ♡❤Associated Press♡❤.

"There is nobody in the world who creates such entertaining and beautiful casinos," British billionaire Richard Branson told ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ from the casino floor. "I would say every other casino must be nervous. He's lifted the bar dramatically," Branson said.

"This would be hard to top," Las Vegan Marlene DeMarco told ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

Two activists who helped identify a vagrant &lt;a href="w%3AGenetic%20engineering"&gt;Genetically Modified&lt;/a&gt; (GM) crop of papaya, which was later confirmed and destroyed by Thai officials, now face prison over their actions, says &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt;.

"In July of 2004, [Journalist] Pat and [Ecology PhD] Jay took this story public when they acted as spokespersons for Greenpeace activists who sealed off GE papaya in experimental fields at the Khon Kaen research station &amp;mdash; the source of GE papaya contamination in the region," says a statement from the environmental awareness organisation.

"They were charged with theft, trespassing and destruction of property."

"Instead of getting to the bottom of who precisely was responsible for the contamination, the very department that was responsible for the contamination decided to take legal action against Pat and Jay."

<h2>Crop discovery and destruction</h2>
In September the government was reported as having located at least nine GM plants on farms near the research facility, in &lt;a href="w%3AKhon%20Kaen"&gt;Khon Kaen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUbon%20Ratchathani"&gt;Ubon Ratchathani&lt;/a&gt;. Entire farm crops were destroyed to prevent the GM variety from spreading further, including those at research stations.

"Ten years of research aimed at improving disease resistance in papayas was destroyed, along with the experimental crops," said Wilai Prasartsri to ♡❤The Nation♡❤ in Thailand when 1,000 suspected genetically modified papaya trees there were buried under 2 meters of soil. Prasartsri is the research station chief of Muang district, Khon Kaen. 

Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Somsak Thepsuthin said at the time only GM crops were to be destroyed, out of 2,600 &lt;a href="w%3Apapaya"&gt;papaya&lt;/a&gt; crops sampled across Northeast Thailand. Papaya on the Khon Kaen farm were destroyed, and a control zone was set up within a 450metre radius of the GM contamination to prevent possible spread.

Director of state-funded non-government organisation, Bio-diversity and Community Rights Action Thailand &lt;a href="http%3A//www.biothai.org/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Withoon Lianchamroon pointed out that rather than carry out extensive testing to isolate GM crops, it would be cheaper to pay compensation to all 2,600 farmers and destroy all the papaya on their farms, because the cost of GMO testing – Bt1,600 (US$40) per sample – was prohibitive.

Two GM papaya strains are being developed in Thailand, according to Greenpeace: ♡❤Khak Dam♡❤ and ♡❤Khak Nuan♡❤. The plants being grown in Thailand were genetically altered at &lt;a href="w%3ACornell%20University"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt; in the US, but details of the agreement were kept secret by the Thai government and Cornell, Greenpeace said. The group believed though, that a royalty fee was to be charged for commercial use of the plants showing the altered genetic code, which was designed to be resistant to ringspot virus.

<h2>Blame</h2>

Although the Network of Northeastern Alternative Agriculture has filed complaints of negligence against the Prime Minister and senior agriculture officials, calling on Khon Kaen police to launch a criminal investigation into how the crops had spread, Greenpeace claims that no charges have been laid against anyone except the two activists.

Mr Somsak has launched an internal investigation to determine how the GM papayas from the experimental fields leaked to taint local crops, while director-general of the Department of Agriculture (DOA), Chakan Saengraksawong, eager to begin further field trials, told ♡❤The Nation♡❤, "We never sold the GM papaya seeds. If any official is found to have illegally sold the seeds he will surely face punishment."

Mr Withoon alleged at the time that a cover-up of the extent of dissemination of the GM variety had occurred. Mr Somsak said that the problem was limited to the Khon Kaen farms, whereas Withoon suspected that many more seedlings had 'escaped', with the thousands of Ubon Ratchathani villagers having been given seedlings by state experimental farms.

Environmentalists pointed to the apparent lack of effectiveness of the Khon Kaen farm's strong fences and round-the-clock security in preventing escape of the GM seedlings.

<h2>Status of GM in Thailand</h2>

Since 2001, Thailand has banned importation of GM organisms for commercial non-research purposes, until national regulations can be developed.

Exports to Europe were cancelled in the face of the discovery, affecting Thailand's US$1 million, 3,000 ton papaya export market. The internal market of papaya in Thailand is a hundred times as large.

According to Mr Withoon, most Thai are against GM. Bumrung Kayothabut of the Network of Northeastern Alternative Agriculture, last year said the government was in the grip of multinational companies trying to dominate Thai agriculture through the promotion of GM crops.

Senator Niran Phitakwatchara linked pro-GM moves by the government to the Thailand-United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA); in the midst of the papaya escapade, the Thai government was reviewing its policy on GM crops, and being lobbied by the US biotech monolith, Monsanto &amp;mdash; who, with Cornell, holds patents on the world's only commercial GM papaya, ♡❤SunUp♡❤, farmed in Hawaii.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin&lt;/a&gt; said on delaying of a decision on overturning the ban on GM crops, that the government needed more information. "People, including some scientists, still have no clear understanding of what GM crops really are," he told ♡❤The Nation♡❤. He added that bio-safety legislation was needed as a first step, before examining whether or not to allow GM crops, and denied that the FTA was influencing Thai policy-making.

Sgt. Hasan Akbar, 34, should die by lethal injection for the murder of two of his comrades by hand grenade and rifle in the opening days of the Iraq invasion. This was the sentence handed down by the jury of 15 Thursday, in a military court martial in Fort Bragg, N.C. Last week the same jury deliberated only 2 and a half hours and found him guilty of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder while stationed with the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division in Kuwait in March of 2003. 

The defense contended that Sergeant Akbar was not able to plan the attack because he was mentally ill and suffering from delusions that his life was in jeopardy. Akbar asked the jury for forgiveness before they went into the sentencing phase: "I want to apologize for the attack that occurred," he told the jury. 

"I felt that my life was in jeopardy, and I had no other options. I also want to ask you for forgiveness." He spoke in a very low voice that was described by reporters as a whisper.

Although the defense argued he was too mentally deranged to plan the attack, there was consensus that he had tossed grenades into tents and fired on soldiers, killing Capt. Chris Seifert of the Army and Maj. Gregory Stone of the Air Force. He wounded 14 others.

The jury took seven hours to sentence him to lethal injection, beginning an automatic appeals process that could go on for years.

Prosecutors said Akbar, a Muslim, attacked his camp just before their move to Iraq because he was concerned about killing fellow Muslims in the Iraq invasion. His defense team believes he will get his sentence reduced to life in prison during one of the five appeal cases they expect to bring.

Sergeant Akbar’s is the first prosecution for these charges since the Vietnam War. The last U.S. military execution was Pfc. John A. Bennett in 1961. He was an Army soldier executed after conviction for the rape and murder of an 11-year-old Austrian girl.

Today in &lt;a href="w%3ARamallah"&gt;Ramallah&lt;/a&gt; Russian President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; promised to aid Palestinians. In a press conference held after talks with &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, Putin said that Palestinians cannot fight terrorism with slingshots and stones. He pledged to give airplane equipment, helicopters, communications equipment and to train security forces. The Russian President was cheered by the Palestinian crowd prior to the conference.

Putin was on a four day tour of the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, where he visited &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first high level visit of a Russian official to Egypt in 40 years, which was followed the next day by a visit to Israel &amp;mdash; a historic first, since no other Russian president has ever visited Israel.

The FOX Morning News broadcast from &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Square"&gt;Harvard Square&lt;/a&gt; this morning in &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. Anchors Liz Carrigan and Gene Lavanchy profiled a restaurant and a musician who will take part in the 22nd annual Mayfair, which starts on Sunday, May 1. The restaurant, Grafton Street, is on Massachusetts Avenue.

The Mayfair is a festival that takes place in Harvard Square on an annual basis. On Sunday, the Square will be closed from noon until 6 pm to vehicular traffic; according to &lt;a href="http%3A//www.harvardsquare.com/mayfair/index.php"&gt;the Mayfair website&lt;/a&gt;, "200 artists and merchants" will participate in the event this year.

The musician, Halsey Burgund, works for a computer security firm, but plays the drums and piano in his spare time. This morning, he had set up his portable recording booth to demonstrate the means by which he records passersby for voice samples in his music. Burgund will have his booth set up on Sunday and hopes to record festival visitors. Eventually, Burgund hopes to release his music under a &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; license. Burgund noted that he previously tried recording people on the street with just a microphone, but he found that there was too much ambient noise for the quality of recording he desired.

Two branches of &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; electricity distributor Electrica SA were privatised on Thursday, after Italian power producer &lt;a href="w%3AEnel"&gt;Enel&lt;/a&gt; bought 51% of the shares in the Electrica Banat and Electrica Dobrogea branches of the previously fully-state-owned company. The transaction had a value of 112 million euro, which included the acquisition of stocks and the increase in social capital of the two branches.

The privatisation ceremony was attended by Codruţ Sereş, the Romanian Minister of Economy and Commerce, as well as Claudio Scazola, the Italian Minister for Productive Activities, alongside Pierro Gnudi, the President of Enel.

Electrica Banat and Electrica Dobrogea supply the Romanian regions of &lt;a href="w%3ABanat"&gt;Banat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADobrogea"&gt;Dobrogea&lt;/a&gt;, which are situated in southwestern Romania, and southeastern Romania, respectively. The two branches account for 19% of Romania's total power supply. After the Enel takeover, Electrica SA, which is state-owned, will still own 49% of the stocks in the company.

The Electrica Banat and Dobrogea privatisation is the latest in a series of recent privatisations by the Romanian government. The new Romanian government, sworn in on December 2004 and headed by &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, is particularly keen on free-market reforms and a faster pace of privatisation.

&lt;a href="w%3ALien%20Chan"&gt;Lien Chan&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Chinese Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (KMT), the leading opposition party in &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, met &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACCP"&gt;Communist Party of China&lt;/a&gt; General Secretary, in the Chinese People's Hall in Beijing, China on Friday. Lien called his visit a step on the "historical bus" toward a "journey of peace".

The week-long visit takes place 56 years after the KMT withdrawal from &lt;a href="w%3Amainland%20China"&gt;mainland China&lt;/a&gt;, and signals the end of hostilities between the KMT (or Nationalist Party) and CPC. From 1926 to 1949, the two parties were involved in a bloody &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Civil%20War"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; resulting in the Nationalist retreat to Taiwan upon their defeat in 1949. 

This is the highest level exchange between the two parties since KMT leader &lt;a href="w%3AChiang%20Kai-shek"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt; and CPC leader &lt;a href="w%3AMao%20Zedong"&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt; met in &lt;a href="w%3AChongqing"&gt;Chongqing&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Sino-Japanese%20War"&gt;Second Sino-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt; in August 1945. Chiang, then the Chinese head of state, and Mao, then a guerrila leader, tried to negotiate a truce at the meeting. The negotiations fails and all-out war soon ensued.

Lien called on the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Taiwanese (ROC)&lt;/a&gt; government, led the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20independence"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt;-leaning President &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt;, to follow his meeting with more efforts at peacemaking and suppression of the independence movement. "I believe the door has been opened," said Lien. "How to walk towards a new future, towards a new outlook - I think the ruling party must shoulder this responsibility." 

"This is a historic meeting between the leaders of our two parties," Hu said after the historic televised handshake with Lien on Friday marking the formal end of hostilities. "As long as both sides place importance on the interests of the Chinese nation, on the common prosperity of the compatriots on both sides of the strait, we will be able to overcome our differences." Lien's visit to mainland China was in part prompted by the mainland &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20People%27s%20Congress"&gt;National People's Congress&lt;/a&gt;'s recent passage of a law against the possible secession by Taiwan, including the possible use of "nonpeaceful means" which could imply military force, a move that has increased tension between their two countries.

Lien's visit to mainland China was strongly opposed by the ruling &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; (DPP) Chairman &lt;a href="w%3ASu%20Tseng-chang"&gt;Su Tseng-chang&lt;/a&gt;, who expressed both "tears" and "rage" at the stance taken by Lien. Su said, "Lien has fully denied the development and the value of Taiwan's democracy, but continued praised China... During Lien's visit to China, we have seen that Lien took part in various banquets, shook hands with Chinese leaders and received gifts. But we didn't see that Lien has strongly criticized China for passing the anti-secession law. Lien neither voiced opposition against China's missiles targeting at Taiwan, nor did he oppose against China's military threat against Taiwan."

The agreements made by Lien will only take effect if ratified by Taiwan's government (which is unlikely, since President Chen opposes the accord and favors Taiwanese independence), or if the Nationalists regain control of the government in future elections.

<h1>Hindu mythological theme park planned for banks of Ganges</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hindu%20mythological%20theme%20park%20planned%20for%20banks%20of%20Ganges&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The family theme park, called "&lt;a href="w%3ADisneyland"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; on the Ganges" by the ♡❤BBC News♡❤ article, could probably be better compared to Disney's &lt;a href="w%3AEpcot"&gt;Epcot&lt;/a&gt;, since both feature an educational, interactive multimedia experience. Billed as the "world's biggest-ever mythological theme park", its purpose is to instruct the masses of Indian pilgrims who come to bathe in the Ganges with tales about the exploits of such &lt;a href="w%3AHinduism"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; gods as &lt;a href="w%3ARama"&gt;Rama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVishnu"&gt;Vishnu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AHanuman"&gt;Hanuman&lt;/a&gt;.

The focus is to be educational, not religious. "We’re not doing this as a religious project," said Sagar to ♡❤India-West♡❤ in an interview last September. "It’s not propaganda. We want to make it fun, a place where people can learn the Indian stories," a place that can appeal not only to Hindus but people of other religious faiths as well.

"The Hindu religion is well suited to something like this, religions like Islam are not allowed to depict forms but we have many different forms and representations of Gods," Sagar said in last week's BBC interview.

The name Ganga-Dham comes from the Indian words Ganga, for the Ganges, and Dham, meaning "place" or "abode". The park is to be built on 25 acres of land in the holy town of &lt;a href="w%3AHaridwar"&gt;Haridwar&lt;/a&gt;, in the foothills of the Himalayas, where an estimated 18 million pilgrims a year come to ritually cleanse themselves in the river. The god Vishnu is said by legend to have left his footprint in the town.

The company behind this project is the Sagar Group. Shiv's grandfather Ramanand Sagar established a film company, Sagar Art, in 1950 and went on to make 25 films and some hugely popular serials for Indian television. Most notably, Sagar Art produced the groundbreaking TV mythological serial "Ramayan", about the Hindu god Rama. Starting in 1987, the series went on to attract worldwide attention and claim as many as 650 million viewers over a period of several years. Images and songs from their TV serials will be incorporated into the park to increase the popular draw and build on the tradition of reverence toward the Hindu gods that the series is known for.

The project has also attracted some criticism, by some who feel that the site next to the holy river Ganges is inappropriate for building, and others who do not appreciate the project's light-hearted take toward the Hindu pantheon, which they find disrespectful. However, an important hurdle has been cleared with the official support of the state government of Uttaranchal, and positive comments have been received from other interested parties who favor spreading the knowledge of Hindu philosophy by popular means.

There are other difficulties that still must be addressed, for example, a lack of infrastructure in the area to support tourism. But the Sagar Group stands to profit as they already have a Sagar Ganga Resort in the area.

The parts of the planned site, as described on the Sagar Group's website, are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- "High-tech" rides
BULLET::::- Animated, interactive museum
BULLET::::- Food courts and bazaar
BULLET::::- Temple city
BULLET::::- Petting zoo

</ul>
Also places are to be provided for visiting non-resident Indians (NRIs) to set up "remote &lt;a href="w%3Apuja"&gt;poojas&lt;/a&gt;" and other rituals over the Internet.

Construction is planned to begin later this year for completion by 2007, specifically timed to be ready for the major &lt;a href="w%3AKumbh%20Mela"&gt;Kumbh Mela&lt;/a&gt; religious festival in 2010, which is expected to draw as many as 50 million or more visitors to the area.

Some of the park proceeds are said to be set aside for various charities. If the park is successful, the Sagar Group plans to build similar Dhams around the world, in Asia, Oceania, South America, or perhaps even in places such as London, England; Los Angeles, California or Orlando, Florida in the United States.

<h1>Romanian government asks kidnappers to release female journalist</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Romanian%20government%20asks%20kidnappers%20to%20release%20female%20journalist&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n government has asked the Islamic terrorists who kidnapped three Romanian journalists in late March to release one of the journalists, Marie-Jeanne Ion, aged 30, who is the only female in the group. The government has confirmed that the three journalists are all still alive, even though the terrorists, who call themselves the Muadh ibn Jabal Brigades, stated that they would kill them by last Wednesday unless Romania withdraws its troops from Iraq.

Romanian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt; said that all efforts were being made to save the journalists. He said, "In principle, authorities are in contact with the kidnappers but I can't say any more."

The terrorists have until yet not responded to the government's request to release Ion. Ion's father, who is a senator from the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Romania"&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, urged the Parliament to take a stand on the kidnappers' demands. He said, "If we don't take a stand, we will probably have a day of mourning that senators and deputies will remember."

Romanian lawmakers have expressed solidarity with the families of the hostages, and passed a resolution calling on the government to inform the Parliament about any options being weighed for the hostages' release. The document also requested that the Supreme Defense Council analyses the situation, as only the Council and the Romanian President, &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;, have the right to decide on military withdrawal from Iraq.

<h2>Iraqi politicians offer support to Romania</h2>

Iraq's new president, &lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt;, told Romania's ambassador to Baghdad that he was concerned about the fate of the Romanian journalists and promised that he would do everything in his power to help resolve the problem. Also, the Islamic Party of Iraq, which mainly consists of Sunni Muslims, made an appeal asking that the hostages be released.

Meanwhile, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly hosted a debate on the overall condition of journalists working in conflict zones such as Iraq. It also passed a resolution for international solidarity concerning the abduction of the three Romanian journalists.

<h2>Rallies continue in Bucharest and other cities</h2>

Rallies continued to occur in Bucharest in the past few days, with more than 1000 Romanians holding banners and demanding the freedom of the journalists. Some people also called for the withdrawal of Romanian troops from Iraq, yelling, "Troops out!" and waving banners saying, "It is not our war" and "Don't let them die!", alongside photos of the three journalists.

Many Romanians also prayed for the release of the journalists, especially since this weekend is Easter for those of &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20Orthodox%20Church"&gt;Romanian Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; religion, which make up 86% of the population. Some of the demonstrators marched to Victoria Palace (♡❤Palatul Victoriei♡❤), the government headquarters, where they quietly prayed for the journalists. After nightfall, several Romanian Orthodox religious services were held, specifically for the release of the journalists.

However, members of Romania's Arab and Kurdish immigrant communities also took part in the rallies, calling for the hostages' freedom. Romania's Kurdish community is mainly made up of refugees from Iraq and Turkey who have come to the country in the past few years.

The flood in northern &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; province &lt;a href="w%3AVojvodina"&gt;Vojvodina&lt;/a&gt; worsens as the river Tamiš rises further. The river flooded 10 days ago, covering the Јaša Tomić village. More then 200 houses were destroyed and around 800 are flooded, forcing 3235 people to evacuate. The flood was caused by heavy rain in Serbia and &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. Meteorologists say that Tamiš level will get lower in the following days.

Serbian army and volunteers are helping local residents, building a dike and saving the animals, but the villagers are short on drinking water and other supplies. There are no human casualties. The People's Office of the &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Tadic"&gt;President of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; has started an aid drive to help Јaša Tomić.

Partial local elections will be held in 26 small towns in &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, on June 12, to elect new local council and mayors. The elections will be organised in all localities where mayors recently ended their terms, as well as in localities that were recently proclaimed to town status.

Elections for new council and mayors will take place in several towns in the counties of &lt;a href="w%3ABacau%20%28county%29"&gt;Bacău&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVrancea"&gt;Vrancea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGalati%20%28county%29"&gt;Galaţi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrasov%20%28county%29"&gt;Braşov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIlfov"&gt;Ilfov&lt;/a&gt;, while local elections for choosing new mayors only will be held in towns in the counties of &lt;a href="w%3AMaramures"&gt;Maramureş&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABihor"&gt;Bihor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVaslui%20%28county%29"&gt;Vaslui&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABuzau%20%28county%29"&gt;Buzău&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADambovita%20%28county%29"&gt;Dâmboviţa&lt;/a&gt;

Romania's last full local elections were held in June 2004. However, partial elections are frequently held in between scheduled elections for those towns where mayors have resigned or ended their terms.

The government passed a law on Friday ratifying &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; accession treaty to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, after the Treaty was signed in a ceremony in &lt;a href="w%3ALuxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; in April 25, which was attended by the heads of state of all 25 current EU member states. The government pointed out that, aside from ratification by Romania and &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, the two states which signed the accession treaty in April 25, the treaty must also be ratified by the 25 current member states who also signed the treaty in Luxembourg.

The law passed by the Romanian government on Friday has been forwarded to the Parliament to be debated. It must be approved in a joint session of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, with at least a two-thirds majority.

Once the accession treaty is ratified by all 25 member states of the European Union, Romania and Bulgaria will become full members in January 1, 2007.

&lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20Romania"&gt;Orange Romania&lt;/a&gt;, the country's &lt;a href="w%3ALargest%20mobile%20phone%20companies%23Romania"&gt;largest mobile phone operator&lt;/a&gt;, announced that its client base increased in the first quarter of 2005 (January-March) from 4.93 million to 5.29 million subscribers, an increase of over 7%.

Additionally, Orange's income rose by 46.2%, from &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;122 million to €178 million. €167 million in income came from the Orange network, while the remainder came from the company's other investments. Company representatives were pleased with the results, and are confident that the objectives to the year as a whole are likely to be achieved.

&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; currently has approximately 10.6 million mobile telephone subscribers, a rate that is rapidly expanding. Orange Romania has nearly 50% market share. By the end of 2005, the number of Romanian mobile phone subscribers is expected to reach 11.5 to 12 million.

&lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; supermarket chain &lt;a href="w%3AMetro%20Cash%20and%20Carry"&gt;Metro Cash and Carry&lt;/a&gt; will open a new supermarket in &lt;a href="w%3AArad"&gt;Arad&lt;/a&gt;, western &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. According to Arad's vice-mayor, Tiberiu Dekany, the building authorisation process is currently underway, with Metro already acquiring a building lot, with an area of 100,000 m², on the outskirts of Arad, where the cash-and-carry store will be built. Metro is hoping to open the supermarket before the end of the year, and Dekany has said that the City Hall will give the building authorisations as soon as possible in order to let Metro meet that goal. Dekany did not comment on the value of the investment.

Metro is one of the largest supermarket chains in Romania, already having 21 stores in various cities across the country.

Heavy rain has washed away a 20-metre stretch of National Highway 75, in &lt;a href="w%3AAlba%20%28county%29"&gt;Alba county&lt;/a&gt;, western &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, leaving only one of the lanes open to traffic. Both the road and the side fences fell into the Arieş River due to the rain. Repair teams from the National Roads Department were called in to assess the damage and clear away the trees that had fallen onto the highway.

Western Romania has recently faced a week of heavy rain, which has caused heavy &lt;a href="w%3Aflood"&gt;flooding&lt;/a&gt; in some areas, and in other areas has damaged infrastructure. Parts of &lt;a href="w%3ATimis"&gt;Timiş county&lt;/a&gt; remain heavily flooded, along with the northern Serbian region of &lt;a href="w%3AVojvodina"&gt;Vojvodina&lt;/a&gt;. Some people have deemed the floods in this region to be the worst in 50 years.

Scientists confirmed today for the first time ever, that astronomers photographed a planet orbiting a sun other than our own. Photographs were taken late last year by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Southern%20Observatory"&gt;European Southern Observatory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ESO) in &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, but it has taken since then to confirm that the body is indeed a planet &amp;mdash; five times the size of Jupiter, the largest planet that orbits our own sun. 

Extra-solar planets such as this have been detected before, but never by direct observation &amp;mdash; their presence has always been inferred from aberrant behaviour of the star they circulate around.

"Among the most essential quests of modern astronomers, taking direct images of planets outside of our solar system is certainly up there among chart-toppers," says the ESO, in a press release given to verify the status of the object.

The newly imaged planet orbits a brown dwarf star known to scientists as 2M1207, at a distance that is nearly twice as far as that of Neptune from our own sun &amp;mdash; making the planet much too cold for lifeforms such as those on Earth. Detection of Earth-like planets is still years away, according to the ESO, because they are too faint for current equipment to detect.

The scientists say that the planet presents a valuable opportunity nonetheless, as it is much younger than those in our own system, at only "a few tens of millions of years old".

"Moreover, as the first tens of millions of years are considered to have been a critical period in the formation of Earth and of our own solar system, the study of nearby young planetary systems provides astronomers with invaluable insight on our own origins."

Suns are understood to form when matter collapses strongly under its own gravity, while planets form later by accretion, in matter orbiting a sun.

Photographs of what was thought to be an extra-solar planet were announced earlier this month. However scientists now state that the size of that planet might be much larger than originally announced, thus allowing a chance that the object might instead be a small star.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
This Friday, 29th of April at 4pm, pro-&lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; graffiti was sprayed on the outside wall of &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; Embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; claiming "Break down the Wall" (&lt;a href="w%3ADanish"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt;: "Riv muren ned").
Surveillance videos reveal a group of four women responsible for the act, as well as a driver. The women were not wearing any form of uniform, or appeared to have common &lt;a href="w%3AEthnic%20group"&gt;ethnic&lt;/a&gt; background and were of different age groups. The operation was completed in less than a minute and the four offenders fled the scene.

"They must have planned the operation ahead," says Sholi Ron, the embassy's chief security officer, "as suggested by the relative speed of the operation. Yet, they did not take into account the surveillance cameras, which gives the police an edge." He also pointed out that the colors were not chosen by accident.

A driver nearby has written down the plate number for the suspected vehicle. Police claim the vehicle was identified as a &lt;a href="w%3AMitsubishi"&gt;Mitsubishi&lt;/a&gt; van.

"Black, red and green, do those colors say anything to you?" says a passerby. "These are the same colors of the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; flag, as well as the base for other &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; nation's flags, I think that whoever did this thing is on the Palestinian side."

The first thing to catch my eye when I approached what used to be a Texeco gas station, was a guy up in a man-lift beside the pump price sign. Seeing heavy equipment being used to change what I thought were the gas prices, I thought, "Gawds, these prices are getting out of hand!"

After stopping in later and talking with the owner, I was impressed by how elated he was on the subject of bank processing fees. This was news to me. So I reported it.

The man-lift I saw earlier is absent from the photograph I took. They had used the lift to change the pump price sign from Texaco to Shell.

<h1>Wal-Mart closes down unionized store</h1>
♡❤♡April 30, 2005♡❤♡

The American discount chain, &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt;, closed the doors at one of its two unionized outlets in North America Friday. The closure eliminated 190 jobs in the small town of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJonqui%C3%A8re%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Jonquière, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. Wal-Mart Canada spokesman Kevin Groh said the store shut at noon Friday rather than the planned date of May 6 because it no longer had any merchandise.

Michael J. Fraser, the union's national director in Canada, said: "Wal-Mart is trying to send a message to the rest of their employees that if they join a union the same thing could happen to them." The union will be filing unfair labor practice charges against Wal-Mart in Quebec. 

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUnited%20Food%20and%20Commercial%20Workers"&gt;United Food and Commercial Workers&lt;/a&gt; union has organizing drives in at least 25 Canadian stores. In August 2004, workers at the Jonquiere store received union certification, and tried to negotiate a contract, which would have been the first for Walmart in North America. Now St. Hyacinthe, Quebec has the only remaining unionized Wal-Mart in North America; employees of that store have no contract.

The consulting firm AT Kearny has stated that above all, low labor costs is a big source of cost advantage for Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's employees might begin at as little as $8 an hour which is 20-30% less than unionized workers at rival discount stores.

In his first interview since the store's closing, Walmart CEO H. Lee Scott, Jr. defended his decision, saying to the Washington Post, "You can't take a store that is a struggling store anyway and add a bunch of people and a bunch of work rules that cause you to even be in worse shape." 

The major sticking point according to Scott was the number of full-time employes. Scott said that it was the union who walked away from negotiations; however, Fraser said that Walmart walked away from the talks, shutting down the store to avoid submitting to arbitration.

The elections were won by &lt;a href="w%3AFaure%20Gnassingb%C3%A9"&gt;Faure Gnassingbé&lt;/a&gt;, son of the previous leader &lt;a href="w%3AGnassingb%C3%A9%20Eyad%C3%A9ma"&gt;Gnassingbé Eyadéma&lt;/a&gt;, who held power in Togo for about 38 years before his death on February 5, 2005. The army appointed his son as his successor and the country's leader, but regional opposition forced him to step down and seek free elections.

The preliminary count indicates that 60% of the vote went to Faure Gnassingbé, a 38-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AMaster%20of%20Business%20Administration"&gt;Master of Business Administration&lt;/a&gt; (MBA) from &lt;a href="w%3AYale%20University"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt; and son of the former President. An additional 38% went to his chief opponent, 74-year-old Emmanual Bob-Akitani, who was endorsed by a six-party coalition and opposition leader Harry Olympio. Further violence is expected as the official vote tally and announcement of results comes within a few days.

"Just after the [preliminary] results were announced the red berets [commandos] went out into the streets and started shooting at the boys," said Marthe, who fled to a U.N. refugee camp in Benin to escape the fighting. "They only shot at the boys. They ransacked shops and blamed the youths, who were unarmed," she continued in her Reuters interview. More than 11,500 Togolese have fled from their country and taken up temporary residence in &lt;a href="w%3ABenin"&gt;Benin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGhana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; since the elections, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees"&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&lt;/a&gt; (UNHCR).

The opposition party claims that 100 people have been killed in the ongoing violence that passed through Lome and other villages. Togo's Human Rights League has verified the deaths of at least 40, and the wounding of many others.

"Violence is not the way to deal with democracy," said Mohammed Ibn Chambas, executive secretary of the &lt;a href="w%3AEconomic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States"&gt;Economic Community of West African States&lt;/a&gt; (ECOWAS). "We think the way forward is for Togolese to use dialogue, and to sit down and negotiate." ECOWAS has certified the elections as free from interference, a decision that some countries such as France have accepted, but the United States continues to question the fairness of the outcome.

&lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; protested after its cultural center, the Goethe Institute, was burned down in &lt;a href="w%3ALom%C3%A9"&gt;Lomé&lt;/a&gt;. The Togolese government has accused Germany of aiding the opposition, and former interior minister Francois Boko (who was fired earlier for trying to postpone the election due to fears of violence) has sought refuge in the German embassy. Togo is a former German colony, but the official language of the country is French, since it was passed to Britain and France in 1918 and only gained its independence in 1960.

Gnassingbé has offered to form a new unity government, incorporating voices from the opposition, but their leaders turned down the offer, claiming that the election was fraudulent and stolen.

"If they refuse tomorrow, I hope that they will decide to join us the next day," said Gnassingbé to France's ♡❤Le Monde♡❤ in their Friday edition. "Reconciliation is a long process. You can't jump overnight from a regime that lasted for 38 years to a new one," he continued.

A chemical part of the saliva of a poisonous lizard, the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGila%20monster"&gt;Gila monster&lt;/a&gt;, has become an integral partner in the control of Type 2 &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Adiabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; has approved its use for people who have not achieved adequate control of their diabetes with oral medications.

Byetta, or exenatide, is produced by Amylin Pharmaceuticals. It is injected before eating morning and evening meals as part of a combination treatment with oral drugs. The FDA said it could be approved as a stand-alone treatment if the drug companies can support such use with data.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEli%20Lilly%20%26amp%3B%20Co"&gt;Eli Lilly &amp; Co&lt;/a&gt;. was the development partner in creation of the drug.

"With Byetta's demonstrated effects on blood sugar and its safety profile, physicians and patients now have a new approach to fight the growing diabetes epidemic," said Sidney Taurel, CEO of Lilly.

<h1>Food with cancer-causing dye recalled in Britain</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Food%20with%20cancer-causing%20dye%20recalled%20in%20Britain&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The British Food Standards Agency (FSA) has announced a recall of foods containing banned dyes which increase the risk of cancer. The food products were sold at the Tesco, Waitrose, and Somerfield supermarkets.

A &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; company called "Barts Spices" found the illegal Para Red substance in their ♡❤Barts Ground Paprika♡❤, which was sold in 48g and 46g jars with a "Co-op" label. The batch codes on the affected products are 5032 and 5089 (expiration Dec 2007), and 5075 (expiration February 2007).

Tesco also found that their 130g package of BBQ rice cakes (expiration November and December 2005) contained both Para Red and Sudan I.

"It would be very prudent to assume that it could be a genotoxic carcinogen," FSA scientific advisers told reporters.

"As a company committed to supplying only the very finest quality food ingredients, we took the immediate decision to withdraw our ground paprika spice from all outlets selling the product and advertised a product recall in the national press," a Barts Spices spokesman said in a statement.

Sudan I is only authorized for industrial use to colorize petroleum products, such as shoe polish. Para Red and Sudan I are banned under the British Colours in Food Regulations of 1995.

Britain last went through a major food recall in February, when Worcester Sauce was found to contain chili powder dyed with Sudan 1.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; announced today that it plans to expand the license terms on its numerous &lt;a href="w%3ARSS"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds to allow other websites to reuse its content. The license currently proscribes that the feeds are only for "personal use," according to BBC editor Peter Clifton. According to Clifton's statement, "in May we'll be happy for outside websites to dip in and take our headlines." The announcement did not specify whether the new license would allow the use of entire articles, or just the headlines.

The BBC currently has 18 feeds, ranging in topic from Business and Technology to Health and Entertainment. They also provide feeds with regional news, focusing on, for example, Scotland or Northern Ireland. In its current setup, the BBC provides a headline plus a lead sentence in its feeds.

&lt;a href="w%3ARSS"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; ("Really Simple Syndication") is a protocol that allows users to aggregate articles from many sources in a program called a "news reader" or "aggregator." A news reader works by reading simple files from user-targeted websites and parsing them into a presentable format.

<h1>Two university students shot, killed in Cameroon strikes</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Two%20university%20students%20shot%2C%20killed%20in%20Cameroon%20strikes&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At least two university students have been shot and killed, and a third may have been mortally wounded after clashing with police at the University of &lt;a href="w%3ABuea"&gt;Buea&lt;/a&gt; in the west-central African nation of &lt;a href="w%3ACameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;. The deaths come after sporadic confrontation between students and police during strikes that began last Wednesday, following by one week mostly peaceful strikes which began April 20 at another Cameroon university, &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Yaound%C3%A9"&gt;Yaoundé One&lt;/a&gt;. A delegation of five students is said to have traveled from Yaoundé One to UB, instigating the strike at the second university.

The strikes at UB turned violent after the University Registrar, Herbert Nganjo Endeley, failed to calm the students. Police tried to disperse the students with &lt;a href="w%3ARiot%20control%20agent"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt;, but were pelted by stones in retaliation. Chaos ensued, with the police also throwing stones, bludgeoning and separating the students, turning &lt;a href="w%3Awater%20cannon"&gt;water cannons&lt;/a&gt; on them, raiding their residence hostels, and performing numerous arrests. The students responded by protesting, erecting barricades and destroying school property and vehicles. Several students and police were hospitalized during days of fighting.

The students were shot on Thursday in different incidents between 14:30 and 15:00 local time in &lt;a href="w%3AMolyko"&gt;Molyko&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; both were reported to be killed instantly. One student, Embwam Aloysius, a level 400 student of Environmental Science, received a bullet in the head, while the other student, Gilbert Nforlem, a masters degree Geology student, was shot in the chest. Local news reports indicate a female student may also have been killed, and claim that the students were shot by police. On Friday, speaking on state-run radio, Higher Education Minister Jacques Fame Ndongo called for an end to violence and said that "[President &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Biya"&gt;Paul Biya&lt;/a&gt;] has requested a judicial enquiry to establish the exact cause of the deaths."

UB, located in the town of Buea, South Province, is Cameroon's only English-speaking university in a nation where French, English, and African languages are spoken. Yaoundé One is Cameroon's largest university, located in the capital city of &lt;a href="w%3AYaound%C3%A9"&gt;Yaoundé&lt;/a&gt;, which is shown in the above map. There are four other state-run universities in Cameroon.

Students at both universities are striking for better educational conditions. The students at UB are demanding an end to the annual school fees of 50,000 CFA Francs (US$99), reduction of school bureaucracy, and other amenities. According to the ♡❤Post♡❤ newspaper in Cameroon, "They want all courses offered during the re-sit, good toilets, more lecture halls, microphones in amphi-theatres; that amphi 750 should be changed to 650 because it lacks 100 seats. They also want to be offered good food at the University restaurant among others." 

Some commentators in the Post's online forum expressed indignation at the deaths of the students and what they perceive as a lack of leadership by school officials, while others expressed sorrow at the loss of student lives and questioned whether the advantages they are bargaining for are really worth the price they have paid.

&lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, the Gecko-based open source browser, has now been downloaded over fifty million times from the official download sites and &lt;a href="w%3Amirror%20%28computing%29"&gt;mirror&lt;/a&gt;s.

The fifty millionth download itself came at 8:58am PST on April 29. The number excludes upgrades. A real time counter is available at http://www.spreadfirefox.com/fifty.html .

The browser was first released to the public as major release 1.0 on November 9, 2004. There have since been three minor security upgrades, with the current version being 1.0.3.

The browser can trace its roots back to the Netscape Navigator of the 1990s. Development of Firefox itself began in 2002, when Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross began writing the new browser using the codebase of the &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Suite"&gt;Mozilla Suite&lt;/a&gt; as their starting point, which itself was an open-sourced version of Netscape Navigator.

Originally named Phoenix, the browser was renamed Firebird and then Firefox due to a series of trademark issues.

<h1>Swiss finish drilling world's longest overland tunnel</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Swiss%20finish%20drilling%20world%27s%20longest%20overland%20tunnel&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Eleven years of drilling and blasting using a total 16 tons of explosives were completed Thursday when Swiss engineers detonated the last few yards of granite completing the 21 mile (35 km) Lötschberg tunnel in the Alps. The Lötschberg is now the longest overland tunnel in the world, and the third longest tunnel overall.

"With the breakthrough we have carved out the mountain for all to see. We are moving on," said Swiss Transport Minister Moritz Leuenberger at a ceremony marking the occasion, attended by about 1,000 people who witnessed the event in the midpoint of the tunnel, about 5,900 feet below the 12,170 foot &lt;a href="w%3ABernese%20Oberland"&gt;Balmhorn mountain&lt;/a&gt;.

The two halves of the tunnel met with almost perfect exactness. The centers of the bores coming from opposite directions were only about 5 inches apart, and the heights were aligned within less than 1 inch.

The new tunnel connects the Swiss district of Raron with the city of Frutigen, near the capital Bern. Construction on the railway within the new tunnel is expected to be completed by 2007, and should shorten travel time between &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and the Italian city of &lt;a href="w%3AMilan"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; by about an hour. The cost of building the tunnel, at US$13 billion (€10 billion) has already overrun budget by US$3 billion, and 11 people died during its construction.

The only two tunnels that are longer than Lötschberg are:
<ul>
BULLET::::- The &lt;a href="w%3ASeikan%20Tunnel"&gt;Seikan Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan's&lt;/a&gt; tunnel between the islands of &lt;a href="w%3AHonshu"&gt;Honshu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHokkaido"&gt;Hokkaido&lt;/a&gt; which passes part of the way underneath the seabed, and is the longest railway tunnel in the world at about 33 miles (54 km).
BULLET::::- The &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%20Tunnel"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, once nicknamed the "Chunnel", which is the second longest at 31 miles (50 km), extending from Kent, England under the English Channel to northern France.

</ul>
The Lötschberg tunnel is the longest tunnel that travels entirely over land, surpassing the previous record-holder, Japan's Hakkoda tunnel, which was completed only two months ago on February 27 at a length of 16 miles (26 km).

At least one future tunnel, &lt;a href="w%3AGotthard%20Base%20Tunnel"&gt;Gotthard Base Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, is planned to be the world's new longest tunnel at a length of 35 miles (57 km); it is also currently under construction in Switzerland, parallel to the Lötschberg with a planned completion date of 2012.

Swiss people make large numbers of train trips compared to other Europeans, with an average of 40 trips per person annually compared to 21 in Germany, 14 in France, and 8 in Italy. A major goal of the ongoing rail tunnel construction is to decrease travel times between popular destinations, with the state-owned Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) predicting a 20% increase in rail traffic by 2020. 

Also under consideration are improvement of the rapidly growing crowding of traffic (particularly heavy trucks carrying cargo) in the narrow Swiss highways, auto accidents, and pollution. Since 1980, Swiss highway traffic has increased tenfold, largely due to its geographical position along Europe's north-south axis.

<h1>Cyprus, Latvia and Malta are a step closer to adopting euro</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Cyprus%2C%20Latvia%20and%20Malta%20are%20a%20step%20closer%20to%20adopting%20euro&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Latvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Malta"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;, three states which joined the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in May 2004, exactly one year ago, today became members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AExchange%20Rate%20Mechanism%20II"&gt;Exchange Rate Mechanism II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ERM II), which pegs their currencies to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; within a 15% margin above or below a central rate. While they are in ERM II, their currencies must not fluctuate to an extent that exceeds this 15% margin, and they must also keep inflation and budget deficits in check. For countries to adopt the euro, they must stay in the ERM II for at least two years. Therefore, the earliest date that Cyprus, Latvia and Malta can adopt the common currency is in May 2007.

Cyprus, Latvia and Malta have joined four other countries already in ERM II: Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia. Denmark joined ERM II in 1999 but has since not wished to adopt the euro, while Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism in June 2004, and are expected to adopt the euro by late 2006 or early 2007. Other new European Union member states are also expected to join ERM II soon.

Out of the European Union of 25 member states, 12 countries currently use the euro, which they adopted in January 1, 2002. The only EU members that remain either outside the Eurozone or ERM II are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Sweden, Poland and the United Kingdom.

&lt;a href="w%3ASoap%20opera"&gt;Soap opera&lt;/a&gt; writer and creator &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20J.%20Bell"&gt;William J. Bell&lt;/a&gt;, best known for his record-setting 25-year-long tenure writing the top-rated ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Young%20and%20the%20Restless"&gt;The Young and the Restless&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, died Friday at the age of 78.

Bell was born on March 6, 1927 in Chicago, Illinois. He first helped fellow Chicago resident &lt;a href="w%3AIrna%20Phillips"&gt;Irna Phillips&lt;/a&gt;, the "Queen of the Soap Opera," write the soap opera ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAs%20the%20World%20Turns"&gt;As the World Turns&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in the late 1950s. The two forged a partnership which lasted for much of the following decade. Bell helped create ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAnother%20World%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Another World&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ with Phillips, and then wrote Phillips' creation ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADays%20of%20our%20Lives"&gt;Days of Our Lives&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ from 1966 to 1975.

The ratings for ♡❤Days of Our Lives♡❤ rose to near the top of the daytime rankings in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Bell then became a hot commodity, and scripted a soap pilot of his own. With the help of his wife, Chicago talk show host Lee Phillip Bell, he pitched ♡❤The Young and the Restless♡❤ to CBS executives, which agreed to air the show starting in 1973. Like ♡❤Days of Our Lives♡❤, ♡❤The Young and the Restless♡❤ focused primarily on young, beautiful characters, while still maintaining balance throughout the rest of the cast. Bell was the head writer of the series for a record amount of time, from 1973 until his retirement in 1998; no one person wrote a daily television series for such an uninterrupted period of time. In 1988, ♡❤The Young and the Restless♡❤ became the highest-rated soap opera on US television, an honor the show continues to hold today.

The Bell husband-and-wife team also created ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bold%20and%20the%20Beautiful"&gt;The Bold and the Beautiful&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a glamorous serial set around the fashion industry in Beverly Hills, in 1987. Bell won three Emmys for his writing on ♡❤The Young and the Restless♡❤, and one for ♡❤Days of Our Lives♡❤. Bell won five more Emmys for producing the latter serial.

At the time of his death, Bell was battling &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. He had three children, William Jr., Bradley, and &lt;a href="w%3ALauralee%20Bell"&gt;Lauralee&lt;/a&gt;; all three of his children had various jobs on his soaps. William Jr. is president of Bell-Phillip Television Productions, Inc., Bradley is the executive producer and head writer of ♡❤The Bold and the Beautiful♡❤, and Lauralee plays Christine Williams on ♡❤The Young and the Restless♡❤.

<h1>China introduces new jury trial system</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=China%20introduces%20new%20jury%20trial%20system&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (PRC) in recent years has begun an effort to reform its judicial system and make trials more fair and accountable, according to its state-run ♡❤People's Daily♡❤. Those efforts came to a head today with the official May 1 start of jury duty by more than 27,000 newly qualified jurors. According to ♡❤People's Daily♡❤, "It is the first time in Chinese history that the people's juries are appointed in a uniformed way by the people's congresses at all levels."

Two jurors and a judge will be sitting on each three-person panel, and decide both criminal and civil cases. The juries will be available when requested by litigants and also in cases "with considerable social repercussions", which appears to mean major cases. Appeals cases will be heard only by judges.

The jurors are not chosen for each trial but will serve a five-year term in the jury pool working on different cases from time to time.

Jurors have been provided for in the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese Constitution&lt;/a&gt; since 1954, but their role in the system was not well-defined by law until now.

The changes to the jury system are part of a long-term planned reform of China's judicial system that was announced in 1999 by China's top judge, Xiao Yang. In addition to jury reforms, the plan addressed trial procedures and court structure and supervision. The goal was to "perfect the socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics...in accordance with the Constitution and laws, and [without] judicial independence and supremacy, which exist in many Western countries," according to Xiao Yang as reported by the ♡❤People's Daily♡❤ in 1999.

"Court reform represents a major part of China's reform of the judicial system and political restructuring. The essence of judicial reform is judicial fairness, which is crucial to the country's rule of law," Xiao Yang said back then.

In August 2004, the 10th &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20People%27s%20Congress"&gt;National People's Congress&lt;/a&gt; (NPC) &lt;a href="w%3AStanding%20Committee%20of%20the%20National%20People%27s%20Congress"&gt;Standing Committee&lt;/a&gt; approved a "resolution on improving the people's jury system", which took effect today. The system specifies that either by recommendation of local work units or by self-application, potential jurors can take qualifying examinations and be presented to standing committees of the NPC for appointment as jurors. 

The first batch of 1,342 jurors were tested in Beijing under the new law on April 23, 2005. Those who were certified to begin service on May 1 are said to "participate in all hearing activities of people's courts according to the law, enjoying the same rights as do the judges except that for a presiding judge after their assumption of the post," according to the ♡❤People's Daily♡❤.

"This is an important move to upgrade and strengthen the system of people's jurors," Xiao Long of Beijing People's Court said to ♡❤China Daily♡❤ on April 24. "The implementation of the NPC's decision will add more transparency and justness to the country's judicial system," he added.

China has one of the world's largest prison systems with over 1 million prisoners, similar to &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. It has received criticism over the years from the U.S. State Department and others for its arbitrariness and its treatment of &lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20prisoner"&gt;political prisoners&lt;/a&gt;. The United States, however, is the world's largest jailer, with a staggering 2 million prison inmates, out of 9 million total around the entire globe. A full 70% of U.S. prison terms are drug-related.

&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Labor%20Day"&gt;International Labor Day&lt;/a&gt;, or May Day, has been marked by &lt;a href="w%3Aprotest"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly 12,000 protesters organized across the country, rallying against the dismantling of &lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20welfare"&gt;social welfare&lt;/a&gt;, as well as wage dumping and the large salaries of top company officials.

The protests were peaceful, although minor skirmishes did occur in &lt;a href="w%3AZurich"&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALucerne"&gt;Lucerne&lt;/a&gt;. These usually involved clashes between left and right extremists rather than with authorities. In one case, bottles and fireworks were used as weapons, but no injuries were reported.

Protesters in &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; demand reform regarding illegal immigration, and equality for men and women. In Zurich trade unions urged the free movement of people, as well as an ending to the pressure on salaries.

Vasco Pedrina, Co-president of the union &lt;a href="w%3AUnia"&gt;Unia&lt;/a&gt;, called the difference between high and low incomes a "existential and human tragedy". Pedrina and others, including &lt;a href="w%3ABern"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Amayor"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; Alexander Tschäppät, spoke out during the Saturday and Sunday period of protests.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; greeted Orthodox Christians with "Christ is risen." He called for unity amongst Christians in his first Sunday Regina Caeli message.

Provisional results indicate that Finance Minister Toke Talagi lost his seat by two votes, in the contest for the six common roll seats elected for the whole island, meanwhile former minister Robert Rex, Jr, came third in the poll for the village seat of Alofi South. Three of the twenty seats are expected to be won by women. Premier &lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Vivian"&gt;Young Vivian&lt;/a&gt; is expected to retain his position.

<h1>World's oldest seaborne passenger vessel on tour as floating library</h1>
♡❤♡May 2, 2005♡❤♡ 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACargo%20ship"&gt;Merchant Vessel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MV) &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMV%20Doulos"&gt;Doulos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , listed in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20Book%20of%20Records"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the world's oldest active ocean-going passenger ship, has docked in the port of &lt;a href="Muscat%2C%20Oman"&gt;Muscat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oman"&gt;Sultanate of Oman&lt;/a&gt; this week. The ship was built in 1914, two years after the &lt;a href="RMS%20Titanic"&gt;Titanic&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike the more famous luxury liner, Doulos has over 90 years of safe sailing to her credit. This "Grand Old Lady of the Sea" has undergone several periods of rebuilding and expansion throughout the 20th century and sailed under three different names, before being purchased by a &lt;a href="Christianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; missionary group, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Mobilisation"&gt;Operation Mobilisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (OM), in 1977 and converted for their use.

Doulos bills itself as "the world's largest floating book fair", and carries half a million books which represent about 6,000 distinct titles, which are donated and sold for modest fees to support the vessel's operation. The books represent Christian literature and educational material in various languages. Sailing from port to port throughout Asia and Africa, the crew of the Doulos sometimes finds itself faced with local restrictions against the sale of Christian literature, which it handles by separating the sacred books from the secular with a canvas divider, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEvangelicalism"&gt;evangelizing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the guards who are sent to control access to the banned books.

Most places visited by the Doulos and its sister ship &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALogos%20II"&gt;Logos II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (which travels North and South America) receive them with an enthusiastic welcome. "Most places we visit don't have Borders or Barnes and Noble," said Lane Powell, publications editor for OM. "In other countries literature is more highly valued and this can be the biggest thing in town," Powell continued in his interview with ASSIST News Service. "People line up one to two miles in some parts of the world. We have 6,000 people coming on the Logos II in one day."

The OM website claims that, since 1970, the two ships have together reached 30 million people in 140 countries, in 435 ports around the world. The crews themselves are also quite international in character, with volunteers from 50 different countries. Powell gives credit to their shared Christian background for their ability to get along with each other despite their differences. The names of their ships also have Christian meaning: ♡❤doulos♡❤ means "servant" and ♡❤logos♡❤ means "word", as in holy scripture.

The ship recently sailed to &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; before coming to the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Oman"&gt;Gulf of Oman&lt;/a&gt;, and docking in its Sultan Qaboos port, where it was received in style by the Tourism Minister Rajiha bint Abdulameer bin Ali, one of three female ministers in the cabinet. Oman is the only country in the Gulf to have its own tourism ministry, created last year to encourage visitors to come partake in Omani life and culture.

Said bin Ali to the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Times%20%28Pakistan%29"&gt;Daily Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, "We are absolutely delighted to have a roving library second to none, busy inculcating reading habits among people at a time when it matters most."

Also speaking to the ♡❤Daily Times♡❤, Murthadha Hassan Ali said, "The importance of such a visit can't be over-emphasised in days when reading habits are waning and people are swarming restaurants as if we were born only to eat... Book remains your best companion, TV or no TV." Ali described himself as a "compulsive book reader", and wants someday to start a public library in the capital city of Muscat, which currently has none.

The 425 foot long (130m) library will weigh anchor and continue its missionary journey starting May 9, with plans to sail to &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, on Africa's east coast.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The 22nd annual Mayfair took place in &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Square"&gt;Harvard Square&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 1. The event, which ran from 12-6 pm, featured work from local artists, performers, as well as a large cadre of tents selling beads, ceramics, and fried foods. After light rain in the early afternoon, the sun came out around 4 pm.

Local streets were closed to cars, and vendors and artists set up along the curbs. Church Street was blocked off and dedicated to chalk drawings, which were drawn by professional artists and amateurs alike. One of the largest drawings was a reproduction of &lt;a href="w%3AHokusai"&gt;Hokusai's&lt;/a&gt; "In The Hollow of a Wave off the Coast at Kanagawa," known colloquially as "The Wave."

The Alice Hoffman Breast Cancer Center and Locks of Love held a "charity shave," in which members of the public were encouraged to donate to the charity. Upon donating they would have their heads shaved, or at least 10" of their hair trimmed "in support of those who lose their hair to chemotherapy."

Several bands played in succession on a stage set up in front of the offices of &lt;a href="w%3ADewey%2C%20Cheetham%2C%20and%20Howe"&gt;Dewey, Cheetham, and Howe&lt;/a&gt;. Performers included Toussaint and the China Band, as well as The Walkmen.

Self-described "voice collector" Halsey Burgund brought his portable recording studio and successfully recorded samples from many passersby. At one point, his small box was packed with five youths who wanted to record a collaborative performance. Not everyone was interested in Burgund's box, though. "I don't want to give my name and some crap out," said one youth, pictured at right, who preferred not to give his name.

&lt;a href="w%3ABaseball"&gt;Baseball&lt;/a&gt; commissioner &lt;a href="w%3ABud%20Selig"&gt;Allan H. "Bud" Selig&lt;/a&gt; has proposed a new &lt;a href="w%3AAnabolic%20steroid"&gt;steroids use&lt;/a&gt; policy for the game. The plan calls for a 50-game suspension of a player testing positive for the first time, a 100-game ban for a second offense, and on a third violation the player is out with a lifetime ban from the game.

In an April 25th letter written to Don Fehr (Executive Director of the Players Association) and all major league team owners, Selig wrote, "Steroid users cheat the game." So far this season, four less-than-big-name major league players have been suspended. Under the current policy, each player is forced to sit out 10 games.

The ball is now thrown to Fehr, who said over the weekend the union was not ready to discuss it. An answer from the players union will probably be forthcoming some time this week.

Congressional hearings on steroids in baseball were held March 17. Rep. &lt;a href="w%3A%20Henry%20Waxman"&gt;Henry Waxman&lt;/a&gt; (D-Calif.), the ranking minority member of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20U.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20Government%20Reform"&gt;House Government Reform Committee&lt;/a&gt;, said, "It's weaker than the policy Congress is considering, but significantly stronger than baseball's current policy."

Testifying at the hearings, Fehr said, “My personal view, this is not an institutional view I'm expressing now, my personal view is that our job with violations of substance abuse is not to destroy careers. Our job is to stop it."

Selig also wants to add amphetamines list of banned substances in the major leagues.

The animated series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20Guy"&gt;Family Guy&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ returned to the &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20Television%20Network"&gt;FOX&lt;/a&gt; television network with a new episode Sunday for the first time since it was taken off the schedule three years ago. Although the show kept most of its audience that lead-in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Simpsons"&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ gave, FOX was still fourth out of five major broadcast networks in the half-hour, losing most notably to &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s hit ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADesperate%20Housewives"&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (&lt;a href="w%3AUPN"&gt;UPN&lt;/a&gt;, the other major American broadcast network, does not air original programming on Sundays).

However, the season premiere of ♡❤Family Guy♡❤ and the series debut of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Dad"&gt;American Dad&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (which helped usher in what the network termed "The New FOX Sunday") helped bring FOX to the #2 spot out of five networks in the crucial 18 to 49 demographic, one of the most important to advertisers in the key May &lt;a href="w%3Asweeps"&gt;sweeps&lt;/a&gt; period. "Sweeps" occurs four times a year and helps networks and independent affiliates determine how much a fixed amount of time for commercial advertisement will cost (the higher the ratings, the more revenue for the networks selling the time to advertisers).

On the whole, ♡❤Family Guy♡❤ averaged a 6.3 rating in the overnights as posted by Zap2It. While the overnight ratings are fairly accurate, the numbers are preliminary and are subject to minor change. One ratings point is equal to 1,096,000 households, as there are now 109,600,000 households in the United States with at least one television. This translates into a little more than 6.9 million households whose sets were tuned into ♡❤Family Guy♡❤, as recorded by the sample of "Nielsen families," who record their viewing habits and contribute to the ratings process the US uses. The use of the word "share" in the article means that it is the rough percentage of viewers with their sets on at that hour tuning into a certain program. For example, nine percent of viewers in the United States with their televisions on at 9 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time were tuned to ♡❤Family Guy♡❤.

This only added up to a 9 household share for the hour, compared to an 11 share for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20%26amp%3B%20Order%3A%20Criminal%20Intent"&gt;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, a 14 share for a &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHallmark%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Hallmark Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ movie of the week (traditionally only aired during the key sweeps periods), and a 23 share for the aforementioned ♡❤Desperate Housewives♡❤. Averaged with the performance of ♡❤American Dad♡❤, a cartoon produced by ♡❤Family Guy♡❤ creator &lt;a href="w%3ASeth%20MacFarlane"&gt;Seth MacFarlane&lt;/a&gt;, FOX earned a mere 5.8 rating/9 share for the hour.

The episode revolved around a big scheme &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Griffin"&gt;Peter Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, the main character of the series, conjured. To give his wife &lt;a href="w%3ALois%20Griffin"&gt;Lois&lt;/a&gt; (who no longer finds him sexually attractive) a second honeymoon in order to "spice up" their love life, he pretends to be actor &lt;a href="w%3AMel%20Gibson"&gt;Mel Gibson&lt;/a&gt; so they can stay in a new luxury hotel for free. Peter stumbles upon a sequel to the film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Passion%20of%20the%20Christ"&gt;The Passion of the Christ&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and vows to keep the movie from ever seeing the light of day. To get the movie back, Gibson kidnaps Lois and keeps her captive on top of &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Rushmore"&gt;Mount Rushmore&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to a scene in which the three battle on top of the monument, in a homage to the film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20by%20Northwest"&gt;North by Northwest&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The last British &lt;a href="w%3ASkylark%20%28rocket%29"&gt;Skylark rocket&lt;/a&gt; has made its final flight.

The rocket flew from coastal Sweden at 6am UTC on Monday, carrying its ESA science package to an altitude of 250km.

The 13m tall rocket was developed in the UK and first flew in 1957 from Woomera range in Australia. It continued to be developed for another twenty years. The British government ended support for the project in 1979, leaving private companies to fly the remaining rockets. Enough rockets had been built to sustain a launch program until today.

A total of 441 flights have been made by the sub-orbital Skylark. The rocket is known as a 'sounding rocket', designed to explore the upper regions of Earth's atmosphere.

Despite what appears to be a large rise in profits, sales actually fell to 2.7bn Swiss francs &amp;mdash; a drop of 1.1 percent. The jump in net profits was largely due to a change in accountancy methods. Operating profits rose just 10% to 411m Swiss francs. This small rise in operating profits was largely due to a major price increase in mature markets such as the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, enabled by strong demand in the marketplace.

Holcim was founded in 1912 in Holderbank, Canton Aargau, Switzerland. Today it employs 46,000 people worldwide and produces over 145m tons of cement annually. It has has recently acquired British- based Aggregate Industries PLC, and gained a controlling interest in India's No. 2 cement player, Associated Cement Companies Ltd.

Holcim Ltd. is the world's second-largest cement maker, beaten in size only by &lt;a href="w%3ALafarge"&gt;Lafarge&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; giant which employs over 77,000 people and sold almost US$20bn worth of building materials last year.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=K%27nesset%20Member%20Natan%20Sharansky%20resigns%20from%20coalition%20government%20to%20protest%20planned%20Gaza%20withdrawal&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANatan%20Sharansky"&gt;Sharansky’s&lt;/a&gt; resignation as Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Jerusalem was accepted by Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; at Sunday’s cabinet meeting.

“I believe [the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; withdrawal] is a tragic plan that makes us pay an extremely high price for nothing, and also encourages terror,” Sharansky said. “The only aim of the current government is the implementation of the disengagement plan, and therefore it is wrong, even immoral, for me to remain a part of this government.”

Sharansky said that although he was always against what he calls the “so-called disengagement plan,” he decided to leave the government once the battle against the withdrawal was no longer able to be waged from within the government. “Our main battle now is public opinion, because the struggle in the government is finished,” he said.

Although he hopes to take the struggle to the people, the former minister hopes his move will pave the way for other politicians to follow their consciences. “I don’t know how effective my quitting will be,” Sharansky said, “but I hope it will encourage other politicians and ministers to at least vote according to what they believe and what they think.”

The former prisoner of &lt;a href="w%3AZion"&gt;Zion&lt;/a&gt; (who served time in a &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; prison for wanting to emigrate to &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;) says his main objection to the plan to withdraw from Gaza and northern &lt;a href="w%3ASamaria"&gt;Samaria&lt;/a&gt; is the fact that the withdrawal is not contingent on the creation of democracy within the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt;. “I have promoted the spread of democracy as the only answer for thirty years. And now, at the time when an American president declares these principles and promotes them, an Israeli PM comes along and does the exact opposite.”

Although he has in the past supported withdrawal from parts of the land of Israel, Sharansky says the current plan goes too far. “We cannot control another people and we will need serious compromise, but that compromise does not include giving another people the ability to destroy us... as if we run from Gaza, Gaza will not run after us.”

Sharansky, whose &lt;a href="w%3AYisrael%20Beytenu"&gt;Yisrael B’Aliyah&lt;/a&gt; party merged with the ruling &lt;a href="w%3ALikud"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt; party after last elections, has maintained good relations with Sharon. “I had many opportunities to present my point of view to the Prime Minister, both publicly and privately,” Sharansky said. “He believes the withdrawal will give us ten years free from world pressure during which to build the settlement blocs of &lt;a href="w%3AGush%20Etzion"&gt;Gush Etzion&lt;/a&gt;, Maaleh Adumim and &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%2C%20West%20Bank"&gt;Ariel&lt;/a&gt;. I told him we will not have ten years – we will not even have ten days free from pressure, because we are legitimizing one-sided withdrawals from Jewish areas – each withdrawal will only invite more pressure.”

“We are speaking about three generations of Jews that were sent on the important mission by the Israeli government and made an empty desert into a blossoming garden. Now we will just destroy all these beautiful communities, with their unique agriculture and incredible Judaism - for what?” Sharansky asks.

“For nothing,” he added, “as a reward for terrorism.”

Josephine Harrison, the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; candidate for both the &lt;a href="w%3AStaffordshire%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Staffordshire South&lt;/a&gt; parliamentary constituency in the &lt;a href="UK%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;UK general election, 2005&lt;/a&gt; and the Kinver seat in the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Staffordshire"&gt;South Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADistricts%20of%20England"&gt;local government district&lt;/a&gt; election, has died of an illness. 

Because the death occurred after the close of nominations, and because postal voting has already commenced, the returning officer is required to declare that the polls for the Staffordshire South parliamentary seat and for the Kinver local council seat be abandoned. Fresh General Election and local council election polls, under the same writs of election, will now take place 28 days after the returning officer has seen proof of the death of the candidate. Under election rules, the existing nominees are entitled to remain nominated, although other, new, candidates may be nominated.

Other local council elections in Staffordshire South apart from Kinver, scheduled for Thursday May 5, 2005, are unaffected and will occur as scheduled.

<h1>Chili Finger Incident</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Chili%20Finger%20Incident&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt; 
On Thursday the 22nd of March, 2005, Anna Ayala, a woman from , claimed to have found a human finger in her bowl of &lt;a href="w%3Achili%20%28food%29"&gt;chili&lt;/a&gt; at a Wendy's restaurant located at &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D1405%2BMonterey%2BHwy%2BSan%2BJose%2C%2BCA%2B95110-3618%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.005289%2C0.007693%26amp%3Bt%3Dk%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;1405 Monterey Highway&lt;/a&gt;, just south of downtown &lt;a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, owned by Fresno-based &lt;a href="w%3AJern%20Management"&gt;Jern Management&lt;/a&gt;.. The finger, which probably belonged to a woman as it had a long and manicured fingernail, did not belong to any of the restaurant employees. The food supplies were seized by officials to be traced back to its manufacturers, while the restaurant was permitted to open again later with chili prepared from fresh ingredients.

<h3>Aftermath</h3>
Wikinews reporter drove his car up to the drive-thru menu and found that chili was still on the menu, at a price of US$1.19 for a small serving. He also witnessed workers unloading supplies from a &lt;a href="w%3ASemi-trailer"&gt;semi-trailer truck&lt;/a&gt; in the restaurant's parking lot, and carting them into the back door of the establishment.

Initially, county health officials said Ayala was fine and the finger had been cooked, which would have killed any bacteriae in the finger. However, on March 27, officials admitted they were not so sure anymore. Tests were done on the finger to determine this. Dr. Martin Fenstersheib, Santa Clara County's &lt;a href="w%3Ahealth%20officer"&gt;health officer&lt;/a&gt;, said that even if the finger was still raw when Ayala bit into it, the risk was low that she would have become infected with anything. However, he advised that Ayala should undergo a series of precautionary follow-up tests.

Sales at Wendy's went down because of the incident. Wendy's International, Inc. (WEN) closed at US$39.43 on Thursday the 22nd, and as the stock exchange was closed for the Good Friday holiday, traders did not weigh in the stock until the next Monday.

By Tuesday the 5th of April, officials had still not succeeded in tracking down the owner of the finger. The fingerprint on the detached digit has been run through an FBI database as well as the local criminal database in Santa Clara County, but no matches were found. According to Rich Reneau, who was leading the investigation at the time, the fingerprint was marginal, and the likelihood of finding a match was slim.

Wendy's stock did not go down significantly and was trading at US$39.37 that morning.

<h3>Investigation centers on Ayala</h3>
The next day, on Wednesday the 6th, Las Vegas police searched the home of Anna Ayala. About a dozen officers conducted the search at Ayala's home at Maryland Parkway and Serene Street at about 4 p.m. local time (23:00 UTC), according to witnesses at the scene. Ayala and other residents were handcuffed and brought out of the house. Ayala said that her teenage daughter, Genesis Reyes, had torn shoulder ligaments as a result of the search. The Las Vegas Review-Journal ran a photo of Reyes wearing a sling in their Friday edition. In San Jose, police spokeswoman Gina Tepoorten confirmed to reporters that investigators had served the warrant in cooperation with Las Vegas police on Wednesday, but she refused to reveal specific details about the warrant. By that time, Wendy's was offering a US$50,000 reward for information leading to the source of the finger.

Research by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ uncovered Ayala's history of lawsuits. Ayala successfully won her suit for medical expenses against the national &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Pollo%20Loco"&gt;El Pollo Loco&lt;/a&gt; chicken-chain, a previous employer, after her daughter Genesis contracted salmonella poisoning, allegedly from eating at the restaurant. However, Ayala lost another suit against &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 claiming that a wheel fell off her car. She also started a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in 1998. A total of 13 lawsuits in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; had been filed. Ayala replied the focus should be on Wendy's, and not her record of law suits. Nick Muyo, a spokesman for the San Jose Police department, said not to expect new information in the case for at least a week.

<h3>Twists and turns</h3>
On Wednesday the 13th there was a potential new lead in the investigation. A spotted leopard had torn off part of a finger from an owner of exotic animals, Sandy Allman, in &lt;a href="w%3APahrump"&gt;Pahrump, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. The portion of Allman's torn off finger was approximately the same size - 1 1/2-inches long. Pahrump is approximately 45 miles away from Las Vegas. Carol Asvestas, who owns an exotic animal sanctuary, told the ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤ she witnessed the leopard tear off the finger. She reported the incident to a hotline run by Wendy's offering the US$50,000 reward. Cindy Carroccio told the ♡❤San Jose Mercury News♡❤ that the finger was not reattached, and that the clinic "gave it back to her (Allman) in a little bag of ice." On the same day the lead was announced, Ayala decided to drop her lawsuit against Wendy's, due to emotional stress.

However, when Allman's prints were sent to San Jose police, they didn't match. Two days later, on Friday the 15th, Wendy's doubled the reward to US$100,000. The company revealed that employees had passed polygraph tests. Wendy's continues to claim that there is no evidence that the finger ever entered their supply chain, pointing to a lack of any accidents among the workers at their suppliers. Wendy's tip line had received reports from across the United States, from "folks who either have lost a finger, or know somebody who lost a finger," San Jose police Sgt. Nick Muyo told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤.

<h3>Ayala arrested</h3>
On Thursday the 21st of April, Anna Ayala was arrested at or near her home in Las Vegas on Thursday evening, in connection with the case, shortly after Wendy's finished its own internal investigation. According to court documents, she has been charged with one count of attempted grand larceny related to the chili case, and one count of grand larceny in an unrelated real estate deal, and is being held without bail in Clark County, Nevada, pending extradition. A press conference by the San Jose Police and Wendy's was held on Friday, April 22, at 13:00 PDT. The charge related to the case states the finger could not have been prepared at Wendy's, where the chili is heated to 170 degrees for 3 hours. There is also an inconsistency in Ayala's account of finding the finger and claiming it caused her to vomit compared with police saying there was no vomit at the scene. The incident has caused Wendy's 2.5 million dollars worth of damages, which Ayala could be criminally responsible for. Until recently, the San Jose police had not accused Ayala of planting the finger herself.

The unrelated charge stems from an incident, also in San Jose, when Ayala allegedly received an $11,000 down payment on a mobile home she did not own.

Ayala was incarcerated at the Clark County Detention Center, awaiting a fugitive review hearing on Tuesday, April 26, 2005, at 7:30 a.m. local time. She was processed and given inmate ID 01964047. Her case number was 05F07229X. Ayala waived extradition at the hearing, and her attorney said they were ready to come to San Jose to defend against the charges.

<h3>Ayala transferred to San Jose</h3>
On Friday, May 6, 2005, Ayala was transported to San Jose, California. Ayala was booked into the main Santa Clara County jail, and is awaiting arraignment. Ayala will likely be arraigned on Monday or Tuesday at the Santa Clara County Superior Court, according to Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney David Boyd.

On September 9, 2005, Ayala plead guilty to conspiring to file a false claim and attempted grand theft, and will be sentenced on November 2, 2005. She faces up to ten years in prison, and her husband faces up to 13 years behind bars.

<h3>Finger's owner identified</h3>
Until the middle of May, the owner of the finger &lt;a href="Owner%20of%20Wendy%27s%20chili%20finger%20still%20not%20found"&gt;still had not been found&lt;/a&gt;. 

But on , &lt;a href="2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, police announced that they had identified the finger tip as belonging to an associate of Ayala's husband &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/05/13/wendys.finger.ap/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The associate had lost his finger tip in an industrial accident at an asphalt company&lt;a href="http%3A//www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/15/chili.finger.ap/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in December, 2004. Police had received the information from an undisclosed caller to Wendy's hot-line.

<h1>B.C. elections debate fiery but not conclusive</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 
In British Columbia, Canada, leadership debates during provincial elections can have a major effect. In 1991, a single sentence during the leadership debate catapulted the then-obscure B.C. Liberal party from no seats for more than a decade to official opposition with 17 seats. In the current election, three television stations plan to broadcast the event live.

Adriane Carr of the Greens, Carole James of the New Democratic Party (NDP) and Gordon Campbell of the B.C. Liberals left the campaign trail on Monday to prepare for the Leadership debate on Tuesday night. The contestants were heavily prepared, and came into the debate with talking points and notes carefully memorized and at the ready.

<h2>Before the debate</h2>

Prior to the debates, it was widely reported that Adriane Carr of the Green party had already won simply by being present. The Green party secured their position in the debate by having a candidate in every riding, 79 candidates in all. With a steadily increasing polling history in elections but no seats in the Legislative Assembly and a minimal campaign budget, the Green party can only benefit from the opportunity to become better known to the BC electorate.

The Green Party formed in British Columbia in 1983 as part of the international Green Party network. In the 2001 election, the party achieved 12.4% of the popular vote, but still failed to elect a single Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA).

Carole James is a newcomer in the leadership role of the NDP. She was elected in 2003 and aims to restore the party to power after they suffered an embarrassing defeat. In 2001, the NDP went from government to opposition with only two seats. A special election raised the expectation of change and voter dissatisfaction when the ruling Liberals were unable, despite high-profile campaigning, to prevent a demoralizing defeat in favour of the NDP candidate. This brought the party up to 3 MLAs. Pundit view of the debate was split on Carole James's best approach; an aggressive approach might win enough interest and respect to gain enough seats to form a government - or backfire and push disaffected voters toward both opponent's parties, while a firm but softer stance would suggest acceptance of the position as opposition with an expectation to pick up about 15 seats in the assembly.

The NDP is not the old guard of B.C. political parties, and only formed in 1961 though it traces its lineage back to 1933. It has led the province on multiple occasions in the 1970s and 1990s. However, a series of leadership scandals and the &lt;a href="w%3AFastCat%20Fiasco"&gt;FastCat Fiasco&lt;/a&gt; led to the crushing defeat at the hands of the B.C. Liberals in 2001.

Gordon Campbell, the Premier of British Columbia, has the most to lose in such an event and would likely have preferred not to attend at all. An experienced rhetorician with both long service in the Legislative Assembly and in politics in general, he also heads the party which revived itself from obscurity during just such a debate in 1991. Described as a small-c conservative in the nature of Margaret Thatcher, his party's dominance in the assembly did not allow him the confidence to actually present a budget the Liberals had been talking about, and making promises on, for months.

One of the oldest parties in the province, the B.C. Liberals are independent of the national Liberal party and its policies. They are a right-of-centre party, being socially moderate and fiscally conservative. The party was in decline for most of the last half of the past century. However, it made a remarkable recovery during the 1990s due to the dissolution of the Social Credit Party. It was greatly helped by its social conservatism and a series of leadership and financial scandals in the NDP. Capitalizing on a split in the ruling party, the Liberals took power in the 2001 election with 77 of 79 assembly seats.

<h2>Leadership debate, 3 May 2005</h2>

With tight moderation and a constrained debate format of questions and answers, rebuttals, and open floor debate, the entire event was surprisingly civil as each candidate tried to push the others into social gaffes. The candidates managed to stay on message throughout, though the discourse occasionally broke into the almost spontaneous and provided some of the liveliest discussion in what has begun to seem like a dull campaign, at least by B.C. standards.

Leading the way into the fray, Campbell pointed to the NDP for leaving the economy and infrastructure of the province in a shambles. "British Columbia became a have-not province," he repeated several times.

James hammered back, focusing on broken campaign promises and trust issues. When Campbell pointed to the successes of his party in office, she dismissed the claims. "We see Mr. Campbell taking credit for things that he had nothing to do with, high commodity prices and low interest rates."

In the enviable position of watching her opponents digging into each other and not sparing much effort on the Greens, Carr was free to criticize both parties. "The gap between the rich and the poor has grown to be the biggest in Canada and that's a shameful record," she said to Campbell. When James pointed to the privatisation of Healthcare under the Liberals, Carr cut her dead with "And who started the move to privatisation? It was the NDP who started that move."

The debate, broadcast live by three stations, did not have any clear winners or losers. Macleans magazine reported that Campbell survived being double-teamed by the other parties, yet he also seemed unable to meet James's challenges or respond to Carr's inquiries with direct answers.

<h1>Issues of World Press Freedom Day raised in U.N., Africa</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Issues%20of%20World%20Press%20Freedom%20Day%20raised%20in%20U.N.%2C%20Africa&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Press advocacy groups in Africa are beginning a new campaign to remove "insult laws" from the books that protect political figures from criticism. The laws, which are found to restrict freedom of expression to varying degrees of severity in 48 out of 53 African nations, result in the imprisonment of many political reporters for what they feel is necessary criticism of their governments.

The campaign was launched on Monday in &lt;a href="w%3ALusaka"&gt;Lusaka&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city of Zambia. The date was chosen so that the workshops would take place on &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Press%20Freedom%20Day"&gt;World Press Freedom Day&lt;/a&gt; (Tuesday, May 3). In the nation of Zambia, to take one example, a three-year jail sentence is prescribed for a journalist who defames or ridicules the President or any other prince.

The laws are supposed to exist to protect the dignity and reputation of public figures. However, according to some critics, they are used to attack journalists who make personal references to some politicians, and those who allege misconduct or corruption by high public officials, such as heads of state or parliamentarians.

"We want to create awareness of these laws and lobby for their repeal in Africa," said research manager Kandji Kaitira of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA). 

According to the Zimbabwe ♡❤Daily News♡❤, a number of African media groups are taking part in the effort, including World Press Freedom Committee, the Southern African National Editors' Forum, the Southern African Editors' Forum, the Southern African Journalists' Association, Journalistes en Danger (JED) of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Organisations of the Media in Central Africa, the Media Foundation for West Africa and Media Rights Agenda in Nigeria.

&lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; in Africa, and some countries in South America, have already removed such laws from the books. However, in at least one &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; country, &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, insulting a head of state remains a crime (see &lt;a href="w%3Afreedom%20of%20speech%23Poland"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt;), though the January 5 &lt;a href="2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; conviction of &lt;a href="w%3AJerzy%20Urban"&gt;Jerzy Urban&lt;/a&gt; for having insulted &lt;a href="w%3Apope%20John-Paul%20II"&gt;the pope&lt;/a&gt; could in principle be overturned by the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Court of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Negativism in coverage of Africa</h2>

Last month, the result of an unusual study by 11 former African presidents was announced in a &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; press conference. The former leaders stated that based on their review of certain American outlets for the past decade (1994-2004), coverage was found to be overwhelmingly negative, crisis-driven and dismissive of Africa's democratic progress. The result of this one-sidedness, they claim, actually becomes detrimental to further progress being made by Africa.

"Negative perceptions lead to negative outcomes &amp;mdash; lower levels of aid and lower investments," said &lt;a href="w%3AJoaquim%20Chissano"&gt;Joaquim Chissano&lt;/a&gt;, one-time president of &lt;a href="w%3AMozambique"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;, who helped put an end to decades of civil war in his country.

The period was chosen because of a trend they saw toward democracy and free markets during that period in diverse nations. Chissano said, "Coverage of Africa... is, at best, dismissive of the continent's progress and potential... At worst, coverage disregards recent trends towards democratisation, betraying an almost contemptuous lack of interest in the potential and progress being achieved on the continent," he said.

The ♡❤New York Times♡❤, ♡❤Washington Post♡❤, ♡❤Wall Street Journal♡❤, ♡❤USA Today♡❤ and ♡❤US News and World Report♡❤ were reviewed in the study.

<h2>Ten stories the world should hear more about</h2>

To focus media awareness on World Press Freedom Day, the U.N. Department of Public Information (DPI) launched a new initiative it calls "Ten Stories the World Should Hear More About". These are items that in the strongly expressed opinion of the U.N. spokesman, are critical issues which are not receiving adequate attention by the major media, compared to other stories which are focused on almost exclusively, such as Iraq.

Some of the stories concern ongoing conflicts and humanitarian crises to which the U.N. is responding, while others concern underreported good news. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Five: &lt;a href="w%3ATajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt;, rising from the ashes of civil war. Again, you know, we often complain that while the cliche is that 'no news is good news', when it comes to media and the U.N., 'good news is no news'. Well, the fact is, here is a good news story, formidable challenges in the aftermath of a deadly civil war, and yet a country that is persisting on the road to peace and recovery &amp;mdash; it hardly gets reported."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The spokesman concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Our staff and the public information staff of the various U.N. agencies are eager to work with you to raise the profile of these topics. We have summaries available of the story behind each of the ten issues on the list... All of them list contact points from whom you can seek further information. We've also posted links to more information sources on our website to help you if the list inspires you. And these are also links to the U.N. officers and agencies concerned with each issue. And if it piques your curiosity sufficiently, we're happy to help by arranging interviews. The staff of DPI and those of other U.N. offices are committed to working with you to help raise the world's awareness of these and other stories that we believe the world needs to know more about. I urge you to use the initiative as a resource, as you go about your tough job, the business of covering the news. After all you are one of the most, perhaps &amp;mdash; we think &amp;mdash; ♡❤the♡❤ most, important source of information about world events."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The stories are listed on the new &lt;a href="http%3A//www.un.org/events/tenstories/"&gt;Ten Stories&lt;/a&gt; space on the U.N. website.

<h1>New Mars Orbiter arrives for launch</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Mars%20Orbiter%20arrives%20for%20launch&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), the latest robotic spacecraft destined for Mars, arrived at &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt;'s Shuttle Landing Facility on April 30 aboard a &lt;a href="w%3AC-17"&gt;C-17&lt;/a&gt; cargo plane and was delivered to the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility to begin processing. Launching is scheduled for August 10, 2005.

With a mission time line through 2010, the MRO will conduct studies of the Martian atmosphere, surface and subsurface in far greater detail than previous missions. Possible landing sites for future &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; landings will be evaluated and the orbiter will also act as a high-data-rate communications relay for surface missions.

"Great work by a talented team has brought Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to this milestone in our progress toward a successful mission," said Jim Graf of NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (JPL) project manager for the mission.

Multiple mechanical assembly operations and electrical tests are scheduled to verify the craft's readiness for launch. A May test to verify communication abilities through NASA's Deep Space Network will be conducted and in June deployment of the high gain communications antenna will be tested. A deployment test is also scheduled for the Orbiter's large &lt;a href="w%3AISS%20Solar%20Arrays"&gt;solar arrays&lt;/a&gt;.

The MRO will be filled with &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrazine"&gt;hydrazine&lt;/a&gt; fuel in July for its "Mars orbit insertion burn" which reduces the craft's velocity and places it in orbit about the red planet. July 26 will see the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter installed in an &lt;a href="w%3AAtlas%20V%20rocket"&gt;Atlas V rocket&lt;/a&gt; fairing for final assembly with the rocket on July 29.

After the scheduled launch, the MRO will spend seven months cruising to Mars and another six months aerobraking after orbital insertion. A variety of scientific instruments on board will be used to search for geological evidence of past seas, ancient shorelines.
The craft was built near &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin%20Space%20Systems"&gt;Lockheed Martin Space Systems&lt;/a&gt; which also supplies the Atlas V launch vehicle.

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission is managed by JPL, a division of the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena&lt;/a&gt;, for the NASA Science Mission Directorate, Washington. Lockheed Martin Space Systems is the prime contractor for the project. International Launch Services, a Lockheed Martin joint venture, and Lockheed Martin Space Systems are providing launch services for the mission.

<h1>Finger found in frozen custard by North Carolina man</h1>

In an eerie echo of the &lt;a href="Wendy%27s"&gt;Wendy's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Chili%20Finger%20Incident"&gt;chili finger case&lt;/a&gt;, a man found a severed finger tip in his &lt;a href="w%3Afrozen%20custard"&gt;frozen custard&lt;/a&gt; on Monday in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike the Wendy's case, agriculture and labor officials have confirmed with Craig Thomas, the owner of &lt;a href="w%3AKohl%27s%20Frozen%20Custard"&gt;Kohl's Frozen Custard&lt;/a&gt;, that an employee had lost the finger tip while working with the custard dispensing machine at the location.

"I thought it was candy because they put candy in your ice cream ... to make it a treat," Clarence Stowers told ♡❤Wilmington WWAY TV♡❤. Stowers continued, "OK, well, I'll just put it in my mouth and get the ice cream off of it and see what it is."

The Kohl's Frozen Custard outlet is located on South College Road in &lt;a href="w%3AWilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Wilmington, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.

"We are still trying to ascertain what exactly happened," owner Thomas told ♡❤WRAL Raleigh-Durham♡❤. "But in the seconds that it took for the accident to happen, and for (the employee) to tell the manager that it happened, a pint was being scooped out," he said.

"I'm sick at my stomach, I just can't get that taste out of my mouth," Stowers told ♡❤WECT TV6♡❤ in Wilmington. Stowers is keeping the finger tip in his freezer and said he plans to hire a lawyer.

This is the second time that an employee has lost a finger tip at Kohl's Frozen Custard. Former employee William Franklin lost a finger tip last summer, but an investigation by the Department of Labor placed the blame on Franklin for that incident.

Kohl's Frozen Custard was permitted to re-open after state inspectors monitored the disassembly and sterilization of the custard dispensing machine.

<h1>Left-side driving part of a planned Findlay, Ohio interchange reconfiguration</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Left-side%20driving%20part%20of%20a%20planned%20Findlay%2C%20Ohio%20interchange%20reconfiguration&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20Department%20of%20Transportation"&gt;Ohio Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; (ODOT) has announced plans to rebuild the &lt;a href="w%3Ainterchange%20%28highway%29"&gt;interchange&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2075"&gt;Interstate 75&lt;/a&gt; (I-75) and &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Highway%20224"&gt;U.S. Highway 224&lt;/a&gt; (US 224) in northwestern &lt;a href="w%3AFindlay%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Findlay, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, signed as &lt;a href="w%3Aexit%20number"&gt;exit&lt;/a&gt; 159 on I-75. Plans for the interchange, a standard &lt;a href="w%3Adiamond%20interchange"&gt;diamond interchange&lt;/a&gt; that also carries &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State%20Highway%2015"&gt;State Highway 15&lt;/a&gt; on the west and south approaches, include reversing the flow of traffic on the bridge over I-75, in what is known as a "&lt;a href="w%3Adiverging%20diamond%20interchange"&gt;diverging diamond interchange&lt;/a&gt;".

Such an interchange does not exist in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;; ODOT based the plan on an interchange in &lt;a href="w%3AVersailles%2C%20France"&gt;Versailles, France&lt;/a&gt; of the same design, introduced to them by a report in a &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20magazine"&gt;trade magazine&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of the standard approach, widening the four-lane bridge to add turn lanes, traffic flow will be reversed between the two sets of ramps, with &lt;a href="w%3Atraffic%20signal"&gt;traffic signal&lt;/a&gt;s controlling the flow. The only conflicts will be between the two directions of US 224; all turns to and from the ramps will be free-flowing. Traffic will be guided by barriers and islands, preventing errors in movement. As it eliminates left turns across traffic, the accident rate at the interchange is expected to be cut in half. The plan will also be cheaper than a rebuild of the bridge, and will be able to carry more traffic.

Left-hand driving is very rare in the United States, but a few &lt;a href="w%3Afreeway"&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt;-to-freeway interchanges incorporate it. In those cases, rather than being traffic-light controlled, the crossings between opposite directions are separated by bridges. Another related case is the &lt;a href="w%3ASingle%20Point%20Urban%20Interchange"&gt;Single Point Urban Interchange&lt;/a&gt;, in which opposing streams of left-turning traffic pass each other on the left.

The bridge, built in 1956, currently carries about 20,000 vehicles per day. The land west of the interchange, across from downtown Findlay, is being rapidly developed, and plans for the area include a &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt;.

Mayor Tony Iriti of Findlay thinks "it's a great idea. It's amazing to me that this has never been done before. We'll be written up in all those magazines nobody wants to read." &lt;a href="w%3AHancock%20County%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Hancock County&lt;/a&gt; officials are similarly enthusiastic.

The decision on whether to build the interchange will not be made until late summer.

&lt;a href="w%3AHungary"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; chemicals company BorsodChem has said that it wants to extend its production capacity, and that it will make an offer for the acquisition of Oltchim, a &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; state-owned company based in &lt;a href="w%3ARamnicu%20Valcea"&gt;Râmnicu Vâlcea&lt;/a&gt;, which generated an income of over 400 million euro in 2004.

The executive director of BorsodChem, Laszlo Kovacs, said, "If the new Romanian government privatizes Oltchim in 2006 we will make a single offer bearing in mind the presence of the Romanian company on the Mediterranean states market."

Kovacs also said that BorsodChem would also be interested in other companies in the region, such as the &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; company Zachem, but said that they will not make an offer because the economic situation of that firm [Zachem] has not improved.

BorsodChem is one of the largest chemical companies in Hungary, with a net profit of 2 billion euro in the first quarter of 2005.

The &lt;a href="France"&gt;Franco&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; bank Dexia has stated that it intends to extend into &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , especially &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. Axel Miller, Dexia's operations director, said the bank is interested in taking over some banking units in these countries in order to develop its network.

Dexia already has a subsidiary in &lt;a href="Slovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;, which will be used as a base for further extension in the region. The Franco-Belgian bank has already organised a team of experts who work in Poland to submit a request for a banking license in Romania.

Bulgaria and Romania signed their Accession Treaties for the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in April 25, and are set to join the EU in January 1, 2007. This, along with economic factors, such as a more liberal fiscal policy in Romania, have given rise to a sharp increase in foreign investment in the past few years. Turkey, which is a European Union candidate country but which has not yet started accession negotiations, has recently opened up to foreign investment due to its stabilising economy and well as its large market.

Approximately 9,000 &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; miners will be made redundant in 2006, slightly more than the 7,000 which are expected to be laid off this year. This comes as part of a government program for 2005-2008 which seeks to maximise efficiency in Romania's &lt;a href="w%3Amining"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; industry, as well as reduce the number of mines and quarries in the country, while progressively bringing down the number of workers in this industry. As agreed with the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; as part of accession negotiations, Romania must cease to provide major state aid to mining companies after 2007, when the country will become a member of the EU. Until then, it must gradually reduce subsidies to state-owned mining companies, in order to comply with European Union competition law.

Romania's mining industry currently employs 47,000 people, quite significantly less than the 175,000 it employed in 1997, before restructuring took place. A major reform in the industry took place between 1997-2000. This time around, from 2004 onwards, restructuring is expected to be more gradual. Out of the workers who have been laid off from 1997 onwards, around 100,000 have accepted voluntary redundancy, while 8,000 have retired and 12,000 have found other jobs in the private sector. By 2010, the government expects that more than 340 mining units will be closed throughout the country.

A &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; student officer on mission in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Major Robertino Ciobanu, was wounded on Sunday by a bullet fired unintentionally by a colleague from the multinational force in the country. The injury took place in front of the Presidential Palace of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;.

The officer's colleague accidentally fired on him while unloading weapons, a standard procedure for military personnel when they are returning from patrol missions. Ciobanu was wounded in the leg, but after being treated at hospital, he was declared out of danger.

Major Ciobanu is currently involved in training new Iraqi security personnel. Romania has one of the largest contingents in Iraq, with 830 soldiers. At the end of March, three Romanian journalists were kidnapped in Iraq, with the kidnappers later demanding that Romania pull its troops out of the country or else the journalists would be killed.

Most &lt;a href="heroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; sold in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; comes from &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;'s poppies. This past week, the 2005 opium harvest was in full view and going full speed in Afghanistan. The cultivators gathering resin from the crop are operating even near the main road through Kandahar and the farmers are out gathering resin from opium poppies in full view.

Last year 80% of the world's &lt;a href="opium"&gt;opium&lt;/a&gt; came from Afghanistan and production is up over 239% since 2003, according to U.S. government estimates. Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of illegal drugs.

In 2002 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ads, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; sent out the message that "drugs fund terrorists". Doug Wankel, a former U.S. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADrug%20Enforcement%20Administration"&gt;Drug Enforcement Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (DEA) official, says the opium industry is "financing terrorism. It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."

"The Bush administration has decided not to destroy the opium crop in Afghanistan," stated a U.S. intelligence official returning from Afghanistan in relation to the 60% smaller 2002 crop. The source, who requested that he not be identified, noted "U.S. forces could destroy the crops using aerial spraying techniques, but no such actions are planned."

U.S. plans to spray the crops were canceled at the request of Afghan President &lt;a href="Hamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt;, who has called for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ajihad"&gt;jihad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or "holy war", but is concerned that aerial spraying could be harmful to the health of Afghan villagers. The U.S. claims that the spraying would be safe, but is granting Karzai's request.

Karzai has indicated that he may change his mind if other U.S. strategies fail to halt the opium. Congress budgeted $774 million for anti-drug operations in Afghanistan just this year.

<h4>Estimating the value of the crop</h4>

The &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; reports in ♡❤From Flowers to Heroin that♡❤ it takes 10&amp;nbsp;kg of opium to make 1&amp;nbsp;kg of 90% pure heroin. The CIA states that impurities are introduced into the processed heroin before it hits the street, making the purity of the end consumer product about 40%. That implies that 10&amp;nbsp;kg of opium makes about 2.25&amp;nbsp;kg of 40% pure heroin.

The Guardian reports that the 2002 opium harvest was 3400 metric tons. Using the conversion supplied by the CIA, 2002's 3400 opium harvest could be converted into 765 metric tons of heroin. According to the International Narcotics Control Board, the 2003 opium harvest was 3600 metric tons. Using the estimated 239% increase of the present harvast over 2003, it means that the 2005 harvest is about 8600 metric tons.

The 2002 street price of heroin in the UK was about 60 £ per GRAM, or (assuming the present 1.89 USD to 1 £ exchange) 113.40 USD per GRAM. As the supply goes up the price will come down some, so for this calculation only the 2002 figures will be used. If all the opium harvest is converted into heroin and all of it is sold at the UK street price, the total street value of the harvest is 86.7 billion USD. (765 metric tons x 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/metric ton x 1000 grams/kg x 113.4 USD/gram = about 86.7 billion USD.) To the extent the 2002 numbers are valid today, the street value of the 2005 harvest should be roughly twice the street value of the 2002 harvest, about 173 billion USD.

To put these numbers in perspective, the total market capitalization of Ford, General Motors and Daimler Chrysler combined is about 76 billion USD. The total market capitalization of Toyota and Honda combined is about 167 billion USD.

<h4>No Statement by the Financial Action Task Force</h4>

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was formed to promote harmonization of international antimoney laundering (AML) laws. Despite the fact that tens of billions of USDs are generated from the Afgan opium harvest alone, the FATF has not added Afghanistan to its blacklist of uncooperative nations. One has to wonder, therefore, what the poppy farmers are doing with their share of the money that escapes the notice of the banking system and the FATF.

The government may not have to enter a new election process as predicted earlier last week. Recently, Paul Martin, the current &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;Prime Minister of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, made a plea on national television that a re-election ought to be delayed until a report concerning use of government monies was produced and published.

Former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AYvon%20Neptune"&gt;Yvon Neptune&lt;/a&gt; has been weakened by a hunger strike and is believed to be in critical condition. He has refused medical care unless all charges against him have been dropped.

The secretary of the Dominican Armed Forces, Gen. Sigfrido Pared Perez, is reported by the Associated Press as saying Mr. Neptune would be flown to the Dominican Republic on Monday, and immediately to a hospital in Santo Domingo, the capital, but this plan was rejected by Mr. Neptune.

The former Prime Minister has been held for 10 months under house arrest without being charged with any crime. Lawyer Mario Joseph claims Haitian law requires that an accused be brought before a judge within 48 hours of arrest.

The Haitian interim government of Prime Minister Gerard Latortue accuse Mr. Neptune of coordinating the killing of Aristide supporters in St. Marc during the rebellion.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Alamos%2C%20NM"&gt;Los Alamos, NM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Raymond N. Rogers, retired chemist who pioneered in the use of thermal analysis to characterize explosives, died on March 8, 2005 at the age of 77 after a long illness. 

Rogers was born July 21, 1927 in Albuquerque NM, but his family soon moved to California to find work. When his father died in an industrial accident on young Rogers' thirteenth birthday, he and his mother were left in Bakersfield with no means of support in the depression years. Rogers took on a number of odd jobs to bring in money: playing the horn in a dance band, ushering at the local theater, and working in a print shop.

In 1945 he enlisted in the U.S Navy and served as a radar technician during World War II. Thanks to the GI bill, Rogers was able to complete his education at the University of Arizona, majoring in chemistry. Upon graduation in 1948 his first job was with the Arizona Agricultural Experimental Station. There he built a thermal analysis instrument to study soils, and this experience brought him to Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in late 1951.

At LANL Rogers became a group leader of an explosives research-and-development group and was elected Laboratory Fellow in 1981. He later worked for the International Technology division, retiring in 1988. He served on the Department of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board from 1987 until 1992 with the equivalent rank of Lt. General, receiving their Distinguished Service Award. He received other awards and recognitions from LANL and professional organizations. 

Although much of Rogers' research at LANL had military applications including the characterization of exotic explosives for munitions, he was always concerned with explosives safety and chemical hazards. One of his published research results has been incorporated into a standard method for the screening of reactive materials (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/DATABASE.CART/REDLINE_PAGES/E698.htm%3FL%2Bmystore%2Bslkt6842%2B1114991548"&gt;ASTM method E698&lt;/a&gt;). Today this method is used worldwide to obtain reaction rate constants for energetic materials, a necessary first step in avoiding thermal explosions.

Until he retired Rogers was an editor for the two scientific journals, Thermochimica Acta and the Journal of Energetic Materials, and throughout his career he participated in conferences and symposia related to his chosen field. His ground-breaking work in thermal analysis&amp;mdash;particularly &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimeter"&gt;differential scanning calorimetry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques for characterizing energetic materials with only a few milligrams of sample. A relevant list of Rogers' scientific publications can be found on the Web (&lt;a href="http%3A//home.att.net/~rnrogers/"&gt;Explosives Science&lt;/a&gt;).

Rogers was also an accomplished amateur archaeologist who did research on the chemistry of deposits and artifacts of interest in archaeology and geochronology. In 1978 he was invited to become Director of Chemical Research for the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP), whose primary goal was to determine the scientific properties of the image on the Shroud of Turin, and what might have caused it. The shroud was a linen fabric purported to be the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth. 

For many people the shroud study proved disappointing when the initial carbon dating results placed the production of the fabric at between 1260 and 1390 AD, indicating that the shroud was a fake. However, about a year before his death Rogers found evidence that challenged the carbon-14 dating results. Although weakened by illness, he performed forensic work (&lt;a href="http%3A//dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2004.09.029"&gt;Thermochimica Acta 425 (2005), 189-194 &lt;/a&gt;) revealing that the material used in the carbon dating was not sampled from the original fabric, but from a part of the shroud that had been rewoven in medieval times. Rogers' work also indicated that the original shroud was much older than the age determined through carbon-14 analysis; but the question remains open as to whether it was in fact the burial cloth of the historic Jesus.

After retiring from LANL Rogers continued to work on the Shroud project, and with his wife Joan he also found time to enjoy hiking in the great outdoors as well as to train dogs for search and rescue operations. He is survived by his wife Joan; daughter Amy Canzona and her husband Tony; step-daughters Dawn Janney and Lauren McGavran and her husband Harry; grandson Kenneth; great-grandson Mark; cousin Bob and other family members; many very special friends; and coonhound Clancy.

A shipment of humanitarian aid from the &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; government was delivered to &lt;a href="w%3ATbilisi"&gt;Tbilisi&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of flood ravaged &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; sent tents, clothes, food and generators for electricity. &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALatvia"&gt;Latvian&lt;/a&gt; aid is expected soon. 
In the eastern region of &lt;a href="w%3AKakheti"&gt;Kakheti&lt;/a&gt;, several villages of the &lt;a href="w%3ALagodekhi"&gt;Lagodekhi&lt;/a&gt; district were flooded after the Kabali river burst its bank Tuesday night. No casualties were reported.
Torrential rains lasting nearly a week combined with snow-melt to create in the worst floods in 20 years in the &lt;a href="w%3ACaucasus"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; republic. A third of the country is effected, mostly in the western portion, with damage reported to buildings, homes and many roads. Over 1000 people were forced to evacuate. 
Georgian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AZurab%20Nogaideli"&gt;Zurab Nogaideli&lt;/a&gt; called for an assessment of the flood and mudslide damages. Amendments to the 2005 budget are foreseen in the range of 20 million &lt;a href="w%3ALari%20%28Georgia%29"&gt;Lari&lt;/a&gt; to cover disaster relief efforts.

&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner%20Inc"&gt;Time Warner Inc&lt;/a&gt; announced that they are unable to locate a container holding 40 backup tapes. These tapes contain personal information on 600,000 current and former employees back to 1986. This information includes details on dependents and beneficiaries, in addition to Social Security numbers. Customers were not affected, Time Warner said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Secret%20Service"&gt;U.S. Secret Service&lt;/a&gt; is investigating and has not found any evidence that the tapes have been misused. This loss affects most of the 85,000 current employees. The tapes were lost by Iron Mountain Inc., a data storage company, which routinely handles off-site data storage for Time Warner and many other &lt;a href="w%3AFortune%20500%20companies"&gt;Fortune 500 companies&lt;/a&gt;. Time Warner has said that the tapes would require expensive equipment to read them, and that they were encrypted.

A major &lt;a href="w%3AGarda"&gt;Garda&lt;/a&gt; hunt has begun in the &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; Midlands for four armed robbers who held up a pub at gunpoint on Monday morning. The pub, ♡❤Paddy Ryans♡❤, is located in Horseleap, &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Westmeath"&gt;County Westmeath&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤Paddy Ryans♡❤, a family pub, was robbed by the four men at 2am on Monday morning as staff were cleaning up and preparing to close for the night. Early reports indicate that the raiders escaped in a dark saloon car and spoke with &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; accents.

Horseleap is a small village of a few hundred located about 20km south of &lt;a href="w%3AMullingar"&gt;Mullingar&lt;/a&gt;.

First-quarter net profit stood at 2.625bn Swiss francs (US$2.19bn; €1.7bn) up 15% from last year's 2.28bn Swiss francs. Assets under management grew to 2.36 trillion Swiss francs (US$1.97 trillion; €1.53 trillion); an increase of 21.2bn Swiss francs on last year.

Despite the solid performance, &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Financial%20Officer"&gt;CFO&lt;/a&gt; Clive Standish told the media "Clearly we have seen a slowing of the markets over the quarter, particularly in March... There is a perceptible slowdown in markets as we speak."
Reacting to the pessimism, UBS shares dropped 1.5%.

Qrio, a humanoid robot developed by &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; Intelligence Dynamics Laboratories, has been "attending" a nursery school in California since March. Qrio is taken to the school in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt; every day, and spends time playing with ten children under the age of two. A researcher is on-hand to observe and document the interactions that take place.

The children were apprehensive about the robot at first, but have grown to accept it, and will help it up when it falls. "The children think of Qrio as a feeble younger brother", according to researcher Fumihide Tanaka.

Sony's aim in this endeavor is to work on developing a robot that can "live in harmony with humans in the future". The data gathered thus far have helped the researchers gain a better understanding of how robots should act around humans, in particular that balancing timely responses and unexpected movements are of integral importance.

Belgrade Media Center, Independent Union of Journalists of Serbia and Independent Media Union "Independence" called all media to interrupt their program for five minutes at 11:55 to mark World Press Freedom Day. Most of the media also read an announcement requesting that the murderers of journalists in &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; are brought to justice. Four cases of murders of journalists still remain unresolved:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Dada Vujasinović, a "Duga" journalist was found dead in her apartment in &lt;a href="w%3ABelgrade"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; on April 8, 1994. Preliminary investigation characterized this case as suicide, but Vujasinović's family hired a group of forensics who found samples of blood of two different people on a chair where she was found. The District Court renewed the case in 1998, but results were never made public. The case was renewed again in 2002, with no results.
BULLET::::- Slavko Ćuruvija, the owner of "Dnevni telegraf" (The Daily Telegraph) and magazine "Evropljanin" (The European) was shot in front of his apartment in Belgrade on April 11, 1999, during the NATO bombing. Official investigation yielded no results. After the change of government in 2000, a document "Ćuran Dossier" appeared in public, revealing that Ćuruvija was followed by the State Security Agency.
BULLET::::- Milan Pantić, a journalist from &lt;a href="w%3AJagodina"&gt;Jagodina&lt;/a&gt;, was killed on March 7, 2005. The minister of police, Dragan Jočić, said that he was killed due to "circumstances" and that "there was no intent to kill him."
BULLET::::- Duško Jovanović, an editor of "Dan," (The Day) was killed in front of his office in Podgorica on May 28, 2004. A car from which he was shot was found later, but the identity of his murderers is still unknown.

</ul>
Serbian journalists also asked for the Radio Frequency Statute to take effect, as well as creating a government agency for telecommunication and abolishing jail sentences for &lt;a href="w%3Aslander"&gt;slander&lt;/a&gt;. 

Independent Union of Journalists of Montenegro asked for solidarity in the fight for media freedom. Representatives of journalist associations in &lt;a href="w%3AKosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; said that only certain journalists have freedom of expression, but that there is no mechanism to protect investigative reporting. Around one hundred journalists protested in front of the Kosovo Assembly building.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATurbolinux"&gt;Turbolinux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;, a variety of &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20software"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; software, has been chosen as the in-house server software for the front-end banking operations of China's largest bank, replacing &lt;a href="w%3ASCO%20OpenServer"&gt;SCO Unix&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AIndustrial%20and%20Commercial%20Bank%20of%20China"&gt;Industrial and Commercial Bank of China&lt;/a&gt; (ICBC) announced the migration on Thursday, April 28.

The announcement is significant in terms of the sheer size of the bank. "This is the biggest Linux implementation in China," said General Manager Claude Zhou of Turbolinux China. The ICBC serves more than 108 million customers and manages their combined assets of US$640 billion (5.3 trillion renminbi). Its 390,000 employees are scattered across 20,000 branch offices throughout China. The planned deployment will be undertaken in steps and is estimated to take three years. 

Zhou described the reasons for the planned migration as the stability and security of Linux. Nielse Jiang, an analyst at IDC, also attributed the switch to insufficient support by the SCO Group. "In China, SCO Unix offers very weak support for customers; they have so few employees," Jiang said.

ICBC selected Turbolinux over its various competitors, including Microsoft Corporation, in part because of its need to maintain its custom-written Unix-based software. The increasing scalability and stability of Linux also were factors in the decision.

Turbolinux has been China's number one source of Linux for the past 4 years. In 2004, Turbolinux held 62.0% of the Chinese server market, and also had 24.9% desktop market share, a much larger portion of desktop share than GNU/Linux holds in the United States.

Turbolinux is an Asian-Pacific distribution of Linux with its corporate headquarters located in Tokyo, Japan, and offices in China and the United States. Turbolinux claims that its "Turbolinux 7 Server was the first-ever to conform to Internationalization standards to help simplify development of applications that require multiple language support — a critical requirement for software distributed globally," and supports the use of its software in the Japanese and Chinese languages.

Turbolinux was also used as the operating system of choice for China's recent supercomputer, the Dawning 4000A. With its unveiling on November 15, 2004, China became the third country, after the U.S. and Japan, to surpass the 10 teraflops level of performance in a single machine. The computer, located in Shanghai Supercomputing Center, contains 2,560 64-bit Opteron processors from AMD, each running at 2.2 GHz, and at its introduction was the 10th fastest computer in the world.

Turbolinux is being spread throughout China, both throughout government and the business sector, in key areas such as transportation and telecommunications. In December 2004, &lt;a href="w%3AZTE"&gt;ZTE Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, the largest telecommunications manufacturer in China, partnered with &lt;a href="w%3AHewlett-Packard"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt; and Turbolinux to bring the benefits of GNU/Linux software to that industry.

The other three largest banks in China have either already announced plans for major migrations to GNU/Linux servers running various distributions, or are expected to do so later this year.

&lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;'s presidential advisor for foreign policy, Andrei Pleşu, resigned yesterday from his position. The resignation was signed by President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20B%C4%83sescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with the 56-year-old Pleşu saying that he is withdrawing from his position due to health problems. A press release by the presidency said that, until a new advisor is named, Anca Ilinoiu will act in the position of Pleşu.

Andrei Pleşu became the presidential advisor when Băsescu was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20presidential%20elections%2C%202004"&gt;elected as the president of Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in December 2004. The advisor had been complaining about his health problems for a while, but was asked by Băsescu to remain in office until a replacement can be found.

A &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n media workers' union has asked the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i ambassador in &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, Adel Murad Ali Murad, to help with the safe release of the three Romanian journalists kidnapped in Iraq in late March. The journalists wrote to the ambassador saying, "We are convinced that the authorities in your country [Iraq] are doing everything possible to resolve the situation. Yet we are obliged to transmit our desire and hopes that efforts will be intensified."

The fate of the journalists in the past few days has been quite underreported in the Romanian media, as the deadline for their killing has passed yet President &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; said this Monday that he knows "for certain" the three are alive. The terrorists which kidnapped them aired a tape on Al-Jazeera, on April 23, that they would kill the journalists by April 27 if Romania does not withdraw its 860 troops from Iraq. Romania declined to withdraw the troops, and it seems the terrorists did not enforce their deadline.

Meanwhile, Romanian authorities have been trying to secure the release of the journalists. Foreign Minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu visited Damascus, Syria, last week, where he discussed the situation.

Many Romanian media workers remembered the fate of the three journalists as part of &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Press%20Freedom%20Day"&gt;World Press Freedom Day&lt;/a&gt;, which occurred yesterday.

A new, refurbished cafeteria at the Romanian &lt;a href="w%3APalace%20of%20the%20Parliament"&gt;Palace of the Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; has opened for the use of parliamentarians. The new cafeteria, which has mahogany furniture and leather draped armchairs, was officially opened yesterday, and is situated at the entrance to the Senate headquarters in the Palace of the Parliament.

Members of Parliament said they were not satisfied with the former cafeteria in the Palace, saying that it didn't have proper tables and chairs to sit on. Many parliamentarians expressed their satisfaction at the opening of the refurbished dining venue, saying that they can now drink a cup of coffee "in a civilised manner" before sessions.

Bucharest's &lt;a href="w%3APalace%20of%20the%20Parliament"&gt;Palace of the Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Palatul Parlamentului♡❤ in Romanian) is the largest building in Europe and the third largest building in the world, with an area of approximately 350,000 m². It contains both houses of the Romanian Parliament (the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate), as well as the National Museum of Contemporary Art (MNAC). It is also frequently used as a function centre.

Constanţa Shipyard (SNC) registered total revenues of &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;&amp;euro;&lt;/a&gt;38.4 million in 2004, 63.5% higher than in 2003. The shipyard also had a net profit of €1.7 million, which was assigned to reserves linked to fiscal facilities, as well as to the coverage of the previous years' losses and the legal reserve.

Constanţa Shipyard, located in the Romanian port of &lt;a href="w%3AConstanta"&gt;Constanţa&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast, is the largest shipyard in Romania. The shipyard was privatised in April 2002, when Resource International, a company based in the Marshall Islands, bought stocks in it worth US$17.4 million, from the Romanian government. The other shareholders in the company are Histria Shipmanagement SRL (Constanţa), Technical Shiprepairs and Maintenance SRL (Constanţa).

Horia Teodorescu, a student in 10th grade at Costache Negruzzi College in &lt;a href="w%3AIasi"&gt;Iaşi&lt;/a&gt;, northeastern &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, won the annual worldwide &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; Space Settlement Design Contest. The contest is sponsored by the Fundamental Space Biology Program of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' space agency, NASA. The task of the contest is for students to develop designs for a permanent orbital space colony. For his design, Teodorescu was awarded a visit to a NASA base in the USA.

Concerning the contest, Teodorescu said, "I designed a space colony which is called 'Temis', a personification of the Greek goddess of wisdom. The project is made up of four parts." He said that the development of the space colony in his design has two phases - "Firstly, there is the construction period, in which the Moon is used as a base for extracting and processing materials. This would last about one year. After that, there would be a period of 4-5 years, in which the population of the colony would reach 10,000." In 15 years, Teodorescu projects in his design that the population would reach 100,000, and reach the stage where the colony would be able to sustain itself and to start developing its own economic, social and educational systems.

During the design's conception, Teodorescu was aided by his teachers, Adrian Koriloff, Margareta Constantinescu, Nicolae Hirtan and Lucia Miron, as well as his father Horia Neculai Teodorescu, who is a professor at the Iaşi University. Teodorescu also participated in the same contest in 2004, where he received second place. The first prize was also obtained by Romanians, more precisely a group of students from &lt;a href="w%3AConstanta"&gt;Constanţa&lt;/a&gt;.

The Costache Negruzzi College, founded in 1895, is, with over 1500 students, the largest secondary education facility in Iaşi, a city of 320,000 people.

Circulation figures dropped an average 1.9% among 814 U.S. newspapers according to research by the ♡❤Newspaper Association of America♡❤ industry group. The drop, which continues a 20-year declining trend, is one of the worst 6 month slips since a 1984 circulation peak.

Factors such as cable TV and the Internet are named as challengers in the competition for reader attention. Also contributing are scandal-driven changes in the way circulation is calculated. Concerns over the credibility of circulation figures given by some newspapers have gripped the industry and caused 3 of the top-twenty papers to have their figures excluded from the report [see below]. A paper’s circulation is the key figure looked at by advertisers when making spending decisions.

Posting slight increases were two rare circulation gainers ♡❤&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="The%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Many papers said drops were partly due to intentional distribution cuts, such as to hotels and schools for example. Another cause was that circulation drives were less successful due to the US National &lt;a href="w%3A%20National%20Do%20Not%20Call%20Registry"&gt;do-not-call registry&lt;/a&gt; hampering telemarketer ability to contact potential subscribers.

&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; Information Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASheikh%20Rashid%20Ahmed"&gt;Sheikh Rashid Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced Wednesday the capture of Abu Faraj al-Libbi, and five other suspected &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; militants, after a gun battle in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWaziristan"&gt;Waziristan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Monday. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was wanted in connection with two attempts to assassinate Pakistan's President, &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, one on December 25, 2004.

Security officials said the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALibya"&gt;Libyan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; born al-Libbi was thought to be a top general for al-Qaeda leader &lt;a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; and acted as an operational commander in Pakistan. Ahmed told AP, "This arrest gives us a lot of tips, and I can only say that our security agencies are on the right track."

Ahmed, who called the capture "a very important day for us", said they are receiving more and more tips and are on the right track towards the eventual capture of bin Laden. Pakistan has put more pressure on its northwest region with a months-long build-up there. The region is believed by many to be where al-Qaeda members are holding out after they were pushed from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said of the capture: "I applaud the Pakistani government for its strong coöperation in the war on terror."

Musharraf has been a key ally in the US-led war on terrorism, and because of that also an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; militant target. A BBC security correspondent said this is the biggest arrest since that of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed"&gt;Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the alleged mastermind of the 2003 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A9/11"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; attack. 

Although al-Libbi is not on the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists, Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao stated that the United States had been offering a bounty of $10 million for information leading to al-Libbi's arrest. He refused to speculate upon whether the arrest would aid in the capture of bin Laden, saying that "We have no information" about the al Qaeda leaders, and "It's premature to say [whether this arrest will help in tracking them], but definitely interrogation is going to take place."

Sherpao also said that it was too early to say whether al-Libbi and Mohammed would be taken to the United States, or remain in undisclosed locations with other al-Qaeda detainees. He stressed that there were the attempted assassination cases pending against al-Libbi in Pakistan.

The United States is not the only country which lays claim to al-Libbi. He is wanted by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALibya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where he has been sentenced to death (and whence he escaped in the 1980s), for assassination attempts on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMuammar%20al-Qaddafi"&gt;Colonel Qaddafi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He is also wanted by Afghanistan.

Astronomers at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Hawaii"&gt;University of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInstitute%20for%20Astronomy"&gt;Institute for Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today announced their discovery of twelve further moons of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaturn%20%28planet%29"&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , bringing the total number of moons discovered so far to 46. The initial discovery of the satellites was on December 12, 2004, and was made using the 8.2 metre &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASubaru%20%28telescope%29"&gt;Subaru telescope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMauna%20Kea%20Observatory"&gt;Mauna Kea Observatory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Confirmational observations were then conducted throughout January, February, and March from the Subaru telescope and from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGemini%20Observatory"&gt;Gemini North&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; telescope.

Similar teams at the university led by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20C.%20Jewitt"&gt;David Jewitt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; discovered 11 moons of &lt;a href="Jupiter%20%28planet%29"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, and a further 11 in 2002, before turning their attentions to Saturn.

11 of the newly discovered moons are in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aretrograde%20orbit"&gt;retrograde orbits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , leading astronomers to hypothesize that they were originally asteroids, attracted out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter's gravity and then captured by Saturn. All of the moons are in inclined elliptical orbits, that range from 16 million to 22 million kilometres in distance from Saturn. As a point of reference, Earth's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amoon"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is an average of 384,403 kilometres from the Earth. The new moons of Saturn are provisionally named S/2004 S07 through to S/2004 S18.

Tito, the lifelong president of Yugoslavia from 1953, died on May 4, 1980 and was buried in the "House of Flowers" in Belgrade.

&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20Two"&gt;World War Two&lt;/a&gt; veterans, as well as youngsters, carrying Yugoslavian flags, laid down flowers on Tito's grave.

Two Macedonians, a 59-year-old Stojanche Kostovski and a 21-year-old Goce Velkovski, marched from &lt;a href="w%3ASkoplje"&gt;Skoplje&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMacedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; to Belgrade, Serbia to visit Tito's grave, covering around 463 km in 13 days.

B92 quoted one of the visitors, Miloica Ružić, as saying "While Tito was alive I had no democracy, but I had money and a passport. Now I have democracy, but also an empty stomach."

A visitor from Vrbas said "Many go to monasteries and churches, but I came here to find peace."

NGO "General Consulate of SFRY", from &lt;a href="w%3ATivat"&gt;Tivat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMontenegro"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, published an obituary in major Montenegran daily newspapers, containing Tito's photography and the text: "Quarter of a century without you - a whole century backwards."

Former &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20energy"&gt;nuclear energy&lt;/a&gt; minister &lt;a href="w%3AYevgeny%20Adamov"&gt;Yevgeny Adamov&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on Monday by authorities. The arrest came at the request of officials who claim he stole more than nine million dollars allocated by &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; to help improve Russian nuclear safety.

The Ministry of Justice in Switzerland said Adamov will be extradited to the US. The warrant allowing this states that he is charged with diverting money from the U.S. Department of Energy to several companies he controls.

Adamov's lead lawyer said he will fight the extradition warrant and called the accusations "baseless". Adamov, who has on a number of occasions been investigated for his financial dealing by the U.S. and Russia alike, said he was being punished for his help in building a nuclear plant in &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

The U.S. now has 60 days to present a formal request, after which a Swiss court will make a ruling. Swiss officials said it is common for this process to take several months.

Adamov's U.S. lawyer, Larry Breur, said Adamov admitted to depositing the money into a personal account, but then he used that account to dispense the money to Russian agencies and nuclear scientists. Breur said the process was common in Russia to avoid hypertaxation.

Yevgeny Adamov was a minister in &lt;a href="Boris%20Yeltsin"&gt;Boris Yeltsin&lt;/a&gt;'s government, but was removed from power by &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to remove corruption. Adamov was in &lt;a href="w%3ABern"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt; attempting to unblock bank accounts belonging to his daughter.

After an away victory of 1:3 over Vojvodina, Partizan increased its advantage over second place Red Star by 7 points in the First Federal League. Red Star shared points with Smederevo by tieing 1:1 at home with the 12th place team.

Another surpise of the round was the easy victory of Obilić over Budućnost, with a score of 4:2 (3:1 at half time), which put Obilić into 13th place, and allowed Zemun to take over the 5th spot from Budućnost. Obilić now has a chance to finish in the top 12, which would secure their existence in the first league, as they are behind Hajduk, Borac and Smederevo by a goal difference only and have a deficit of one played game.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — After being postponed a week because of weather, on Saturday and Sunday, April 30 and May 1, &lt;a href="w%3AFaneuil%20Hall%20Marketplace"&gt;Faneuil Hall Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, Massachusetts, held public auditions for their 2005 performance slots. Thirty-two performance and musical acts got the coveted slots at one of the city's popular tourist destinations. Benefits of performing in the Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market area include exposure and tips from passersby.

Although the auditions were open to the public, few people seemed to find the location for the tryouts, since they were held on the second floor of Quincy Market because of the weather. Were it not raining, they would have been held outside.

Acts vying for performance slots included Dan Foley, who has juggled chairs at the marketplace for several seasons, jugglers, and a contortionist. Musicians included The Vegas Valentinos, a loud rock and roll act reminiscient of &lt;a href="w%3AElvis"&gt;Elvis&lt;/a&gt;; Apple Crisp, a father and son with a keyboard and a vibraphone; a few guitar/harmonica combinations; and Tom Bianchi, a familiar site among Boston street performers.

The emcee between musical acts tried to steal the show with bad jokes. Luckily, audience members steeled themselves and braved his jokes to listen to Toby Tobas' steel drums.

The judges selected performers earlier this week. Entertainment will begin on &lt;a href="w%3AMemorial%20Day"&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/a&gt; weekend.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Herald"&gt;Boston Herald&lt;/a&gt;, the selected acts are:

During the first meeting between new &lt;a href="w%3AEstonia"&gt;Estonian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAndrus%20Ansip"&gt;Andrus Ansip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMatti%20Vanhanen"&gt;Matti Vanhanen&lt;/a&gt; they praised the strong relations between their countries, and spoke on how to expand their cooperation.

One topic under discussion was a 2003 report written by two "wise men" (former Bank of Finland director Esko Ollila and Estonia’s current Minister of Defence Jaak Jõeruut), regarding closer cooperation. Within the report were 43 suggestions for closer dealings.

On the economic front, discussion occurred on the Finnish one year "interim" period limiting citizens of the new &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; countries access to Finnish labour markets. It is the opinion of Estonia that it goes against the principles of the EU.

In education and science, the Estonian PM commented that,"Experience that Estonians have picked up in Finland has been important. For instance, Finnish television taught Estonians about the market economy already in the Soviet period." Further cooperation between Finnish and Estonian universities for research was discussed.

Ansip made several comments regarding the recent &lt;a href="w%3AVictory%20Day"&gt;Victory Day&lt;/a&gt; celebrations in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. He commented that relations between Estonia and &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; should not be harmed by Estonian President &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20R%C3%BC%C3%BCtel"&gt;Arnold Rüütel&lt;/a&gt; not attending the celebrations. He also stated that "We are waiting for the invitation", to sign a border treaty with Russia.

The Tuesday drawing of the Italian Superenalotto game has awarded the biggest prize ever won in a betting game in &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. The single winner of the first category prize (6 numbers guessed) will receive an amount, including the jackpot from previous un-won draws, of &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;72.090.405,19 (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;93 million.) The prize money will be received in full without further taxation, since taxes in prizes of that type are taken at a fixed rate by the Italian State from the money paid for the bet.

The winning card was purchased in a café in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMilan"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;. The betting game, in some respects similar to &lt;a href="w%3APowerball"&gt;Powerball&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, but without the special number, requires guessing 6 numbers out of 90.

There is not a drawing for the Superenalotto itself. Numbers are taken from the drawing of another Italian lottery game called the national Lotto. If you guess all 6 numbers in Superenalotto, you win the highest prize.

One additional number is drawn from the Lotto drawing. If you have guessed 5 numbers of the normal Superenalotto 6, where the additional number is called the Jolly number or Joker number, you win a runner-up prize (somewhat less than the full 6 award). Called the 5+1 prize, it was just won in the previous drawing on April 30. There are minor prizes for 5, 4 or 3 numbers guessed, but only the full 6 and 5+1 prize have the jackpot mechanism.

In a football match played in Eindhoven, &lt;a href="w%3AA.C.%20Milan"&gt;A.C. Milan&lt;/a&gt; advanced to the UEFA Champions League finals on away goals against &lt;a href="w%3APSV%20Eindhoven"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt; with ♡❤♡3:1♡❤♡ in today's game (1:0 at half-time).

In 91' Ambrosini scored the winning goal for Milan. In the next minute, Cocu scored for the second time this evening, but it was not enough for overtime.

John Rudachyk told reporters he thought he was moments from death Sunday during an attack by a black bear but managed to crawl away to his car and drive home.

Mr. Rudachyk, 32, was reportedly searching for deer horns in the woods near his home in Norquay, &lt;a href="w%3ASaskatchewan"&gt;Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt; when he says the bear suddenly charged at him out of some thick brush, snorting and grunting. He managed to climb a nearby poplar tree but before getting too high, the bear reached him. Mr. Rudachyk recalls kicking the bear's nose which caused it to momentarily retreat but then attacked again grabbing his foot and flinging him into a spruce tree. Mr. Rudachyk said he then fell to the ground and was briefly knocked out. After regaining consciousness, despite a mangled foot, broken bones, and numerous cuts, he managed to crawl to his car some 700 metres away never daring to look back to see if the bear was still near. He told a CBC reporter, "I figured if he was going to come after me, I didn't want to know. I was that scared."

Mr. Rudachyk, now recovering in a &lt;a href="w%3ARegina%2C%20Saskatchewan"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt; hospital, said he does not know how he managed to survive the attack and drive himself home. "It was a pretty big bear. I thought I was dead. I thought that was the end of my life and all I could do was try to fight, stay alive or whatever."

On May 29, 2005, the final phase of reconstruction of the &lt;a href="w%3AConey%20Island-Stillwell%20Avenue%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20station%29"&gt;Stillwell Avenue Terminal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AConey%20Island"&gt;Coney Island&lt;/a&gt; will be completed, with the reopening of the &lt;a href="w%3ABMT%20Sea%20Beach%20Line"&gt;BMT Sea Beach Line&lt;/a&gt; to regular ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AN%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29"&gt;N&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ service. ♡❤♡N♡❤♡ service currently stops one station short of Coney Island, at &lt;a href="w%3AGravesend-86th%20Street%20%28BMT%20Sea%20Beach%20Line%20station%29"&gt;Gravesend-86th Street&lt;/a&gt;, and last reached Coney Island under regular service on November 4, 2001, though various General Orders caused by other closures have resulted in ♡❤♡N♡❤♡ trains running all the way.

The Sea Beach Line began in 1879 as the New York and Sea Beach Railway, a steam-powered railroad. It was bought by the &lt;a href="w%3ABrooklyn%20Rapid%20Transit%20Company"&gt;Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company&lt;/a&gt; in 1897 and soon fitted with &lt;a href="w%3Atrolley%20wire"&gt;trolley wire&lt;/a&gt;, with connections to &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; via various &lt;a href="w%3Aelevated%20railway"&gt;elevated railway&lt;/a&gt;s.

Reconstruction into a four-track depressed line was finished in 1915, and &lt;a href="w%3Asubway"&gt;subway&lt;/a&gt; trains running to &lt;a href="w%3AMidtown%20Manhattan"&gt;Midtown Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; started using the line. The Sea Beach Line was the fastest of the four lines connecting Coney Island to Manhattan, especially when the express tracks of the Sea Beach Line (last used in 1968) were in use, as there were no express stations between the split from the &lt;a href="w%3ABMT%20Fourth%20Avenue%20Line"&gt;BMT Fourth Avenue Line&lt;/a&gt; and Coney Island.

The ♡❤♡N♡❤♡ was both the first service to be cut back from Coney Island and the last to return, and was the only one not replaced by a shuttle bus during its closure. The &lt;a href="w%3ABMT%20West%20End%20Line"&gt;BMT West End Line&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AW%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29"&gt;W&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, later ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AD%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡) was never cut back from Coney Island, but the &lt;a href="w%3ABMT%20Culver%20Line"&gt;BMT Culver Line&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AF%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29"&gt;F&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡) and &lt;a href="w%3ABMT%20Brighton%20Line"&gt;BMT Brighton Line&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AQ%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29"&gt;Q&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡) were cut back from September 8, 2002 to May 22, 2004 (returning to service May 23).

Three months after the FBI raided the offices of the Dorean Group in Union City, California, neighboring companies in the same office park have received letters claiming that rent for the office park should now be paid to the Dorean Group. The owner of the office park, Hanover Properties, insists that they have not sold the park and called the Dorean Group's claim fraudulent.

The first letter from the Dorean Group, dated May 2nd, 2005, purported to "inform [the tenants] of the change in ownership of the property [the tenants] now occupy," and asked that "payment of rents be sent" to the principals of the Dorean Group. The letter also included notarized documents authorizing the sale by an alleged agent of the current owner, Hanover Properties, a "Julia Pantibratyuk."

On the subsequent day, Hanover Properties responded in a letter to the other tenants of the park. They noted that they had not sold the office park to the Dorean Group, but that they had evicted the Dorean Group from the premises on April 26. They added that, "We do not know who Julia Pantbratyuk is."

The letters were provided to Wikinews reporter by an employee of one of the companies in the office park.

<h2>Background on the Dorean Group</h2>
According to the Sacramento Bee, the Dorean Group says that it helps homeowners "wipe your mortgage off the books ... by executing a series of maneuvers with deeds and other real estate documents." U.S. District Judge William Alsup called the firm's work, "an elaborate Internet scam", said the Bee.

Kurt Johnson, one of the principals of the Dorean Group, disagrees. "We're on the cutting edge of legal theory ... It's in the law books, but no one's had the courage to bring it out," he told the Bee.

The Greater Cleveland Better Business Bureau issued an alert on its website in January about the Dorean Group. According to the bureau, the Dorean Group was "believed to be victimizing area lenders while leaving homeowners facing dire consequences."

The case of a Serbian diocesan Tomislav Gačić (also known by his Christian name Pahomije), accused of molesting four boys, will be moved to a municipal court in &lt;a href="w%3ANis"&gt;Niš&lt;/a&gt;. The supreme court in &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; accepted a plea by prosecution in Vranje, which said that they are under a big pressure of the public and media.

Sanja Pejović and Vladimir Ristić, attorneys of the accused, asked for the exemption of all judges of municipal and district courts in &lt;a href="w%3AVranje"&gt;Vranje&lt;/a&gt; because of their bias. Attorneys of the four boys said that this was a move to palliate the case.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASerbian%20Orthodox%20Church"&gt;Serbian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; did not make a statement regarding this case, that is now in its third year.

Videotape from security cameras appeared to show a cyclist lighting metal canisters that were filled with gun powder, and throwing them toward the building before fleeing the scene, police sources said. The make-shift explosives blew up in a concrete flower box, shattering glass but causing no injuries.

Two explosions were heard before 4am EST this morning, outside the 21-story building housing the &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; consulate in midtown &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.google.com/maps%3Fli%3Dlmd%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bq%3Dbritish%2Bconsulate%2Bloc%3A%2BNew%2BYork%2C%2BNY%26amp%3Bnum%3D30%26amp%3Bcid%3D40714167%2C-74006389%2C14482622662681109634%26amp%3Bradius%3D0.000000%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF-8%26amp%3Bll%3D40.756831%2C-73.970154%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.146484375%2C0.37967783337560945"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Police%20Department"&gt;NYPD's&lt;/a&gt; bomb squad was called to the scene, and checked the area for further explosive devices. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATimes%20Online"&gt;Times Online&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported a blast at 3:35; an ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ report mentioned two blasts around 3:50 from "in or near a cement flower box," according to &lt;a href="w%3ANYPD"&gt;NYPD&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Noel Waters.

The damage from the explosion included broken windows in the building, a parked car, and the front door of the building. &lt;a href="w%3ANYC"&gt;NYC&lt;/a&gt; mayor &lt;a href="Michael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; noted that police closed Third Avenue between 51st and 53rd Streets. European markets reacted quickly to the news, which briefly increased volatility in all assets, according to &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20%26amp%3B%20Company"&gt;Dow Jones&lt;/a&gt; news wires.

It is not yet known whether this is related to &lt;a href="UK%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;Britain's general election today&lt;/a&gt;, featuring Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;'s bid for his third term. Mayor Bloomberg told reporters, "We do not at this point have any idea who did it, or a motive...I don't think anybody should jump to conclusions".

Police think the target may have actually been a board member of &lt;a href="w%3ACaterpillar%20Inc."&gt;Caterpillar, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, who works in the same building. Caterpillar sells bulldozers used by &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; to demolish &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; homes. NYC Police Chief &lt;a href="Raymond%20Kelly"&gt;Raymond Kelly&lt;/a&gt; noted the building was the site of an April 13 demonstration by a group called &lt;a href="w%3AJews%20Against%20the%20Occupation"&gt;Jews Against the Occupation&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Doubts on yesterday's Italian Lotto and Superenalotto drawing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Doubts%20on%20yesterday%27s%20Italian%20Lotto%20and%20Superenalotto%20drawing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The live television broadcast of the &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; Lotto draw, which was used to award the record-breaking &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;72.090.405,19 Superenalotto prize Tuesday, is reported to have had problems in the drawing procedure.

Only the numbered ball extraction of the "Ruota di Roma" (Wheel of Rome) was shown in the live television broadcast. 

Instead of the traditional ball extraction made by a child, a new method based on an automatic machine was used for the "Wheel of Rome" and for the new "National Wheel". The other "Wheels" were drawn with the traditional system but were not broadcast on public television.

The operation with the new machine worked for the new "National Wheel" but when the operation started for the "Wheel of Rome", something went wrong. Not all the balls were taken into the box by the compressed air jet. A person tried to solve the problem, but a ball had fallen on the floor. Television images did not make it clear what really happened. Some parts of the procedure may not have been shown on television. The organization stated that the fallen ball was reinserted into the box, but this was not shown on television.

For these reasons, doubts have arisen about the regularity of the draw. Mr. Corbelli, the president of Movimento Diritti Civili, an association for civil rights, has stated that he wants an investigation to be made by the justice system to clarify what really happened and to check if the drawing was regular.

Bus drivers at &lt;a href="w%3AStagecoach%20Group"&gt;Stagecoach&lt;/a&gt;, the main busline in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, began a six-day strike on May 5 after company and union representatives failed to reach a settlement. Traffic during rush-hour has become much more dense than usual, due to parents driving children to or from school. Extensive motorway roadworks in Auckland are in progress, as well as the usual rash of roadworks at the end of the annual council budgets.

Stagecoach employees are in disagreement with the new &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;-based management over working practices and pay.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Democratic%20Alliance"&gt;National Democratic Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (NDA), the chief alliance of Opposition Parties in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, has rejected &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20India"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt;'s appeal to end its boycott of &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20India"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson of the &lt;a href="w%3ABharatiya%20Janata%20Party"&gt;Bharatiya Janata Party&lt;/a&gt;, the chief opposition party, &lt;a href="w%3ASushma%20Swaraj"&gt;Sushma Swaraj&lt;/a&gt; termed the appeal as a "mere formality" which was akin to "rubbing salt to the wound". 

"I appeal to leaders of the opposition to join the proceedings and this government is ready to discuss all issues and there is no issue which is barred from discussion," Singh said in parliament.

The NDA has been boycotting Parliament to put pressure on the government to answer their demands for the dismissal of Lalu Prasad Yadav, Railways Minister. Yadav had been indicted over charges stemming from the "fodder scam".

The appeal comes as the &lt;a href="w%3ATDP"&gt;Telugu Desam Party&lt;/a&gt;, an ally (although not a member) of the NDA, while maintaining its criticism of the Government's attitude, decided to end its boycott of Parliament and will join for the rest of the Budget Session.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20Navy%20finds%20soldier%20shot%20wounded%20Iraqi%20at%20Fallujah%20in%20self%20defense&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In the case of a Marine who fired upon an unarmed and wounded Iraqi in a mosque in November 2004, the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service, headed by Major General Richard Natonski, ruled that the soldier acted in self-defense, and within the law of armed conflict. In a statement released by the &lt;a href="w%3AUSMC"&gt;Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt;: "He has determined that the actions of the Marine in question were consistent with the established rules of engagement, the law of armed conflict and the Marine's inherent right of self-defense." He will now not face a court martial.

In a videotape of the event, the &lt;a href="w%3ACamp%20Pendleton"&gt;Camp Pendleton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; marine raises his weapon and fires into the body of a &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; lying up against a wall in a mosque. When the Marine approached the wounded man, the marine is heard on the videotape saying, "He's f****** faking he's dead; he's faking he's f****** dead." Then he fired his rifle point-blank at the man's head, at which point a companion said, "Well, he's dead now."

The shootings occurred inside a mosque during a U.S. offensive that led to house-to-house fighting in southern &lt;a href="w%3AFalluja"&gt;Falluja&lt;/a&gt; last November. A television journalist embedded with the Marines recorded the killing on videotape.

The man killed was one of several Iraqi insurgents who had been wounded in fighting and then disarmed by marines, who then moved on leaving the wounded men in the mosque. The next day a second line of marines moved through the area, who fought with more insurgents. Due to the time that had passed since the first wave of marines, the second line assumed that any buildings could have been re-occupied by insurgents. The corporal found wounded men in the mosque when they searched it. At that moment marines from the first line of attack were approaching the mosque, among them the journalist, who had also been there the first time. As they approached, they heard three shots. When they entered the journalist taped what he saw, the same people who were left there, disarmed. Some were still alive and one marine thought a man lying on the ground was a threat because one of his arms was not clearly visible, so he could be hiding a weapon. However, instead of keeping him covered so another could search him he shot him, while the journalist was taping it. When the marine saw this and heard that these men had already been disarmed before he shouted that he didn't know that.

In sworn testimony, the corporal said he thought the people in the mosque were a threat. Investigators who considered a videotape of the shooting agreed. A known tactic of anti-Iraqi forces (AIF) is to feign injury or death, and the marine could reasonably claim they were still a threat.

The Marines said in a press release:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The evidence supports the conclusion that the shooting of all three AIF by the corporal during the assault on the mosque was consistent with the ROE (rules of engagement). The evidence indicates that based on the actions of those AIF, the corporal reasonably believed that they posed a hostile threat to him and his fellow Marines and justifiably fired in self-defense. The enhanced videotape of the shooting supports the corporal's claim that the wounded AIF was concealing his left arm behind his head. While it is not clear whether the AIF in the videotape made any overtly threatening gestures, it is clear that the Marines of 3/1, to include the corporal, were aware that feigning death was a common enemy TTP (tactics, techniques &amp; procedures). Accordingly, it was reasonable to believe that the corporal fired on the AIF after reasonably believing that the individual was committing a hostile act by exhibiting a known enemy TTP (feigning death and subsequently moving his concealed arm). Based on all the evidence in the case, and the rules of engagement that were in effect at the time, it is clear that the corporal could have reasonably believed that the AIF shown in the videotape posed a hostile threat justifying his use of deadly force."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kevin Sites, the NBC TV journalist who taped the event as "pool" footage, was embedded with the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment when it neutralized Fallujah. The incident in the mosque raised considerable controversy over whether embedded journalists should maintain a neutral point of view. The unedited footage was aired extensively by Al Jazeera over the months following the incident. 

Sharif Hikmat Nashashibi of the Arab Media Watch said the footage would support the idea in the Middle East that the prime concern of US forces is not the welfare of Iraqis.

In the USA, however, the shooting itself was not shown because NBC considered it too shocking. Now that Sites is no longer embedded he wants to bring the whole story out in the open. 

Despite the fact that Sites introduced the footage with a long explanation of how the soldiers were under a lot of stress, which could easily cloud their judgement, he received thousands of hate-mails per day and even death-threats

Sites later responded to the criticism in an &lt;a href="http%3A//www.kevinsites.net/2004_11_21_archive.html%23110107420331292115"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the regiment in his weblog.

The recently started bus across the &lt;a href="w%3ALine%20of%20Control"&gt;Line of Control&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AKashmir"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; completed its third round-trip free of any untoward incident. The third bus from &lt;a href="w%3ASrinagar"&gt;Srinagar&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AMuzzafarabad"&gt;Muzzafarabad&lt;/a&gt;, carrying 37 passengers, left Srinagar at around 0815 hours &lt;a href="w%3AIST"&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. The return trip from Muzaffarabad carried 41 passengers. 

Heavy security arrangements were made to ensure no untoward incident took place. Authorities kept the names and addresses of the passengers secret to avoid a repeat of violent attacks launched by militants when the service started. The traveler's place of stay in Srinagar, in addition to the starting point of the bus, were also kept secret. 

The 170 km Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Road, which was closed for traffic on &lt;a href="w%3AOctober%2027"&gt;October 27&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A1947"&gt;1947&lt;/a&gt; was reopened after nearly 58 years on &lt;a href="w%3AApril%207"&gt;April 7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;.

In chatrooms and on bulletin boards, Macintosh users and the Macintosh-curious are buzzing about Tiger, the newest version of Apple Computer's Mac OS X, version 10.4. The open-source kernel, or base of the system, "Darwin", plus all the features of Apple's proprietary Quartz user interface features, software, and system utilities have passed through their next phase of upgrading and scrutiny, and have been shipping for more than a week now.

Apple reports that Tiger, the code name for this release, includes over 200 new features and new versions of application software such as e-mail client Mail, web browser Safari, and multi-person audio/video/text messaging client iChat. Entirely new features have also been rolled out in this release:
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Spotlight"&gt;Spotlight&lt;/a&gt; integrates search in the core of the OS, and utilizes meta-data in its algorithm.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Dashboard"&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; provides a sandbox for widgets, handy mini-applicatios like a calculator, sticky notes, and a dictionary, made available at the stroke of a key.
BULLET::::- Automator, a graphical scripting interface that enables non-programmers to automate repetitive tasks.

</ul>
One user of the new operating system made this comment:

Industry analysts have pointed to both the advances and the failures of the new version already. Many of the bigger technology advances have gained high praise, but, they point out, Microsoft Longhorn is also expected to have many of these advantages when it is released, expected in late 2006. And inter-operability, long a strength of Macintosh to work with other operating systems and networks, has had a few bugs&amp;mdash;such as reports of issues with Server Message Block (SMB) and Active Directory. Another issue for some is the fact that Cisco System's VPN does not work with Tiger. Cisco has promised a compatible release before the end of the month.

The biggest technology breakthrough is Spotlight. Using meta-data, searches are fast and easy and very thorough, and the results of the search can be used over and over again and will automatically update and change as you use your system. Search queries on a user's data can be saved as "Smart folders" without ever moving files on the hard drive, so you can collect all your photos, receipts, and webpages about your summer vacation, for example, while still keeping things ordered on your hard drive. According to a review by ♡❤PC World♡❤, this alone is worth the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;129.

Still, even Macintosh support sites such as Mac News suggest waiting for the first "point" release (10.4♡❤♡.1♡❤♡) before jumping in, which is expected in late May. Apple Computer has been on a semi-regular release pattern since moving to Mac OS X, with four versions released in 5 years. This constant development program has occasionally been accused of being aimed at forcing users to constantly pay out for expensive new software, but the returns of regular releases have been quick bug fixes and leading edge technology.

In a victory that has come as a surprise to commentators, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Galloway"&gt;George Galloway&lt;/a&gt;, candidate for the &lt;a href="w%3ARESPECT%20The%20Unity%20Coalition"&gt;RESPECT The Unity Coalition&lt;/a&gt; party, has won the election in &lt;a href="w%3ABethnal%20Green%20and%20Bow%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Bethnal Green and Bow&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="UK%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;UK general election, 2005&lt;/a&gt; with a majority of just 823. The seat had been held by &lt;a href="w%3AOona%20King"&gt;Oona King&lt;/a&gt;, and with a majority of 10,057 in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202001"&gt;United Kingdom general election, 2001&lt;/a&gt;, it had been considered to be a safe &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; seat.

RESPECT also took second place in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Ham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;East Ham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Ham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;West Ham&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; into third place in both constituencies, and in &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%20Sparkbrook%20and%20Small%20Heath%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Birmingham Sparkbrook and Small Heath&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; into third place.

In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Banks%20%28politician%29"&gt;Tony Banks&lt;/a&gt; stated his belief that the large Muslim population in the constituency had voted against Oona King "because she is a black woman" and that he believed that George Galloway would have seen a far different result if he had "come to West Ham". (In West Ham, &lt;a href="w%3ALyn%20Brown"&gt;Lyn Brown&lt;/a&gt; later beat the RESPECT candidate, &lt;a href="w%3ALindsey%20German"&gt;Lindsey German&lt;/a&gt;.)

&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; National Authority for Tourism (ANT) announced that they would promote &lt;a href="w%3ATourism%20in%20Romania"&gt;tourism in Romania&lt;/a&gt; through a new branding strategy, in collaboration with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development"&gt;United States Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;. The director of ANT, Marius Critonescu, said that the branding exercise will be "a significant component of the Romania's development as a new tourist destination of international level." He also added that the development of an integrated brand for Romanian tourism will promote a more positive image for the country, thereby increasing the number of tourists and investors. In recent times, there has been quite a lot of investment in "national branding", especially in the field of tourism, as most marketing experts believe that branding for a product or a country is theoretically the same thing, and that the same strategies and approach should be used for both.

Concerning the Romanian tourism rebranding, international tourism and marketing expert James MacGregor stated that, "We have to touch the hearts and souls of the contemporary tourists who no longer travel for a simple beach or ski track. They want to live a self-knowledge experience that is truly uplifting and will leave unforgettable memories. The brand must show them not what they will see or do as tourists but what they will feel when visiting Romania."

&lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; coffee house chain Coffeeheaven has stated that it will enter the &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; market this year, with the first of its coffee houses set to open in &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. Concerning the company's structure in Romania, Coffeeheaven's executive director, Richard Worthington, said, "We've decided to work with a local partner and we'll establish a joint venture in Romania. The investments will be covered by both parts in equal shares. We don't work in a franchise system." Coffeeheaven also said that they would not open stores in shopping malls, but rather in the city centre or in main pedestrian streets.

Coffeeheaven, based in &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, and opening its first store in 2000, is one of the largest coffee house chains in &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Europe"&gt;Central Europe&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounds. It currently has 28 outlets in &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, 7 in &lt;a href="w%3ALatvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; (trading under the brand name Coffee Nation) and 3 in the &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;.

A &lt;a href="w%3Asydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; bus driver dropped off a group of Mater Maria Catholic College school children at a Brookvale bus depot on Thursday, rather than following the normal route near their homes. The Rail, Tram and Bus Union said the incident occurred because the children were misbehaving and racially taunting the driver for a second day in a row. Parents of some of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Beaches%20%28Sydney%29"&gt;Warriewood&lt;/a&gt; children have conceded that this did occur.

Some parents accused the driver of kidnapping their children, and asked police to press charges. The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; State Government asked to see the &lt;a href="w%3AClosed-circuit%20television"&gt;♡❤CCTV♡❤&lt;/a&gt; footage, which does not include audio, as part of an inquiry into the incident. 

Transport Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Watkins"&gt;John Watkins&lt;/a&gt; dismissed this as an overreaction. 
"To call it kidnapping or criminal behaviour is right over the top," he said.

The union intends to support the driver, saying that he acted responsibly under the circumstances, and the children were safe at all times.

The opposition transport spokesman Peter Debnam has said that this is not an isolated incident, especially in rural areas, and accused Premier &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Carr"&gt;Bob Carr&lt;/a&gt; of spinelessness for not supporting bus drivers.

&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; new road traffic laws have been approved by the Senate, with the laws being in accordance with &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; legislation and updating a previous law from 1999. Romania is currently going through the process of aligning its legislation with EU standards, as it is set to become a member of the European Union on January 1, 2007. The Senate approved the law with several amendments from the original draft drawn up by the government and approved by the Chamber of Deputies.

The new traffic laws include many important changes. Firstly, car drivers with a concentration of 0.80 grams or more of alcohol per litre of blood can receive penalties of between one to five years in jail. In the case of public transport drivers, the punishment can increase to seven years in jail. Additionally, constructions of any kind will be banned on sidewalks, and traders will not be allowed on roads and parking lots.

Another important change is that pedestrians injured while crossing the street in an unauthorised manner, such as at a red light, will "bear full responsibility" for their actions, according to the law.

Before being implemented, the law must be approved by the President, &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking in Putney, London, where the Conservative candidate won the seat from Labour, Michael Howard has announced that he will not fight in the next General Election.

The Conservative leader stated that he would be 67 or 68 by the time of the next election, an age he believed to be too old to lead a party into power. Therefore, he would be making way for a successor so he or she can be well-established before the next election.

Howard stated that he would first reform the selection process for a new party leader before resigning, to avoid long debates about the party's leadership.

He added that the Conservative party could "hold its head high", after gaining thirty seats in the &lt;a href="UK%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;General Election&lt;/a&gt;.

Many of the Tory party members and journalists gathered at Putney expressed their surprise at his decision.
