The &lt;a href="w%3ADixie%20Chicks"&gt;Dixie Chicks&lt;/a&gt; won the award album in the song of Not Ready To Make Nice. Finally overcame controversy to dominate the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Grammy%20Awards"&gt;2007 Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday night, winning five statuettes including the two coveted awards for Record and Song of the Year (for "Not Ready To Make Nice"). The country/rock trio, led by &lt;a href="w%3AMartie%20Maguire"&gt;Martie Maguire&lt;/a&gt;, often criticized for their political views, also won for their album ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATaking%20the%20Long%20Way"&gt;Taking the Long Way&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

&lt;a href="w%3AMary%20J.%20Blige"&gt;Mary J. Blige&lt;/a&gt;, who went into the Grammies with the most nominations, ended up winning three, while ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idol"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ winner &lt;a href="w%3ACarrie%20Underwood"&gt;Carrie Underwood&lt;/a&gt; won two, including &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20New%20Artist"&gt;Best New Artist&lt;/a&gt; and for her song "&lt;a href="w%3AJesus%20Take%20The%20Wheel"&gt;Jesus Take The Wheel&lt;/a&gt;". With completion of the "big three" music awards (which includes the American Music Awards held in November, and the Billboard Music Awards held in December), Blige and Underwood were the only two artists to sweep all three major awards this season.

&lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario's&lt;/a&gt; Health Minister/Deputy Premier &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Smitherman"&gt;George Smitherman&lt;/a&gt;, 43, will wed his long time partner this summer, August 5. The couple also hopes to adopt a child.

Christopher Peloso, 33, who is Smitherman's partner, works for a large chocolate company called &lt;a href="w%3ALindt%20%26amp%3B%20Spr%C3%BCngli"&gt;Lindt&lt;/a&gt;. The couple met 10 years ago. Smitherman proposed on Christmas Day in Peloso's home of &lt;a href="w%3ASudbury%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Sudbury, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

"Christopher had decided that he, at least, should wear a white or cream-coloured tuxedo, so I bought him one and slipped a little note in there," said Smitherman. "This is my greatest foray into romance to date."

The wedding will take place at Laurentian Lodge, a wilderness resort near the northern city of Sudbury, Ontario. It will not be formal and a beach party will take place after the wedding.

Smitherman is the first openly gay cabinet minister in the province of Ontario.

When asked what Smitherman will wear to the ceremony, he was quoted jokingly saying: "Probably a thong."

Over 700 troops stormed a &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;an slum near the capital city of &lt;a href="w%3APort-au-Prince"&gt;Port-au-Prince&lt;/a&gt; on Friday to oust a gang led by a man known only as Evans, blamed for many murders, kidnappings and rapes in the area. Heavy sustained gunfire was exchanged for several hours in the operation, which killed four gang members and wounded two U.N. peace keepers, U.N. officials said.

U.N. commander Maj. Gen. Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz said no one was arrested in the raid and no weapons were recovered, but U.N. spokesman told BBC News that the operation had taken away the Evans' gang's base in Cite Soleil.

The raid has been approved by Haitian President &lt;a href="w%3ARen%C3%A9%20Pr%C3%A9val"&gt;René Préval&lt;/a&gt;.

Over 8,000 UN force have been stationed in Haiti since 2004, to restore order following a coup against then President &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Bertrand%20Aristide"&gt;Jean-Bertrand Aristide&lt;/a&gt;. 

The area of Cité-Soleil is home to around 300,000 people and a neighborhood known as Boston was said to be in the control of Evan's gang.

The UN troops raided a school controlled by Evans' gang and their headquarters, called Jamaica Base. This was the largest of the several raids into gang's territory.

Five people were killed by an 18 year-old man who opened fire inside the &lt;a href="w%3ATrolley%20Square"&gt;Trolley Square Mall&lt;/a&gt; on Monday evening, according to preliminary reports. 

Police say they have shot dead one suspect. 

The shootings started at 6:45 in The &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Old%20Spaghetti%20Factory"&gt;Old Spaghetti Factory&lt;/a&gt; on the second floor of the Trolley Square Mall.

Two employees of the Williams-Sonoma store, near the southwest corner of Trolley Square, told KSL that they heard shots and breaking glass from the area of the west parking garage. They say they saw a gunman about 6'3”, wearing a dark trench coat, carrying a shotgun, probably in his 20's. He came into the mall from the parking garage. 

A witness at Trolley Square has said that there may have been a second shooter, a man dressed in normal clothing and carrying a young child. Multiple news outlets have reported an off-duty police officer from the nearby city of Ogden confronted and shot the suspect. This officer is likely the "second shooter" reported earlier.

KTVX had reported that there may have been another shooter inside the facility, however this was later found to not be the case.

The mall evacuation began at 7:00 and is progressing slowly. 

The shooter has been identified as Solejman Talovic, an eighteen year-old Bosnian refugee living in Salt Lake City.

In &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, a 20-year urban success story may yet have a sad ending. The city's downtown population has doubled to 80,000 in the last 20 years thanks to Vancouver’s “Living First” policy – a planning strategy that favors residential development over commercial. And planners are expecting the population to reach more than 120,000 by 2030. But while downtown booms with people, business is busting. The International Herald Tribune reports that the city’s recently-released jobs and land-use study is estimating that downtown Vancouver may run out of commercial and office space within 5 years. 

The 'Vancouver problem' is one that many &lt;a href="w%3Acity"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; in the United States could only hope to have. On the contrary, much effort has been put into bringing residential life back into the city centres. In Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami, and Washington, D.C. there has been a condominium boom in recent years, but these cities are far from the situation Vancouver faces now.

To counter the trend in Vancouver, planners are proposing changes to the city’s &lt;a href="w%3Azoning%20regulation"&gt;zoning regulation&lt;/a&gt;s, including the passage of more lenient building height restrictions. But because residential developments are so much more profitable than commercial and office space, some public officials are proposing offering better incentives to the developers willing to build commercial. Another option is to expand the moratorium that was placed on new housing development in the central &lt;a href="w%3Abusiness%20district"&gt;business district&lt;/a&gt; two years ago. 

Translink is currently involved in a major expansion of the 49.5 km (30.8 mi) Skytrain system centred on downtown Vancouver. Construction of the Canada and Evergreen lines is underway. The former will be complete in 2009, and the latter in 2011.

&lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20phone"&gt;Mobile phones&lt;/a&gt; are to fight &lt;a href="w%3AHIV/AIDS"&gt;HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Health-care workers will be able to report current health data from the field to a central database using their mobile phones, under a project to be launched with the help of leading phone companies and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; government.

The US$10 million project, called “Phones-for Health”, was announced on Tuesday at the 3GSM World Congress in &lt;a href="w%3ABarcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. 

The software used in this project is loaded on to a standard handset developed by &lt;a href="w%3AMotorola"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;. The information will be transmitted with the help of the standard &lt;a href="w%3AGPRS"&gt;GPRS&lt;/a&gt; mobile data communication protocol or, if this is not available, by the ubiquitous &lt;a href="w%3ASMS"&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt;.

Africa lacks fixed-line telephone as well as &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; connections. Most often people use pen and paper to record the spread of disease. However, today more than 60 percent of people living in Africa have mobile phone coverage and the number of areas to have mobile phone coverage is expected to increase up to 85 percent by &lt;a href="w%3A2010"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;. This data was provided by the GSM Association, which is a global trade group that represents some of the leading operators of mobile telephony.

The scheme, under which the project will be launched, was designed after the success of another project launched earlier in &lt;a href="Rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;. It will focus mainly on fighting HIV/AIDS in 10 African countries. The first to enter the program is &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n mobile phone operator - &lt;a href="w%3AMTN"&gt;MTN&lt;/a&gt;. 

The new scheme hopes in long-term to be spread from Africa to &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; so to turn its attention towards other diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.

A major winter storm is dropping snow, ice, and freezing rain across the &lt;a href="w%3AMidwestern%20United%20States"&gt;Midwestern United States&lt;/a&gt;. 

Over 12 inches (30cm) of snow is expected in parts of &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. Along the &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20River"&gt;Ohio River&lt;/a&gt;, freezing rain and sleet is expected to make driving hazardous. The precipitation is forecast to continue through the evening Tuesday and into early Wednesday morning, before moving out towards the East Coast.

&lt;a href="w%3ABlizzard"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; warnings have been issued for much of Northwest Ohio and Northern Indiana, with very cold temperatures, considerable snowfall, and blowing and drifting snow.

Many flights have been canceled or delayed at &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Columbus%20International%20Airport"&gt;Port Columbus International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, especially those destined for other cities in the midwest. 

Schools have been canceled, and some businesses are sending employees home early. &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State%20University"&gt;The Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Cincinnati"&gt;University of Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; and many other colleges decided to cancel classes, sending home all non-essential staff.

Former &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Massachussets"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; formally announced his presidential candidacy yesterday outside of &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;.

"I don't believe Washington can be transformed from within by lifetime politicians, there've been too many deals, too many favors, too many entanglements — and too little real world experience managing, guiding, leading," said Romney, who was a successful businessman before entering politics. Romney focused on his leadership experience outside of government. 

Romney made the announcement at the &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Ford%20Museum"&gt;Henry Ford Museum&lt;/a&gt;, something which the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Jewish%20Democratic%20Council"&gt;National Jewish Democratic Council&lt;/a&gt; heavily criticized saying that they were, "deeply troubled by Governor Romney's choice . . . to kick (off) his presidential campaign on the former estate of a well-known and outspoken anti-Semite and xenophobe." A spokesman for Romney said, “Governor Romney believes our country needs to put innovation at the forefront if we are to ensure a stronger, safer and more prosperous America, the Ford Museum embodies that bold, innovative spirit.”

Romney's record as a &lt;a href="w%3Amoderate"&gt;moderate&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="w%3ALatter-day%20Saint"&gt;Latter-day Saint&lt;/a&gt; faith are expected to be his primary campaign challenges.

Romney, born in Detroit, the son of former &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Michigan"&gt;Michigan Governor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; Presidential candidate, and automotive pioneer &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Romney"&gt;George Romney&lt;/a&gt;, attended &lt;a href="w%3ACranbrook%20Kingswood"&gt;Cranbrook School&lt;/a&gt; of Michigan and &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; Business and Law Schools. Romney ran against senior Massachusetts senator and Kennedy family member, &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. Romney won 41% percent of the vote against Kennedy in the closest election in Kennedy's entire tenure in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt;. Romney was also CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee which was in charge of planning the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;2002 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; from 1999 to 2002, he took charge after the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Winter%20Olympic%20bid%20scandal"&gt;2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal&lt;/a&gt;. He also sat on the board of Massachusetts-based office supply giant, &lt;a href="w%3AStaples%2C%20Inc"&gt;Staples, Inc&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n spiritual leader &lt;a href="w%3ASathya%20Sai%20Baba"&gt;Sathya Sai Baba&lt;/a&gt;, 81, found himself embroiled in a political row after his recent remarks characterising the partition of the state of &lt;a href="w%3AAndhra%20Pradesh"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; (AP) as a "great sin". 

On a recent visit to &lt;a href="w%3AChennai"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt; he publicly spoke out against the proposed partition of India's fourth largest state, calling such a move a "mahapapam" (great sin) and claimed that there was no demand from the people to bifurcate AP into &lt;a href="w%3ATelangana"&gt;Telangana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAndhra"&gt;Andhra&lt;/a&gt; states. 

The comments caused an outcry among pro-Telangana activists who angrily voiced their protests in street marches and attacks on the Sivam building, the Baba's temple in &lt;a href="w%3AHyderabad%2C%20Andhra%20Pradesh"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt;, which was staffed by a few devotees. Shouting anti-Sai Baba slogans, the protestors pulled down a large picture of the holy man and trampled on it before taking it outside and setting it on fire. An effigy of the Baba was also reported to have been burnt, and twenty protestors were arrested following several police complaints.

<h2>Responses</h2>

The Baba, who preaches love and universal brotherhood, has several thousands of followers both in India and abroad including several heads of state, politicians, military officials, judges, film stars and sportsmen. Criticism of the Baba's comments have come from several quarters. 

K. Chandrasekhar Rao, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ATelangana%20Rashtra%20Samithi"&gt;Telangana Rashtra Samithi&lt;/a&gt; and former Union Minister, suggested that the Baba should restrict himself to religious functions and not involve himself in politics. "Otherwise, he should quit religion and join politics," Rao said. Congress MP &lt;a href="w%3AMadhu%20Yaskhi%20Goud"&gt;Madhu Yaskhi Goud&lt;/a&gt; criticised the Baba for not assisting with the ongoing &lt;a href="w%3Afluorosis"&gt;fluorosis&lt;/a&gt; problem in the Telangana region. Poet and &lt;a href="w%3AMaoism"&gt;Maoist&lt;/a&gt; sympathiser &lt;a href="w%3AGaddar"&gt;Gaddar&lt;/a&gt; asked the Baba to ♡❤"shut up"♡❤.

&lt;a href="w%3ASwami%20Agnivesh"&gt;Swami Agnivesh&lt;/a&gt;, social activist and President of All-India &lt;a href="w%3AArya%20Samaj"&gt;Arya Samaj&lt;/a&gt;, voiced his criticism against the Baba for focusing on something "unnecessary" instead of speaking out on the recent &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Noida%20serial%20killings"&gt;Nithari&lt;/a&gt; killings. "As he is not a political leader he should not make such comments," he said, adding that he intended to write a protest letter to the Baba.

Sai Baba's followers in his home town of &lt;a href="w%3APuttaparthi"&gt;Puttaparthi&lt;/a&gt; responded by calling a '&lt;a href="w%3ABandh"&gt;bandh&lt;/a&gt;' in which shops and business establishments were shut down to protest against the remarks of the Telangana leaders, and effigies of Rao, Goud, and Gaddar were set alight. K. Kesava Rao, President of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee, maintained that the Baba's comments had been "misinterpreted" and that the remark was not political. "All that Baba wanted to emphasis was unity and human oneness. But reference to Telangana in his speech was unfortunately misread," he said.
&lt;a href="w%3ADigvijay%20Singh"&gt;Digvijay Singh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20National%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; secretary-general disagreed with suggestions that Chief Minister &lt;a href="w%3AY.%20S.%20Rajasekhara%20Reddy"&gt;Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy&lt;/a&gt; could have instigated the Baba to make his statement, and confirmed that his party approved plans for the creation of a separate Telangana state. "With due respect to Sai Baba we can say that the work for setting up the second state reorganisation commission will go on," he said.

Archaeologist Julio Mercader at the University of Calgary has discovered hammer-like tools dating back 4300 years. The tools are thought to have been used by non-human primates to crack nuts.

The large size of the stones are of too great a weight to have been favoured as tools by humans. Further, humans are not believed to have been in that area at that time for the primates to have learned from them by observation.

Mercader suggests that this implies the primates learned to use the tools either independently of humans or else by a common ancestor (of &lt;a href="w%3Acommon%20descent"&gt;common descent&lt;/a&gt;). 

Further evidence supporting the hypothesis that the hammers were not used by humans includes that the nut residue on the tools are of nuts which were not regularly a part of a human diet.

Mercader elaborates in a prepared statement: “Some of the nuts require a compression force of more than a thousand kilograms to crack. And the idea is to crack the shell but not smash it — it’s not a simple technique.” [Editorial correction: force is a vector while mass is a scalar. By context, the force is approximately 10KN (10 KiloNewtons).]

Social and Political implications follow from the findings also. Anthropologist Agustín Fuentes (at Indiana’s University of Notre Dame) said, “It puts the nail in the coffin on those who say chimp tool use is atypical.”

This parallel of human evolution may also lead to further debate on the legal rights of primates.

A storm that has been passing through the midwest some parts of the nation will arrive in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; late tonight. This will be the first major snowstorm of the winter season for the northeast.

There is currently a winter storm warning for most of &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. It is predicted that there could be near-blizzard conditions in the morning. The storm is expected to bring several inches of snow to the area.

There are currently parking bans in effect in some areas of Massachusetts.

An &lt;a href="India"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; sex museum Antarang in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; teaches sex workers and their clients &lt;a href="w%3Asafer%20sex"&gt;safer sex&lt;/a&gt;. According to the museum's management, the visitors find learning about safer sex from the graphic exhibits more effective than from lectures. The museum is run by the government as a part of anti-&lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; program.

Antarang is a one-room exhibition displaying models of human &lt;a href="w%3Aanatomy"&gt;anatomy&lt;/a&gt; and illustrations. This is the only sex museum in India. Since the museum is located in the red light district a great bulk of its visitors are prostitutes who visit the museum together with their partners being taken there by health workers. 

There are about 5.7 million people infected with HIV in India - more than in any other country. This number is expected to quadruple by &lt;a href="w%3A2010"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; unless people become less reluctant to speak about the vital necessity of safe sex openly. Indian authorities use many innovative ways to spread necessary knowledge about safer sex and awareness of sexually transmitted diseases. 

Many of prostitutes who visited the museum say Antarang changed their lives as they realized the necessity of using a &lt;a href="w%3Acondom"&gt;condom&lt;/a&gt;. 

Indian authorities plan to open another sex museum away from the red light district in order to attract a wider audience.

Due to a US$23 million budget shortfall, all public libraries in Jackson County, Oregon are scheduled to close April 6. The U.S. Congress did not renew the Secure Rural Schools and Self-Determination Act, which replaces property tax revenues with revenue sharing from timber harvests. Jackson County used the revenue to pay for libraries and sherriff's patrols. Voters rejected a property tax increase last November. A similar increase will appear on the May ballot; such increases must pass a double-majority vote: a majority of county voters must turn out for the election, and a majority of those must support the increase.

Supporters hope the measure will pass this time. "Many people didn't believe we were going to close libraries." said County Commissioner C.W. Smith. The Ashland City Council has said it would find a funding solution to keep their branch of the library open; other cities have not made similar statements. Some alternative funding solutions, such as charging subscription fees, have been considered. However, charging fees for access to libraries is illegal in Oregon.

Jackson County is located in Southern Oregon, and has a population of 181,000. The Jackson County Library System consists of 15 branches.

International car company &lt;a href="w%3ADaimlerChrysler"&gt;DaimlerChrysler&lt;/a&gt; announced today it would cut 13,000 jobs in North America. It could part ways with the loss-making business.

It also plans to cut two Chrysler plants in an attempt to make Chrysler business profitable by 2008.

About 9,000 production jobs will be cut in the U.S., 2,000 production jobs in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and 2,000 salaried jobs.

"It's hard to say if it's enough ... but the stock is reacting nicely, which is further verification that this is a favorable restructuring move and a much-needed one at Chrysler," said chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, Tim Ghriskey.

Following some speculation that the companies &lt;a href="w%3ADaimler-Benz"&gt;Daimler-Benz&lt;/a&gt; (Mercedes-Benz) and Chrysler, which merged together in 1998 to make DaimlerChrysler, would split, chairman &lt;a href="w%3ADieter%20Zetsche"&gt;Dieter Zetsche&lt;/a&gt; denied allegations.

"We do not exclude any option in order to find the best solution for both the Chrysler Group and DaimlerChrysler."

The Australian Prime Minister (PM), &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has arrived in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; today for various duties.

While in New Zealand Mr Howard will talk to the New Zealand PM, &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;; participate in a joint New Zealand and Australian &lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; conference at &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20University%20of%20Wellington"&gt;Wellington's Victoria University&lt;/a&gt;; open the new high commission for Australia in &lt;a href="w%3AThorndon"&gt;Thorndon&lt;/a&gt;; lay a wreath at the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Warrior"&gt;Tomb of the Unknown Warrior&lt;/a&gt;; and talk to the leader of New Zealand's opposition party, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Key"&gt;John Key&lt;/a&gt;.

Ms Clark has said that their talks will cover various topics, including trade, global warming, problems in the &lt;a href="w%3ASolomon%20Islands"&gt;Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, and the settling of &lt;a href="w%3ATonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;, and about New Zealand's apples continuing to be banned in Australia. They will also talk about other regional, and international topics. Keith Locke, Green party member, is urging that Ms Clark talks to Mr Howard about sensitive issues, including urging Australia to withdraw from &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, release &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and Australia not ratifying the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Howard said, "We remain quite concerned about Fiji and will compare notes and talk about that as well as other bilateral issues."

Mr Howard said that the relationship between himself and Ms Clark are good. "We put aside any ideological differences we might have and we focus very much on getting good results." He also said that the relationship between Australia and New Zealand "...has got a lot of history, it has got a lot of common culture, it has got a lot of common sporting endeavour. But, like all close relationships, if you take them for granted they tend to fray at the edges over time."

Mr Howard will return to Australia on Friday.

A bill introduced by a Republican representative from Texas, &lt;a href="w%3ALamar%20S.%20Smith"&gt;Lamar Smith&lt;/a&gt;, would require all &lt;a href="w%3AISP"&gt;ISPs&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to maintain a log of all on-line activity by &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP addresses&lt;/a&gt; for an unspecified period of time, imposing fines and prison time of one year on service providers that fail to do so.

The proposed legislation would require:

The bill, titled ♡❤Internet Stopping Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Today's Youth Act (SAFETY) of 2007♡❤, was introduced to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; on February 6.

Smith, along with seven House republican co-sponsors, designed the legislation as an effort to combat on-line child pornography. A separate portion of the legislation reads: "Whoever, being an Internet content hosting provider or email service provider, knowingly engages in any conduct the provider knows or has reason to believe facilitates access to, or the possession of, child pornography ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both."

The legislation's effect would, in practice, attempt to force ISPs to connect dynamically assigned IP addresses to specific individuals. It would also extend the responsibility to any Internet content hosting provider which the bill defines as any service that:

Internet privacy advocates are skeptical over the vagueness of the bill. In its present form the bill leaves to the U.S. attorney general, &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;, unspecified powers in setting the limits of the legislation. 

Bloggers cite the bill as an invasion into something, "That includes, well, everything. IM conversations, E-mails and Web surfing will all be recorded and maintained, lest the ISP face penalties of up to a year in prison," wrote William K. Wolfrum at ♡❤WorldGolf.com♡❤.

Marvin Johnson of the &lt;a href="ACLU"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt;'s Washington legislative counsel said, "This represents an incredible invasion into our privacy and freedom to use the Internet without the government reading over our shoulders," according to ♡❤InternetNews.com♡❤.

The year &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; marks the meeting of the major representatives of the &lt;a href="w%3Awatch"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Ajewelry"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; industry at &lt;a href="w%3ABasel%23Industry%20and%20trade"&gt;BaselWorld&lt;/a&gt; Show, &lt;a href="w%3ABasel"&gt;Basel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. The Show will take place in the period of April 12 - 19, 2007. The international event is to attract over 2000 companies from 45 countries and about 90,000 visitors.

At present day the luxury goods business holds quite strong positions in the world industry and is still developing at high rates due to appropriate economic climate. Thus, BaselWorld is perceived by watch and jewelry producers and their partners as favorable new grounds for their further development.

BaselWorld is organized annually by MCH Swiss Exhibition (Basel) Ltd with a purpose to provide new business opportunities for the participants who are expected to exhibit their latest products in the exhibition area of about 160,000 m2. Visitors come to BaselWorld to keep aware of the current trends of watch and jewelry making, while retailers and wholesalers discover new partners and strengthen their links with well-established ones.

The exhibition is divided into product sectors presented in the six exhibition halls, among them there are the Hall of Universe and the Hall of Elements. This year the management of the Show has taken care of updating and redecorating the design of the halls. 

All the participants of the event will be able to expand their business contacts beyond the fair in the BaselWorld Village located nearby. The 'village' comprises special facilities for partners to discuss their matters in informal atmosphere.

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s administration press-service has said that &lt;a href="w%3Awebcams"&gt;webcams&lt;/a&gt; are being installed at the holy site of the &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Aqsa%20Mosque"&gt;Al Aqsa Mosque&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ATemple%20Mount"&gt;Temple Mount&lt;/a&gt; complex in &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, to enable people to watch excavations at the site over the Internet.

Users will be able to watch live the archaeological process and the following construction works from February 15. 

Excavations at the site were halted on Sunday after protests by &lt;a href="w%3AMuslims"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt;, who feared that the digging and the construction of a new pedestrian bridge in the area can have a negative impact on the al-Aqsa Mosque and the &lt;a href="w%3AQubbat%20as-Sakhra"&gt;Qubbat as-Sakhra&lt;/a&gt;.

Last week Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas declared the construction and blockade as "hostile measures" against Muslims. Israeli authorities say that these worries are groundless. They also accuse "irresponsible elements" of manipulating Muslim sentiment in order to gain political mileage. 

The Internet broadcast is to be set at the official website of the Israel Antiquities Authority, the department responsible for archaeological research within the country. Currently the site includes a three-minute video that explains in English the essence of the project in interpretation of the main archaeologist of Israel – Dr. Gideon Avni, the director of the Excavations and Surveys Department of the Israel Antiquities Authority.

Scientists have discovered a place on the outside part of &lt;a href="AIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; virus that might be vulnerable to &lt;a href="w%3AAntibody"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; blocking the virus from infecting human cells. This could mean that an anti-&lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; vaccine is possible in the future. 

According to Peter Kwong, researcher at U.S &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institute%20of%20Health"&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH), this study is likely to contribute to finding HIV's "site of vulnerability" which could then be targeted with a vaccine that prevents the initial infection. 

The team of researchers have made atomic-level images of HIV and revealed the structure of a protein on the surface of the virus. This protein, called &lt;a href="w%3Agp120"&gt;gp120&lt;/a&gt;, binds to an infection-fighting antibody and seems to be susceptible to attacks by this antibody called 'b12'. B12 can broadly neutralize the virus. 

Researchers detailed the precise interaction as the virus tries to hook on to and infect cells sent to protect the body. They have captured an image of how the virus of human immunodeficiency attacks the human cells. Dr. Gary Nabel, an NIH vaccine expert and a co-author of the research, describes this first contact between the virus and the cells as a 'cautious handshake' which then becomes a 'hearty bear hug'. The virus grabs and infects the cells that are aimed at protecting the body. 

Then the virus mutates quickly to fight the immune system's attacks as well as to counter the effect of antibodies that block the proteins with help of which HIV binds to a cell to infect it.

Scientists agree that a &lt;a href="w%3AHIV%20vaccine"&gt;vaccine against AIDS&lt;/a&gt; would be an ideal way to stop the pandemic of this disease, but, with all importance of these findings, much work and studies are still needed. This implies that any vaccine against AIDS is probably still many years away. 

The AIDS virus has killed more than 25 million people since it was first detected in 1981. &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt; is the most severely affected by the epidemic. Approximately 40 million people live with HIV.

About a dozen potential vaccines are currently under development. Two products, one by &lt;a href="w%3AMerck"&gt;Merck&lt;/a&gt; and one by &lt;a href="w%3ASanofi-Aventis"&gt;Sanofi-Aventis&lt;/a&gt;, are now in advanced human trials.

He failed to even send an MP in his place, to the event, scheduled as part of &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20History%20Month"&gt;Black History Month&lt;/a&gt;.

Every other political party with seats in Parliament sent a representative to greet the visitors. Present was the deputy leader of the Liberal opposition party, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt;, and prominent &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; MP &lt;a href="w%3AOlivia%20Chow"&gt;Olivia Chow&lt;/a&gt;, who is the wife of NDP leader &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt;.

While Chow and Ignatieff both hold office in Toronto, where the Citytv broadcasts to, and the Conservatives were shut out of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Toronto%20Area"&gt;Greater Toronto Area&lt;/a&gt; (GTA), even those without self-interest dropped by. &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Quebecois"&gt;Bloc Quebecois&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20Duceppe"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt; spoke to the students, despite the fact his party only runs candidates in Quebec.

City's coverage of the tour focused on what the students did see, rather than what they missed.

Harper seems to have made a regular practice of ignoring or delaying scheduled visits. Canadian Auto Workers union leader &lt;a href="w%3ABuzz%20Hargrove"&gt;Buzz Hargrove&lt;/a&gt; mentioned he has yet to talk to the Prime Minister. Hargrove represents over 265,000 workers in every province and territory in Canada.

A hijacked &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Mauritania"&gt;Air Mauritania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt; passenger plane has landed on Spain's Canary Islands after making a fuel stop in Western &lt;a href="w%3ASahara"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt;, officials in &lt;a href="w%3AMauritania"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt; said today. It was hijacked after the takeoff from the Nouakchott airport.

While on the plane, the man demanded it to be flown to France to seek asylum.

The 71 passengers and eight person crew were let out when the hijacker landed the plane in Las Palmas. Several people were wounded by a gun and the suspect was arrested.

Reports say that it is unconfirmed as to what the man's motive was. Mauritanian police are still investigating.

♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3APlymouth%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Plymouth, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ - This week, independent software developer &lt;a href="w%3AStardock"&gt;Stardock&lt;/a&gt; released ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGalactic%20Civilizations%20II%3A%20Dark%20Avatar"&gt;Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, an expansion to their PC turn-based strategy game ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGalactic%20Civilizations%20II%3A%20Dread%20Lords"&gt;Dread Lords&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Industry websites IGN and GameSpy responded with Editors' Choice awards, while UGO gave it an A. The expansion had previously been named as one of GameSpy's ♡❤Most Wanted Games of 2007♡❤.

Reviewers cited the significant increase in customization options, better &lt;a href="w%3Aartificial%20intelligence"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, and an improvement in graphics quality as decisive factors. UGO's Adam Swiderski noted that "if creating a fleet of death-dealing starships sounds like fun to you (and it really should), this is your dream playground," while GameSpy's reviewer suggested that "after a week of playing ♡❤Dark Avatar♡❤, you may forget ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMaster%20of%20Orion"&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ altogether." Criticism mostly revolved around "uninspired" ground combat, a too-generic &lt;a href="w%3Atechnology%20tree"&gt;tech tree&lt;/a&gt;, and the continued lack of multiplayer support.

The original game received some publicity for its lack of &lt;a href="w%3Acopy%20protection"&gt;copy protection&lt;/a&gt;, but gained far more by the actions of a &lt;a href="w%3AStarForce"&gt;StarForce&lt;/a&gt; forum administrator, who made a post linking to an illegal &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; download of the game. StarForce developer Protection Technology later claimed this to be a poorly-considered attempt to demonstrate the result of not using their software, which is designed to prevent software piracy. The result was a media backlash against the company, including satirical commentary by gaming webcomic/blog ♡❤Penny Arcade♡❤ describing the action as "extortion." Its writer, Jerry Holkins, asked that "publishers distance themselves from a company that has shown such contempt for their industry."

The expansion is available as an online purchase in CD or digital download form through Stardock's gaming subsidiary, TotalGaming.net. A compilation of the original and expansion has also been released as ♡❤Galactic Civilizations II: Gold Edition♡❤ and is available in stores, say Stardock. Their retail game releases still contain no copy protection, but &lt;a href="w%3Aproduct%20activation"&gt;online activation&lt;/a&gt; is required to download updates.

The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative Canadian&lt;/a&gt; government have decided to obey the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20accord%23Canada"&gt;Kyoto bill&lt;/a&gt; which was a forced decision by the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberals&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to this decision, the Liberal opposition party said the government could be sued if they would ignore the law.

"If and when that becomes law, the government would respect it. I'll just point out ... that the bill has no plan of action in it, the bill gives the government no authority to spend any money to have a plan of action," Canadian PM &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; told the House on Thursday. "Of course, if and when that becomes law, the government would respect it."

The bill will be sent to the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20of%20Canada"&gt;Senate of Canada&lt;/a&gt; for approval before it is actually made law. The legislation will only give the government 60 days to come up with a plan that meets with the Kyoto Protocol.

Kyoto wants to drop 6% of greenhouse gas emissions starting from 1990 to 2012. The Conservatives say it is bad for the Canadian economy.

Political experts are now saying that a federal election could come as soon as spring 2007. The Conservatives were elected on the 23 of January in 2006.

According to a recent survey and study reported in the British journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALancet%20%28journal%29"&gt;Lancet&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, mothers eating fish during certain parts of their pregnancy could possibly help a child's development.

Seafood is the predominant source of &lt;a href="w%3Aomega-3%20fatty%20acids"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which are essential for optimal neural development.

The survey of more than 11,000 women in the United Kingdom, noted their weekly seafood intake and found that low seafood intake was correlated with a higher risk of suboptimal developmental outcome.

During 2004, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFDA"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; released a report recommending pregnant women and nursing mothers should eat less than 12 &lt;a href="w%3Aounces"&gt;ounces&lt;/a&gt; (340 &lt;a href="w%3Agram"&gt;grams&lt;/a&gt;) of seafood every week to prevent development problems due to the toxins in the seafood. The advisory noted that shark, swordfish, king mackerel should not be eaten more than once weekly.

An FDA spokesperson said that neither the FDA or the EPA had any comment on the study and would need to review it before commenting.

Tigger costumed character actor Michael J. Fedelem, 31, has been cleared by the Florida state attorney's office. After reviewing tape of an incident where Tigger appears to bop a 15-year-old in the face, the office decided that the allegations were false.

Jerry Monaco Sr. and his family, including Jerry Monaco Jr., were visiting the Walt Disney World theme park early this year. The tape of Junior being hit in the face, distributed to the media by Senior, quickly went international, with Junior telling the press that the attack was completely unprovoked.

While the short clip the media aired of this scenario would seem to prove his statement, the full-length video shows Junior pulling on the Tigger costume's tail, thus blocking proper air flow. Even earlier in the clip, Senior is heard mocking the character, sarcastically apologising for supposedly sitting on its head.

The DA commented to television station Local6 that "The family didn't react like they wanted justice, they reacted like they wanted cash."

Jean Erik Redrupp, general manager of Park Operations at Disney-MGM Studios, had phoned to apologise after the incident, but Senior repeatedly demanded Fedelem himself reply.

"Everybody will come up and apologize to me but Tigger. He won't be a man about it and get out of the costume and come out and apologize to my son. I didn't want VIP treatment. I didn't want an extra day at Disney. I didn't want any of that. I wanted him to apologize and that is the one thing that they won't do."

Some reports say that Disney has made no decision on Fedelem's employment status, while the Associated Press claims a "telephone call placed to Disney officials ... early Friday to find out Fedelem's employment status was not immediately returned".

Wikinews has contacted Teamster's Union Local 385 for comment; Teamster's represents Fedelem and many of the other costumed character employees.

On Friday an Italian judge ordered 26 Americans, a &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;-led team, to stand trial for kidnapping of &lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Mustafa%20Osama%20Nasr"&gt;Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. He was brought to &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; where he says he was tortured as a subject to CIA "&lt;a href="w%3AExtraordinary%20rendition"&gt;rendition&lt;/a&gt;". He was later released. Also on trial is &lt;a href="w%3ANicolo%20Pollari"&gt;Nicolo Pollari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;'s former spy chief, and members of the &lt;a href="w%3ASISMI"&gt;SISMI&lt;/a&gt; military intelligence agency.

This is the first criminal trial over "renditions", aspects of the Bush administration's "war on terror". One of the defendants &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Seldon%20Lady"&gt;Robert Seldon Lady&lt;/a&gt;, the former CIA station chief in Milan, said via his lawyer that he did not recognize the court.
Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, a Muslim cleric also known as Abu Omar was taken by a CIA-led team in Milan on 17 February, 2003 and allegedly transferred by vehicle to the Aviano Air Base near Venice, later by air to the Ramstein Air Base in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and lastly sent to Egypt. He was released from prison on Sunday and says that he would like to return to Italy. He also said he has been tortured with electric shocks, beatings, rape threats and genital abuse, and that "I have been reduced to a wreck of a human being."

Though Mr. Nasr was under investigation for terrorism-related activities at the time of his abduction no charges have been brought against him. Italian officials says Nasr was suspected of recruiting fighters for radical Islamic causes and fought in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bosnia"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt;. Montasser al-Zayat, lawyer, said Nasr had only traveled to &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Yemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Albania"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt; and Germany.

&lt;a href="w%3ADisney"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt; has given a thumbs down to a university's &lt;a href="w%3ALGBT"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt; club stage production of &lt;a href="w%3ASister%20Act"&gt;♡❤Sister Act♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. After working six months on the production, the group at &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; university &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20University%20of%20Ireland%2C%20Galway"&gt;NUI Galway&lt;/a&gt; were told to cease production, or suffer the consequences of legal action.

Jeff Rockett, producer of the play, commented to the ♡❤Irish Times♡❤, "We are dumbfounded by Disney's stance towards what is a charitable, non-profit-making society, aimed at promoting safety and integration for the student LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] community. We were just having fun."

Reports claim the story was only "loosely based" on the film, and so the play's producers are investigating with lawyers what changes can be made, to make the production completely independent of the original concept.

Galway's Town Hall Theatre will refund tickets to the production.

An officially licensed ♡❤Sister Act: The Musical♡❤ is on stage in Atlanta, before making its way to Broadway.

&lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand's&lt;/a&gt; national cricket team, the "Black Caps", made One Day International Cricket history yesterday when they inflicted a ten wicket defeat on an under-strength &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n side, at Wellington. It is the first time in O.D.I. Cricket history that Australia has suffered a ten wicket loss.

It is also the first time in over a year that New Zealand have beaten Australia. This lends credibility to the view that the current New Zealand side has a culture of mediocrity, as they have not beaten a top-level side at full-strength for a long time.

New Zealand won the toss and elected to field first. Australia were already in trouble, when by the fourth over they had lost two wickets for a mere 16 runs, the damage coming from New Zealand's pace bowler, Shane Bond, who finished the day with a five wicket haul including a spectacular caught-and-bowled off Australia's Cameron White.

With Australia bowled out for an unimpressive 148, New Zealand took up the bat and reached the target in only 27 overs. The partnership between Lou Vincent and Stephen Fleming was unbreakable, despite several close shaves. 
A few key members of the Australian side were conspicuously absent, notably Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Brett Lee. However, Australia (currently world no.1) has lost four of its last five One Day International matches only two months before the International Cricket World Cup. 

If Australia lose either of their next two matches against New Zealand, they will slip to no.2 position, with South Africa occupying first place on the ICC's one-day rankings.

"This result shows how orbital observations can identify features of particular interest for future exploration on the surface or in the subsurface or by sample return. The alteration along fractures, concentrated by the underground fluids, marks locations where we can expect to find key information about chemical and perhaps biologic processes in a subsurface environment that may have been habitable," said McEwen.

According to NASA scientists, "mineralization" was found on the surface of the cracks and the crack's fractures. Scientists say the minerals became visible after layers of sand and dirt eroded away from the cracks. The minerals were likely placed on the rocks after dissolving in water and then evaporating onto the rocks, causing the minerals to become rock. Another possibility on how the minerals were placed there is that the "fluid" circulating on the rock was a gas, which might or might not have contained water.

"What caught my eye was the bleaching or lack of dark material along the fracture. That is a sign of mineral alteration by fluids that moved through those joints. It reminded me of something I had seen during field studies in Utah, that is light-tone zones, or 'haloes,' on either side of cracks through darker sandstone," said &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Arizona%2C%20Tucson"&gt;University of Arizona, Tucson&lt;/a&gt; geologist, Dr. Chris Okubo.

"The haloes visible along fractures seen in the Candor Chasma image appear to be slightly raised relative to surrounding, darker rock. This is evidence that the circulating fluids hardened the lining of the fractures, as well as bleaching it. The harder material would not erode away as quickly as softer material farther from the fractures," said a statement on NASA's website.

It is not clear how long the minerals might have been present or how long it took them to get on the rocks.

"It is hard to say how long ago the fluids were there - hundreds of millions or perhaps a billion years ago. But the fact that we see evidence for chemical reactions between the fluids and the rock means that the fluids were sitting there for quite a long time ... that's perhaps good if you want to look for any habitable areas that might support any biological activity," added Okubo.

"This publication is just the first of many, many to come. The analysis is based on test observations taken even before the start of our main science phase. Since then, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has returned several terabits of science data, sustaining a pace greater than any other deep space mission. This flood of data will require years of study to exploit their full value, forever increasing our understanding of Mars and its history of climate change," added Okubo.

A Delta II rocket blasted off from NASA's Cape Canaveral launch pad today, carrying five satellites designed to investigate the &lt;a href="w%3AAurora%20%28astronomy%29"&gt;northern lights&lt;/a&gt; and the electromagnetic storms that cause them. The launch had been twice delayed due to bad weather, but was eventually performed at 23:00 UTC.
&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Canadian Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; have collectively invested $200 million in the mission, known as the &lt;a href="w%3ATHEMIS"&gt;THEMIS Project&lt;/a&gt;. Through this mission, they hope to develop better techniques to forecast electromagnetic storms, in order to protect communication satellites, power grids, and spacewalking astronauts. Scientists from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Alberta"&gt;University of Alberta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Calgary"&gt;University of Calgary&lt;/a&gt; also helped with the project.

The Sun continuously sends a stream of charged particles, called the solar wind, at the Earth. We are generally protected from the solar wind by the Earth's &lt;a href="w%3Amagnetosphere"&gt;magnetosphere&lt;/a&gt;. During substorms, however, the magnetosphere gets overloaded by the solar wind and the magnetic field lines stretch until they eventually snap back, energizing and flinging electrically charged particles towards Earth.

Scientists want to find out what snaps in the overloaded magnetosphere to trigger a substorm.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Key"&gt;John Key&lt;/a&gt;, leader of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand's&lt;/a&gt; political opposition party, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National party&lt;/a&gt;, is advancing as the preferred Prime Minister (PM), and is very close to the same percentage of &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;, current PM of New Zealand, according to a recent &lt;a href="w%3AONE%20News"&gt;ONE News&lt;/a&gt; Colmar Brunton Poll.

Mr Key is 27%, and Ms Clark is on 32%.

Mr Key's party, National, is currently beating the main party in New Zealand, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; by 7%. National is on 46%, and Labour is on 39%. And, following the trend of the &lt;a href="w%3A3%20News"&gt;3 News&lt;/a&gt; TNS poll, the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Aotearoa%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; is also gaining support, and is on seven percent, which would enable them to control who the government would be. The rise in support is suggested to be because of global warming.

However the same 3 News TNS poll which showed an increase in support for the Greens, had Labour in the lead, with National trailing.

The other political parties do not cover the required threshold of five percent to enter parliament, unless they win an electorate. The &lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori%20Party"&gt;Māori Party&lt;/a&gt; is on three percent; &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20First"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt; on two percent; &lt;a href="w%3AACT%20New%20Zealand"&gt;ACT New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; on one percent; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Future%20New%20Zealand"&gt;United Future New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; also on one percent.

&lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Peters"&gt;Winston Peters&lt;/a&gt; is on three percent for preferred PM.

The One News Colmar Brunton Poll, with a 3.1% margin of error, polled 1,000 eligible voters.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has lost the top spot of the &lt;a href="w%3ACricket%20World%20Rankings"&gt;ICC ODI rankings&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, after losing the second match of the &lt;a href="w%3AChappell-Hadlee%20Trophy"&gt;Chappell-Hadlee trophy&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; - Australia's fifth defeat in their last six consecutive matches, 

It is the first time Australia has dropped from world No.1 since the rankings were started in October, 2002. However, Australia still has a vast lead in the Test Match Championship and are still the ODI World Champions having won the last two World Cups,

New Zealand's win edges them further up the table to within a few decimal points of current world number three team, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. If New Zealand can win the third match of the Chappell-Hadlee trophy they will take Pakistan's spot.

Current world standings with total points, as of February 18 2007, are as follows-

Car and suicide bombs killed at least 63 people within a single hour near markets in an area called "&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Baghdad"&gt;New Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;" and in &lt;a href="w%3ASadr%20City"&gt;Sadr City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

The two car bombs were detonated near marketplaces and bus stops in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Baghdad"&gt;al-Jadida&lt;/a&gt; at 3:00 PM local time. Another was detonated near a &lt;a href="w%3Asecurity%20checkpoint"&gt;security checkpoint&lt;/a&gt;. At least 134 people were wounded in the attack.

A news release from the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Army"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; forces in Iraq said that troops helped 327 families displaced by the bombings to safe locations. During a search of a building, troops found three pistols, two &lt;a href="w%3AAK-47"&gt;AK-47s&lt;/a&gt;, eight women, and at least 23 children.

Major General Joseph F. Fil said that he believes that the insurgents are "...watching us carefully," to determine their next move.

Thirteen &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; soldiers sustained minor injuries yesterday when three light armoured vehicles (&lt;a href="w%3ALAV%20III"&gt;LAV III&lt;/a&gt;) smashed into each other in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar%2C%20Afghanistan"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. The LAV IIIs are reported to have sustained minor damage.

Seven soldiers were taken to the Canadian-run provincial reconstruction base medical clinic. Six soldiers were transferred by air to the &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar%20airfield"&gt;Kandahar airfield&lt;/a&gt;.

The soldiers, who arrived in Afghanistan this month, are from the 2nd Battalion Royal Canadian Regiment and reserve units around &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Canada"&gt;Atlantic Canada&lt;/a&gt;..

"Our soldiers receive excellent training before they're deployed to theatre, but I don't think anything can quite fully prepare anyone for the nature of the roads here in Kandahar," said a spokesman for the Canadian Forces, Major Dale MacEachern.

They are now safe and will return to their units in a couple of days.

Around midnight on Sunday, a pair of bombs exploded on the &lt;a href="w%3ASamjhauta%20Express"&gt;Samjhauta Express&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Friendship Express♡❤), a night train going from &lt;a href="w%3ADelhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ALahore"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. At least 68 fatalities have been reported. Two more suitcases with &lt;a href="w%3AImprovised%20explosive%20device"&gt;improvised explosive devices&lt;/a&gt; have been found on the train. Some 13 passengers were reported injured, some with severe burns. According to the police, the explosions were rather small but intended to cause a fire. Since lower class coaches in India generally have barred windows, people cannot flee easily through the window.

The &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Indian prime minister&lt;/a&gt;'s office condemned the act as an "act of terror" and promised to find the people responsible. The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;Pakistani government&lt;/a&gt; also condemned the attack.

The incident comes just before a planned visit of Pakistan's foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AKhurshid%20Mahmud%20Kasuri"&gt;Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri&lt;/a&gt; to India for peace talks, and two weeks before both countries have scheduled a meeting to exchange information on terrorism. Kasuri said his trip would not be cancelled. Pakistani President &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; stated: "We will not allow elements which want to sabotage the ongoing peace process to succeed in their nefarious designs."

Last July, attacks on trains in Mumbai killed 186. "It's sabotage. It's an act of terrorism like the one in Mumbai," said railways Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav. The attack also comes days before the anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3AGodhra%20Train%20Burning"&gt;Godhra train burning&lt;/a&gt; on 27 February, 2002.

Audible Magic, a company in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Gatos"&gt;Los Gatos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, is developing a new &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; that can filter music and video uploaded on the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; without permission of copyright holders. The company's chief executive, Vance Ikezoye, demonstrated how the system works. He downloaded a poor-quality video from &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and fed it to the filtering software, which identified the video as a fighting scene of “&lt;a href="w%3AKill%20Bill%3A%20Vol.%202"&gt;Kill Bill: Vol. 2&lt;/a&gt;,” the rights to which are owned by Miramax.

The entertainment industry is already demanding the adoption of the new system by the Internet companies. One of the major social networks owned by &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;, has agreed to adopt the filter. However, not all websites want to adopt the system as soon as it is launched. The main holdout is YouTube, owned by &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.

The site's officials earlier said they would adopt a filtering software by the end of last year, but so far YouTube has not begun using any type of filtering system. The company's officials said that they would only use the filter if copyright owners will broaden their license with Google. The executives of &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AViacom"&gt;Viacom&lt;/a&gt; have already stated their complaints regarding Google's delay on placing filters.

The new system uses a large database that includes digital representations of various copyrighted audio and video files. This technology of spotting copyrighted material, called “digital fingerprinting,” checks for matches and decides whether to post the material on the site or not. However, Audible Magic's software is not considered finalized since it can still be "fooled"--e.g., by cropping the image. 

Analysts say that the filtering software is to improve the relations that are currently quite tense between the standard media companies and Internet companies.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Socialist%20Movement%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;National Socialist Movement&lt;/a&gt; is endorsing &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Taylor%20Bowles"&gt;John Taylor Bowles&lt;/a&gt; (50) as a &lt;a href="w%3AThird%20party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;third party&lt;/a&gt; candidate for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;upcoming U.S. Presidential Election&lt;/a&gt; to be held on November 4th, 2008. Bowles, 49, has been in the National Socialist Movement for 33 years, was honorably discharged from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; as a Telecommunications Operations Specialist, and is a retired &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; federal officer who currently resides in South Carolina. His platform's policies consists of &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20supremacy"&gt;White supremist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAryan"&gt;Aryan&lt;/a&gt; political ideals, such as declaring non-whites as not citizens of the United States, along with other issues, such as: decrease immigration, free healthcare, improving public education, recognition of traditional marriage, and the right to bear arms. 

Bowles' party, the fascist National Socialist Movement, is also known as NSM, NSM88, or the American Nazi Party as it has direct ties to the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Nazi%20Party"&gt;American Nazi Party&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Socialist%20Party%20of%20America"&gt;National Socialist Party of America&lt;/a&gt;. The NSM is the largest Nazi, and Pro-White political party in America, and shares many ideologies with other radical U.S. Third Parties, such as the U.S. Secessionist group &lt;a href="w%3ALeague%20of%20the%20South"&gt;League of the South&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AKu%20Klux%20Klan"&gt;Ku Klux Klan&lt;/a&gt;.

As the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces"&gt;Canadian Forces&lt;/a&gt; were assuring the nation that they felt the Taliban incapable of launching a spring offensive, and talked of launching a new strike against insurgent forces in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, a convoy of Canadian &lt;a href="w%3ACoyote%20Reconnaissance%20Vehicle"&gt;Coyotes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARG-31"&gt;Nyalas&lt;/a&gt; was ambushed in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar, Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. 
Two separate RPG attacks were made by the Taliban as the Canadians held to their route. The second attack came when vehicles damaged during the first barrage broke down and presented an easy target for the Taliban fighters. 
No Canadians were killed in the attacks, or in the small-arms skirmish that followed, but an Afghan civilian was shot by Canadian troops when he reportedly ignored warnings and approached the Canadians. An Afghan police officer was also killed during the firefight.

The government of &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; decided to change the OS on thousands of its computers. These will run on &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href="w%3AWindows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;. This step made by the Cuban government raises tensions between the country and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; - based company &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. 

The idea was welcomed by several Cuban ministers. This includes Ramiro Valdez, communication minister, who at a technology conference stated his position towards moving to free software. 
Richard Stallman, heading the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Software%20Foundation"&gt;Free Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, criticized the proprietary &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; saying that today it is rather insecure, and that unlike
proprietary software, free software develops democratically under the control of its users.

Heading one of the largest universities in &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, Hector Rodriguez also showed his positive attitude towards the migration of the country to free software. He outlined that Cuban customs service has already moved to Linux and several ministries are still to migrate. Among them are the ministries of culture, of higher education and of communication.

Although it will take some time for Cuba to move to free software, Rodriguez, as quoted by the Associated Press, declined to state the time it will take for the government of Cuba to move entirely to GNU/Linux. The pace of migrating to free software and open source software is very fast in Cuba. 

GNU/Linux has been adopted as an operating system by millions of computer enthusiasts around the world, and a number of local, regional and national governments have also advocated its adoption.

&lt;a href="w%3ACelia%20Franca"&gt;Celia Franca&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Ballet%20of%20Canada"&gt;National Ballet of Canada&lt;/a&gt; and its training ground, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Ballet%20School%20of%20Canada"&gt;National Ballet School of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, died at age 85 Monday in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

She is reported to have died in an Ottawa Hospital and her cause of death is not known. She went to the hospital last week and stayed there until she had died.

"Celia was more than the National Ballet's founder. She was its presiding spirit, its most stalwart supporter and the embodiment of its ideals and values," said Karen Kain, the National Ballet of Canada's current artistic director. "She inspired generations of dancers by her example and her devotion to the art of ballet. And most importantly, she made us believe in ourselves and that no goal was ever out of reach."

Franca, born 1921 in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt;, came to Canada in 1951 to found the National Ballet of Canada. Franca choreographed ballets in Canada such as the famous "Cinderella" and "The Nutcracker." She was artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada for 24 years. 

In 1967, Franca was named an officer of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20Canada"&gt;Order of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, then named a Companion of the order in 1985.

An &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; court today ruled that marriages conducted over the telephone are admissible under Italian law.

Mushtaq Z. C., a &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i national who lives in Italy under a work permit, had permission to bring his wife to the country refused by the Italian Embassy on the 20th of September 2006, on that grounds that a wedding celebrated by telephone could not be valid. Mushtaq had remained in Italy when he married his wife who was back home in Pakistan.

The Tribunale dell'Immigrazione di Milano ruled that, under Italian law, Mushtaq's right to bring someone to Italy as his wife could only be judged on the basis of the legitimacy of the marriage under the laws the country in which the marriage had been conducted. Mushtaq was able to demonstrate to the court not just a marriage certificate from Pakistan but a video of the wedding celebration in Pakistan in which relatives and friends had celebrated the event in the absence of the happy couple.

The court ruled, therefore, that the happy couple could finally meet at an airport somewhere in Italy and live as man and wife within the country.

&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; researchers have found that natural methods of family planning like the &lt;a href="w%3Asymptothermal%20method"&gt;symptothermal method&lt;/a&gt; (STM) are as effective as modern &lt;a href="w%3Acontraceptive"&gt;contraceptives&lt;/a&gt;. This finding challenges the common conception that natural methods of birth control are the least effective among all the family planning methods that are available today.

In 1985, scientists at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Heidelberg"&gt;University of Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt; started a &lt;a href="w%3ALongitudinal%20study"&gt;prospective, longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt; of 900 women using the symptothermal method for family planning (not compared to another population). The symptothermal method requires a woman to define her fertile interval during the &lt;a href="w%3AMenstrual%20cycle"&gt;monthly cycle&lt;/a&gt; through measuring body temperature and observing &lt;a href="w%3Acervical"&gt;cervical&lt;/a&gt; secretions. 

It was found that the lowest pregnancy levels (an average 0.43 pregnancies per 100 women per year, ♡❤i.e.♡❤ 13 cycles, with 95% &lt;a href="w%3AConfidence%20interval"&gt;confidence intervals&lt;/a&gt; of 0.05-1.55) were among women who abstained from &lt;a href="w%3Asexual"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; contact or practiced non-penetrative sex during their most fertile period (as defined by the symptothermal method). The rate was slightly higher (0.59 pregnancies per 100 women per year) among women who used barrier methods of contraception (for example, a &lt;a href="w%3Acondom"&gt;condom&lt;/a&gt;) during the same period.

These figures indicate that the symptothermal method might be reliable, but more research is needed to increase the &lt;a href="w%3AStatistical%20power"&gt;statistical power&lt;/a&gt; of the data. Scientists consider a method of contraception to be highly effective if the pregnancy rate is less than one pregnancy per 100 women per year when used properly (the upper limit of confidence was 1.55 in this case, but the average 0.43).

The study reported a dropout rate of 9.2 per 100 woman. Study participants indicated that this was either due to the fact that they no longer wished to participate, or that they wanted to achieve pregnancy, for medical reasons, because they separated from their partner, ♡❤etc♡❤.

Surprisingly enough, the rate of pregnancy among women who had sex during their fertile period turned out to be only 7.46 pregnancies per 100 women per year, although the rate was four times higher than what could be expected. The researchers say these women had sex on the boundaries of their fertile periods.

Taken together, these findings suggest that the symptothermal method of contraception is worthy of further research, as a possible future option for those who for some physical or religious reasons cannot use other family planning methods.

Blair admitted that the situation in &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt;, the port city were the British operate mostly, was not yet how he wanted it, but that "the next chapter in Basra’s history can be written by Iraqis." The withdrawal contrasts with the 20,000 extra troops announced by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;. Blair explained that the situation in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; is very different, because of "an orgy of terrorism".

Blair envisions a pullback, leaving the U.K. with support and training tasks, while Iraqis would patrol the city. The pace of the withdrawal "depends, of course, in part on what we do, what the Iraqi authorities themselves do, but also on the attitude of those we are together fighting," according to the prime minister. Over the last weeks, the British have conducted '&lt;a href="w%3Aoperation%20Sinbad"&gt;operation Sinbad&lt;/a&gt;' against &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; militias in Basra. On Sunday, Blair said in a T.V. interview that the operation was now complete.

On Tuesday, an &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Iraqi%20Army"&gt;Iraqi Army&lt;/a&gt; division in Basra was transferred to Iraqi control. The Ministry of Defence spoke of an "important step" toward taking up responsibilities in the area.

Rumours of the pullback had already emerged on Tuesday. A &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson had stated that "while the United Kingdom is maintaining a robust force in southern Iraq, we’re pleased that conditions in Basra have improved sufficiently that they are able to transition more control to the Iraqis." The press was told that Bush "sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the Iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in Baghdad."

&lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt;, delivered his resignation today to the country's President &lt;a href="w%3AGiorgio%20Napolitano"&gt;Giorgio Napolitano&lt;/a&gt;. The decision came following an embarrassing loss suffered by the Italian government on a foreign policy vote in the Italian Senate, concerning the engagement in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and after a political split in the government coalition about the planned expansion of a U.S. Army base in &lt;a href="w%3AVicenza"&gt;Vicenza&lt;/a&gt;, in Northern Italy.

President Napolitano will begin consultations among Italian party Leaders on the next Thursday: according to the Italian Constitution, the President can send back Prodi to the Chambers for a vote or might choose another Prime Minister who might have enough support to put together a new government, or could be forced to dissolve the Parliament and call for new elections. 

In the meantime, the President asked the government to stay on in a caretaker role.

Prodi has been Prime Minister for nine months.

In the largest study of its kind, a genetic analysis of 1,168 families with multiple cases of &lt;a href="w%3Aautism"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; has identified genetic links to autism. A previously overlooked stretch of &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3Achromosome%2011%20%28human%29"&gt;chromosome 11&lt;/a&gt; implicates a gene called neurexin 1 and increases the evidence for the involvement of neurexins and genes related to &lt;a href="w%3AGlutamic%20acid"&gt;glutamate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANeurotransmitter"&gt;transmission in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.

Genetic studies of autism have previously been undertaken; however the new study involves the collaboration of more than 120 scientists from more than 50 institutions representing 19 countries who pooled their data as part of the Autism Genome Project. The findings were published in the Feb. 18 issue of Nature Genetics.

Bob Wright, co-founder of &lt;a href="w%3AAutism%20Speaks"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing awareness of autism, said: "The identification of susceptibility genes will provide profound new insight into the basis of autism offering a route to breakthroughs in new treatments in support of families." Autism Speaks funded this project in conjunction with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institutes%20of%20Health"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.

Joachim Hallmayer, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at Stanford and chair of the collaboration's executive committee, explains what is next: “While promising, these results need to be followed up with more refined genetic maps to home in on other specific &lt;a href="w%3ACandidate%20gene"&gt;candidate genes&lt;/a&gt;. We also need to look more closely at chromosomal anomalies in large samples of children with autism.” In the paper, researchers caution that the genetic foundation of autism probably involves multiple genes and chromosomal abnormalities.

Autism affects about one in every 150 children, and the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; has called it an "urgent health concern". Autism is a &lt;a href="w%3APervasive%20developmental%20disorder"&gt;developmental disorder&lt;/a&gt; which impairs social interaction, communication and features restricted and repetitive interests and activities. &lt;a href="w%3ATwin%20study"&gt;Twin studies&lt;/a&gt; and other research clearly suggest a genetic basis for the condition. Currently there is no cure for autism, but both behavioral or sensory interventions and drugs can influence the symptoms.

Former Ontario &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20New%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; premier &lt;a href="Bob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt; created the revenue ministry. Liberal premier &lt;a href="Dalton%20McGuinty"&gt;Dalton McGuinty&lt;/a&gt; recreated it because he wanted Chan in it. He also said that Finance Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Sorbara"&gt;Greg Sorbara&lt;/a&gt; needs a hand with his job and this would help.

"Michael is a strong member of our team and brings a great deal of experience to this position," McGuinty said today. "Michael is passionate about building opportunity for Ontario families and we're happy to have him on the team."

Before getting in power, Chan owned an insurance brokerage in Markham with hundreds of agents. A by-election was called for two ridings including Markham. Chan won on February 8 and was just sworn in two days ago.

The Ontario cabinet now has 27 ministers.

An enormous mud-spewing volcano in East Java, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; is to become the newest testing grounds for the human control of natural phenomena. In this instance, the natural phenomenon may actually be initiated through human activity. If so, the humans responsible for the disaster may eventually answer to the over 10,000 former residents of the land currently reduced the world's most unruly mud puddle.

A consultant for the oil and gas industry is on record saying, "This is a natural disaster induced by drilling activity...Somehow, or somewhere, several mistakes occurred that caused the mud to come from the hole." Since its birth over eight months ago, the mud volcano has expelled as much as 126,000 cubic meters of mud per day. A recent publication of the Geological Society of America has concurred with the earlier assessment.

The mud is not toxic, but it smells bad and reaches over 4 meters deep at some points. Entire villages have been filled by the mud flow. Management techniques for the disaster have included diverting the flow into the ocean, which has in turn produced anxieties regarding the potential of ecological damage to the ocean.

In an attempt to check the deluge of hot mud, a recent (and contentious) intervention has been placed into motion: the volcano will be plugged. Although the plan seems cartoonish, Rudi Novrianto -- spokesman for the national mudflow disaster commission -- is on record saying, "We will insert high density chained balls inside the mud volcano. This technique is expected to reduce the amount of mud flow and ease the pressure at the source of the gushing."

The obvious possibility of pressure buildup, and a secondary (and more violent) mud eruption, has been addressed. Richard Davies of Durham university is on record stating "...nobody has ever done this before...the pressure may build, forcing open other vents, possibly exacerbating the situation."

Denial. Anger. Bargaining. Depression. Acceptance.

Originally formulated in 1973 by &lt;a href="w%3AElisabeth%20K%C3%BCbler-Ross"&gt;Elisabeth Kübler-Ross&lt;/a&gt;, these five stages are well-known to many as the "&lt;a href="w%3AK%C3%BCbler-Ross%20model"&gt;Five Stages of Grief&lt;/a&gt;". However, despite their familiarity, the five-stage theory had remained untested empirically, until Paul K. Maciejewski, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry at the &lt;a href="w%3AYale%20School%20of%20Medicine"&gt;Yale University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and the Yale Bereavement Study completed several years of research, findings for which were published in the February 21 issue of the &lt;a href="w%3AJournal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt; (JAMA).

According to Dr. Kübler-Ross's theory, denial is the first and most defining indicator of grief. The Yale Bereavement Study's findings, in contrast, show acceptance to be the most common indicator, and yearning the strongest negative indicator.

The authors explain, "Disbelief decreased from an initial high at one month postloss, yearning peaked at four months postloss, anger peaked at five months postloss, and depression peaked at six months postloss. Acceptance increased steadily through the study observation period ending at 24 months postloss.” 

Study author Holly Prigerson, associate professor of psychiatry at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Medical%20School"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt; and director of the &lt;a href="w%3ADana-Farber%20Cancer%20Institute"&gt;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;'s Center for Psycho-Oncology and Palliative Care Research, says, "This would suggest that people who have extreme levels of depression, anger or yearning beyond six months would be those who might benefit from a better mental health evaluation and possible referral for treatment."

The Yale Bereavement Study followed the progress of 233 participants from January 2000 through January 2003 who had lost family, most often a spouse, and was funded by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institute%20of%20Mental%20Health"&gt;National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Cancer%20Institute"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institute%20of%20Neurological%20Disorders%20and%20Stroke"&gt;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke&lt;/a&gt;, the Center for Psycho-Oncology and Palliative Care Research, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Women’s Health Research at &lt;a href="w%3AYale%20University"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Telecom%20New%20Zealand%20reviews%20itself%2C%20finds%20fault&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

New Zealand's monopoly ISP, &lt;a href="w%3AXtra%20%28ISP%29"&gt;Xtra&lt;/a&gt;, owned by &lt;a href="w%3ATelecom%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Telecom New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, is going to credit 60,000 customers after completing an internal review of itself last week and finding that there was an error with its traffic management policy on their ♡❤Go Large♡❤ plan.

The 60,000 customers, less than 10% of Telecom's subscribers, who subscribed to ♡❤Go Large♡❤, which boasts full speeds and no &lt;a href="w%3ADownload%20Quota"&gt;data cap&lt;/a&gt;, since December 8, 2006 till late February, 2007 will receive up to &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;160 in credit. Telecom has temporarily stopped either new or existing customers from signing up to the new plan, and will also ask existing customers in the next couple of weeks if they wish to change plans, stay on the same plan with a changed traffic management policy, or cancel their service.

The credit, automatically applied to the affected customers monthly bill, will cost Telecom itself around $7.5-$8.5 million.

Kevin Bowler, general manager of Telecom's consumer marketing, said that the traffic management policy process was found to be not what they had originally intended it to do. The fault applied to all forms of Internet use, instead of certain applications, like large music, or movie downloading. "Clearly it is not an ideal situation and therefore we are crediting Go Large customers for plan charges incurred during this period."

"In this instance with the Go Large plan our internal technical review showed we had made an error and we believe that we are doing the right thing by crediting customers," Mr Bowler said.

New Zealand's Commerce Commission has been investigating complaints by customers who say that they are not receiving what Xtra promised since the same time when Xtra initiated its traffic management policy, December. Deborah Battell, fair trading director, said that the Commerce Commission is pleased Telecom is crediting customers for its error. "However, the Commission is concerned that Telecom's actions may not address the full extent of the problems. The Commission will continue its investigation into whether the promotion breached the Fair Trading Act. In particular, the Commission is considering whether Telecom's initial representation that Go Large gave customers unlimited access was misleading, as the company's reasonable use policy in effect placed limits on use."

The reasonable use policy meant subscribers could not download &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrents&lt;/a&gt;, or use other &lt;a href="w%3Apeer-to-peer"&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;/a&gt; services without giving priority Internet access to other subscribers.

Ernie Newman, chief executive of the &lt;a href="w%3ATelecommunications%20User%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Telecommunications User Association of New Zealand (TUANZ)&lt;/a&gt;, said that it is good that Telecom is to repay its subscribers for their own error, but says that it will diminish their trust in Telecom, and other phone companies. "We applaud their openness. But sadly it is another episode in a chain of events where customers have signed up for broadband services that were advertised as offering attractive speeds or data limits, but in reality have delivered a whole lot less."

"Something in Telecom needs to change. There have been too many disappointments, too much over-promising and under-delivering. This simply adds to the concern of many people that when it comes to the impact of broadband on customers lives and businesses, Telecom has not yet got the message," Mr Newman said.

Pioneer Malaysian bloggers Ahiruddin Attan and Jeff Ooi have been sued for defamation by a leading Malaysian newspaper, The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Straits%20Times"&gt;New Straits Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. They are alleged to have defamed top executives of the English daily. The case marks the first time bloggers have been sued for libel in the country.

The oldest newspaper group in Malaysia is owned by the &lt;a href="w%3AMedia%20Prima"&gt;Media Prima&lt;/a&gt; group, which is in turn owned by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Malays%20National%20Organization"&gt;United Malays National Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the leading party in the government.

Malaysia has strict media laws but they function less effectively on newer forms of electronic media. Leading members of the ruling coalition, &lt;a href="w%3ABarisan%20Nasional"&gt;Barisan Nasional&lt;/a&gt; (the National Front) have suggested making amendments to its media laws, such as to punish bloggers who publish materials that are deemed controversial and "anti-government".

Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang expressed concerns that the action will have a chilling effect on popular blogs that have expressed discontent with the incumbent administration.

The 15th Annual &lt;a href="w%3AElton%20John"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="AIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; Foundation (EJAF) party will mark the &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Awards"&gt;Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; to take place this Sunday, February 25th. 

The event will be held at the Pacific Design Center in West &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. Sir Elton John and &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Furnish"&gt;David Furnish&lt;/a&gt; will co-host the party. As for this year's sponsors - &lt;a href="w%3AAudi"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChopard"&gt;Chopard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVH1"&gt;VH1&lt;/a&gt; have offered the Elton John Foundation their support. The &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy"&gt;Grammy&lt;/a&gt; nominated rock singer, &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Blunt"&gt;James Blunt&lt;/a&gt;, has been invited to perform at the event.

The annually held gala is found among the major fund-raising events organized by the Foundation. Taking place on the Oscar Night, the party is also aimed to attract international attention towards the fight against AIDS and promote people's awareness of the terrifying disease. During the period of the last 14 years the event has raised about $ 125 million to support the Foundation in its activities against AIDS, in particular HIV/AIDS prevention and special direct service programs implemented in 55 countries of the world. 

The party to be held for the 15th time this year will include a big expanded dinner, live auction and musical performance. Among the guests of the party there will be entertainment community celebrities, Hollywood stars and Oscar winners, as well as the music industry representatives. 

Antony Todd, the leading designer of Antony Todd Inc. based in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; City and involved into special event-designing, has been commissioned to turn Outdoor Plaza of the Pacific Design Center into to a festive arena staged in a designer rectangular tent.

A major snowfall has disrupted transport in &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; this week. Several roads and all railway services have been reported as closed due to the heavy snowfall, and meteorologists have recommended that people try to stay at home if possible. Snow storms are also causing problems in other parts of Southern Scandinavia, such as &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; and Southern &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.

In Norway, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20route%20E18"&gt;E-18&lt;/a&gt;, the highway from &lt;a href="w%3AKristiansand"&gt;Kristiansand&lt;/a&gt; and eastwards have been closed after several accidents, which according to the local police primarily was the result of truck drivers not having prepared for the heavy snow and getting stuck. 

Several cars got stuck as a result of this, with some motorists being stuck from 3.30 pm Wednesday until Thursday morning. The local &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; cooperated with the police in getting food and gasoline out to the stuck drivers, and also evacuated a bus full of senior citizens who had been out on an excursion. 

Regional bus and rail services have been canceled for most of Wednesday and Thursday from Kristiansand and eastwards, and in Kristiansand and nearby areas in the southern regions of Norway the heavy snowfall also made local traffic slow with major disruptions and delays.

According to the regional newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFedrelandsvennen"&gt;Fædrelandsvennen&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, it is expected that there will be about 100 &lt;a href="w%3Acm"&gt;cm&lt;/a&gt; more snowfall on Friday alone, with Wednesday and Thursday having resulted in 50 cm so far.

A &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; minister and woman’s activist was shot and killed last Tuesday because she refused to wear the veil.

&lt;a href="w%3AZilla%20Huma%20Usman"&gt;Zilla Huma Usman&lt;/a&gt;, the minister for social welfare in &lt;a href="w%3APunjab%20%28Pakistan%29"&gt;Punjab&lt;/a&gt; province and an ally of President &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, was killed as she was about to deliver a speech to dozens of party activists. Her assassin, Muhammad Sarwar, believed that she was dressed inappropriately and that women should not be involved in politics, officials said.

“I have no regrets. I killed her out of the conviction that she was leading an un-Islamic life and spreading an evil influence on other women,” Muhammad Sarwar told his interrogators, according to a police source.

Usman, 35, was wearing the &lt;a href="w%3ASalwar%20kameez"&gt;shalwar kameez&lt;/a&gt; worn by many professional women in Pakistan, but did not cover her head.

Victor "Lloyd" Clemett, one of Canada's last surviving veterans from &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20I"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; (WWI) died last night at age 107.

Clemett died at &lt;a href="w%3ASunnybrook%20Health%20Sciences%20Centre"&gt;Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre&lt;/a&gt; in his home-city of &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

Clemett lived at his home until two years ago when he moved to a Sunnybrook residence.

When interviewed by the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; last year he is quoted saying: "Just taking it easy, not running too wild and having a good time."

The last remaining WWI vets are Percy Wilson 105 years old and John Babcock 107. About 620,000 Canadians enlisted in the First World War.

Born on December 10, 1899, Clemett served the war from 1916 to the fall of 1918. He ran away from home at age 16 to join the war after his brother left a few months before. Clemett successfully lied about his age but when officials found out they sent him out to help supply lumber.

After, Clemett worked with the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Pacific%20Railway"&gt;Canadian Pacific Railway&lt;/a&gt; for 10 years. He, and his friend, co-founded a lawn-equipment company in Toronto. Years later, he became a water-meter reader.

Clemett met his future wife Cassie Duggan while working with the lawn equipment company. Cassie Duggan later died in 1993 at the age of 82. He is now survived by his sons: David Clemett, who resides in the United States, and John Clemett, who resides in the Canadian western province of &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>State funeral approved</h2>

The government will have a &lt;a href="State%20funeral%20approved%20by%20Canadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;state funeral&lt;/a&gt; for the last WWI veteran.

State funerals in Canada, by tradition, are reserved for prime ministers and governors general.

This changed last year after the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Dominion%20Institute"&gt;Dominion Institute&lt;/a&gt;, introduced a motion to have a state funeral for the last veteran. It was likened by all party leaders and passed on the 21 of November in 2006.

"We honour his service to Canada during the First World War," executive director of the Dominion Institute, Rudyard Griffiths, said. "With only two Great War veterans remaining, we hope that the federal government will follow through on the motion unanimously passed in Parliament last November to offer the family of the last Great War veteran resident in Canada a full state funeral."

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has approved the deployment of an &lt;a href="African%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt;-led peace keeping force in &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt; for a period of six months.

The 15 member council met last Tuesday (February 20), and unanimously authorized Resolution 1744, allowing African Union member states to establish a mission in Somalia "...to support dialogue and reconciliation in Somalia by assisting with the free movement, safe passage and protection" of those involved in the national reconciliation congress, including the federal transition government led by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Mohammed%20Ghedi"&gt;Ali Mohammed Ghedi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Other goals will be to create the "necessary security conditions for the provision of humanitarian assistance", and to secure key infrastructure. The mission has been designated as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union%20Mission%20to%20Somalia"&gt;AMISOM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an acronym that stands for ♡❤A♡❤frican ♡❤Mi♡❤ssion in ♡❤Som♡❤alia.

The initiative for the national reconciliation congress was announced by Somalian President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbdullahi%20Yusuf%20Ahmed"&gt;Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during a recent summit of the African Union. In the resolution text, the Council reminds that the congress needs a broad base, with representation of the diversity of the Somalian people.

While exact numbers remain unknown, diplomatic sources spoke of some 8,000 troops that could be sent to the region, half of which would be provided by &lt;a href="Burundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;. Ugunda would be the first to start with a phased operation to deploy their troops, some 1,500.

&lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; will not take part in AMISOM. The country's intervention in Somalia in December 2006, working together with forces loyal to Gedi, received much criticism. 

Ethiopian prime minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMeles%20Zenawi"&gt;Meles Zenawi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who recently announced the retreat of the army from Somalia, admitted that he didn't wish for his country to be present any longer, and that the war only served to protect Ethiopia from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Courts%20Union"&gt;Islamic Courts Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which controlled until last December the largest part of the country, including the capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

For the purpose of the mission, the Council has lifted the arms embargo in effect since 1992, which it says has helped greatly for peace and security in Somalia. States supplying weapons and supplies still need to inform the sanctions committee, adding that the Council intends to "consider urgently" ways to strengthen the embargo's effectiveness.

Accompanying the resolution, the Security Council has asked Secretary-General &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; "to send a Technical Assessment Mission to the African Union headquarters and Somalia as soon as possible to report on the political and security situation and the possibility of a UN Peacekeeping Operation following the AU’s deployment."

&lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Trudeau"&gt;Justin Trudeau&lt;/a&gt;, the son of late former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Trudeau"&gt;Pierre Trudeau&lt;/a&gt;, will seek the federal &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal party&lt;/a&gt; nomination to run for office in the &lt;a href="w%3ARiding%23Canada"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3APapineau%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Papineau&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;.

Trudeau, 35, will run in the next federal election, widely expected this spring, if the Liberal party accepts his nomination, a regular practice in Canada to run for office.

"I admire his courage and I encourage him," said Liberal leader &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;. "It's not going to be easy."

"It's an absolute bonus that I'll be able to take back this riding for the Liberals," Trudeau told the CBC.

Pierre Trudeau, who was Canada's PM for 16-years straight, died at age 80 in 2000. His son is an avid speaker and supported &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; for leadership of the Liberal party. Kennedy backed out to support eventual winner Stéphane Dion and Trudeau did the same.

&lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVivian%20Barbot"&gt;Vivian Barbot&lt;/a&gt; is the current MP for the riding. Papineau is known as the poorest riding in Canada with an average annual household income of &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CAN&lt;/a&gt;$34,380. It is also the smallest riding in Canada.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpitzer%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Spitzer Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; made news this week when it was announced that the space observatory had, for the first time, captured enough light to detect molecules in the atmospheres of &lt;a href="w%3AExtrasolar%20planet"&gt;planets&lt;/a&gt; outside the solar system.

The planets are too far away to be observed directly with current technology, but by measuring the spectra of each planet when visible with its star, and again when the planet was hidden behind its star, the teams were able to determine the measurements of the planets spectra.

In a paper published in the February 22 issue of Nature, Dr. Jeremy Richardson of NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AGoddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center"&gt;Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt; presented measurements of &lt;a href="w%3AHD%20209458%20b"&gt;HD 209458 b&lt;/a&gt;, a hot, Jupiter-like planet located 153 light-years from Earth, in the constellation &lt;a href="w%3APegasus%20%28constellation%29"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt;. Richardson's team found a peak in the infrared spectra and was able to determine that the atmosphere of HD 209458 b likely consisted of clouds of silicate dust. Dr. Mark Swain of the &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; led another study of HD 209458 b, and found similar results.

Another team, led by Dr. Carl Grillmair of &lt;a href="w%3ASpitzer%20Science%20Center"&gt;Spitzer Science Center&lt;/a&gt; at Caltech, performed a similar study of &lt;a href="w%3AHD%20189733b"&gt;HD 189733b&lt;/a&gt;, 63 light-years away, in the constellation &lt;a href="w%3AVulpecula"&gt;Vulpecula&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Grillmair discusses the results: “It was believed to be fairly straightforward that these planets would have a lot of water in them, for one thing, very hot water. These planets, these hot Jupiters very, very close in to their parent stars are 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit or so, so it's not a pleasant place to live. And what we found instead and what the other group found for this completely different planet around another star, is that the spectrum is essentially flat. It really doesn’t show any of the features we would have expected from water.”

"The theorists' heads were spinning when they saw the data," adds Dr. Richardson. "It is virtually impossible for water, in the form of vapor, to be absent from the planet, so it must be hidden, probably by the dusty cloud layer we detected in our spectrum."

Dr. Grillmair: "The observations are showing us that things are not the way we expected them. And so there'll be a big push to get a lot more data while Spitzer is still alive. I think this will ultimately be one of the most important legacies of the Spitzer Space Telescope, unanticipated as it was before launch. I think it will become extremely important in the future." The telescope was launched in August of 2003 with a maximum expected life cycle of 5 years. 

"With these new observations, we are refining the tools that we will one day need to find life elsewhere if it exists," said Swain. "It's sort of like a dress rehearsal."

Dr. Swain's and Dr. Grillmair's studies are pending publication in Astrophysical Journal Letters.

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Dunne"&gt;Peter Dunne's&lt;/a&gt; proposition as the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; political party, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Future%20New%20Zealand"&gt;United Future&lt;/a&gt;, to have &lt;a href="w%3AWaitangi%20Day"&gt;Waitangi Day&lt;/a&gt; changed back to New Zealand Day failed.

The New Zealand Day bill would have created disharmony within the society according to parliamentary select committee, the Justice and Electoral Committee. But they do say that it could be a good idea for a completely new holiday to be created called New Zealand Day. 

"I welcome the advice from the committee that many of the submitters were in favour of retaining Waitangi Day and having another day set aside for a national day that will celebrate everything that's good about New Zealand and being a New Zealander," said Mr Dunne.

Mr Dunne said the reason for his proposed change was because since New Zealand is multi-cultural, then New Zealand's national day should be one about everybody and not one about grievance.

Mr Dunne says that he is still backing New Zealand Day in some form despite the rejection, as he is now considering many options, including changing the &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Official%20Birthday"&gt;Queen's Official Birthday&lt;/a&gt; holiday to New Zealand Day, and starting &lt;a href="w%3ADominion%20Day"&gt;Dominion Day&lt;/a&gt; back up. He says that he is now considering writing up a new bill to submit it to the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.

Waitangi day is on February 6, each year and celebrates the &lt;a href="w%3AWaitangi%2C%20Northland"&gt;Waitangi&lt;/a&gt; signing of New Zealand's founding document, the &lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20of%20Waitangi"&gt;Treaty of Waitangi&lt;/a&gt; (Te Tiriti o Waitangi).

Flights from &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; will operate three times a week between November and March, to coincide with the peak travel season between the two destinations, as Canadians escape winter and New Zealand skiers head to the Canadian slopes. 46,000 Canadians visit New Zealand and 16,000 New Zealanders visit Canada each year, starting at the end of this year. 

The reinstatement of the Vancouver link restores a route phased out in the 1990s.

Canadian visitors make up two percent of international visitor arrivals, however they stay longer and spend more in New Zealand than many other visitors spent an average of 29 days in New Zealand in 2006, and spent almost $3400 each. In total, they contributed $136 million to New Zealand's economy.

Tourism New Zealand chief executive, George Hickton has said that the direct flights will make New Zealand look much more appealing to the Canadian market. "This is great news for our tourism industry."

The Tourism Industry Association New Zealand say that the new route has the added benefit of freeing up seats on Air New Zealand's busy routes from San Francisco and Los Angeles.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; MP and former leadership candidate &lt;a href="Bill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt; says he will not run for re-election in his riding of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Centre"&gt;Toronto Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Graham, 67, made the announcement to the executive of his &lt;a href="Toronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; riding association Thursday night.

&lt;a href="Bob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt;, former NDP premier of &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; from 1990 to 1995 and Liberal leadership candidate, will announce his candidancy for the Liberal nomination in the riding in the coming days, according to reports. Toronto lawyer Meredith Cartwright and United Church minister Rob Oliphant are also expected to contest the nomination which will likely be decided in April.

Rae spoke of Graham's experience but made his election intentions secret. Rae does not have a seat in Parliament.

"[Graham] has been a great representative of Toronto Centre ... and a terrific minister. Today is certainly not about speculation, it is about Bill," said Rae. "I shall be making my intentions known in the very near future."

Graham was a lawyer before entering politics and has served in cabinet and as interim Liberal leader in opposition. He has served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of National Defence under Prime Ministers &lt;a href="Jean%20Chr%C3%A9tien"&gt;Jean Chrétien&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; respectively. In 2006, when the Conservatives took power and Paul Martin stepped down, he was appointed interim leader of the party until &lt;a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt; was elected.

In &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, the Internal Security Forces (ISF) found bomb-making equipment in three separate caches on Thursday, two days after a bomb was discovered in Beirut. This had stroke fears among many Lebanese who were still dramatized by recent bus bombings and street clashes. A wooden box, armed with nineteen &lt;a href="w%3ATrinitrotoluene"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; sticks, was found in Beirut's Christian neighborhood, &lt;a href="w%3AAchrafieh"&gt;Achrafieh&lt;/a&gt;, by a scrap collector. The box was found in a dumpster on Hikmeh Avenue leading to Corniche al-Nahr, facing the Murr Television Station and the Mont Liban Radio building.

The box of TNT sticks was found approximately at 8:30 a.m. The police immediately rushed to the scene and cut off the city from the public to disarm the bomb.

Half an hour later, employees of Lebanon's privatized waste management company, Sukleen, found an aluminum box packed with thirteen detonators. The box was found about 200 meters away from the wooden one.

By the end of the day, bombs were found on the road leading to the Kesrouan village of Ghbaleh, the National News Agency (NNA) reported. However, NNA stated that the bombs were not meant to explode. ISF's investigation was immediately conducted.

A 13-year-old male student, Clay Moore, from &lt;a href="w%3AParrish%2C%20Florida"&gt;Parrish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, was abducted at gunpoint earlier this morning shortly before 9:00 AM while waiting for his school bus with about 15 other students. A male believed to be around 30 years old and reportedly between 5 feet, 7 inches and 5 feet, 8 inches, drove up and motioned him into his faded red extended-cab pickup truck. Witnesses reported that Moore, a student at Manatee School for the Arts, told the unknown abductor, "Sir, I don't know you." before leaving with the man, who looked Hispanic or like a white male "with a dark tan". A student on the scene called 911 to inform the authorities of the abduction. An Amber Alert was put out for Moore, who is about 5 feet tall and was wearing a Manatee School for the Arts jacket over a green polo shirt.

Clay Moore was found later, near Kibbler Ranch off of State Road 64, according to Sheriff Charlie Wells, with no visible injuries. He used a cell phone to call his mother and tell her that he was safe. "We believe it was somebody else's cell phone, somebody that was rendering aid to him, and allowed him to use the phone," Wells said.

The abductor has not been located as of now, but the authorities are investigating.

The reason for the fight was because Senators player &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Neil"&gt;Chris Neil&lt;/a&gt;, #25, caught the co-captain of the Sabres, &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Drury"&gt;Chris Drury&lt;/a&gt;, #23 with an elbow while he wasn't looking. The hit caused the co-captain to fall to the ice, stunned, with a possible concussion. Drury is said to be out for an undetermined amount of time.

Shortly after Drury was escorted off the ice, &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Mair"&gt;Adam Mair&lt;/a&gt; of the Sabres hit &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Spezza"&gt;Jason Spezza&lt;/a&gt; of the Senators just before the face-off following the incident with Drury which sparked the fight between all of the 12 players on both teams, including both goalies, &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Biron"&gt;Martin Biron&lt;/a&gt; of the Sabres and &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt; of the Senators, who were both thrown out of the game. Emery had just returned to the ice rink after he was suspended for three games when he slashed &lt;a href="w%3AMaxim%20Lapierre"&gt;Maxim Lapierre&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%20Canadiens"&gt;Montreal Canadians&lt;/a&gt;.

During the physical brawl with the players, both coaches Ruff and Murray were yelling at each other and at one point Ruff began to jump over walls separating the two teams from the penalty boxes however neither of the coaches ended up in a physical brawl.

"When something like that happens to one of your star players, you have to respond. The players did the right thing. You can't respond any other way," said Ruff in regards to the brawl between the players.

Murray accuses Ruff of sending several players to the ice in what he says was the initiation of the fight.

"I put out skill players and he sends out the five guys on his team that are going to start a fight," said Murray.

Ruff first denied that he sent players to the ice to start the fight saying "I'm not going to comment on what I had on my mind" in a press conference after the game, but then said he said "go out and run 'em."

As a result of the brawl, these penalties were handed out:

A 9 Carriage &lt;a href="w%3APendolino"&gt;Class 390 Pendolino&lt;/a&gt; train, with as many as 180 people onboard, operated by &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Trains"&gt;Virgin Trains&lt;/a&gt; has derailed and crashed in , &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

The train was the 17:15 service from London's &lt;a href="w%3AEuston%20railway%20station"&gt;Euston Station&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow%20Central%20railway%20station"&gt;Glasgow Central&lt;/a&gt;. Witnesses said that several passengers have broken bones. All but one carriage have slid down the embankment and all of the carriages were derailed. 5 people are still seriously injured in hospital, including the driver Ian Black, and 11 people altogether are still in hospital. Hospital reports early on Saturday morning indicate 1 death, 84 year old lady Margaret Masson from Glasgow.

"It's our understanding there are a number of people injured on the train. We think there are numerous injuries," said a spokesman for the Cumbria Fire and Rescue squad, Brian Mitchelhill.

"A train has crashed between Oxenholme and Tebay, but that is all we know at the moment. We have got two cars travelling there now and local police are attending," said a spokeswoman for the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Transport%20Police"&gt;British Transport Police&lt;/a&gt;.

At least twelve ambulances and at least five fire trucks are at the scene, along with 3 &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Air%20Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWestland%20Sea%20King"&gt;Sea King&lt;/a&gt; helicopters, two mountain rescue teams and one police helicopter. The rescue effort was hampered by limited access to the remote site and poor weather conditions. 

"At the moment, we have reports of various injuries, from leg injuries to back injuries and head injuries -- ranging from minor to quite serious," said an unnamed ambulance official.
"The carriage I am in is completely on its side, it did a sort of bump - and I was thinking don't worry this fine - but then the swaying became very dramatic," said a &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; executive, Caroline Thomson. "Where I am there are some injuries - a woman with a very badly hurt back but I suspect further up the train it's a bit more serious."

First reports suggested that the train hit something on the track at 20:15 near &lt;a href="w%3AGrayrigg"&gt;Grayrigg&lt;/a&gt;, between &lt;a href="w%3AOxenholme"&gt;Oxenholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATebay"&gt;Tebay&lt;/a&gt;, derailed and slid down an &lt;a href="w%3AEmbankment"&gt;embankment&lt;/a&gt;. Early investigators reports say a set of &lt;a href="w%3ARailroad%20switch"&gt;points&lt;/a&gt; will be the primary focus of the investigation. All but one of the train's carriages are said to have totally come off the tracks, a spokeswoman said. 

So far 12 passengers have been taken to The Royal &lt;a href="w%3APreston"&gt;Preston&lt;/a&gt; Hospital, where three casualties are said to be in a "critical condition" and one serious. 3 passengers with limb injuries are at the Royal &lt;a href="w%3ALancaster%2C%20Lancashire"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; Infirmary. People with minor injuries were taken to a nearby farm before being transferred to a Kendal hotel.

As of 22:16, Sleeper services over the affected line have been suspended. Other major services are terminating at Preston or &lt;a href="w%3ACarlisle"&gt;Carlisle&lt;/a&gt; according to (UK) National Rail Enquires. A five mile cordon has been set up to seal the crash site as investigators from the &lt;a href="w%3ARail%20Accident%20Investigation%20Branch"&gt;Rail Accident Investigation Branch&lt;/a&gt; attempt to determine the cause of the crash.

Virgin owner &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Branson"&gt;Richard Branson&lt;/a&gt; came to the site from his holiday in &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; and held a press conference at a safe distance, roughly 200 meters, from the site. Branson stated that the Virgin Train Pendolino was "built like a tank", and believed the track was to blame. All of the carriages retained their integrity and none of the windows broke. Mr Branson also praised the driver of the train for attempting to stop the train and not leaving the cockpit.

&lt;a href="w%3ANetwork%20Rail"&gt;Network Rail&lt;/a&gt; has checked 700 sets of rail points in response to the accident, though no speed restrictions have been imposed.

Researchers with the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Calgary"&gt;University of Calgary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; have found that &lt;a href="w%3AProlactin"&gt;prolactin&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone produced during pregnancy, may reverse the progression of &lt;a href="w%3AMultiple%20Sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), according to a paper published this week in The Journal of Neuroscience.

The study, led by Drs. Samuel Weiss and V. Wee Yong of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute, compared virgin and pregnant mice with MS-like lesions introduced by &lt;a href="w%3ALysolecithin"&gt;lysolecithin&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical which destroys the myelin sheaths around neurons. They found the pregnant mice developed smaller lesions and fewer damaged neurons, and showed signs of repaired neurons. They also found the pregnant mice had higher levels of cells called &lt;a href="w%3AOligodendrocytes"&gt;oligodendrocytes&lt;/a&gt;, which create myelin and are able to repair some damaged neurons through &lt;a href="w%3Aremyelination"&gt;remyelination&lt;/a&gt;. Because prolactin regulates the levels of precursors of oligodendrocytes, the scientists hypothesized that prolactin levels were responsible for the differences in damage. They also tested virgin mice given additional prolactin, and found results similar to pregnant mice.
Previous studies have shown that other hormones could reduce myelin damage, but this is the first study to show a mechanism to reverse myelin damage, and establish an empirical connection between that mechanism and pregnancy. Dr. Weiss says, “It is thought that during pregnancy, women’s immune systems no longer destroyed the myelin. However, no previous study has tested whether pregnancy actually results in the production of new myelin, which may lead to improvement of symptoms. "We're excited about this result because it suggests to us that prolactin has the potential to be used to enhance the production of new myelin.”

Dr. William McIlroy, national medical advisor for the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada, explains the significance of this study: “The results of this study should be well received by people living with MS today. It represents a new insight of how we might be able to reverse some of the effects of the disease and improve the quality of life for those who live under its influence.” 
Dr. Luanne Metz, director of the Calgary MS Clinic in the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary and Calgary Health Region, adds, “This discovery has the potential to take MS therapy a step further than current treatments that stabilize the disease in its early stages. By promoting repair, which is the goal of prolactin therapy, we have hope of actually improving symptoms in people with MS.”

Further animal studies need to be done to examine the possibility of side effects, such as lactation in men and non-pregnant women, as well as increased inflammation which could worsen the MS. Researchers believe human trials may begin within a few years.

Funding and support were provided by the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Institutes%20of%20Health%20Research"&gt;Canadian Institutes of Health Research&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMultiple%20Sclerosis%20Society%20of%20Canada"&gt;Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research and the Stem Cell Network.

MS is an &lt;a href="w%3AAutoimmune%20Diseases"&gt;autoimmune disease&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Nervous%20System"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt; where the body attacks the fatty &lt;a href="w%3AMyelin"&gt;myelin&lt;/a&gt; which helps nerves carry electrical signals, causing muscle weakness and spasming which may lead to disability. MS affects approximately one of every 1000 people in North America, northern Europe and Australasia.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; ambassador to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AZalmay%20Khalilzad"&gt;Zalmay Khalilzad&lt;/a&gt;, apologized today to &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Aziz%20al-Hakim"&gt;Abdul Aziz al-Hakim&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the largest political party in the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Council%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Iraqi Council of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, for the detention of his son.

"I am sorry about the arrest.We don't know the circumstances of the arrest and we are investigating ... but he is being released," the U.S. ambassador said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAmmar%20al-Hakim"&gt;Ammar al-Hakim&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, is a cleric with an important position in his father's political movement. He and his six bodyguards were detained by U.S. troops near the border, while crossing into Iraq from &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. All seven were released within 12 hours. A U.S. military spokesman said more information would be released "as it becomes available".

A condemnation of the detention was delivered to the U.S. Department of State by al-Hakim's party &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Council%20for%20the%20Islamic%20Revolution%20in%20Iraq"&gt;SCIRI&lt;/a&gt;. The party suggested on affiliated TV stations that protesters might be sent out onto the streets to show opposition to the arrest.

A huge sinkhole in the earth swallowed about a dozen houses in a poor neighborhood of the capital of &lt;a href="Guatemala"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;. Three people died when the 330-ft-deep hole opened up on February 23. The police decided to evacuate some 1,000 people in the Guatemala City neighborhood.

The bodies of Domingo Irma and David Soyos were recovered from the hole and surrounding sewage water.

Officials speaking to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; blamed recent rains and a ruptured sewage main for the massive hole.

<h1>XM and Sirius announce merger deal</h1>
&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=XM%20and%20Sirius%20announce%20merger%20deal&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On 19 February 2007, &lt;a href="w%3AXM%20Satellite%20Radio"&gt;XM Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASirius%20Satellite%20Radio"&gt;Sirius Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt; announced a move that will change the face of satellite radio in the United States and Canada: XM and Sirius will be merging, creating a single satellite radio provider.

Multi-million dollar losses, combined with increasing competition from &lt;a href="w%3Ainternet%20radio"&gt;internet radio&lt;/a&gt;, downloadable music, and HD radio were factors in this merger. 

Mel Karmazin, CEO of Sirius Satellite Radio, described the problem: "We don't want to take subscribers from XM. We won't make money that way. We need new subscribers." Likewise, XM executives say they can't succeed by stealing Sirius subscribers. This leaves both companies with the problem of attracting new customers and distinguishing their brand, while at the same time trying to convince potential customers to pay $12.95 a month for radio, something that people are used to getting for free. Even if one company were to force the other out of the marketplace, the remaining company would have won a Pyrrhic victory, without enough capital remaining to take advantage of the situation.

The solution: make a deal now, while both companies are both strong and in a position to expand their technologies and services. That's exactly what they plan to do: In press releases and news postings on both of their web sites, both companies have pledged to make the combined company better than either service by itself. "You've heard of 1+1=3," &lt;a href="w%3AMel%20Karmazin"&gt;Karmazin&lt;/a&gt; said during an invester conference call, "that's what this is."

Pending approval of the deal, each share of XM stock will be replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius. Each company's stockholders will retain approximately 50% of the joined company. Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin will retain his CEO title in the new company, and XM chairman &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Parsons"&gt;Gary Parsons&lt;/a&gt; will retain his. XM CEO Hugh Panero will retain his position until the merger is complete, which should happen near the end of 2007.

A PDF presentation of the call is available &lt;a href="http%3A//investor.sirius.com/downloads/InvestorPresentation022007.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<h2>Opposition</h2>

Several consumer and community groups have come out in opposition to the merge. 

<ul>
BULLET::::- In a strongly worded press release on February 19, 2007, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20Broadcasters"&gt;National Association of Broadcasters&lt;/a&gt; decried the plan, stating that the merger would create a monopoly in the United States &lt;a href="w%3Asatellite%20radio"&gt;satellite radio&lt;/a&gt; market.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- A group of law students formed an organization known as the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.c3sr.org"&gt;Consumer Coalition for Competition in Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt;, with the purpose of stopping the merger. The C3SR is composed of law students, all of whom subscribe to XM or Sirius Satellite Radio. Their major argument is that this would create a monopoly in the satellite radio, which would increase prices, reduce consumer choice, and subsidize unwanted services. Chris Reale, a founder of C3SR, said "If this merger is permitted to go forward, there will be no protection of competition and there will be no competitors."

</ul>
<h2>Support</h2>
In the initial merger press release, Sirius and XM asserted that satellite radio is part of the audio entertainment industry rather than an industry of its own, and as such competes with traditional terrestrial &lt;a href="w%3Aradio"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHD%20Radio"&gt;HD Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;s and on-line radio. The resultant company will be subject to regulation pre- and post-merger by the &lt;a href="w%3AFCC"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Trade%20Commission"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and possibly other federal organizations. The FCC has issued a statement saying that a merger is not without its hurdles, and that they will want assurances that price, quality, and consumer choice will be protected.

Based on C3SR's blog posts and Internet forum posts on various fan sites, it is apparent that many subscribers are looking forward to the deal. Speculation abounds on what the new receivers will look like, and how customers' existing hardware will fit in to the new plan. 

While many of the facts concerning the merger are not yet known: what the new company will be called, exactly which programming the new company will carry, and when customers will need to upgrade their hardware, one thing is for certain: Satellite radio in North America is in for one big change.

Specifically, Arbitron claims that the average satellite radio listener listens to 14 hours of terrestrial radio for every 10 hours of satellite raadio. Posts on two XM Radio fan sites dispute these findings: &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xmfan.com/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D77291"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.xmfan.com/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D77291"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

At this point, it's unlikely that a decision will be rendered until 2008, making this even more of a political football: With more primary elections happening at the beginning of 2008, the announcement will likely be made amidst serious Presidential primary campaigning.

<h2>More information</h2>
For more information on the merger, including background on the merger and on both companies, see the .

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
The same questions keep popping up on forum posts, blog posts, and even news articles over and over again. We will address some of those here, but keep in mind that this section is speculation, and that things could change at any time. However, this is based on the most current information that is available, and as news is presented that conflicts with or supports this information, it will be updated to remain current.

<dl>
BULLET::::- Will I need a new radio?: The answer is "maybe". Conflicting reports have been popping up from different people in Sirius. Both companies have made statements that subscribers' existing receivers will continue to work. However, some people involved with Sirius have said that duplicates will be removed. The problem is that there is only room for so many channels, and if the company wants to bring new content, some channels will have to be removed. Also, there is no cost savings in running all of the existing channels. Most of the music stations on each network have a parallel station on the other network. Also, the duplicate simulcast stations (CNN and Fox, for example) can be cut from one network. Without having exact figures, it's likely that Sirius and XM together could cut 1/3 or more of their channels without losing content. Under this scenario, it's possible that one set of radios would lose an entire genre of music, such as XM losing its Urban category and Sirius losing its rock category.

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- Will the universal receiver fix this?: Yes. It can receive and decode signals from both satellites. However, it is not being produced yet, and probably won't until the merger is either complete or is a "sure thing."

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- Will XM listeners get Stern? Will Sirius listeners get Oprah?: The most popular shows will probably be simulcast to both networks, but there is not enough bandwidth to completely duplicate all of the shows on both networks. So Howard Stern and Oprah, for example, will probably make their way to the other network. This will almost certainly happen at the expense of other programming. What will suffer is anybody's guess.

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- What about price?: Karmazin and others have said again and again that they do not want to raise prices. But the exact interpretation of their statements is vague. Probably, you will get the same channels you get now for your $12.95 a month, and to get more content (such as Stern for XM listeners), you will need to pay a little bit more. How much more? Nobody knows.

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- What about signal issues?: Signals from the XM satellites will work just like they do now, and the same goes for Sirius signals. Things would only change if some channels are moved to the other network (or cut in favor of a similar channel on the other network).

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- What about Clear Channel programming?: Clear Channel Communications has an agreement with XM and is a shareholder in the company. It is likely that Clear Channel will end its relationship with XM in 2008. For more information, see &lt;a href="w%3AXM_Satellite_Radio%23Clear_Channel_programming_agreement"&gt;XM Satellite Radio on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- Will the audio quality get better? worse?: Nobody knows. Hopefully, part of the process of duplicating channels will be that some bandwidth is freed up and will improve the overall audio quality of both services, but it's just as likely that the bandwidth will get used for something else, and that neither service will improve.

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- Should I wait before buying a radio?: By all accounts, no major changes will occur until 2008 or later, and the universal tuner probably wouldn't be available until even later. So if you choose to wait, you will be waiting for more than a year.

The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; won an exciting game Friday in Miami, as they defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Panthers"&gt;Florida Panthers&lt;/a&gt;.

The Penguins, just off of a 16 game winning streak after dropping one to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Islanders"&gt;New York Islanders&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, had some goalie controversy as to who will start the game. Penguins coach &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Therrien"&gt;Michel Therrien&lt;/a&gt; had said that he was unhappy with the play of goalie &lt;a href="w%3AMarc-Andre%20Fleury"&gt;Marc-Andre Fleury&lt;/a&gt; against the Islanders. As a result of this, goalie &lt;a href="w%3AJocelyn%20Thibault"&gt;Jocelyn Thibault&lt;/a&gt; got the nod to start for the Pens on Thursday. There was also a goalie problem for the Panthers, as &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Auld"&gt;Alex Auld&lt;/a&gt; (Panthers starting goalie) had suffered an injury in a previous game and was out for the night. Instead, they started the old veteran &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Belfour"&gt;Ed Belfour&lt;/a&gt;, who did a good job, stoping the puck 39 of the 41 shots he faced, which is a solid outing for any goalie. But it would be Jocelyn Thibault who outdid him, stopping 32 of 33 shots on goal.

Goal scoring was rather low, though, with &lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20Staal"&gt;Jordan Staal&lt;/a&gt; (Powerplay) and &lt;a href="w%3AColby%20Armstrong"&gt;Colby Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; (Game winner, Overtime) scoring for the Penguins and &lt;a href="w%3AJuraj%20Koln%C3%ADk"&gt;Juraj Kolník&lt;/a&gt; scoring for the Panthers. Assists were credited to &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaxime%20Talbot"&gt;Maxime Talbot&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Whitney"&gt;Ryan Whitney&lt;/a&gt; for the Pens and &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Gratton"&gt;Chris Gratton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Allen%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Bryan Allen&lt;/a&gt; for the Panthers. The Three Stars of the game were given to Colby Armstrong (First Star), Jocelyn Thibault (Second Star),and Ed Belfour (Third Star).

All in all, this game was well played and was a solid win for the streaking Penguins. Pittsburgh will travel across the state to face the surging &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%20Bay%20Lightning"&gt;Tampa Bay Lightning&lt;/a&gt; this Sunday.

The first leg of the round of sixteen in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was completed on Wednesday, with at least one controversial result, and a bag full of ties. The leg began on Tuesday with four games, and the other four were played the next day, including reigning champions &lt;a href="FC%20Barcelona"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Real Madrid (Spain) 3 - 2 Bayern Munich (Germany)</h3>

English star &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Beckham"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; started the game for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGal%C3%A1ctico"&gt;Galácticos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , while Canadian/Englishman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOwen%20Hargreaves"&gt;Owen Hargreaves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; started his first game back after injury for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Bayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Madrid came out fast, with David Beckham passing it to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARuud%20van%20Nistelrooy"&gt;Ruud van Nistelrooy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who slid in a tidy pass to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARa%C3%BAl%20Gonz%C3%A1lez"&gt;Raúl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who slid the ball past &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20Kahn"&gt;Oliver Kahn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the bottom right corner of the net. Bayern struck back within 13 minutes, after a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWilly%20Sagnol"&gt;Willy Sagnol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; free kick was headed home by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALucimar%20Ferreira%20da%20Silva"&gt;Lúcio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Madrid kept up the fight, and 5 minutes later, Raúl was on the score sheet again after heading home a David Beckham corner kick. Real increased their lead 5 minutes later, when Ruud van Nistelrooy slotted home a redirected Beckham free kick. Bayern was able to grab a crucial late away goal via &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20van%20Bommel"&gt;Mark van Bommel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h3>PSV Eindhoven (Holland) 1 - 0 Arsenal (England)</h3>

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were without several key players due to their upcoming &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20League%20Cup"&gt;Carling cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; final against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this weekend, but star &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThierry%20Henry"&gt;Thierry Henry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was in the squad along with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEmmanuel%20Adebayor"&gt;Emmanuel Adebayor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a strike partner. The only goal came in the 61'st minute, when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdison%20M%C3%A9ndez"&gt;Edison Méndez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shot a low screamer past &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJens%20Lehmann"&gt;Jens Lehmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from around 25 yards from goal.

<h3>Lille (France) 0 - 1 Manchester United (England)</h3>
In a game ripe with controversy, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United%20F.C."&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; walked away with a crucial away win after a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Giggs"&gt;Ryan Giggs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; free kick gave them the lead. &lt;a href="w%3ALille%20OSC"&gt;Lille&lt;/a&gt; protested the goal, saying the team was setting up its wall at the time Giggs took the kick, and the team nearly left the pitch. After goading by officials, the game was resumed, but Lille said it would be making a stake for a replay with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . UEFA has rejected the claim and declared the goal valid, as well as deciding to "instigate proceedings against Lille for the improper behaviour of their players immediately after the goal."

<h3>Celtic (Scotland) 0 - 0 A.C. Milan (Italy)</h3>
A spirited draw both sides played competitively, but neither had a finishing flourish to seal the points.

<h3>Roma (Italy) 0 - 0 Lyon (France)</h3>
Another goalless draw, this game lacked discipline. English referee Mike Riley issued 11 yellow cards, 8 for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AA.S.%20Roma"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; alone.

<h3>Inter Milan (Italy) 2 - 2 Valencia (Spain)</h3>

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AF.C.%20Inter%20Milan"&gt;Inter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; came into this game on a 15 game winning league in domestic play, while &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AValencia%20CF"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as also been hot in the Spanish league as of late. Inter struck first with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEsteban%20Cambiasso"&gt;Cambiasso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pouncing on a rebound after &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZlatan%20Ibrahimovi%C4%87"&gt;Ibrahimović&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; redirection of a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALu%C3%ADs%20Figo"&gt;Figo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; freekick was fabulously saved by goalie &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASantiago%20Ca%C3%B1izares"&gt;Cañizares&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Valencia replied in the second half with a free kick by David Villa Sanchez form 30 yards. Inter restored their lead just over 10 minutes later, as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaicon%20Douglas%20Sisenando"&gt;Maicon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; slotted home a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJulio%20Ricardo%20Cruz"&gt;Julio Cruz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pass. As the game wound down, Valancia pressed, and were rewarded with a goal by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Silva"&gt;Silva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a volley ensuing from a corner.

<h3>Porto (Portugal) 1 - 1 Chelsea (England)</h3>
Both goals happened early in this game, with the home side taking the lead after 12 minutes. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARa%C3%BAl%20Meireles"&gt;Raúl Meireles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; volleyed a ball towards the net, and after a deflection of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Lampard"&gt;Frank Lampard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's knee, the ball beat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APetr%20%C4%8Cech"&gt;Petr Čech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; low. Chelsea leveled only 4 minutes later, when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArjen%20Robben"&gt;Arjen Robben&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; jetted down the sideline and crossed the ball into the middle, where &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndriy%20Shevchenko"&gt;Andriy Shevchenko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; slotted the ball into the bottom corner.

<h3>Barcelona (Spain) 1 - 2 Liverpool (England)</h3>
This game saw the current champions taking on the champions of the year previous. Barcelona came out strong, and Brazilian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADeco"&gt;Deco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored early, heading in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGianluca%20Zambrotta"&gt;Zambrotta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cross. Liverpool leveled just before half time, with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Bellamy"&gt;Craig Bellamy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; heading a ball across the net, and out of the reach of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AV%C3%ADctor%20Vald%C3%A9s"&gt;Víctor Valdés&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . After the break, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Arne%20Riise"&gt;John Arne Riise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gave Liverpool a crucial away win, as he cleared home a Bellamy pass after some poor defending by Barcelona.

Governor &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Pawlenty"&gt;Tim Pawlenty&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; signed a bill into law on Thursday that requires the state to generate a significant amount of its energy needs from renewable sources.

The amount of power generated by wind turbines in the state stands now at 895 megawatts. An additional 5,000 megawatts of energy from renewable sources will need to be added to Minnesota's electricity resources, which is roughly eight times more than the amount that currently comes from renewables. 

The bill signed by the Governor requires energy companies to provide 25 percent of power from renewable sources by 2025. 

&lt;a href="w%3AXcel%20Energy"&gt;Xcel Energy&lt;/a&gt;, which supplies approximately half of the electricity in the state, is required to provide 30 percent from renewable sources by 2020.

<h1>Italy: President Napolitano dismisses Prodi's resignation</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Italy%3A%20President%20Napolitano%20dismisses%20Prodi%27s%20resignation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The President of the &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGiorgio%20Napolitano"&gt;Giorgio Napolitano&lt;/a&gt;, has asked &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt; today to stay on as Prime Minister, but Prodi will need to pass a confidence vote as soon as possible. After two days of consultation among Italian party leaders, Napolitano called on Saturday a press conference to explain his decision.

Napolitano stated that Prodi's coalition, &lt;a href="w%3Al%27Unione"&gt;l'Unione&lt;/a&gt;, is ready to support unanimously its Prime Minister, above all after the drafting of the twelve points agreement about the main political issues. The President rejected the proposal from the centre-right opposition to call for fresh elections, because Italy needs a new electoral law, and there was no consensus to form a broad interim government.

The confidence votes, both in &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Chamber%20of%20Deputies"&gt;Italian Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;, will be held in the coming week.

Thanks to the vote of independent Senator &lt;a href="w%3ALuigi%20Pallaro"&gt;Luigi Pallaro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Follini"&gt;Marco Follini&lt;/a&gt;, leader of a centrist movement, and the votes of four senators for life (&lt;a href="w%3ACarlo%20Azeglio%20Ciampi"&gt;Carlo Azeglio Ciampi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEmilio%20Colombo"&gt;Emilio Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARita%20Levi%20Montalcini"&gt;Rita Levi Montalcini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOscar%20Luigi%20Scalfaro"&gt;Oscar Luigi Scalfaro&lt;/a&gt;), the centre-left coalition could trust in a majority of 162 votes in Senate. The centre-right coalition, instead, has some 155 votes, although it is unknown how the ex-senator of the "&lt;a href="w%3AItaly%20of%20Values"&gt;Italia dei Valori&lt;/a&gt;" Sergio De Gregorio and the life-senators &lt;a href="w%3AGiulio%20Andreotti"&gt;Giulio Andreotti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrancesco%20Cossiga"&gt;Francesco Cossiga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASergio%20Pininfarina"&gt;Sergio Pininfarina&lt;/a&gt; will vote.

&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; took on &lt;a href="w%3AFulham%20F.C."&gt;Fulham&lt;/a&gt; today at &lt;a href="w%3ACraven%20Cottage"&gt;Craven Cottage&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; leaders hoping to open a 9 point gap above second place &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20FC"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, who are not playing this weekend in the league. Fulham on the other hand needs points to stay out of the relegation zone, and wanted to pull 12 clear of 18th place &lt;a href="w%3ACharlton%20Athletic"&gt;Charlton Athletic&lt;/a&gt;. Both teams fielded strong starting sides with Fulham playing &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Radzinski"&gt;Thomasz Radzinski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20McBride"&gt;Brian McBride&lt;/a&gt;. The Red Devils starting 11 included &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Larsson"&gt;Henrik Larsson&lt;/a&gt;, the on-loan striker from &lt;a href="w%3AHelsingborgs"&gt;Helsingborgs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt; as his strike partner, and the &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href="w%3AChristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Christiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; in the midfield.
Fulham started out the game strongly, with a &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Davies"&gt;Simon Davies&lt;/a&gt; volley which was thumped just right of &lt;a href="w%3AEdwin%20Van%20Der%20Sar"&gt;Edwin Van Der Sar&lt;/a&gt;'s post. After 17 minutes, United defender &lt;a href="w%3ANemanja%20Vidic"&gt;Nemanja Vidic&lt;/a&gt; got tied up with his goal keeper, and Brian McBride was able to sweep in the ball off the post, giving Fulham a deserved lead. With United in need of some inspiration, Ronaldo banged a shot just wide of the net. On 19 minutes, Wayne Rooney made a run down the right side, and crossed the ball to skipper &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Giggs"&gt;Ryan Giggs&lt;/a&gt; who clipped the ball off the outside of his boot, and into the opposite side of the goal, tying the match. Evra should have put the leaders in front, but his wide open volley was dragged wide and the game went into halftime drawn 1 - 1.
After the break, Fulham came out stronger yet again, and Van Der Sar was forced to make a great one handed save off Davies shot. On 52 minutes, Van Der Sar could only watch as Thomas Radzinski blasted a header off his crossbar, but did not drop into the net. Van Der Sar earned his money this day, as he was forced into another spectacular save after a Brian McBride shot was aimed for the bottom corner, but was denied by the Dutchman. With the clock winding down, United began to pressure, and Christiano Ronaldo had an inspired run, beating out three defenders, and lashing the ball into the bottom right corner of the net, past Jan Lastuvka, giving the Red Devils a 2 - 1 lead with only 2 minutes remaining in normal time. Fulham pressed for an equilizer, but Manchester prevailed, continuing their winning run this season.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20Canada"&gt;Supreme Court of Canada&lt;/a&gt; has ruled unanimously 9-0, in favour of a ruling that overturns controversial anti-terror legislation that allowed the &lt;a href="w%3ACSIS"&gt;Canadian Security Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; to indefinitely detain suspects without revealing the reason for their arrest or detention.

The judgement, summarised by Justice &lt;a href="w%3ABeverley%20McLachlin"&gt;Beverley McLachlin&lt;/a&gt; in the ruling, gave &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Parliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; a one year &lt;a href="w%3AGrace%20period"&gt;grace period&lt;/a&gt; to create new legislation that will fall within &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20constitution"&gt;Canada's constitution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACharter%20of%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms"&gt;Charter&lt;/a&gt;.

The CSIS &lt;a href="w%3ASecurity%20certificate"&gt;security certificate&lt;/a&gt;s have caused five Canadians to spend years in prison since the &lt;a href="w%3A9/11"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; in the United States - accused of ties to terrorism, but without trial, and not even allowed to be informed of the evidence against them for reasons of national security.

The certificates only target Canadians who do not hold &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20citizen"&gt;citizenship&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="w%3Alanded%20immigrant"&gt;landed immigrants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Arefugee"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt;.

The three Canadian detainees who took their cause to the Supreme Court last June include Algerian-born &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Harkat"&gt;Mohamed Harkat&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%2C%20Canada"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, Syrian-born &lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Almrei"&gt;Hassan Almrei&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; and Moroccan-born &lt;a href="w%3AAdil%20Charkaoui"&gt;Adil Charkaoui&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Montreal"&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/a&gt;. The ruling also applies to Egyptian-born Canadians &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Jaballah"&gt;Mahmoud Jaballah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Zeki%20Mahjoub"&gt;Mohammad Mahjoub&lt;/a&gt;, both residents of Toronto.

A fast, but potent, snowstorm passing through the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; dropped more than a foot of snow and caused a 35-car pile-up on one of the U.S.'s major highways, &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2070"&gt;Interstate 70&lt;/a&gt;. 

The collision happened Saturday morning when white-out conditions, caused by 68 MPH sustained winds, hit the area. Despite the pileup, officials report that there were no major injuries. 

Interstate 70 was closed in both directions on Saturday, on a route from &lt;a href="w%3ADenver"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; state border, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation. The storm also forced the closure of 125 miles of highway on &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2080"&gt;Interstate 80&lt;/a&gt;. 

A blizzard warning remained in effect for parts of Kansas and &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20of%20America"&gt;Voice of America&lt;/a&gt; (VOA) marked its 65th anniversary Saturday amid plans to cancel radio broadcasts to many countries where press freedom is under attack. These program cuts are resisted by many former and current VOA journalists who see them as a dangerous departure from VOA's mission to support press freedom worldwide. The &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcasting%20Board%20of%20Governors"&gt;Broadcasting Board of Governors&lt;/a&gt; (BBG) - a bipartisan body managing VOA and other U.S. international broadcasts - plans to expand news coverage to the Middle East, North Korea and Latin America by eliminating or reducing programs to Russia, Tibet, China, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and a number of other media-at-risk countries. Acting with apparent approval from the White House, the BBG also want to eliminate VOA's flagship English radio broadcast News Now. 

Former and current VOA journalists who have criticized the BBG's plans as a betrayal of VOA's support for media freedom are circulating two online petitions asking the U.S. Congress to stop the proposed program cuts.

One of the petitions specifically opposes the planned elimination of VOA Uzbek radio broadcasts by pointing out that Uzbekistan's ruler Islam Karimov has effectively silenced political opposition and eliminated or forced underground nearly all independent media outlets. 
This is the second time the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) - bipartisan body in charge of U.S. international broadcasts - is trying to eliminate VOA radio programs to Uzbekistan. The BBG had stopped VOA Uzbek radio programs once before, in August 2004, but the pressure from the U.S. Congress and human rights groups forced the BBG to resume them in June 2005. 

This year the BBG is again trying to end VOA radio presence in Uzbekistan and in a number of other countries. In addition to VOA Uzbek radio programs, the BBG is planning to eliminate or reduce U.S. taxpayer-funded broadcasts to Kazakhstan, Russia, Tibet and China -- countries whose regimes were declared by the Paris-based nongovernmental organization &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; (RSF) as major violators of media freedom and freedom of expression. Uzbekistan's leader &lt;a href="w%3AIslam%20Karimov"&gt;Islam Karimov&lt;/a&gt;, Russia's President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, Kazakhstan's authoritarian ruler &lt;a href="Nursultan%20Nazarbayev"&gt;Nursultan Nazarbayev&lt;/a&gt; and China's leader &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; have been all called by Reporters Without Borders "Predators of Press Freedom."

The second online petition initiated by a former VOA Associate Director Ted Lipien focuses on the BBG plans to eliminate VOA Russian radio broadcasts. The petition asks the U.S. Congress to reject the proposed cuts and demand from the White House and the BBG a consistent U.S. international broadcasting strategy in support of freedom.

&lt;a href="w%3AFreeMediaOnline.org"&gt;FreeMediaOnline.org&lt;/a&gt;, a California-based nonprofit group founded to support freedom of the press worldwide, described these proposed cuts and reductions in U.S. international broadcasting as nothing less than a "gift to dictators and suppressors of press freedom." FreeMediaOnline.org believes that "this lack of consistency sends a terrible signal to defenders of freedom and courageous journalists around the world. Some of them, like independent Russian journalist &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Politkovskaya"&gt;Anna Politkovskaya&lt;/a&gt;, paid with their lives for exposing human rights violations. To make their voices heard, they have relied on VOA Russian radio programs which the White House and the BBG plan to eliminate." 

According to the BBG, some program cuts are necessary to fund expansion of U.S. broadcasts to Iran and to other major Muslim countries and regions. Critics such as FreeMediaOnline.org activists have pointed out, however, that there are many other noncritical programs within the U.S. international broadcasting bureaucracy controlled by the BBG. They maintain that reducing these support programs instead could easily pay for new programming to the Middle East and for the much needed enhancement and modernization of programs and program delivery to countries like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and China.

VOA first broadcast on shortwave to Nazi Germany February 24, 1942, just weeks after the United States entered World War Two. In that broadcast, news announcer William Harlan Hale told listeners, "The news may be good. The news may be bad. We shall tell you the truth."

VOA Director Dan Austin says although the technology of broadcasting may have changed in the intervening years, the Voice of America's adherence to its core mission remains the same. He says the agency will continue to honestly and accurately report the news. Austin did not address the issue of the program cuts demanded by the BBG and how they might affect VOA's mission. He was appointed to his position as VOA Director by the BBG.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iranian%20TV%20station%20announces%20first%20space%20rocket%20launch&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, the state-controlled TV station has announced that the country for the first time test-fired a &lt;a href="space"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; rocket, with scientific equipment aboard. "The first space rocket has been successfully launched into space," the station's website reported. The rocket was later reported not be designed to reach an orbit. Iran claims it reached an altitude of 94 miles and then parachuted home. No images have been released, and no other reports have confirmed the launch.

The announcement comes at a time of international tension over Iran's nuclear program. In a speech today, Iranian President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; compared his country's nuclear program with a train with no brakes and no reverse gear. Manouchehr Mohammadi, a deputy foreign minister, said the country had prepared itself for a standoff over its nuclear activities. Diplomats said that if Iran would possess advanced missile capabilities it would be of concern to the nations who believe Iran is developing nuclear weapons, something Iran denies.

The head of the Iranian space center, Mohsen Bahrami, was quoted saying that the scientific material on board came from the science and from the defence ministry. He also said that the test was in line with international regulations on the matter. Although the news would mean a significant breakthrough for Iran's missile technology, the story was only mentioned during one TV broadcast, and not at all by other official Iranian media.

Iran has said in the past it wants more satellites to increase its cellular phone and internet capabilities. It also said it hopes to become a center for science and technology in the region.

Since 2005, Iran already has one satellite in space, &lt;a href="w%3ASinah-1"&gt;Sinah-1&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched in &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; with a Russian rocket. The rocket was described as serving telecommunication and research purposes. Soon after the 2005 launch, Iran announced they would develop their own launcher. Yesterday, the Iranian Defence Minister spoke of Iran's plans for their own satellite launcher, and disclosed his country's desire to join the club of countries with a space program.

The former center of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConfederate%20States%20of%20America"&gt;Confederacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20War"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; became the first &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; slave state to issue such a proclamation.

"This session will be remembered for a lot of things, but 20 years hence I suspect one of those things will be the fact that we came together and passed this resolution," said Delegate A. Donald McEachin, a Democrat who sponsored it in the House of Delegates.

The resolution passed the Virginia House 96-0 and the Virginia Senate on voice vote. The resolution says government-sanctioned slavery "ranks as the most horrendous of all depredations of human rights and violations of our founding ideals in our nation’s history, and the abolition of slavery was followed by systematic discrimination, enforced segregation, and other insidious institutions and practices toward Americans of African descent that were rooted in racism, racial bias, and racial misunderstanding." The measure also expressed regret for "the exploitation of Native Americans."

"The resolution's wording was a compromise between House and Senate lawmakers who tweaked the language from issuing an apology, to expressing 'contrition,' to expressing 'profound regret,'" according to the ♡❤Richmond Times-Dispatch♡❤.

Prior to the cessation of slave importation, Virginia was a central hub in the slave trade. Historians estimate that more than 100,000 slaves passed through ports on the James River at Richmond, the state's capital.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMissouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are considering similar resolutions.

The officials from &lt;a href="CBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; stated on Monday that the company is going to invest in virtual world content developer Electric Sheep Co., which develops 3D properties in several virtual worlds like the one called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Life"&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In recent months corporate investors are paying more attention to virtual worlds. This is mainly due to the fact that the audience is shifting from TV to &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. Another advantage of virtual worlds is that they can help in marketing products and promoting brands.

The Interactive President of CBS, Quinsy Smith, sees the virtual worlds as platforms for the next generations. The Chief Executive of Electric Sheep, Sibley Verbeck, mentioned in an interview that the company has the goal of helping entertainment companies to gain their clients from virtual worlds like Second Life. Then Electric Sheep will provide more entertainment experiences for clientèle. With money invested by CBS, Electric Sheep plans to develop software that will create virtual worlds for mainstream consumption.

Electric Sheep developed several projects for CBS, including "The L-Word in Second Life". CBS also filmed a commercial within Second Life in order to promote its show called "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATwo%20and%20a%20Half%20Men"&gt;Two and a Half Men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

Currently Electric Sheep is developing inside Second Life a &lt;a href="Star%20Trek"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt;-themed area for CBS.

<h1>Chelsea beats Arsenal in Carling Cup</h1>

A heated showdown occurred in the all &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACarling%20Cup"&gt;Carling Cup&lt;/a&gt; final yesterday at &lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Stadium"&gt;Millennium Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Chelsea fielded a full strength side, including &lt;a href="w%3AAndriy%20Shevchenko"&gt;Andriy Shevchenko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ballack"&gt;Michael Ballack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADidier%20Drogba"&gt;Didier Drogba&lt;/a&gt;, and skipper &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Terry"&gt;John Terry&lt;/a&gt;. Arsenal on the other hand fielded a young side, including &lt;a href="w%3ATheo%20Walcott"&gt;Theo Walcott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACesc%20Fabregas"&gt;Cesc Fabregas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJeremie%20Aliadiere"&gt;Jeremie Aliadiere&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Hoyte"&gt;Justin Hoyte&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite their apparent lack of experience, Arsenal started out the match strongly, with crisp passing and great control. They pressed their advantage, and forced Chelsea keeper &lt;a href="w%3APetr%20Cech"&gt;Petr Cech&lt;/a&gt; into several saves. On 12 minutes, Theo Walcott struck gold, as he orcestrated a give and go with &lt;a href="w%3AAbou%20Diaby"&gt;Abou Diaby&lt;/a&gt; and slotted the ball into the far corner of the net, scoring his first ever goal for the Gunners. Soon after, Baptista of Arsenal had a legitimate claim for a penalty, but referee Howard Webb wouldn't hear of it. Chelsea struck back quickly, and a hint of offside was shown as Didier Drogba was played in by an over the top ball by Michael Ballack. The Ivory Coast striker didn't wait for a whistle, and slotted the ball between Manuel Almunia's legs to tie the match. A few more chances were spurned due to poor finishing before the break, but the game went into halftime drawn at one a piece.
The second half started much as the first, with the youthful exuberance of Arsenal showing through, as they continued to press. Chelsea's output was increased as well however, with the addition of &lt;a href="w%3AArjen%20Robben"&gt;Arjen Robben&lt;/a&gt; at the exspense of Makelele. 2 yellow cards were handed out to Chelsea in the next few minutes, before the game took a huge downturn. Chelsea skipper John Terry was seriously injured, when Diaby's foot connected squarly with his face as Diaby attempted to clear the ball. Terry was taken off in a stretcher and was replaced by Mikel. The loss of their captain seemed to push Chelsea to new levels, as Drogba forced a fine save out of Almunia, and Lampard saw his shot go off the woodwork. Arsenal were not able to hold on, and on 81 minutes, Denilson made a sloppy pass and Robben picked up the scraps. He sent a cross in as Drogba beat Senderos to the ball and headed in his 28th of the campaign. The blue tide continued, and Shevchenko blasted a ball off the woodwork, missing his chance to seal the victory.

As the game entered stoppage time, Mikel and Toure entered a shoving match, and more players got involved. Coaches took the field to attempt to settle their players, and when all was finally calm, Mikel and Toure were shown red cards, along with Adebayor of Arsenal. The game was finally called at 101 minutes, and stand in skipper Lampard was able to hoist the Carling Cup.

Given to an "individual in the motion picture industry whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry", the Jean Hersholt Award is not an annual honor, but rather an occasional prestigious title.

This year's winner was Sherry Lansing, the former CEO of Paramount Pictures and the first woman to head a major studio. Her biography in Wikipedia provides a full overview of her industry and humanitarian accomplishments.

She delivered the following acceptance speech at the 79th Annual Academy Awards ceremony last night:
She joins a list of only been six honorees in the last seventeen years, Audrey Hepburn (1992, posthumously), Elizabeth Taylor (1992), Paul Newman (1993), Quincy Jones (1994), Arthur Hiller (2001), and Roger Mayer (2004).

Golfer &lt;a href="w%3AFuzzy%20Zoeller"&gt;Fuzzy Zoeller&lt;/a&gt; wants to sue the anonymous person who vandalised his article in the &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; encyclopedia, a website resource almost anyone can edit.

An IP address from Josef Silny &amp; Associates, a Miami education consulting firm, wrote a biased paragraph about him creating uproar from the golfer. The entry was posted twice: once sometime last year, and again in December 2006. The paragraph was removed last month, and deleted from the article history by Danny Wool, a staff member of the Wikimedia Foundation.

Zoeller is suing Josef Silny &amp; Associates to find out who added this text.

"The Zoeller family wants to take a stand to put a stop to this. Otherwise, we're all just victims of the Internet vandals out there. They ought not to be able to act with impunity," said Zoeller's attorney, Scott Sheftall.

The offensive edits, about which the suit is based, allegedly suggested that Zoeller admitted to consuming mass quantities of drugs and alcohol and beat his wife.

Through the court, Wikipedia can not be sued for a vandalous edit. The person or company, in this case, will be sued. In fact, the Wikimedia Foundation has not been contacted by Zoeller or his representatives about the lawsuit.

Canadian &lt;a href="w%3AAstral%20Media"&gt;Astral Media Inc.&lt;/a&gt; will buy out &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20Broadcasting"&gt;Standard Radio Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, which runs many radio stations in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Standard Radio Inc. is the largest privately owned multimedia company in Canada.
&lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; based Astral Media Inc. will buy all of the assets from Standard Radio Inc. for about CAN$1.2-billion. Standard Radio Inc.'s 52 radio stations, and Astral's 29, will be brought together by Astral Media Inc. This will give Astral 81 radio stations in total. This makes Astral the largest radio operator in Canada of FM and AM radio.

"With the acquisition of Standard Radio, Astral Media will not only be acquiring the best performing radio stations in the country, we will at the same time acquire a company with similar values and culture. said Ian Greenberg, President and CEO of Astral Media. 

"Over the past four decades the Slaight family has built a remarkable collection of strong radio brands and has contributed meaningfully in shaping the Canadian radio industry as we know it today. We are delighted with the prospect of welcoming Standard Radio's employees into our team."

Gary Slaight, President and CEO of Standard Radio also commented on the deal.

"We are looking forward to becoming a part of the Astral Media family," said Gary Slaight, President and CEO of Standard Radio. "We are pleased to see our legacy live on with a company such as Astral that has such a strong track record and commitment to its employees and to the Canadian radio and television industries."

All of Astral's radio stations are run in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Canada"&gt;Atlantic Canada&lt;/a&gt; and it also runs various television stations across Canada. Astral also has two french channels that broadcast on &lt;a href="w%3ASirius%20Canada"&gt;Sirius satellite radio Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

The company hopes to finalize the deal in or before April.

<h1>New Zealand's state broadcaster plans to dismiss 160 workers</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%27s%20state%20broadcaster%20plans%20to%20dismiss%20160%20workers&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The state broadcaster of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATelevision%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Television New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; (TVNZ), has announced its plans to fire at least 160 people because they have falling revenue, mainly from their NZ$9.3 million advertising loss.

A &lt;a href="w%3Amemorandum"&gt;memorandum&lt;/a&gt;, or "memo", was circulating the 1,100 employer, TVNZ yesterday from CEO, &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Ellis"&gt;Rick Ellis&lt;/a&gt;, which stated that their "guesstimate" of job losses was around 130-160. 50 of the job losses will be from the news and current affairs department, where a total of 350 people currently work. The numbers are not set in stone, according to a spokesperson for TVNZ.

The lay-offs have been expected since late last year where he announced it to a parliamentary select committee.

The union which represents some of the staff working at TVNZ, &lt;a href="w%3AEngineering%20Printing%20and%20Manufacturing%20Union"&gt;Engineering Printing and Manufacturing Union&lt;/a&gt;, said that some of the staff are asking themselves how TVNZ will be able to start and manage the new digital 24 hour news channel with fewer staff. They are seeking to talk to TVNZ.

In two weeks time, staff will be asked what they think of the proposed changes, which also includes a top level management restructuring. 

Steve Mahery, broadcasting minister, said, "The restructuring of TVNZ is an operational issue, and I expect they'll meet their charter requirements. How they structure the company to achieve this is entirely up to them."

Ahead of an upcoming election in the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href="Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AParti%20lib%C3%A9ral%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec"&gt;Parti libéral du Québec&lt;/a&gt; (Liberal Party of Quebec) are in the lead, well ahead of the &lt;a href="w%3ASovereignty"&gt;separatist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AParti%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Parti Québécois&lt;/a&gt; (PQ), says a poll done by &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; based newspaper &lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Devoir"&gt;Le Devoir&lt;/a&gt;.
The Liberals are at 37% support, 28% for the PQ, and 24% for the &lt;a href="w%3AAction%20d%C3%A9mocratique%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec"&gt;Action démocratique du Québec&lt;/a&gt; (ADQ) (Democratic Action of Quebec).

The Liberals, which form the current government in the province, could win again if they had a 6-point lead, says Jean-Marc Leger, president of Leger Marketing.

Quebecers were also asked who is leading the best campaign; 31% for &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Charest"&gt;Jean Charest&lt;/a&gt;, 25% &lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Dumont"&gt;Mario Dumont&lt;/a&gt;, and 14% for &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Boisclair"&gt;André Boisclair&lt;/a&gt;.

Jean Charest, the leader of the Quebec Liberals, wants Quebec to stay in Canada while the PQ, lead by André Boisclair, wants the province to separate completely. Mario Dumont, leader of the ADQ, also wants Quebec to stay in Canada. If the PQ were to win the election, a referendum on separation could be put to the people of the province, the results of which could form the basis of negotiation with Canada on sovereignty. 

However, more Quebecers want to stay in Canada then to separate. In a referendum, about 56% would say no to separation and 44% yes, according to the latest polls. The percentage of Quebecers wanting to separate from Canada has not changed markedly over time.

The official voting day is March 26.

Schools in the city &lt;a href="w%3APeshawar"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; were closed for two days at the end of last week after anonymous threats were received warning female students to wear &lt;a href="w%3Aveil"&gt;veils&lt;/a&gt; in class. 

The threats, believed originating from members of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; movement, along with the detention of two would-be suicide bombers before they exploded themselves, raised tensions and closed the schools out of safety concerns for the students.

One of the two suicide bombers was a woman who attempted enter the Koochi &lt;a href="w%3ABazaar"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, a market in Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan’s &lt;a href="w%3A%20North-West%20Frontier%20Province"&gt;North-West Frontier Province&lt;/a&gt;. Purses carried by women are routinely searched before entering the market. Explosives were discovered in the purse carried by a woman who refused the search and tried to walk away.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; ambassadors to &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; were "slightly injured" when their helicopters were targeted by mortars on a landing strip in &lt;a href="w%3ABatticaloa"&gt;Batticaloa&lt;/a&gt;. 

The projectiles were fired by the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberation%20Tigers%20of%20Tamil%20Eelam"&gt;Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam&lt;/a&gt; (Tamil Tigers) in Sri Lanka's east on Tuesday, officials said.

U.S. ambassador &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20O.%20Blake%2C%20Jr."&gt;Robert Blake&lt;/a&gt; is reported to be "alright", Italian Pio Mariani suffered head wounds from shrapnel. They had already landed and disembarked from their aircraft when the explosions took place.

A spokesman for LTTE said they mistook them for a military target, and have apologized. They blame the military, who they say landed the diplomats in a site used for attacks on the rebels, even this very morning.

The ambassadors were reportedly visiting the area that was recently liberated by the Sri Lankan forces to observe the development activities of the area.

An &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href="w%3ABlog"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAbdel%20Kareem%20Nabil"&gt;Abdul Kareem Suleiman Amer&lt;/a&gt;, known online as Kareem Amer, was sentenced to four years in prison on Thursday for insulting &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; on his weblog. 

Blogs had been considered a relatively safe means of expression for citizens of countries with restrictive Islamic laws. Mideast governments have harassed and arrested bloggers before, but Kareem is the first to receive jail time.

Kareem had written about becoming a &lt;a href="human%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; lawyer and working for the betterment of Muslim and Arabic women; however, the &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Azhar%20University"&gt;Al-Azhar University&lt;/a&gt; expelled him in 2006 for criticizing the school's religious leaders.

He had criticized various Muslim beliefs and suggested that there was &lt;a href="atheism"&gt;no God&lt;/a&gt;. The court took special interest in his posting to Coptic blogs, ♡❤i.e.♡❤ those run by Egyptian &lt;a href="Christianity"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt;.

His arrest last November inspired rallies in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Rome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, and Stockholm.

Gamal Eid, the Executive Director of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, said that the most repressive regime for blogging had been &lt;a href="Tunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, which have blocked sites and limited internet access. Expressing surprise at the severity of the sentence given Egypt's recent history, he said it was a "gloomy day for all the advocates of freedom of expression", not only in Egypt but also around the world.

&lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, the Paris-based advocacy group for press freedom condemned the sentence. Pointing out that &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;President Mubarak&lt;/a&gt; had promised in 2004 to end prison terms for press offenses, it called the sentence a "message of intimidation" to Egyptian bloggers who, it said, were emerging as an "effective bulwark" against what it called the regime’s authoritarian excesses.

A suicide attack at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABagram%20Air%20Base"&gt;Bagram Air Base&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; at 10:30 a.m. Afghan time has left at least 19 dead reports the Associated Press. President &lt;a href="Hamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt;'s office said 23 people were killed and 20 were injured. Agence France-Presse has reported that at least one &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; soldier was killed in the attack. A South Korean soldier was among those killed said &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;'s defence ministry. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQari%20Yousef%20Ahmadi"&gt;Qari Yousef Ahmadi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who claims to be a &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; spokesman, said that &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; was the target of the attack. Cheney made a surprise visit to the base. He ate breakfast with Major General David Rodriguez, commander of the 82nd Airborne Division and troops. Cheney had been in his room before the explosion occurred. He was quickly escorted to a nearby bomb shelter, where he remained, unharmed, until the situation settled.

Cheney told reporters traveling with him, when informed of who claimed responsibility for the attack, "I think they clearly try to find ways to question the authority of the central government," he said according to Donna Miles of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Forces%20Press%20Service"&gt;American Forces Press Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "Striking at Bagram with a suicide bomber, I suppose, is one way to do that. But it shouldn't affect our behavior at all."

&lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; decided to buy a health information search engine called Medstory. This is the company's first step towards an involvement in the health market. The &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; that Medstory develops involves artificial intelligence techniques which are applied to both medical and health information stored in medical journals, as well as government documents. No additional information on the Medstory purchase was disclosed.

According to Peter Neupert, vice president for health strategy at &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, the acquisition of Medstory represents the first step in assembling technologies which can serve well for the consumer experience in health care.

In 2006 Microsoft bought Azyxxi, which is a clinical health care service system. It searches and displays information about the patient from many sources. The information might be provided by: scanned documents, &lt;a href="w%3AX-ray"&gt;X-rays&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="w%3Aultrasound"&gt;ultrasound&lt;/a&gt; images.

Microsoft decided to make its move into the health care system at a time when many websites, that provide various information on health, started to significantly raise their traffic and receive investments. 

The industry analyst and Medstory investor, Esther Dyson, mentioned that the technology provided by Medstory is not just a search engine, it also represents an ontology engine. He also outlined the fact that Microsoft has acquired "some of the best deep technology" in the fast growing field of medical search engines.

The Pittsburgh Penguins played at Florida for the second time in two games. The Pens did not have the same luck as they did against the Panthers as they lost 5-1. Tampa Bay played as if they were in the playoffs finishing there checks, getting to the puck and skating well all in this great win to make them a likely candidate for the Playoffs, they are ranked third in Conference and first in division. The Pens, despite losing, are still in a good position to be in the Playoffs, they are fifth in Conference and second in division. The Goal Scoring was credited to, for the Pens: Sergei Gonchar, on a Evgeni Malkin, Sidney Crosby assist. For the Lightning: Martin St. Louis, Paul Ranger, Filip Kuba, Brad Richards, and Vincent Lecavalier, all scoring for Tampa Bay. Assists going to: Brad Richards(3), Dan Boyle, Eric Perrin(2),Ruslan Fedotenko(2), and Martin St. Louis. All in All, the Tampa Bay Lightning should try to stay consistent and play like they did in this game. For the Pens, try to rebound from this loss and try to win against the New Jersey Devils Tuesday.

Professional photographer &lt;a href="http%3A//www.johnbmuellerphotography.com/"&gt;John B.

It is one of the largest events, following only the ♡❤Vanity Fair♡❤ and Elton John AIDS Foundation Party in size.

Among the guests at the event were Lil' Kim, Bow Wow, Ruben Studdard, Diane DeGarmo, DMX, Darryl 'DMC' McDaniels, DJ Spinderella, Dennis Hopper, Blu Cantrell, Tyler Hilton, Erik Palladino, Daniel Cage, Farnsworth Bentley, Aaron Carter, Nick Carter, Cindy Margolis, LaToya Jackson, AJ McLean, Joey Fatone, Shar Jackson, Tyrese, Tyson Beckford, Tara Reid, Rosie Perez, Radha Mitchell, MC Lyte, Jane Seymour, James Keach, Fran Drescher, Tommy Davidson, Bruce Davison, and Adam Kowalczyk.

Even Mickey Rooney stopped by to watch the ceremonies.

Larry Birkhead, boyfriend of the late-Anna Nicole Smith was still on the guest list, according to press materials. No media outlet reported him attending, so it is likely he stayed in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; for the on-going legal proceedings.

The biggest U.S. stock market index, the &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones&lt;/a&gt;, plunged by more than 416 points by the closing bell on Tuesday, the worst single-day decline since the re-opening of the markets following the September 11th terrorist attacks. The slip followed a 9% sell-off in Chinese markets. Other stock indices, such as the &lt;a href="w%3ANasdaq"&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AS%26amp%3BP%20500"&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;, dipped by 96 points and 50 points, respectively. It was the 7th largest single-day decline is &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; history.

Analysts blamed the slide on a number of factors: (1) U.S. and &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; stock exchanges had powered upward for too long and were due for a significant correction; (2) inflation and the prices of bonds and equities had become too high; (3) the U.S. is headed for an economic recession. Alan Greenspan indicated on Monday that the U.S. economy would not sustain its recent growth, where the Dow Industrials set day-to-day records and the White House signaled on Tuesday that it would revise its estimate of fourth-quarter 2006 GDP growth down to an annual rate of about 2.3 percent from an initial forecast of 3.5 percent and was increasingly nervous that the figure could come in even lower.

Around 3 p.m. EST, ♡❤Reuters♡❤ reported that the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; had implemented on-floor tradition restrictions meant to curb the sell off.

The decline also occurred on the day that a plot to assassinate U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Cheney"&gt;Richard Cheney&lt;/a&gt; failed in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Canadian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, Monday, announced CAN$200 million for the cleanup of war-torn &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

The money will be used for hospitals and broken roads as well as other important projects that will help Afghanistan. The $100 million has been added to the $100 million already used in the country, which will be used over the next 10 years.

"Thanks to the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces"&gt;Canadian Forces&lt;/a&gt; efforts, the fragile peace that reigns over most of the country has been extended to large parts of Kandahar province," Harper said during a news conference in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;. "Now it's time to consolidate those security gains on the ground and use them to advance reconstruction because the long-suffering Afghan people desperately need hope for a better future for their families and communities."

"Afghanistan is a long way from home, but the issues we are addressing here — building democracy, reducing poverty, fighting terrorism, celebrating pluralism — matter for the entire world," Harper said. "Global security hinges on success in Afghanistan... Afghanistan is on the frontline of the international security challenge of the modern post-war world. We must build a successful alternative there in order to defeat extremism and terrorism everywhere."

About $120 million is already being spent for governance and development; $30 million for counter-narcotics; $20 million for policing; $20 million for de-mining; and $10 million for road construction.

Various political leaders in Canada want the soldiers to come home from Afghanistan. NDP leader &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt; wants the troops pulled out of Kandahar, where the Canadians are currently fighting, immediately. However, in earlier 2006, the Conservative government said the troops will stay until 2009. Before &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt; was elected as Liberal leader, thirty Liberal MPs suppoted the motion but a majority of them opposed. Stéphane Dion, now leader, says if he were elected Prime Minister, he would pull out all 2,500 troops.

Canada's overal mission in the country is for humanitarian and peacekeeping as well as fighting for peace and an end to the war.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReading%20F.C."&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="Manchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; clashed today in a fifth round &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFA%20cup"&gt;FA cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; replay at the Madjeski Stadium. Neither team fielded a full strength side, with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeroy%20Lita"&gt;Leroy Lita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Hunt"&gt;Steven Hunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; von the bench for Reading, and &lt;a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Wayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt; as substitutes for United.

United started the game with a blitz, scoring 3 goals in the first 6 minutes. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGabriel%20Heinze"&gt;Gabriel Heinze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; started the scoring by shooting in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20O%27Shea"&gt;John O'Shea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cross. Two minutes later, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALouis%20Saha"&gt;Louis Saha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; received a long ball from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Ferdinand"&gt;Rio Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and sent the ball into the back of the net, doubling the lead. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOle%20Gunnar%20Solskjaer"&gt;Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; then scored the 3rd, as he beat the offside trap and curled the ball into the net. Reading did not give up the fight, and scored on 23 minutes, when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADave%20Kitson"&gt;Dave Kitson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; headed home an Ingimarson cross. The game stayed at the 3-1 scoreline for much of the rest of the game, until 84 minutes, when Leroy Lita scored to force an edgy finish. Litas powerful header off a Glen Little cross left keeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdwin%20Van%20Der%20Sar"&gt;Edwin Van Der Sar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; helpless, leaving Reading in sight of extra time. A shot by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrynjar%20Gunnarsson"&gt;Brynjar Gunnarsson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which rattled of the crossbar could have caused an amazing comeback, but Manchester United were able to hold on, and advance to the sixth round of the FA cup.

Manchester will face &lt;a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C."&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; in the next round, who defeated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bromwich%20Albion"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today after a penalty shootout.

Last night the New Zealand Parliament passed the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act, which now makes it illegal to send spam from New Zealand that does not include the sender's details, and an unsubscribe facility, which also applies to normal commercial e-mails and porn e-mails.

New Zealand previously had no defense from spammers sending spam from New Zealand, which accounts for around 10% of all spam internationally.

All members of parliament voted for the bill, except for two ACT MP's with their leader saying that it will place extra costs on small businesses who wish to market their services.

Critics are also damning the act, saying that it will do little to combat the spam, because most of it comes from other countries.

The law also prohibits spam instant messaging and spam text messages.

Spam in New Zealand accounts for 80% of all e-mails in the inbox.

David Cunliffe, minister of information technology, said, "This legislation enables Kiwis to join the global fight against spam. International cooperation to identify, shut down or block the sources of spam is an important part our anti-spam strategy."

The ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Toronto Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ experienced one of its biggest one-day point losses in the wake of a major (9%) stock sell-off in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AS%26amp%3BP/TSX%20Composite%20Index"&gt;S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index&lt;/a&gt; dropped 2.7%, falling 364 points eventually ending the day at 13,040. Despite this 'dramatic' drop, the main Toronto index is still above where it was eight weeks prior at the end of 2006. 

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; It was the biggest one-day percentage drop since April 2004. At its worst point, the index was down 457 points. Every sector was in negative territory, with resource stocks leading the charge down.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – &lt;a href="w%3ACBC%20News"&gt;CBC News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Recently, the TSX set seven record highs in nine trading sessions. Its benchmark index doubled since October 2002 as well as experienced a steady rise in commodity prices. The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (NYSE) witnessed even larger drops; the &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; saw a loss of 3.3%, fallling 416 points, making it its worst day in almost four years. At its lowest point of the day it dropped 4.3%, falling 550 points. The &lt;a href="w%3ANasdaq"&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; composite index dropped similarily 96 points to 2,432 for a 3.8% loss.

In total, 498 of the 500 U.S. companies represented in the &lt;a href="w%3AS%26amp%3BP%20500"&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt; index fell including all &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;30 Dow&lt;/a&gt; stocks.

The new &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Pole%20Telescope"&gt;South Pole Telescope&lt;/a&gt; has recently collected its first light in a long-term project to learn about the nature of &lt;a href="w%3Adark%20energy"&gt;dark energy&lt;/a&gt;. It will use the cold and dry conditions in &lt;a href="w%3AAntarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; to detect , which is said to be the afterglow of the &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Band"&gt;Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;. The study will help determine if dark energy affected the development of &lt;a href="w%3AGalaxy%20groups%20and%20clusters"&gt;galaxy clusters&lt;/a&gt;.

Yesterday, Richard Porter, an editor from BBC News, wrote a blog entry to respond to a controversy that has erupted overnight in the &lt;a href="w%3ABlogosphere"&gt;blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;. "We're not part of a conspiracy," he assures his readers. "We didn't get told in advance that buildings were going to fall down. We didn't receive press releases or scripts in advance of events happening."

At the heart of the controversy is a video that surfaced on &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; Video and &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. It is a segment taken from the BBC's own archive of their news coverage of the events of September 11. In it, reporter Jane Standley reports the complete unexpected collapse of &lt;a href="w%3A7%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;WTC 7&lt;/a&gt;. However, she presented this information half an hour before it actually happened. In fact, while she is reporting the demise of WTC 7, it is clearly visible right behind her. During the course of the broadcast, the studio loses the connection with her, and when she returns, the building is gone.

During the first part of the broadcast, she gives specific details about the building, how many floors it has, who owns &amp; leases it, and the fact that nobody was inside at the time of the collapse. All of these facts that Ms. Standley presented were 100% accurate.

In Porter's 5-point response to the accusations, he insists that his organization was the victim of chaos, not conspiracy. Unfortunately, Porter says, none of the reporters involved remember exactly what happened, and they have lost all of the original archive tapes, making it impossible to check. Porter explains that "like everybody else that day she was trying to make sense of what she was seeing; what she was being told; and what was being told to her by colleagues in London who were monitoring feeds and wires services."

He concludes that, at worst, they simply made an error &amp;mdash; an error that happened to be prophetic. He signs off by quoting a flippant comment from YouTube: "so the guy in the studio didn't quite know what was going on? Woah, that totally proves conspiracy... ".

Directly beneath Porter's blog are two-dozen comments from BBC News readers. The comments are less than appreciative.

An extensive study of adolescents conducted in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; revealed that claiming an early beginning of &lt;a href="w%3Asex"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; life is statistically correlated to delinquent behavior later. An examination of more than 7,000 teenagers revealed that those who had their first sexual experience earlier than their peers showed a 20 percent increase in delinquent conduct a year after. 

Stacy Armour, a research student from &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State%20University"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;, who took part in the study found a correlation between teens beginning their sex life later than their peers and their subsequent rate of delinquency. The research showed that adolescents who were late to begin sex life as compared to the average age of teens in their school, were 50 percent more unlikely to act delinquently.

The average age when adolescents begin their sex life would be between 11.25 and 17.5 years, according to the research that is found in Journal of Youth and Adolescence. The information concerning the average age of teenagers who just had their first intercourse was revealed for each of the schools that took part in the study. Every respondent had his data compared with the data of other peers within one school. 

The overall data of the study revealed that a 58 percent increase in delinquent behavior was pronounced among those teenagers who stopped claiming to be virgins between first and second study. The research itself doesn't suggest that sex is interrelated with delinquency but it raises the problem that those teenagers who are more impatient to start sexual life are likely to show asocial behavior later.

Marc-Andre Fleury responded to Penguins coach Michel Therrien's criticism Tuesday night by holding the New Jersey Devils to one goal. Unfortunately for Fleury, Martin Brodeur was one goal better. Brodeur was spectacular in net once again, earning his NHL leading 12th shutout of the season. The Devils only goal of the night was scored by Jamie Langenbrunner on the Power Play, 3:00 into the second period, assisted by Scott Gomez and Patrick Elias.

&lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;'s biggest aircraft manufacturer, has announced 10,000 job cuts over the next four years. The news comes as its parent company, &lt;a href="w%3AEADS"&gt;EADS&lt;/a&gt; starts a major restructuring programme because the company is not efficient enough. 

&lt;a href="w%3ALouis%20Gallois"&gt;Louis Gallois&lt;/a&gt;, the Airbus chief executive, said the company expects to cut approximately 4,300 jobs in &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, 3,700 in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, 1,600 in &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and 400 in &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. About half of those cuts will be made among subcontractors and temporary workers. Actual Airbus employee reduction would be about 5,000, or 9% of the total European work force of 55,000 full-time Airbus employees.

Although Gallois said he hoped to achieve this mainly through attrition, the &lt;a href="w%3ATrade%20union"&gt;unions&lt;/a&gt; were displeased. Union officials said nearly 14,000 employees at four French sites had a two hour &lt;a href="w%3AStrike%20action"&gt;work stoppage&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday afternoon to protest the cuts.

"The response has been massive," said Julien Talavan, a spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AForce%20Ouvri%C3%A8re"&gt;Force Ouvrière&lt;/a&gt;, the main Airbus union in France. "This is just the beginning," he said, hinting at future labor action.

This move comes after well-publicized delays on its &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;A380&lt;/a&gt; super-jumbo commercial airliner. The restructuring announcement also includes the proposed sale or closure of 3 plants.

According to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20State"&gt;Department of State&lt;/a&gt;, officials for the U.S. government and the &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;n government are going to meet in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; on March 5 to the 6 to discuss "organizational issues and agenda-setting issues," said spokesman for the State Department, &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McCormack"&gt;Sean McCormack&lt;/a&gt; who also added that no agreements are expected to be reached during the meeting.

"It is really a first meeting and first set of discussions. There will be some organizational issues, agenda-setting issues that they will tackle. So do not look at it as a meeting that is going to produce immediate results. Nobody is going come out the front door and wave a piece of paper with some agreement on it. But it is a good-faith act in implementing the agreement that was signed in Beijing, and we look forward to those consultations," said McCormack.

Officials for N. Korea are also going to stop over in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt; on March 1, where a speech will be given at an unnamed university. The officials will then meet with "non governmental groups" before arriving in New York on March 2.

<h1>Toxic chemical spills in the Ohio River</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Toxic%20chemical%20spills%20in%20the%20Ohio%20River&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
At least 10,300 gallons of a toxic chemical, &lt;a href="w%3ACumene"&gt;Cumene&lt;/a&gt;, also called isopropyl benzene, which is generally used in paint thinner, fuels, and rubber, spilled from a barge after it hit a wall of an underwater moveable dam in the &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20River"&gt;Ohio River&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;.

"There's a tremendous volume of water going through there, so there's a dilution factor, and this will be taken into consideration as they try to take measures to contain it," said a spokeswoman for the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Maggie Carson.

The barge, which held at least 960,000 gallons of the chemical, hit the dam owned by Kirby Marine at &lt;a href="w%3ABrookport%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Brookport, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. The barge still blocks the river, leaving the waterway open to traffic going in one direction at a time for at least one mile on the river. 

Authorities have stated that the drinking water is okay to drink and that as of the moment the toxin has not been found in any water pumps in the area.

"I would say it's not particularly dangerous. Any spill is serious ... but my answer would be that there would not be a risk to human health," said a spokesperson for Kirby Marine, Mark Buese.

It is not known what the environmental impact might be, but according to U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Wayne Chapman, the chemical floats on the surface of water so it will evaporate quickly.

Exposure to the chemical can cause headaches, eye irritation, nose and throat irritation, as well as some dizziness. Any animals that have been exposed directly to the chemical could also be at risk.

It is still not known what caused the crash.

<h1>Prodi wins vote of confidence</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Prodi%20wins%20vote%20of%20confidence&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt;, prime minister of &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, won a confidence vote in the &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Senate"&gt;Italian Senate&lt;/a&gt;, after attempting to resign last week. His victory means that the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Union%20%28political%20coalition%29"&gt;l'Unione&lt;/a&gt; coalition of leftist parties will remain in power. The vote was 162-157.

Justice minister &lt;a href="w%3AClemente%20Mastella"&gt;Clemente Mastella&lt;/a&gt; reacted in an interview: "This government is like the &lt;a href="w%3ALeaning%20Tower%20of%20Pisa"&gt;Tower of Pisa&lt;/a&gt;. It leans, leans, but never falls."

The expected vote in the &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Chamber%20of%20Deputies"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; on Friday is expected to be only a formality, since Prodi has a much more comfortable coalition there.

Prodi faced competition from the opposition centre-right &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Freedoms"&gt;Casa delle Libertà&lt;/a&gt; coalition, led by former prime minister and media magnate &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the win, l'Unione's hold on the Senate is weak, due to the narrowness of its majority.

Prodi had tendered his resignation to Italian president &lt;a href="w%3AGiorgio%20Napolitano"&gt;Giorgio Napolitano&lt;/a&gt; on February 21, but Napolitano rejected the resignation on February 24, leading to a vote of confidence for Prodi in the Italian Senate.

Main contentions between the coalitions include the presence of Italian military units in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and Italy's relations with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

A steroid distribution network exposed by a New York prosecutor is reported to have connections to a number of high-profile professional athletes, including retired boxer &lt;a href="w%3AEvander%20Holyfield"&gt;Evander Holyfield&lt;/a&gt; and current &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim"&gt;Los Angeles Angels&lt;/a&gt; outfielder &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Matthews%2C%20Jr."&gt;Gary Matthews, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;

Federal agents raided two pharmacies in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; which were tabbed by a prosecutor in &lt;a href="w%3AAlbany%20County%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Albany County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; as having links to illicit distributors of steroids. Eight people have been arrested in connection to this ring, and up to 24 people are individuals of interest to federal agents and may be arrested before the investigation is over.

According to records seized during the raids, customers of the pharmacies included Holyfield, Matthews, former baseball star &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Canseco"&gt;Jose Canseco&lt;/a&gt;, and former pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Grimsley"&gt;Jason Grimsley&lt;/a&gt;. Investigators reportedly have found evidence that performance-enhancing drugs were prescribed to a number of professional athletes as well as international bodybuilders. Further evidence showed that &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Rydze"&gt;Dr. Richard Rydze&lt;/a&gt;, team doctor of the Pittsburgh Steelers, purchased $150,000 worth of &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Growth%20Hormone"&gt;human growth hormone&lt;/a&gt; on his personal credit card. Calls to Dr. Rydze were not immediately returned.

Those arrested include Stan and Naomi Loomis, owners of Signature Pharmacy in &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, Florida. Two other employees of the pharmacy (including Loomis's brother, Mike) were arrested as well. P. David Soares, Albany County prosecutor, indicated in filings from his office that Signature is believed to be a "producer" of anabolic steroids. Grimsley and Rydze were reported to be customers of Signature Pharmacy. Holyfield, Matthews, and Canseco were allegedly on customer lists from Applied Pharmacy Services in &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, Alabama. Both pharmacies and their owners are implicated in the steroid ring.

According to SI.com, Matthews received shipments of &lt;a href="w%3AGenotropin"&gt;Genotropin&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic growth hormone. The shipments were sent to the address of one of his former minor-league teammates in Mansfield, Texas. Matthews claimed he did not know why his name was on Applied Pharmacy's customer list. He did not comment further on the situation, stating that he was not "in a position to answer specific questions."

On Wednesday, Holyfield indicated that he was "not overly concerned about the situation." He did mention that the only purchase of medical supplies that can be attributed to him were medications for his father, who died of a heart ailment in January. Later that evening, Holyfield released a more pointed denial, stating, "I do not use steroids. I have never used steroids. I resent that my name has been linked to known steroid users by sources who refuse to be identified in order to generate publicity for their investigation."

The partnership between New Zealand's monopolistic ISP, Xtra and Microsoft New Zealand, XtraMSN has expired today and has been replaced with a partnership between Xtra and Yahoo!7, YahooXtra. Yahoo!7 is also a partnership, between Yahoo! and the 7 television station in Australia.

The partnership's website was launched today, as well as a new MSN New Zealand homepage.

Yahoo!Xtra are trying to become the homepage of all New Zealanders with the claim the partnership will beef up content, as well as being the biggest website in New Zealand in terms of revenue. Kevin Kenrick, Telecom's consumer products chief operating officer, who own Xtra, said the aim of Yahoo!Xtra was to, "Yahoo!Xtra aimed to bring the best available international content and technology into a New Zealand context." "We do think Yahoo!Xtra will become an extension of New Zealanders living rooms."

Chief executive of Yahoo!7, Ian Smith, said that two to three percent of all the advertising market was from online advertising. In Australia, that number is around eight percent, which Mr Smith expects to become the number for New Zealand.

Mr. Smith said: "Yahoo!Xtra will be the best of New Zealand linked to the best the rest of the world has to offer, and puts us in a prime position to capitalize on changing trends in media consumption and media usage."

Yahoo!7 will own 51% of the partnership, with Xtra owning the other 49%. Mr Smith will chair the board that will be created.

The partnership also means that current Xtra subscribers will receive a new e-mail messaging platform, but current e-mail addresses will remain the same. This will mainly happen because of the mail technology currently offered by Yahoo!

Other services owned by Yahoo!, such as Flickr and Answers, will also be brought into the new portal.

Mr. Kenrick and Mr. Smith both denied to disclose how much money from either sides has been invested, but do say that it will be profitable in the near future.

Other ventures between Yahoo! and telecommunication ISP's have occurred internationally as well.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASwatch"&gt;Swatch&lt;/a&gt; O'Neill Big Mountain Pro &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, an innovative format of mobile free-ride event for &lt;a href="w%3Asnowboard"&gt;snowboarders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aski"&gt;skiers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AAlps"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt;, will start on March 1, 2007. 

The initial stage of the event will open in the &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; resort of &lt;a href="w%3ALaax"&gt;Laax&lt;/a&gt; and finish in &lt;a href="w%3AInnsbruck"&gt;Innsbruck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; on March 10. Eight world-class snowboarders and eight top international skiers will participate in the Swatch O'Neill Big Mountain Pro free-ride competition. 

The organizers of the Swatch O'Neill Big Mountain Pro 2007 have opted for a mobile contest format and claim that the current snow pack condition on the selected mountains is suitable for holding the competition. The invited riders and skiers will be offered special lift and helicopter access to explore the area.

The free-ride content is to take place on three different mountains at some of the most challenging terrain in the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an Alps. On every of the three competition days the participants will arrive at a site with different terrain type - cliffs, steeps, as well as environment more suitable for freestyle skiing and snowboarding. The event is meant to include the following potential playgrounds: Swiss Graubuenden (&lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Moritz"&gt;St Moritz&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ADavos"&gt;Davos&lt;/a&gt;) and Grand St Bernard (&lt;a href="w%3AVerbier"&gt;Verbier&lt;/a&gt;), Italian Alagna (&lt;a href="w%3AMonte%20Rosa"&gt;Monte Rosa&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChamonix"&gt;Chamonix&lt;/a&gt;, and finally &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArlberg"&gt;Arlberg&lt;/a&gt;. 

As the final part of the event, the competitors will gather in Innsbruck to judge the performance of one another via video playback. The € 60,000 prize purse is to be divided between the best.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMullah%20Dadullah%20Akhund"&gt;Mullah Dadullah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a high ranking official for the &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, has said that the leader of &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; is "still alive" and that "messages are exchanged to share plans" with Bin Laden. Dadullah also said that they "go to the battlefield together."

"Only his comrades see him; we exchange messages with each other to share plans. We also go to the battlefield together. We actually meet very rarely, just for important consultations. It's hard for anyone to meet Bin Laden himself now, but we know he's still alive," said Dadullah.

Dadullah also claims that there are "hundreds" of suicide bombers that are prepared and ready to hit the &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan and that Americans will "reap the crop for a long time" also saying that the Taliban and al-Qaeda will get "revenge" on the United States either inside or outside Afghanistan.

"The Americans have sown a seed. They will reap the crop for quite a long time. We will get our revenge on them, whether in Afghanistan or outside," said Dadullah.

"The suicide martyrs, those willing to blow themselves up, are countless. Hundreds have registered their names already and are ready to go and we have hundreds more on the waiting list. Each is anxious to be the first to be sent," added Dadullah.

Dadullah also says that &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; "is more important than anything."

"For the Taliban, Islam is more important than anything else. It's our religious duty to shelter any Muslim brother who's on the run from the infidels, even at the cost of our government."

So far, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; has not been able to confirm or deny the information and Dadullah has not stated where bin Laden may be hiding.

<h1>Columbine High School evacuated following bomb scare</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Columbine%20High%20School%20evacuated%20following%20bomb%20scare&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Reports say that an evacuation has taken place at &lt;a href="w%3AColumbine%20High%20School"&gt;Columbine High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALittleton%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Littleton, Colorado&lt;/a&gt; after a bomb threat was phoned into the school.

"All we know at this point is that there is a bomb threat and that the school has been evacuated. Most of the threats that have been associated to that school made reference to past events that occurred there. But a bomb threat to a school is as serious at any school as it is at Columbine," said Jacki Kelley, spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. Kelley added that all people evacuated from the school were initially sent to a park near the school, and that more than one threat was made against the school.

Kelley also added that the threats began at about 9:30am local time (4:30 PM UTC).

According to Reuters, police have found no evidence of explosives at the scene. However, the bomb squad is still searching and bomb-sniffing dogs are also being used to search the school.

According to Marlene Desmond, spokesperson for Jefferson County Schools, there are over 1,850 students at the high school. The entire school was evacuated upon receipt of the bomb threat.

In 1999, the school was the scene of a massacre when &lt;a href="w%3ADylan%20Klebold"&gt;Dylan Klebold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Harris"&gt;Eric Harris&lt;/a&gt;, both students at the school, shot and killed 13 people before taking their own lives. This is the 10th in a series of threats the school faced since then, and is the second time the threats caused the school to evacuate and send students home.

In an exclusive interview Jim Shires, Public Information Officer for the Jefferson County Sheriff told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that it is unknown if this incident was referenced in the current bomb threat. 

"We won't know more until we speak with the people who actually took the call," Shires said. He added that the school would be closed for the remainder of the day while the investigation continues.

Another &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Cup"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; replay occurred last night, featuring Blackburn and Arsenal at &lt;a href="w%3AEwood%20Park"&gt;Ewood Park&lt;/a&gt;. The previous game was played to a 0 - 0 draw, with defensive strength showing on Blackburn's side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This game went much the same way, with Arsenal controlling the game, but not delivering any potent strikes. Arsenal had an appeal for a penalty when keeper &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Friedel"&gt;Brad Friedel&lt;/a&gt; brought down &lt;a href="w%3AJermie%20Aliadiere"&gt;Jermie Aliadiere&lt;/a&gt; in the box, but referee &lt;a href="w%3AGraham%20Poll"&gt;Graham Poll&lt;/a&gt; dubbed the challenge fair. Arsenals best chance came through &lt;a href="w%3AJulio%20Baptista"&gt;Julio Baptista&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to head in a &lt;a href="w%3ADenilson"&gt;Denilson&lt;/a&gt; free kick, but the attempt sailed over the crossbar, not troubling Brad Friedel. Blackburn had their own chance on 53 minutes, but &lt;a href="w%3AMorten%20Gamst%20Pederson"&gt;Morten Gamst Pederson&lt;/a&gt;'s shot flew wide of the post after he did well to make space in the box. 10 minutes later, Blackburn made two substitutions, putting &lt;a href="w%3ABenni%20McCarthy"&gt;Benni McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Dunn"&gt;David Dunn&lt;/a&gt; into the match at the exspense of Tugay and Nonda. Arsenal made a change several minutes later, as Clich replaced Traore. Baptista continued to threaten the Blackburn goal, but a great save from Friedel and a misplaced header kept the game tied. As the game drew close to extra time, Benni McCarthy produced a wonderful goal, as he beat out Senderos and curled the ball into the top left corner. Arsenal attempted to strike back, but they left it too late, as Blackburn advanced to the next round.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Blackburn will play &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; in the next round of the FA Cup.

Thunderstorm supercells spawned dozens of tornadoes in at least 6 states; the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; received 31 reports of tornadoes in all on Thursday, March 1, 2007.

In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnterprise%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Alabama, a tornado tore through Enterprise High School, leaving 8 students dead, many injured and missing. The Sumter Regional Hospital in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmericus%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Americus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Georgia was also hit by a tornado, killing 2 people in the area and injuring an unknown number of others; the hospital was destroyed along with many other buildings in Sumter County.

The many tornadoes are to blame for the estimated death toll which has risen to above 20. In other parts of the United States, snowstorms and torrential rain are responsible for flooding and power outages.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sirius%20CEO%20visits%20congress&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ASirius%20Satellite%20Radio"&gt;Sirius&lt;/a&gt; CEO &lt;a href="w%3AMel%20Karmazin"&gt;Mel Karmazin&lt;/a&gt; appeared before a newly formed Antitrust Task Force, a sub-committee of the &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt;, on Wednesday last week in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; to defend the proposed &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; merger between &lt;a href="w%3AXM"&gt;XM&lt;/a&gt; and Sirius &lt;a href="w%3ASatellite%20radio"&gt;satellite radio&lt;/a&gt; services. 

The hearing, carried live on C-SPAN, was attended by representatives from various competing broadcast companies. The representatives challenged the merger deal, and some speakers were openly hostile to Karmazin and to satellite radio in general, while other speakers were more civil.

Several times during the debate, the discussion centered on the failed merger deal between the two satellite television networks &lt;a href="w%3ADirecTV"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEchoStar%20Communications%20Corporation"&gt;Echostar&lt;/a&gt;. The comparison between this proposed radio merger and the failed television merger was settled to some extent with an understanding that nearly all television viewers now use either cable or satellite to view available programming. Televised programming content is now delivered mainly in the form of a subscription, rather than airwave transmissions.

Unlike television programming, most radio listeners use over the air receivers to listen to free programming content supported advertisers.

"We come to this hearing with an open mind, but we recognize that the companies have the obligation to convince the Congress, the regulators, and most importantly, the American People that this combination will improve the competitive playing field and benefit consumers," said &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;John Conyers&lt;/a&gt;, the sub-committee chairman. To determine the legality of this merger, Congress first needs to decide whether a combined XM and Sirius would be a monopoly, as the only satellite radio provider in the United States, or whether the new company will actually be in competition with other forms of radio-like entertainment, according to Conyers. The hearing focused on alternatives such as Internet radio, terrestrial radio, portable audio devices, and emerging services, such as cell phone services and WiMax.

<h2>The Issue</h2>

At the heart of the debate is whether the two competing satellite services could drive each other to improve both of their services, or whether the proposed merger could result in end-user cost reductions by making more money available for Research &amp; Development, new content, and subscription price reductions.

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<h3>David Rehr</h3>
David Rehr, president of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20Broadcasters"&gt;National Association of Broadcasters&lt;/a&gt;, spoke first. In a speech riddled with loaded terms like "government sanctioned monopoly" and "government bailout", he laid out points:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. This merger would create a government sanctioned monopoly.
BULLET::::2. This government sanctioned monopoly would violate FCC rules and precedent (DirectTV and Echostar), Congressional rules, and anti-trust principles.
BULLET::::3. This government sanctioned monopoly would undermine competition
BULLET::::4. Both companies have a pattern of violating the terms of the FCC licenses and can't be trusted.
BULLET::::5. XM and Sirius are not failing companies and should not receive a government bailout.

</ol>
Rerh accused Sirius and XM of breaking promises and asserted that neither company can be trusted. To trust the new, combined company would be stupid, he alleged.

<h3>Gigi Sohn</h3>
Gigi Sohn of Public Knowledge presented a more balanced view. On one hand, consolidation will raise questions about price and choice. On the other hand, XM and Sirius have engaged in a spending war, harming both companies financially. She also proposed conditions to protect consumer choice, such as public radio and educational programming requirements. Touching on the &lt;a href="w%3ARecording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Recording Industry Association of America&lt;/a&gt; lawsuit, she also stated that consumers should be allowed to record programming.

<h3>Mark Cooper</h3>
Mark Cooper spoke on behalf of the &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Federation%20of%20America"&gt;Consumer Federation of America&lt;/a&gt;. "We have not given up on competition," Cooper said. Like David Rehr, he pointed out the restriction by the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FCC) against merging the two licenses. He believed the distinction between satellite and terrestrial radio makes satellite a unique market, where satellite radio is mobile and nationwide, and is not content-regulated. He also touched on the conditions of entry into the FCC market, "Four is few and six is many, we only have two in this market."

Cooper also brought up "inter-modal competition" (competition between services that offer similar, but not the same products.) According to him, inter-modal competition has a poor track record of keeping down costs and increasing product quality. 

Cooper was extremely outspoken against a "regulated monopoly", and said "consumers are better served by competition."

<h3>Charles Biggio</h3>
Charles Biggio has a history in anti-trust regulation. He advocating finding more facts regarding the merger. His argument focused around Section 7 of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.stolaf.edu/people/becker/antitrust/statutes/clayton.html"&gt;Clayton Act&lt;/a&gt; (see section 18.) Unlike other speakers, he did not have an agenda to pursue, but rather spoke specifically on government regulations.

<h3>Mel Karmazin</h3>
Mel Karmazin spoke on behalf of both XM and Sirius. Karmazin made several points and promises:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. The price will not go up. At the beginning that was implied, but by the end of the meeting he made a promise that the price of the XM and Sirius service will not be raised over the current $12.95 a month mark, and will probably go down as tiered products are introduced.
BULLET::::2. The merger was willing to comply with any reasonable restrictions placed on the new company.
BULLET::::3. Consumers would not need to switch to new radios. A unified receiver has been developed, and he has one sitting in his office right now. This receiver can't be produced now because of the cost: no manufacturer wants to touch it becaus of the lack of subsidization by XM or Sirius; it would not be reasonable to expect one company to subsidize the manufacture a radio that might not result in a subscription to that company's product.
BULLET::::4. XM and Sirius satellite radio compete with the IPod, local stations, WiMax, cell phones, and Internet radio.
BULLET::::5. Sirius could provide tiered service, however the technology is not in place to allow customers to pick and choose individual channels.

</ol>
<h3>Other monopolies</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Berman"&gt;Howard Berman&lt;/a&gt; (D-California 28th District) made a profound remark: "As I listen to Mr. Rehr's testimony, and when he was talking about merged entities that controlled many radio markets, I thought for a second he was talking about ClearChannel." The media company &lt;a href="w%3AClearChannel"&gt;ClearChannel&lt;/a&gt; holds a considerable stake in the broadcast bandwidth in the United States.

<h3>Diversity</h3>
House Representative &lt;a href="w%3ASheila%20Jackson%20Lee"&gt;Sheila Jackson Lee&lt;/a&gt; (D-Texas) asked about diversity, wondering how the new company would create opportunites for minority ownership and minority involvement in the company's broadcasting? 

Karmazin responded that Sirius and XM have several channels aimed at the African American community: music, entertainment, and talk channels. He noted that each network also carries Spanish-language channels. 

To the impression that the combined stations would provide for minority-oriented programming, Karmazin explained that news and talk feeds were simply picked up from existing TV and radio networks, which left Rep Lee apparently unconvinced that their interests would be served.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

As a debate, this session did not definitevly resolve any issues, and more debate will be necessary. However, it did reveal some interesting facts and motivations:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20Broadcasters"&gt;National Association of Broadcasters&lt;/a&gt; (NAB) is going to fight this merger tooth and nail.
BULLET::::2. Sirius and XM will both operate as they do currently for the foreseeable future. Both XM and Sirius radios will continue to receive their existing channels, in addition to new content carried over from the other network.
BULLET::::3. If the merger does go through, there may be additional requirements, such as educational programming and price controls.
BULLET::::4. XM and Sirius can be said to compete with other media outlets, such as terrestrial radio and portable audio devices.
<ol>
BULLET::::1. The NAB's presence at the meeting seems to contradict their monopoly claims. While the NAB claims that the merger would create a monopoly, they act as if it won't: the satellite network will be competing with NAB stations.
BULLET::::2. Based on an Arbitron report, a satellite radio listener actually listens to more terrestrial radio than a non-satellite radio listener: 14 hours of terrestrial radio for 10 hours of satellite.
BULLET::::3. Emerging technologies exist that will increase the competition in the marketplace: cell phones can now download songs and news. Podcasting is on the rise. Internet radio is more popular than ever.
</ol>
BULLET::::5. At this point, most of the panel members did not want to hear "trust me" from Karmazin. They wanted some other form of assurance.
BULLET::::6. If the companies do indeed form a monopoly, the cost of entry for new competitors is high.
BULLET::::7. Nobody knows whether approving or denying the meger will save or destroy satellite radio.

</ol>
The merger faces more lobbying and politicizing of this issue as the proposal moves forward.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Parti%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois%20leader%20slams%20radio%20host%20on%20homophobia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Sepratist &lt;a href="w%3AParti%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Parti Québécois&lt;/a&gt; (PQ) leader &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Boisclair"&gt;André Boisclair&lt;/a&gt; commented on Louis Champagne, a &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; radio host.

Champagne said the factory workers in Saguenay would never vote for a "tapette," a derogatory French slang word for homosexual.

Champagne was referring to a number of PQ candidates. In one interview with a candidate, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexandre%20Cloutier"&gt;Alexandre Cloutier&lt;/a&gt;, Champagne asks if it would be hard for people to vote for leader André Boisclair, who is homosexual. In another interview, Champagne talks of &lt;a href="w%3ASylvain%20Gaudreault"&gt;Sylvain Gaudreault&lt;/a&gt;, who is running in the riding of &lt;a href="w%3AJonqui%C3%A8re"&gt;Jonquière&lt;/a&gt;. Gaudreault is homosexual. Champagne asks Cloutier, when talking about Gaudreault, if the PQ is a "fag club."
"When you show up with a homosexual, aren't you going to be asked the question, 'Listen, the PQ, isn't that a party of fags?'" the popular morning show radio host said to the candidate.

"You try promoting a homosexual to the boys at &lt;a href="w%3AAlcan"&gt;Alcan&lt;/a&gt;. Just try," said the host talking of Gaudreault.

Boisclair, who is struggling to get the vote of many Quebecers, showed his feelings by commenting to reporters in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20City"&gt;Quebec City&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.

"Is he saying on the radio that people in Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean are more homophobic than other people elsewhere in Quebec?" Boisclair said in response. "Homophobia exists, but I feel these words are insulting for the people of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, and I have the support of millions of Quebecers behind me when I say so."

Meanwhile, Boisclair came to Quebec City as a campaign stop. He presented a new education system that could reduce the rate of high school dropouts. Boisclair also presented other ideas to University students.

A recent poll by &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; based newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Devoir"&gt;Le Devoir&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, on the 27 of February, shows the Parti Quebecois at 28% and the governing party &lt;a href="w%3AParti%20lib%C3%A9ral%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec"&gt;Parti libéral du Québec&lt;/a&gt; at 37%. If the Parti Québécois were to win, they could try to separate the province of Quebec from the rest of Canada.

Today, the &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; took on the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Rangers"&gt;New York Rangers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMadison%20Square%20Garden"&gt;Madison Square Garden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJaromir%20Jagr"&gt;Jaromir Jagr&lt;/a&gt; struck first for New York, with &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Nylander"&gt;Michael Nylander&lt;/a&gt; following suit in the final 2:30 to give the Rangers a comfortable 2-0 lead at the end of the second period. Staal's shorthanded goal came 76 seconds into the final period, with Staal beating Rangers goaltender &lt;a href="w%3A%20Henrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt; with a soft forehand shot. Penguins winger &lt;a href="w%3A%20Colby%20Armstrong"&gt;Colby Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; continued the shorthanded show, scoring less than 2:00 later with a bad angle shot, which would ricochet off of Lundqvist's pad. 

When all momentum had seemingly crossed to the Penguins, Blair Betts fired a goal to restore New York's lead at 3-2. &lt;a href="w%3A%20Sergei%20Gonchar"&gt;Sergei Gonchar&lt;/a&gt; tied it up again late in the 3rd, with a blistering shot on a Penguins power play to level the score at 3-3. In the shootout, not a single score occurred until NHL scoring leader &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt; took the ice. With the shootout tied 0-0, and a point on the line, Crosby beat Lundqvist, lifting Pittsburgh to victory. The game was not a total loss for the Rangers, though, as they picked up a precious point by forcing overtime.

Penguins rookie &lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20Staal"&gt;Jordan Staal&lt;/a&gt; wasn't supposed to make the team, and once he did make it, he wasn't expected to contribute more than assisting on the penalty kill and filling in on the fourth line. Not much could be expected of an 18 year old rookie not named Sidney Crosby. That was the premise before the season started, at least. Now, heading into the stretch run toward the NHL Playoffs, Staal leads not just rookies, but the entire &lt;a href="w%3ANHL"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; in shorthanded goals, after notching his 6th of the season, his 26th total goal.

Several players in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; are packing their bags. Topping the list is &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Steelers"&gt;Steelers&lt;/a&gt; linebacker &lt;a href="w%3AJoey%20Porter"&gt;Joey Porter&lt;/a&gt;. Porter was considering holding out of training camp for a new deal, and the Steelers needed breathing room to fit under the salary cap. Porter, called the "Most Feared Player in the NFL" by &lt;a href="w%3ASports%20Illustrated"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt; last fall, had a disappointing 2006 campaign, with only seven sacks.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%20Saints"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Horn"&gt;Joe Horn&lt;/a&gt; by his own request. Horn was a fan favorite, standing up for the city when the team was forced to evacuate following &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. Horn is also known for infamously pulling a cell phone out of a goal post in a post-touchdown celebration. 
As expected, the &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Cowboys"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; cut quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ADrew%20Bledsoe"&gt;Drew Bledsoe&lt;/a&gt;, although Cowboys owner Jerry Jones did not rule out Bledsoe returning at a lower salary, stating: "I spoke with Drew today and told him that this was primarily a cap decision and that the door was very much open for him being a part of our future." Bledsoe, a former first pick in the draft, was pushed out of his job by Tony Romo after a terrible first half in 2006.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2049ers"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; released wide receiver &lt;a href="w%3AAntonio%20Bryant"&gt;Antonio Bryant&lt;/a&gt;, after Bryant had several clashes with the law, as well as 49ers head coach Mike Nolan. Bryant lead San Francisco with 40 receptions for 733 yards. Bryant's short career with the 49ers ended in a four-game suspension to end the season.

&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Chargers"&gt;San Diego Chargers&lt;/a&gt; wide receiver &lt;a href="w%3AKeenan%20McCardell"&gt;Keenan McCardell&lt;/a&gt; was among those released Thursday. The 37 year old receiver had 36 catches for the Chargers last year, his 15th NFL season. The Chargers also released safety &lt;a href="w%3ATerrance%20Kiel"&gt;Terrance Kiel&lt;/a&gt; and linebacker &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Foley"&gt;Steve Foley&lt;/a&gt;. Kiel had pleaded guilty last month to felony and misdemeanor drug charges. Foley had been shot this past year by a police officer.

<h2>Notable Resignings</h2>

<h3>Popeyes Chicken sues Church's over franchisee buy-out</h3>

United States fast-food chain &lt;a href="w%3APopeyes%20Chicken%20and%20Biscuits"&gt;Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits&lt;/a&gt; has filed a $20 million dollar lawsuit against competitor &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%27s%20Chicken"&gt;Church's Chicken&lt;/a&gt;.

Popeyes Chicken says fast-food chain Church's Chicken was trying to steal customers.

AFC owned both companies for 12 years, till it sold Church's in 2004. AFC claims that Church bought all 10 Popeyes restaurants owned by franchisee CVI. Popeyes Chicken says the sale of the 10 restaurants violated its franchise agreement with CVI.

The sudden buy-out in December 2006 led the restaurants to close in early January 2007. 

"What Church's chose to do, I do believe, was not honest competition," said Ken Keymer, CEO of &lt;a href="w%3AAFC%20Enterprises%20Inc."&gt;AFC Enterprises Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of Popeyes.

Church's spokesperson chose not to comment on the issue.

<h3>Australian plant species reclassified</h3>
The national body for scientific research in Australia, the &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20Organisation"&gt;CSIRO&lt;/a&gt; has announced that 93 species of shrubs and small trees of the &lt;a href="w%3Agenus"&gt;w:genus&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADryandra"&gt;Dryandra&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ have been been merged into the genus ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABanksia"&gt;Banksia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in the series ♡❤Dryandra♡❤. This increased the number of Banksia species from 80 to 173. 

The plants are endemic to the southwestern corner of &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; and the former genus was named in honour of the Swedish botanist &lt;a href="w%3AJonas%20C.%20Dryander"&gt;Jonas C. Dryander&lt;/a&gt;.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Shinzo%20Abe"&gt;Shinzo Abe&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the conservative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Japan%29"&gt;Liberal Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, denied responsibility for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AComfort%20women"&gt;military brothels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; set up during &lt;a href="World%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Abe said, "There is no evidence to prove there was coercion, nothing to support it. So, in respect to this declaration, you have to keep in mind that things have changed greatly." 

His statement contrasts with earlier comments in which he seemed to support a 1993 government declaration that Japan had in fact set up wartime military brothels. 

Korean believe around 200,000 women from a multitude of different nations were forced into brothels during the war, where they would be raped dozens of times daily. However, conservative elements in the Japanese government have often denied or minimized the extent of war crimes taking place during World War II.

In 1992, historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi discovered a document titled in the Defense Agency's library (The content of this order is "A Japanese army prohibits the use for the malignant Korean people broker. "), prompting the government's 1993 declaration. Over the years, several former sex slaves have stepped forward, providing testimony in direct contrast with the Japanese government's.

According to one &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; Common Council member, David Franczyk, the City of Buffalo Police force is staging a "sickout" on the weekend of &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Patricks%20Day"&gt;St. Patricks Day&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANCAA"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; Basketball Tournament, or somewhere around March 17, 2007.

A sickout means that officers in the entire city would all call in sick during that weekend.

Franczyk says that he received a call from at least one person that claimed he was an officer of the Buffalo police force and that he was warning Franczyk that the sickout was going to take place. The caller also claimed, according to Franczyk, that his intentions are to get "the nation's attention."

"He explained that because the wages are frozen that this would be a work action to get the attention of the Nation essentially," said Franczyk. As of the moment, Franczyk has been the only Common Council member to be informed about the sickout.

Mayor of Buffalo, &lt;a href="w%3AByron%20Brown"&gt;Byron Brown&lt;/a&gt; said if this were to take place, it would be "catastrophic" for the city, but also said that he thinks the sickout "will not happen" and also added that it would be "illegal."

"How catastrophic would it be if they were to ever do that? Again, I don't believe that it would happen. Those kinds of behaviours..those kinds of actions are irresponsible and illegal. We have a Police Department that is very responsible," said Brown.

Brown also said that he believes that police officers "will do the right thing" and that they will "do their jobs, even if they are frustrated."

The name of the officer who called Franczyk is not known and it is not known if he was actually a police officer.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ attempted to contact Franczyk regarding the sickout, but he has yet to respond.

Protests have continued after &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3ALille%20OSC"&gt;Lille&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; round of 16. A free kick by &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Giggs"&gt;Ryan Giggs&lt;/a&gt; in the second half of the game caused great controversy, as Lille was setting up their wall as the ball went into the back of the net. Lille players nearly walked off the pitch at the time, but they were goaded back onto the field, and the game ended 1 - 0 for Manchester United.

Lille made one protest to &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt;, asking for a replay of the match, but the appeal was turned down, and the decision of referee &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Braamhaar"&gt;Eric Braamhaar&lt;/a&gt; stood for the time. Lille has made a second protest, claiming a technical error on the referee's part, as the kick was taken without the whistle being blown. UEFA has rejected their appeal again, saying no proof of a technical error has been presented. Lille will have 3 days after receiving notice from UEFA to lodge another appeal to the &lt;a href="w%3ACourt%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport"&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport&lt;/a&gt;, or the claim will be dismissed in full.

The second leg game between United and Lille will take place next Wednesday at &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Trafford%20%28football%20ground%29"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;.

There will be a full &lt;a href="w%3ALunar%20eclipse"&gt;lunar eclipse&lt;/a&gt; starting on Saturday, &lt;a href="w%3AMarch%202007"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt; 3. Earth's passage between the Sun and the Moon will begin casting its shadow on the surface of the Moon starting at 20:18 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;. The Moon will be totally eclipsed by the Earth's shadow between 22:44 and 23:58 UTC.

Cloudless conditions would make for a great viewing experience as the &lt;a href="w%3ALunar%20phase"&gt;Lunar phase&lt;/a&gt; is now &lt;a href="w%3AFull%20moon"&gt;full&lt;/a&gt;. The color of the moon will be like that of copper.

In &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, the lunar eclipse will occur between 8:18pm and until 2:24am.

A chart to calculate the &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20offset"&gt;time offset&lt;/a&gt; from UTC puts the eclipse starting at 3:18pm &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; in North America. The moon will be totally eclipsed 21 minutes prior to sunset in that time zone. The moonrise will occur during the period it is eclipsed, at 6:01pm. Viewers will be able to see the moon re-emerge from the Earth's shadow, weather permitting.

The eclipse will take place during the Hindu festival of &lt;a href="w%3AHoli"&gt;Holi&lt;/a&gt;.

The official reason for the expulsions is that the students failed multiple tests. Activists, however, claim that other students with similarly poor &lt;a href="w%3AAcademia"&gt;academic&lt;/a&gt; records have been allowed to continue their studies.

Ahmadinejad was cited as saying that dissenting students would go unpunished. "It is my honour to burn for the sake of the nation's ideals and defend the system," he said as protesters burned a picture of him.

To members of the Islamic Students Committee, the expulsions break Ahmadinejad's public pledge that none of them would be harmed for speaking out. Said vice-secretary Ali Azizi, "It demonstrates revenge against the students' protests."

There was a report in February that students who had been expelled were re-admitted. &lt;a href="w%3AKyrgyzstan"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt;'s news agency Adnkronos International (AKI), reported that Abbas Hakimzadeh, said that the re-admission was a "victory of the students' movement." 

It remains unclear if the expulsions reported by Robert Tait of &lt;a href="w%3AGuardian%20Unlimited"&gt;Guardian Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; is reporting a new expulsion, a re-expulsion, or simply old news.

A "star rating" system has been introduced since Ahmadinejad's presidency began. It supposedly ranks politically active students from one star up to three stars, relative to the perceived threat they pose. Prospective students with one star have been asked to sign a statement that they would not join any &lt;a href="w%3APolitics"&gt;political activities&lt;/a&gt;. Applicants with two stars are said to have enrollment delayed by months, and applicants with three stars would be barred admission to a &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity"&gt;university&lt;/a&gt;.

Amir Kabir University is one of the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20colleges%20and%20universities%20in%20Tehran"&gt;universities&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; from which the &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20Revolution"&gt;1979 Islamic Revolution&lt;/a&gt; drew much of its support.

Businesses operating in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, are threatening to sue the government within the next two weeks, if it fails to resolve the current &lt;a href="Hezbollah-led%20protestors%20stage%20Beirut%20sit-in"&gt;street protests&lt;/a&gt; being held by groups opposed to the government. Currently, about eighty shops had been forced to close down due to the protest.

Large numbers of people took part in the &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;-led protests held since the beginning of December 2006, along with the security measures imposed by the Internal Security Forces, cut off downtown Beirut from the rest of Beirut, thus strangulating most businesses in the area.

Lawyers of affected firms have prepared a civil suit, and company owners and managers are now tabulating damage estimates, said Tony Salameh, chairman of Aishti, at a news conference Thursday at the Phoenicia &lt;a href="w%3AInterContinental"&gt;InterContinental&lt;/a&gt;. He went on by saying that the Lebanese politicians are to be held responsible. He had also met with President &lt;a href="w%3AEmile%20Lahoud"&gt;Emile Lahoud&lt;/a&gt; and Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AFouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt; without achieving any tangible results.

Late last month, the Tourist Associations have pleaded with General &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Aoun"&gt;Michel Aoun&lt;/a&gt;, one of the opposition leaders, to find a new site for the round-the-clock Hezbollah-led protest that has crippled downtown Beirut since the protest began.

Manchester United and Liverpool faced off earlier today at Anfield, with Liverpool undefeated at their home field so far this season. United fielded a strong side including Larsson, Ronaldo, and Rooney, and Liverpool matched their lineup with Kuyt, Gerrard and Bellamy taking to the pitch. Speculation said manager Rafa Benitez would rest his star players for the upcoming Barcelona match, but the Spanish manager proved otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Liverpool came out strong, not giving any ground to league leaders United. Early strikes by Agger and Riise looked promising, but most efforts sailed wide of the net. Christiano Ronaldo had several chances for United, but his shots also were off target. Craig Bellamy was especially threatening for Liverpool, as he continually outplayed defender Nemanja Vidic, and sent several crosses into the middle, none causing any damage to the Red Devils. Ronaldo had a strong run down the right side, but timely defending by Carragher stopped him in his tracks, as well as another chance by Wayned Rooney.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the second half, Liverpool was again looking dominant, as shots from Gerrard, Bellamy, and Kuyt all flew in, but again no results come of the dominant play. Bellamy then appeared to have gained the lead for the home side, but the goal was deemed offside, as Sissoko took an extra touch before the ball reached the Welshman. Manchester then made an attacking change, putting Saha in place of Larsson, who was playing his last game for United before heading back to Sweeden. Rooney was then forced to be changed after a high foot from Carragher produced a gash in his knee, and the young Englishman was replaced by O'Shea. Riise again challenged Van Der Sar's goal with a long distance shot, but the ball dipped over the crossbar and out of play. Saha had an appeal for a penalty after a challenge by Agger left him on the ground, but the referee gave no call. As Liverpool left the zone, Paul Scholes appeared to take a swipe at the head of Xavi Alonso with his fist, and was subsenquently red carded, leaving United with 10 men. Liverpool continued to attack, and Peter Crouch had plenty of room to strike in a half volley from 8 yards, but Edwin Van Der Sar produced a fingertip save to keep the game tied. As the game entered stoppage time, Ryan Giggs earned a free kick on the edge of the Liverpool penalty box, and Christiano Ronaldo lined up for the kick. Jose Reina was not able to hold onto Ronaldo's powerful kick, and the ball popped out to John O'Shea, who slammed the ball into the top of the net, giving 10 man United the lead. Liverpool tried in vain to tie the match, as Ronaldo wasted time with his tricks and turns. When the 4 minutes of stoppage time were up, the game continued, and Liverpool earned a corner. Brazilian Aurelio took the corner, but it was poor and as Rio Ferdinand cleared the ball, Martin Atkinson blew the whistle to condemn Liverpool to their first home defeat in the Premier League this season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The game leaves Manchester United 12 points ahead of 2nd place Chelsea, who have 2 games in hand and play later today against Portsmouth. Liverpool on the other hand will regroup for the second leg of their Champions League match against Barcelona.

<h3>UK Attorney General stops BBC report on cash-for-honours probe</h3>
The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Attorney General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Goldsmith"&gt;Lord Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; obtained an injunction from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Courts%20of%20Justice"&gt;Royal Courts of Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in London stopping the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from broadcasting a report on the ongoing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACash%20for%20Peerages"&gt;cash-for-honours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; probe involving Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;'s government.

The Attorney General's office and the Metropolitan Police issued a joint press release that the injunction was sought at the request of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Scotland%20Yard"&gt;New Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and was meant to avoid impeding ongoing investigations.

The BBC said that its reporting was on a matter of public interest.

Controversy and discussion erupted on internet forums on 28 February 2007, when publicity was given to Essjay, a prominent Wikipedia administrator and editor, having claimed false credentials which were published in a magazine. Internet encyclopedia Wikipedia co-founder &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimbo Wales&lt;/a&gt; was travelling in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, and at 06:42 on March 3 he issued a statement that further information had come to his attention and he had asked the editor to resign his positions of trust within the community. At 03:17 on March 4 Essjay announced on his user talk page that he had retired and was no longer active on Wikipedia.

The affair became public when the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20Yorker"&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ issued a retraction to their article about Wikipedia which they had published at the end of July 2006, stating that biographical details they had printed about an administrator and contributor they had interviewed had been found to be false, even though he had confirmed the accuracy of these details as shown on his user page while remaining anonymous. 

The Pulitzer Prize winning reporter &lt;a href="w%3AStacy%20Schiff"&gt;Stacy Schiff&lt;/a&gt; was referred by the Wikimedia Foundation for an interview for the article to Wikipedia administrator Essjay, a member of Wikipedia's arbitration committee and generally trusted member of the community.

EssJay had fabricated a persona which he described on his user page on Wikipedia, presenting himself as a tenured professor at a private US university. After the news broke, EssJay claimed that the false details were intended to avoid &lt;a href="w%3Acyberstalking"&gt;cyberstalking&lt;/a&gt;.

The following is an excerpt of a statement Wales issued on his talk page:

Essjay revealed his identity as Ryan Jordan, a 24-year-old with no advanced degrees, who has never taught, when he was hired by Wikia, a company that runs community-based wikis.

Jordan has since posted that he was shocked Schiff would publish such information; "It was, quite honestly, my impression that it was well known that I was not who I claimed to be, and that in the absence of any confirmation, no respectible publication would print it."

Five-hundred edits were made to his talk page between 09:45, March 1, 2007 and 17:04, March 3, 2007, and the barrage of comments was expected to continue for an extended period. EssJay subsequently retired from the English Wikipedia, and requested that his bureaucrat, checkuser, oversight, and sysop privileges be revoked.

Wikipedia allows its users to be anonymous, by creating usernames as pseudonyms. However, it is considered unethical to purposely misrepresent oneself to the media, or to use unjustified claims to qualifications to support arguments with other contributors.

In his first official visit to &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, Iran's President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; met &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;King Abdullah&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the region's growing political and sectarian conflicts, agreeing to stand against "enemy plots" that divide the Muslim world.

Both leaders have expressed concern over sectarian tensions in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, fearing they could spread through the Middle East.

According to an account of Sunday's meeting in Riyadh by the Saudi Press Agency, "The two leaders asserted that the greatest danger threatening the Muslim nation at the present time is the attempt to spread strife between Sunni and Shia Muslims and that efforts should be exerted to stop such attempts and close ranks."

Iran is a large &lt;a href="w%3AShia"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; power in the region and Saudi Arabia a large Sunni power. The Saudis have tried in recent months to curb the growing influence of Iran, even working to cool off tensions in Lebanon, where the Iran-backed &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; has faced off with the secular &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; government.

After returning to Tehran, Ahmadinejad said, "Plots carried out by the enemies in order to divide the world of Islam were discussed" and both men condemned those plots. He also said Iraq and Palestinian issues were discussed "comprehensively."

<h1>Three babies dead within one week at Madrid Hospital</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Three%20babies%20dead%20within%20one%20week%20at%20Madrid%20Hospital&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; hospital reported today that three premature babies have died within one week from the same infection. The babies, who were being cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit of &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤12 de Octubre♡❤ Hospital, all died after being infected with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AKlebsiella%20pneumoniae"&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ bacterium. Authorities also suspect that a fourth baby has become infected with the bacterium. The Spanish patients' association ADEPA has asked the public prosecutor of the Madrid Region, Manuel Moix, to open an investigation into the matter.

This morning, hospital authorities stated that the first death occurred on 26 February. A baby born eight weeks prematurely and weighing just under one kilo died due to septic shock arising from the infection, which was unconnected with the symptoms of his premature birth, according to hospital reports.

Shortly afterwards, two babies in the same unit died on 2 March. They appear to have died from the same infection; however the hospital stated that they are still waiting for confirmation of the cause of death. A fourth baby has been found to have the bacteria on his skin, but as yet there is no confirmation of whether he has been infected. The hospital states that although the baby is in a serious condition, this is to be expected when a baby is born so premature, and that his condition is also due to other factors, unrelated to the bacterium, which have arisen since his birth.

The hospital authorities have asserted that all of the babies in its care are under close supervision, and are being periodically monitored by the Preventive Medicine Centre, in order that the most up-to-date information may be had on the state of any and all patients in the hospital. 

To prevent further infections, the hospital has taken several measures. The first is of course rigorous medical hygiene. High-risk patients are referred to other hospitals. The hospital has been divided into two separate zones, one for those already infected and the other for those who have not yet been affected. As a consequence, 25 children who were staying in the hospital while the 3 premature babies died, remain separate from the others, to make sure newly admitted children are not exposed. The nursing staff has also been restricted to one or other of these two areas. Visits from specialists of other hospital services, and from families, has been restricted. Furthermore, an epidemiological study is being undertaken to determine the origin of the situation.

The newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Pa%C3%ADs"&gt;El País&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that the bacterium ♡❤Klebsiella pneumoniae♡❤ is to be found in hospitals as a matter of course and is often contracted by those who have been in hospital for prolonged periods (termed a &lt;a href="w%3Anosocomial%20infection"&gt;nosocomial infection&lt;/a&gt;). The mortality rate from the bacterium is extremely high in those cases where it's contracted by people with serious illnesses, as is often to be expected in the case of a premature birth, which can result in newborn babies weighing less than 500 grammes.

According to the Spanish daily, this type of bacterium is prevalent in hospitals throughout the world, but the incidence of infection in Madrid hospitals is lower than the Spanish average. The head of the Neonatal Unit at 12 de Octubre Hospital, Carmen Payás, explained that the bacterium is very adaptable "and keeps on learning". The father of the dead baby, an &lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;ian named Angel Marcelo, was quoted as saying that the progress of the baby had at first been "tremendous", and that he had even been taken off the respirator, but that a few days later he began to cough up blood, dying soon afterwards.

The chair of ADEPA, Carmen Flores, has appealed to the Madrid public prosecutor to open an investigation into the situation and to find those responsible. ADEPA have suggested that the investigation centre on the number of casualties among infants in the hospital, and on the question of whether conditions in the neonatal unit were a direct contributor to the incidence of the infection.

José Quero, head of the Neonatology Department of the La Paz hospital in Madrid said that, "sadly enough", this situation was "not something exceptional," but rather something neonatologists have to watch out for.

Several conflicts involving civilians occurred in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; at the same time that Australian-led peacekeeping troops stormed a town where a rebel former army officer and his men have been under siege.

The Australian soldiers, supported by helicopters and armored vehicles, stormed the town of Same, 50km south of the capital &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt;, at dawn.

Four armed East Timorese men were killed and two others injured during the operation, but their leader, Major &lt;a href="w%3AAlfredo%20Reinado"&gt;Alfredo Reinado&lt;/a&gt;, escaped the troops.

The operation was authorised by East Timor's president, &lt;a href="w%3AXanana%20Gusm%C3%A3o"&gt;Xanana Gusmão&lt;/a&gt;, after Reinado refused to negotiate. 

The Major was directly involved in the clashes with the government forces last May, and was later jailed by Portuguese troops for having in his possession dozens of weapons and explosives that he hadn't handed over to the Australian troops in charge of disarming the rebels. Reinado escaped during a mass breakout from a Dili jail last August.

After the Australian-led operation started, many conflicts occurred simultaneously in different parts of Dili, with roads being barricaded and cut off by burning tires, rocks and trees. Many houses and vehicles were also burned, as violence between rival groups started on the streets.

The Vila Verde neighborhood, right in the center of Dili, was one of the most affected, with facilities of the Education Ministry being engulfed by a fire until the morning.

Benjamin Marty, finance manager for the Norwegian Council for Refugees in East Timor, has his house and office in Vila Verde, in the same street that connects the Portuguese Corporation Neighborhood to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Integrated%20Mission%20in%20Timor-Leste"&gt;United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste&lt;/a&gt; (UNMIT) headquarters.

"I didn't get too worried when a saw a group of people starting to hit the gate, but I called my boss, that said me to stay calm." Bryn Bithell-Marty said.

"Ten minutes later, I see the GNR arrive and starting to fire rubber bullets to the right and to the left" of the street, Marty remembered.

"They called and asked me to open the gate, but initially I didn't understood what they wanted, because I don't speak Portuguese. Just in some minutes, I was inside a armored vehicle, and we got out of there at the same speed that they had arrived, deviating from the barricades with a lot of skill", Marty added.

Benjamin Marty said he was "surprised with the professionalism" with which the &lt;a href="w%3APortuguese%20Republican%20National%20Guard"&gt;Portuguese Republican National Guard&lt;/a&gt; (GNR) acted, but he was discontented with members of the United Nations Police (UNPol).

"There's UNPol near my house, the patrol cars were always stopped and the police agents didn't do anything», Marty said, adding that the UNPol agents also didn't react "hours early when some people started to burn tires and hitting metal to call other people to the street".

The clashes in Taibessi, Pité neighbourhood, and at the entrance of the UNMIT headquarters were the most severe, involving firearms in some locations.

In Banana Road, one of the main roads that crosses the city, a group of teenagers guarded a poster of Alfredo Reinado.

"We are the defenders of Major Alfredo, hero of the justice. We are ready to die to defend him", said one of them.

In the streets of Taibessi since some days ago that the illumination posts and some trees have posters and banners of Alfredo Reinado.

As a response to the successive attacks by a group on the Pité neighborhood, 15 &lt;a href="w%3APol%C3%ADcia%20de%20Seguran%C3%A7a%20P%C3%BAblica"&gt;Portuguese Public Security Police&lt;/a&gt; (PSP) officers, organized themselves without orders from the UNPol, and for three hours the 15 officers faced the attacks.

Later back at the GNR headquarters, Benjamin Marty, found himself even more surprised. "Do you know how the Asterix and Obelix stories end?" he said. On the GNR headquarters there wasn't a party with roasted boars, like in the Gaul village, "but there was a cow in the skewer", he added.

All of the three GNR operational platoons then left their monthly festivity to the streets of Dili, for a operation that lasted seven hours.

A week after having been ordered to pay a one-and-a-half-billion dollar fine by courts in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤El Mundo♡❤ reports today that &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has won a case brought by Alcatel-Lucent against Microsoft involving the violation of patents on voice-recognition technology.

Alcatel-Lucent's spokesman said that the company planned to appeal against the verdict by a federal judge in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt;, and were confident of victory on appeal.

On the other hand, Tom Burt, a member of Microsoft's legal team, said that Microsoft were confident that the appeal court would uphold the verdict of the trial court.

Last week, a jury in the San Diego federal court upheld a complaint against Microsoft for the violation of patents on the MP3 format, used on computers and portable media players. Sources said that the $1.5bn fine, the largest ever awarded in a patent case, took into account the number of computers sold pre-installed with the Microsoft Windows operating system since May 2003.

The verdict - which Microsoft has confirmed it intends to appeal - could have implications far beyond Microsoft's Redmond, WA headquarters, due to the high volume of devices which use the MP3 format; the format is the most popular method of storing digital music on portable music players, etc.

The NCAA's two-week slate of conference championships came to a conclusion on Sunday, March 11. Twenty-five conferences held their championship games this past week, cementing the postseason destinies of schools headed to the national tournament.

<h2>Conference championship recaps</h2>

<h3>Sunday, March 4, 2007</h3>
The week kicked off with the &lt;a href="w%3AMissouri%20Valley%20Conference"&gt;Missouri Valley Conference&lt;/a&gt; championship. The &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Illinois%20University"&gt;Southern Illinois Salukis&lt;/a&gt; took on the &lt;a href="w%3ACreighton%20University"&gt;Creighton Bluejays&lt;/a&gt; for the right to guarantee a trip to the national tournament. While nationally-ranked SIU was heavily favored and had defeated Creighton twice during the regular season, the Salukis had no answer for the Bluejays attack. Creighton led by as many as 14 points, and while SIU was able to cut the deficit to five in the waning minutes, Creighton's free throw shooting allowed them to ride the lead to a victory.

<h3>Monday, March 5, 2007</h3>
The first game on March 5th featured the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Commonwealth%20University"&gt;Virginia Commonwealth Rams&lt;/a&gt; taking on the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Mason%20University"&gt;George Mason Patriots&lt;/a&gt;. GMU, coming off a trip to the national semifinals last year, simply ran out of steam as VCU used a 12-2 run in the final 90 seconds of the game to finish off the Patriots, 68-58. With GMU leading by 5 points with just under 1:30 remaining, VCU scored 6 straight points to take the lead. Off a miss by GMU, Eric Maynor of VCU brought down the rebound and drew an intentional foul that would all but seal the win for the Rams. VCU's overall record now stands at 27-6.

In the MAAC final, &lt;a href="w%3ANiagara%20University"&gt;Niagara University&lt;/a&gt; got 26 points from Tyrone Lewis and 21 from Lorenzo Miles as the Purple Eagles defeated &lt;a href="w%3ASiena%20University"&gt;Siena University&lt;/a&gt; 83-79. Niagara returns to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2004.

Out west, the &lt;a href="w%3AGonzaga%20University"&gt;Gonzaga&lt;/a&gt; Bulldogs wrapped up their fourth straight West Coast Conference tournament championship with a 77-68 win over &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clara%20University"&gt;Santa Clara&lt;/a&gt;. The Broncos' loss marked the final game for Santa Clara coach Dick Davey, who announced his retirement on February 1st. Gonzaga will be making its ninth straight trip to the NCAA tournament.

<h3>Tuesday, March 6, 2007</h3>
Three more conference champions were crowned on Tuesday night. The first game of the evening was the Mid-Continent Conference championship, which went to the &lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts%20University"&gt;Oral Roberts Golden Eagles&lt;/a&gt;. The matchup against &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20University"&gt;Oakland University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; was a rematch of the Mid-Con final from 2005, when the seventh-seeded Grizzlies upset ORU to earn the MCC's automatic bid. Tonight would not be a repeat of that fateful game two years ago, as the Golden Eagles held off a spirited rally from Oakland to win. Oakland led by 11 at the half, but ORU stormed back early in the second half and kept the Grizzlies at bay for the last seven minutes of the game.

The second game of the evening was an upset, with the &lt;a href="w%3AWright%20State%20University"&gt;Wright State Raiders&lt;/a&gt; upsetting the 17th-ranked &lt;a href="w%3AButler%20University"&gt;Butler Bulldogs&lt;/a&gt; 60-55. Butler trailed by 8 with 11 minutes to go in the game but fought back and kept the game close for the last half of regulation, but the Raiders were able to fend off the Bulldogs with four straight free throws in the final 12 seconds. Butler still stands a chance of receiving an at-large selection to the tournament but will not know their fate until March 11.

The final game of the evening was the Sun Belt championship, with the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20North%20Texas"&gt;North Texas Mean Green&lt;/a&gt; taking the conference championship over &lt;a href="w%3AArkansas%20State%20University"&gt;Arkansas State&lt;/a&gt; 83-75. UNT led by only one at the break but scored 46 points in the second half to earn their first conference championship since 1988.

<h3>Wednesday, March 7, 2007</h3>
Two conferences crowned champions on Wednesday evening. In the Northeast Conference, the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Connecticut%20State%20University"&gt;Central Connecticut State Blue Devils&lt;/a&gt; earned a trip to the NCAA tournament with a 74-70 win over &lt;a href="w%3ASacred%20Heart%20University"&gt;Sacred Heart&lt;/a&gt;. The Blue Devils will be the only team from Connecticut in the tournament this year as state counterpart &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Connecticut"&gt;UConn&lt;/a&gt; was eliminated in the first round of the Big East tournament and will presumably miss out on the tournament with a 17-14 overall record.

Out west in the Big Sky Conference, the &lt;a href="w%3AWeber%20State%20University"&gt;Weber State Wildcats&lt;/a&gt; picked up their 20th win, a conference championship, and their first NCAA invitation since 2003 with an 88-80 victory over the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Arizona%20University"&gt;Northern Arizona Lumberjacks&lt;/a&gt;. While NAU was able to cut a 21-point Weber State lead to as little as two points, the Lumberjacks never led in the game.

There are no conference championship games on Thursday. The Patriot League resumes the slate of conference championship games on Friday.

<h3>Friday, March 9, 2007</h3>

The lone conference championship on Friday saw the Crusaders of the &lt;a href="w%3ACollege%20of%20the%20Holy%20Cross"&gt;College of the Holy Cross&lt;/a&gt; defeat the &lt;a href="w%3ABucknell%20University"&gt;Bucknell Bison&lt;/a&gt; 74-66. The Crusaders, leading 35-22 at the half, opened the second half with an 11-5 run, before the Bison answered with a 13-0 of their own. The Bison were able to tie the game with just under 6 minutes left in the game, but the Crusaders scored seven straight points to answer.

<h3>Saturday, March 10, 2007</h3>

The largest day of conference finals during the week commenced with the Conference USA championship featuring the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Memphis"&gt;Memphis Tigers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Houston"&gt;Houston Cougars&lt;/a&gt;. Memphis won decisively, 71-59. The Tigers never trailed during the second half and had a double-digit lead for much of the last 20 minutes.

Out at the America East Conference championship in Burlington, Vermont, the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Albany"&gt;Albany Great Danes&lt;/a&gt; eked out a 60-59 victory against the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Vermont"&gt;Vermont Catamounts&lt;/a&gt;. Vermont had a possession to win with 32.5 seconds left, but Albany defender Brian Lillis knocked the ball loose from Vermont guard Mike Trimboli with four seconds left to preserve the victory.

Nine other champions were crowned during the course of the day. &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20A%26amp%3BM%20University"&gt;Florida A&amp;M&lt;/a&gt; won the MEAC championship narrowly, defeating &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware%20State%20University"&gt;Delaware State&lt;/a&gt; 58-56. In the SWAC, &lt;a href="w%3AJackson%20State%20University"&gt;Jackson State&lt;/a&gt; had a slightly larger margin of victory, taking out the Delta Devils of &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi%20Valley%20State%20University"&gt;Mississippi Valley State&lt;/a&gt; 81-71.

Other big winners included &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Washington%20University"&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; (Atlantic 10), &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; (Pac-10), &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgetown%20University"&gt;Georgetown&lt;/a&gt; (Big East), and &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Beach%20State%20University"&gt;Long Beach State&lt;/a&gt; (Big West).

Three other conference championships game down to the final minutes. At the Mid-American Conference championship, the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20University"&gt;Miami Redhawks&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Akron"&gt;Akron Zips&lt;/a&gt; in controversial fashion. Miami player Doug Penno banked in a 3-point shot as time apparently expired, but upon review the officials placed six tenths of a second back on the official clock. When Akron's inbounds pass was tipped away, the Miami celebration could begin in earnest. Akron coach Keith Dambrot claimed that the clock started late when Miami inbounded the pass initially and that Penno's shot came after when the buzzer should have sounded. The officials determined that the Miami sequence took six seconds, and placed six tenths of a second back on the clock. Dambrot continued to protest, but to no avail.

In the Mountain West Conference championship, the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Nevada%20at%20Las%20Vegas"&gt;UNLV&lt;/a&gt; Rebels rallied from a 13-point deficit early in the second half to defeat the &lt;a href="w%3ABrigham%20Young%20University"&gt;Brigham Young Cougars&lt;/a&gt; 78-70. Farther south, at the Western Athletic Conference championship, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Mexico%20State%20University"&gt;New Mexico State Aggies&lt;/a&gt; survived a &lt;a href="w%3AUtah%20State%20University"&gt;Utah State&lt;/a&gt; rally and hung on for the 72-70 victory.

<h3>Sunday, March 11, 2007</h3>

Five conference championships took place mere hours before the official release of the NCAA tournament bracket. The first game of the day was the Southeastern Conference championship, featuring the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas Razorbacks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Florida"&gt;Florida Gators&lt;/a&gt;. The Gators took control early and routed the Razorbacks 77-56 to claim their third straight SEC tournament title.

Out at the Atlantic Coast Conference championship in Tampa, Florida, the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina%20State%20University"&gt;North Carolina State Wolfpack&lt;/a&gt; fell just short of a historic tournament run, falling to the top-seeded &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina Tar Heels&lt;/a&gt; 89-80. NCSU entered the ACC tournament as a 10-seed, defeating three straight ranked opponents on their way to the ACC championship, but fell just short of a successful tournament run.

The Southland Conference championship came down to the final seconds, as the &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University%20at%20Corpus%20Christi"&gt;Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi Islanders&lt;/a&gt; won 81-78. The &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwestern%20State%20University"&gt;Northwestern State Demons&lt;/a&gt; hit a three-point shot with two seconds to draw within one point. Following two foul shots, the Demons had an opportunity to tie with another three-point shot but their inbounds pass was tipped and intercepted as time expired. The Islanders earn their first trip to the NCAA tournament with the win.

The Big Ten Conference championship started off a tight affair, but the &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State%20University"&gt;Ohio State Buckeyes&lt;/a&gt;, top-ranked in the country at game time, pulled away from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin Badgers&lt;/a&gt; in a 66-49 final. It was believed that the winner of this game would receive a top seed in the national tournament.

The final conference championship to be decided was the Big 12 Championship. The &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Texas"&gt;Texas Longhorns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Kansas"&gt;Kansas Jayhawks&lt;/a&gt; played an extremely tight game, with multiple ties and lead changes during the course of the game. Mario Chalmers of Kansas hit a three-pointer with 13.8 seconds left to tie it, with the Jayhawks having battled back from a deficit late in the half. Kevin Durant's shot with two seconds left hit the back rim and bounced away, sending the game into overtime. In the overtime, Texas missed their first three free throws but was able to maintain pace through the first part of the extra period. Shooting struggles and fatigue doomed Texas in the overtime, however, and Kansas was able to hang on for the win and the Big 12 Conference tournament championship by a final score of 88-84. Two key shot blocks from the Kansas defense spurred the victory for the Jayhawks.

On March 2, 2007, &lt;a href="w%3AKraft%20Foods"&gt;Kraft Canada Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (Kraft) issued an alert to news media requesting the recall of a brand of cookies manufactured in their Toronto, Ontario plant.

The news release indicates that certain packages of Christie Chewy Chunks Ahoy! cookies may have been tampered with. Kraft had received 2 complaints from consumers that small, sharp metal objects had been found in the cookies.

The product had been distributed to stores in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, and to a Wal-Mart in &lt;a href="w%3ALLabrador%20City%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt; in the province of &lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundland"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;. Kraft indicated that no other Christie products are affected by the recall.

Kraft is undertaking an internal investigation and has referred the case to police, although they suggest that there have been no serious injuries associated with consumption of the product.

According to spokesperson Lynne Galia, Kraft is treating the case as suspected tampering, as "the material found in the cookies is not found in our plant."

The police investigation is in early stages, with accidental contamination or intentional tampering both being given consideration.

The product recall affects the following packages of ♡❤Christie Chewy Chunks Ahoy!♡❤:

For more information, consumers and industry are encouraged to call 1-800-310-3704

Tottenham Hotspur travelled to Upton Park earlier today to face West Ham United, currently the bottom team in the table. West Ham were 10 points adrift of relegation safety at kickoff, and desperately needed points to secure a stay in the Premiership for next season. Tottenham on the other hand have been enjoying a good run of play as of late, and had a chance to jump above Portsmouth into 8th position in the Premiership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
West Ham started strongly in the match, desperately trying to bring the game to Tottenham with the support of their home fans urging them on. West Ham's first effort came in the second minute, but keeper Paul Robinson was able to beat away the shot of Mark Noble. Things took a downturn for the Hammers several minutes later, when Matthew Upson was forced off the pitch after aggravating a calf injury, and was replaced by Calum Davenport. Dimitar Berbatov then had two great chances for Tottenham, as he went one on one with keeper Robert Green, but Green was able to stop the Bulgarians attempts both times. West Ham continued to press, and were rewarded with a goal on 16 minutes. Paul Konchesky's pass was chested down by Argentinian Carlos Tevez, and Mark Noble half-volleyed the ball into the back of the net. Tottenham nearly got an equilizer only minutes later after a defensive error by West Ham, but Berbatov's shot was again saved by Green. More chances came for both sides in the forms of Defoe for Tottenham and Harewood for West Ham, but the next goal would come through the young Carlos Tevez. Michael Dawson fouled the Argintinian on the outside of the 18 yard box, and Tevez curved the ensuing free kick in under the crossbar. The goal was Teves' first since joining West Ham at the beginning of the season. He was booked for his goal celebration as he ripped off his shirt and ran into a group of cheering fans.&lt;br&gt;
Tottenham made a change to start the second half, substituting Tom Huddlestone for Hossam Ghaly, and Huddlestones prescence helped Tottenham to control the midfield. They used their control to its potential, and Aaron Lennon was able to earn a penalty after being brought down by Lee Bowyer in the area. Jermain Defoe stepped up and slotted the ball past Green to cut the Hammers lead in half. Spurs continued to press for an equilizer, and got it in the 63 minute as Lennon flicked a Berbatov cross into the path of Tainio, and the Finnish international volleyed the ball past Green. The tying goal seemed to wake West Ham up, and Bobby Zamora and Keppa Blanco were added to the mix to try and save the 3 points for the home side. West Ham got their goal, and Tevez was involved again as his cross was headed home by substitute Zamora. As 90 minutes approached, Tottenham won a free kick on the edge of the box, and Dimitar Berbatov stepped up to the plate. Several of Berbatov's attempts had been blocked by keeper Green already, but he would not be denied this time as he curled the ball into the top left corner, leaving the goalie helpless. Tevez again threatened Tottenhams goal, but his shot flew just wide. West Ham would be left to rue their missed chances when Defoe's shot was parried by Green, but the ball was tapped in by Canadian Paul Stalteri, giving the visitors their first lead of the game, and soon earning them all 3 points. The goal came just over 5 minutes into stoppage time, and there was no chance left for West Ham to equilize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
West Ham will continue their battle to stay in the Premiership in two weeks time against Blackburn, while Tottenham is due for an UEFA cup battle against Braga.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%2C%20Taiwan"&gt;Taipei, Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; City &lt;a href="w%3ALantern%20Festival"&gt;Lantern Festival&lt;/a&gt; was off to a bright start on Saturday Night as hundreds of thousands of people crowded onto the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial near downtown Taipei to witness city mayor Hau Lung-bin and other dignitaries ceremoniously flip the switch to light hundreds of colorful lantern scenes in and around the 240,000 square meter memorial park.

The centerpiece of this rock concert-like performance is a 15 meter high rotating pig equipped with a fog machine, laser light show and theme music.

The theme of this years lantern festival revolves around the 12 year Chinese zodiac cycles year of the pig. Its round shape symbolizes wealth and good fortune and is believed to bring good luck.

Started in 1990, the Taipei lantern festival continues a 2000 year old tradition of light related festivals marking the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations. This particular event grows in popularity every year. Last Year over 4 million visitors attended the event and this year the city expects about 6 million visitors according to the event website.

Colorful lantern scenes not only fill the central square but also the surrounding 2 km circumference of the memorial. Each section has a theme. One side of the memorial is scenes made by student groups while other areas represent the counties of Taiwan. There is even a section of lanterns sponsored by foreign countries. The Malaysia Tourism board was quite prominent at the main entrance to the grounds. 

As with all new year celebrations in Taiwan, the lantern festival is crowded. People flock to see the lantern scenes and enjoy the festival atmosphere as they carry lanterns, given away by the city and bought from street vendors at the event. The many light toys such a swords, devil ears, and lanterns turn the milling crowd into a unique light show that can be observed by climbing the steps of the 70 meter memorial hall on the grounds.

Local public transportation hubs are often swamped by the event. The station staff at Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall Station do an excellent job of crowd control but lines for the subway can still be hours long and very exhausting. A sudden rain storm on Sunday night (March 4)caused a mass exodus of people to head for the station prompting lines that backed up into the street. The commuting crowds can be avoided however by walking from NTU Hospital Station or Shandao Station. Both of these stops are only about a 20 minute walk from the event and have no crowds at all. 

If you really want to avoid the crowds, definitely avoid the weekends. Wait until the fourth or fifth day of the festival when the crowds will have dwindled. I visited the festival on Saturday night, the opening night, and there was a sea of people in the square. I went back the next Tuesday night and there was almost no one there, just a few stray photographers taking advantage of the unimpeded views of the lanterns. The festival runs through March 11 this year.

The prime minister (PM) of &lt;a href="Fiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJosaia%20Voreqe%20Bainimarama"&gt;Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama&lt;/a&gt; has urged Fijians living in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; to protest the involvement of the New Zealand government, and PM of New Zealand, &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;, in Fiji's affairs.

The acting PM, and former coup-leader, Mr Bainimarama told the Indian-language radio station, Radio Tarana that Helen Clark is affecting and damaging the way he can run his country, because she does not support him. He also says that New Zealand will damage the 2010 Fijian elections, which Mr Bainimarama intends to hold.

Mr Bainimarama has said that he had wanted to remove the policies in Fiji that are based on races, but New Zealand wasn't prepared to help him. He says that New Zealand and Helen Clark is supporting a race biased government and calls on Fijians to tell her that they don't support that.

Mr Bainimarama took control of Fiji when he initiated Fiji's fourth coup in 20-years on December 6, 2006, saying that the government was corrupt. Mr Bainimarama had opposed the coup in 2000, saying the government was too soft on those involved.

In response to the 2006 coup, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; initiated various sanctions.

According to a report from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sun"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; members have issued a prominent threat on the Internet that Britain's &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Henry%20of%20Wales"&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/a&gt; will be killed or kidnapped when he is sent out to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; for his first tour of duty in the British Army in May this year.

An Islamic website has messages which have been posted on the site since the 22 year old Prince's deployment to the gulf state was revealed at the start of February. The messages included: "Prince Harry will be sent to Iraq to be killed by Muslims." and "May Allah give him what he deserves — like his fellow crusaders." Another person commented: "He must be wishing for his death."
Furthermore, The ♡❤Sun♡❤ reports that Harry and his troop of 12 soldiers will be trained this week to face hostage situations. He also has a group of SAS (Special Air Service) soldiers who will protect him.

The Prince has requested his regiment, the &lt;a href="w%3ABlues%20and%20Royals"&gt;Blues and Royals&lt;/a&gt;, to treat him like any other soldier, whether royalty or not. Commenting on the threat, an official of the Blues and Royals said: "Officially Harry is being treated just like any other soldier but in reality everyone knows how desperate the insurgents out there will be to get their hands on him."

A former contractor of &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;, who was convicted more than a decade ago for bypassing the security systems of the semiconductor company in 1993, is now free from charge. 

The hacker used a special program, named "Crack", that was able to detect the passwords of his former colleagues. He worked at Intel Supercomputer Systems Division and afterwards he suspiciously left the company. 

When &lt;a href="w%3ARandal%20L.%20Schwartz"&gt;Randal L. Schwartz&lt;/a&gt; was accused, the court sentenced him to pay Intel a restitution, estimated at &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;68,000. Then the &lt;a href="w%3Ahacker"&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt; was imposed to spend five years of probation and 480 hours of community service. In addition, the court sentenced Schwartz to 90 days of deferred jail time. All in all, the legal bills of the former Intel contractor exceeded US$170,000.

Randal Schwartz told the court that the reason he used "Crack" is that he wanted to show the disadvantages of Intel's security system, especially when he left the company. He also mentioned about reestablishment of his respect, which, according to Schwartz, was lost. 

After more than a decade, he appealed to a Democratic governor. In February 2007 a court in &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; expunged his conviction. Schwartz stated that it will take some time for him to absorb the result. The 13-year journey still keeps him in shock.

Retired Wikipedian Ryan Jordan, known originally by his pseudonym &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AEssjay"&gt;"Essjay"&lt;/a&gt;, put himself up to more scrutiny by suggesting that unethical journalistic practices were used during an interview by &lt;a href="w%3AStacy%20Schiff"&gt;Stacy Schiff&lt;/a&gt; for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20Yorker"&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ magazine.

Essjay made the statement on the user's Wikipedia page that: 
Jordan suggested that Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Schiff, to whom he said that he was a tenured university professor, offered to compensate him for an interview she conducted as research for the magazine article titled "♡❤KNOW IT ALL♡❤".

The article, published in the magazine's July issue last year, was later appended by the editors of the magazine with the disclaimer that, "He was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page. At the time of publication, neither we nor Wikipedia knew Essjay’s real name."

What is known now, following the quitting of Essjay at Wikipedia, and the resignation at Wikia, is that the individual misrepresented himself.

Blogger and prominent contributor to Wikimedia Foundation projects Andrew Lih contacted Schiff for comment. Her reply was "on the record, succinct and emphatic":

Wikipedia Signpost writer Michael Snow received a similar response from the Deputy Editor of ♡❤The New Yorker♡❤, Pam McCarthy, stating:

&lt;a href="w%3AStacy%20Schiff"&gt;Schiff&lt;/a&gt; was referred by the Wikimedia Foundation for an interview for the article to Wikipedia administrator Essjay, a member of Wikipedia's arbitration committee and generally trusted member of the community.

Lih comments "He has now accused Schiff of unethical conduct, entering into the dangerous domain of defamation and libel and directly affecting the reputation of a working journalist. Is he ready to stand up and be accountable for his story, or will he leave a reckless statement sitting on the Talk page?... Who do we believe — a respected reporter or proven prevaricator Essjay/Ryan Jordan?"

<h3>Essjay tried to build sympathy?</h3>

Lih, himself an assistant professor of journalism, suggests Jordan may have tried to "portray himself as a sympathetic character", not realising that he was suggesting a journalistic wrongdoing.

Before issuing a correction, Schiff's article about Wikipedia had stated:

Jordan had fabricated a persona which he described on his user page on Wikipedia, presenting himself as a tenured professor at a private US university. After the news broke, EssJay said that the false details were intended to avoid &lt;a href="w%3Acyberstalking"&gt;cyberstalking&lt;/a&gt;. However, Jordan had used these fictitious credentials to win content debates on Wikipedia. Polls have found that 55% of web users have used fake identities.

When Wikimedia's Jimmy Wales called for Jordan's resignation from any position of power, such as his Arbitration Committee placement or administrative privileges, the user decided instead to remove himself from the project completely.

He is no longer an employee of Wikia, Inc., the community wiki company at which he revealed his true identity; corporation co-founder Angela Beesley has told Wikinews that Jordan resigned.

An aerial collision near &lt;a href="w%3AZell%20am%20See"&gt;Zell am See&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; has killed 8 people, 5 Swiss citizens, 1 French, 1 German and 1 Austrian.

The collision occurred Monday afternoon between a &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Puma"&gt;Super Puma&lt;/a&gt; helicopter belonging to Helog S.A, based in &lt;a href="w%3AK%C3%BCssnacht"&gt;Küssnacht&lt;/a&gt; (Switzerland), and a private &lt;a href="w%3ADiamond%20DA20"&gt;Diamond DA20&lt;/a&gt; "Katana" light aircraft which had taken off from the aerodrome at Zell am See.

All 7 of the passengers and crew from the helicopter were pronounced dead at the scene, as was the pilot of the light aircraft, which had no passengers on board.

The debris from the accident spread over a 20 metre radius and bystanders near to the incident reported seeing a "huge ball of fire in the sky".

The reason for the accident is presently unclear as both craft have been confirmed as passing pre-flight testing at their respective take-off locations. Furthermore, Zell am See tower radioed the helicopter that a plane was taking off, to which the helicopter replied positively. This conversation should have been heard over radio by the pilot of the plane.

The site of the accident is now being guarded by police, pending the arrival of an investigation team and a delegate of the state attorney.

&lt;a href="w%3AResearch%20In%20Motion%20Ltd."&gt;Research In Motion Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; (RIM) co-chief executive and chairman, &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Balsillie"&gt;Jim Balsillie&lt;/a&gt;, has resigned voluntarily as chairman after an internal review revealed irregularities with how the company accounted for stock options.

The review was carried out over the past 7 months and indicates that, Canadian &lt;a href="w%3ABlackBerry"&gt;BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt; maker, RIM, will have to restate earnings for all of 2004, 2005, and 2006, and for the first quarter of 2007. The company will have to lower previously reported earnings by approximately US$250 million.

The review committee indicated that RIM "failed to maintain adequate internal and accounting controls with respect to the issuance of options in compliance with the Company’s stock option plan, both in terms of how options were granted and documented, and the measurement date used to account for certain option grants". 

Although the review finds that there was no deliberate misconduct, both Balsillie and co-chief executive, Michael Lazaridis, have agreed to pay, voluntarily, up to $5 million each to compensate the company for the costs of the review and restatement.

All RIM directors and C-level officers will have to pay back any monies received incorrectly as a result of the option irregularities.

Balsillie will retain his positions as co-chief executive and director. In a press release, the company stated that "consistent with current best practices in corporate governance, the roles of chairman and CEO are being separated". Current RIM chief financial officer, Dennis Kavelman, will move to the position of chief operating officer.

RIM is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of wireless solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market and is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange.

<h1>Lineup coming together for Manchester United charity match</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Lineup%20coming%20together%20for%20Manchester%20United%20charity%20match&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Manchester United will be taking on eleven of the top players in Europe in a celebration match next Tuesday at Old Trafford, and the lineup for the European XI is coming together nicely. The game is a UEFA-Manchester United collaboration created to commemorate not only the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, but also the 50th anniversary of Manchester United entering into European club competitions. Funds raised in the match will go to support the Manchester United Foundation, which works with local charities as well as UNICEF to aid children in need. Italian Marcello Lippi will be in charge of coaching the European XI side, and his assistant will be Andy Roxburgh. Confirmed players have slowly been filing into the team, but with current Manchester United on-loan striker Henrik Larsson confirmed, the XI is now complete.

<h2>Players</h2>

♡❤♡Henrik Larsson♡❤♡: &lt;br&gt;Current Club: Manchester United (loan)&lt;br&gt;Age: 35&lt;br&gt;Currently on loan to Manchester United from Helsingborg, Larsson has been in sharp form as of late. This charity match will act as a farewell for the Swede, as he is due back in Sweeden to play for his home club after his loan contract expires on March the 12th.
♡❤♡David Beckham♡❤♡: &lt;br&gt;Current Club: Real Madrid&lt;br&gt;Age: 31&lt;br&gt;The former Manchester star will be returning to Old Trafford to play against his former club. Beckham has been playing strong for Real Madrid in recent weeks. An injury will keep him out of Real's next game in the Champions League, but if all goes well he will be back to match fitness for the March 13th charity match.&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡Update♡❤♡: Beckham has been removed from the squad due to his knee injury. No replacement has yet been announced.&lt;br&gt;♡❤♡Update♡❤♡: It is confirmed that Beckham will not be participating in the March 13th charity match, but Beckham will still travel to Old Trafford and be announced onto the pitch in order to say goodbye to the fans.
♡❤♡Ronaldinho♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Barcelona&lt;br&gt;Age: 26&lt;br&gt; Winner of both European and World player of the year awards, Ronaldinho is arguably one of the best players in the world currently. After nearly signing with United, the Brazilian has won 2 La Liga titles and the Champions League trophy with Spanish giants Barcelona.
♡❤♡Carles Puyol♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Barcelona&lt;br&gt;Age: 28&lt;br&gt; Another player from Barcelona, Puyol is one of the best central defenders in Spain, he was the first of his position named to Lippi's squad. His shaggy hair makes him easy to pick out on the football pitch, but his dominance from the back lures much more attention.
♡❤♡Gianluca Zambrotta♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Barcelona&lt;br&gt;Age: 30&lt;br&gt; A member of the Italian World Cup winning team, Zambrotta is equally comfortable on either defensive wing, or in the midfield. He is also a Barcelona player, and joined the Spanish team after winning two Italian domestic championships with Juventus. Zambrotta has history with coach Lippi, as he played on his Italian International side while Lippi was in command.
♡❤♡Lilian Thuram♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Barcelona&lt;br&gt;Age: 35&lt;br&gt; Thuram is most capped player on the French International team, and he was with the French side for their European and World Cup victories in 1998 and 2000. Thuram has also won domestic league trophies in 3 countries with Monaco, Parma, Juventus, and Barcelona, his current club.
♡❤♡Steven Gerrard♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Liverpool&lt;br&gt;Age: 26&lt;br&gt;Though Gerrard plays for one of Manchester United's biggest rivals, Liverpool, he is an amazing football talent in the midfield. Gerrard won the 2006 PFA Player of the Year award, and has won several other medals including the European Cup, 2 FA cups, two league cups, a UEFA cup, and a Super Cup.
♡❤♡Jamie Carragher♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Liverpool&lt;br&gt;Age: 29&lt;br&gt; Another Liverpool player, Carragher is well known for his grit and determination in defence, and is sure to cause the United forwards some problems, like he did this past Sunday in a match between the two.
♡❤♡Juninho♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Lyon&lt;br&gt; Age: 32&lt;br&gt; The second Brazilian player on the team, Juninho is well known for his free-kick prowess, and is regarded as one of the best in the world for that purpose. Juninho has played at Lyon in France for all 5 of their consecutive league titles.
♡❤♡Eric Abidal♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Lyon&lt;br&gt;Age: 27&lt;br&gt; The French International plays alongside Juninho at Lyon after moving there from Lille in 2004. He has won 2 league titles with the French giants, as well as a Champions Trophy, France's equivalent to the FA Cup.
♡❤♡Gregory Coupet♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Lyon&lt;br&gt;Age: 34&lt;br&gt; Coupet is the keeper named to the European XI side, and plays alongside Juninho and Abidal at Lyon. He, like Juninho, has been with the club for all 5 of their consecutive league championships.

Two earthquakes, measuring 6.3 and 6.0 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20scale"&gt;Richter scale&lt;/a&gt; struck the &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; within the space of two hours, killing at-least 70 people. The death toll may rise as a large number of buildings were destroyed and the search for survivors continues.

No &lt;a href="w%3ATsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; warning was issued, although some people in coastal areas moved inland. However, as the quake was under land there was no likelihood of a tsunami.

The tremors were felt in &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; as well.

<h1>Broken stormwater drain led to Guatemala sinkhole</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Broken%20stormwater%20drain%20led%20to%20Guatemala%20sinkhole&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A rupture in the underground stormwater drain system opened a huge &lt;a href="w%3Asinkhole"&gt;sinkhole&lt;/a&gt; on February 23, killing three people and bringing down twelve houses in Guatemala City.

Teenagers Irma and David Soyos and their father, 53-year old Domingo Soyos were killed when their house collapsed into the sinkhole. Nearly a thousand people were evacuated from the San Antonio neighborhood after the collapse. 

Wikinews interviewed Eric Haddox, a civil engineer who has visited the site of the sinkhole and spoken to the engineers working on fixing the drain. Mr. Haddox, who specialises in the building of earthworks, roads, water supply and sewage systems, and is working as a missionary in Guatemala, visited the site following the collapse to help in the recovery effort.

Mr. Haddox told us that the size of the hole is much smaller than the 330 feet depth originally reported and that the erosion causing the collapse is believed to have happened over a long time, and not just during the recent rains as initially suspected. 
There are also concerns that a four-story building less than a metre from the edge of the hole may collapse as the earth under the building continues to be eroded. 

<h3>Trouble brewing over years</h3>
Before the collapse, a junction box linked two collector pipes to a 3.5m main pipe leading to a nearby canyon in a system believed to be 20 to 50 years old. The surrounding earth had been filled in artificially to level the ground, but the fill was not well compacted before being built upon. Such leveling of the ground is widespread in Guatemala city. 

It is thought that, at some point in the last 20 years, either one of the collector pipes ruptured or was detached from the junction box, possibly because of seismic activity. Water gushing out of the break following rainstorms gradually eroded the loosely compacted soil, creating an expanding cavern around the junction box. On February 23, the roof of this cavern collapsed, creating the sinkhole, 20m wide at the top and tapering out towards the bottom, which is about 60m (204 feet) deep, not 330 feet as originally reported. 

"Things like this don't happen often and there are many interesting engineering lessons to be learned with them", Mr. Haddox said.

The sinkhole has continued to expand even after the collapse, since the collector pipes continue to carry water, which cascades 15m down the sinkhole to the main pipe, further eroding the sides of the sinkhole. The hole was about 25m wide at the top and 40m wide at the bottom a week ago. 
A bypass pipe is being laid to divert the water away from the junction to arrest further erosion. The sinkhole will then have to be drained before repair work can begin. 

Authorities are also concerned that similar breakages and undermining may be happening at other locations, Mr. Haddox said. Muddy water has been seen coming out of the main collector pipes, but it is not certain whether this is due to ruptures elsewhere or simply mud from the surface that has been washed into the drainage system.

The six suspects, supporters of the opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKizza%20Besigye"&gt;Kizza Besigye&lt;/a&gt;, are alleged to be members of the &lt;a href="w%3APeoples%20Redemption%20Army"&gt;Peoples Redemption Army&lt;/a&gt; and are charged with treason for allegedly plotting a coup. Twelve men have been detained in connection to these charges since November 2005.

Scores of armed police were deployed outside the High Court while the bail application was being heard last week, and the suspects were detained by armed military police. A defence lawyer was reportedly assaulted by prison guards.
Defending the arrests, President &lt;a href="w%3AYoweri%20Museveni"&gt;Yoweri Museveni&lt;/a&gt; said that the suspects had been re-arrested on fresh murder charges and that the arrests did not amount to disobeying the court. He also said that granting bail to those charged with "treason and terrorism" amounts to sending them beyond the reach of law.

Last week's arrests seriously undermines the rule of law in Uganda, said the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Commission%20of%20Jurists"&gt;International Commission of Jurists&lt;/a&gt;, and called on the Ugandan government to stop "intimidating" lawyers and judges taking part in the trial. 

A similar incident occurred in 2005, with military personnel detaining men granted bail in the same case. 

President Museveni said that he had met with the Chief Justice to discuss the matter and that a "legal and transparent" method of re-arresting suspects will be formulated.

Justice James Ogoola, a senior judge told the BBC that the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary should be brought "back to form" in the country. 

Opposition groups who demonstrated on Monday to show support to the judges were dispersed by police using tear gas. Ugandan newspaper, ♡❤The Monitor♡❤ reported that a baby had died during the tear-gassing. 

The state-owned newspaper ♡❤New Vision♡❤ reported that undertrials set for court appearances were sent back to prisons, without any hearings taking place, at various courts in Kampala, Lira, Erute, Mbale and Mityana.

&lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has begun an attack against &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; over the issue of copyright infringements. The officials from the &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; giant state that the number one search engine takes a cavalier approach to what concerns copyright protection. The associate general counsel of &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Thomas Rubin, prepared a remark that he delivered to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociation%20of%20American%20Publishers"&gt;Association of American Publishers&lt;/a&gt;. He argued that &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s idea to create a book search engine might come at publishers' expense. 

Mr. Rubin criticized those companies that use the works of various publishers and not their own, stating that such companies make billions on the back of other people's content. He said that in distinction from Microsoft, Google feels comfortable making a certain content searchable online and afterwards asking permission from the author. According to the associate general counsel of Microsoft, Google does not always ask permission and uses the copyright work until its author tells the company to stop.

In response to the accusations from Microsoft, the senior vice president for corporate development of Google said that Google performs legal actions. Whenever the company wanted to make certain content available online it always asked for permission. In such a way Google worked with several thousands publishing partners and recently made a partnership with &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AN.B.A."&gt;N.B.A.&lt;/a&gt; to display videos on &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ARichemont"&gt;Richemont&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APolo%20Ralph%20Lauren"&gt;Polo Ralph Lauren&lt;/a&gt; decided to join their skills and rich experience in order to form a joint venture, the name of which is Polo Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. The representatives of the global &lt;a href="w%3Aluxury"&gt;luxury&lt;/a&gt; business decided to unite their efforts in order to develop luxury timepieces and fine &lt;a href="w%3Ajewelry"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; items. 

After the new products are manufactured, they will be distributed through Ralph Lauren boutiques and independent retailers of jewelery items and luxury &lt;a href="w%3Awatch"&gt;timepieces&lt;/a&gt;. The first jointly developed products are to appear in the fall of the following year.

Richemont and Polo Ralph Lauren will equally share 50 percent of the new joint venture. The partners hope for long-term cooperation. The union will be a completely new experience for both Richemont, which has never cooperated with a luxury fashion designer before, and Polo Ralph Lauren, which, until the present day, has not maintained any links with the precious jewelry and luxury watch businesses. 

Ralph Lauren, holding the post of Polo Ralph Lauren's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , believes that the company's experience in the area of designing and marketing luxury lifestyle products will blend with Richemont’s experience on a global scale.

Johann Rupert, owning the position of Richemont's Executive Chairman counts on Ralph Lauren's reputation and image based upon distinctive taste, style and attention to detail. He hopes that the newly formed joint venture will benefit from these factors, as well Richemont’s expertise in the area of jewelry and watches.

The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; future in &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; is skating on thin ice after owners &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Burke"&gt;Ron Burke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Lemieux"&gt;Mario Lemieux&lt;/a&gt; sent a letter Wednesday addressed to &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; Governer &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Rendell"&gt;Ed Rendell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlleghney%20County"&gt;Alleghney County&lt;/a&gt; Executive Officer &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Onorato"&gt;Dan Onorato&lt;/a&gt;, and Pittsburgh Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20Ravenstahl"&gt;Luke Ravenstahl&lt;/a&gt;, stating that the organization was prepared to "aggressively explore relocation", after reaching what the organization called an "impasse." This threat came just three days after Rendell expressed his belief that a new arena deal was close. 

Lemieux and Burke visited &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City"&gt;Kansas City&lt;/a&gt; on January 4, 2007 to explore possibly moving the team if a new arena deal in Pittsburgh could not be reached. The offer from Kansas City includes free rent of the $276 million &lt;a href="w%3ASprint%20Center"&gt;Sprint Center&lt;/a&gt;, which is still under construction. The Penguins would be asked to pay $2.86 million per year to rent a proposed arena in Pittsburgh, better than the orignial offer of $4 million a year, including $1.16 million each year in naming rights, along with an upfront contribution of $8.5 million.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; jury has found &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Libby"&gt;Lewis 'Scooter' Libby&lt;/a&gt; guilty of four counts of obstructing justice, lying and perjury during the investigation into the disclosure of former CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity. Libby faces up to 30 years in prison with the conviction announced at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia"&gt;E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday. Sentencing for the guilty verdicts are expected to be handed down on June 5. The defense lawyer for Libby says he will ask for a new trial or an appeal.

Once the chief of staff to &lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, Libby resigned in October 2005 after charges were brought against him by &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href="w%3APlame%20affair"&gt;Plame affair&lt;/a&gt;. The conviction is vindication for the role played by special prosecutor Fitzgerald, who some believed went too far by bringing charges against Libby when no indictments were made stemming from the original offense investigated. 

"It’s sad that we had a situation where a high-level official person who worked in the office of the vice president obstructed justice and lied under oath. We wish that it had not happened, but it did." said Fitzgerald according to ♡❤MSNBC♡❤. What effect the verdict will have on the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; and the credibility of the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration's run-up to the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;war in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; is unclear.

The conviction came after what Fitzgerald originally alleged, by way of a &lt;a href="w%3ABaseball"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; analogy, was the equivalent of Libby "throwing sand in the face of an umpire."

Spanish giants Barcelona bowed out of the Champions League earlier today, even after defeating Liverpool 1-0 at Anfield. Barcelona was up against the wall from the get-go after losing 2-1 in the first leg of the series. Due to the away goals rule (in the event of a tie after both games, the side to score more away goals advances), Barcelona required at at least two goals to advance. Liverpool have been strong at home this season, losing only one domestic league match this season at Anfield to rivals Manchester United. Liverpool featured one of their recent January signings in the match by the way of Alvaro Arbeloa, while Barcelona played their usual lineup including Ronaldinho and Deco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though Barca was the desperate team in the match, Liverpool were the more dominant side after the kickoff, as they used the support of their home crowd to boost them. After only 5 minutes, Steve Finnan crossed in a well placed ball to Bellamy, but the Welshman wasn't able to head the ball into the open net. Riise, who scored the winning goal in the first leg, continued to threaten Barcelona with two of his trademark long-range shots. The first flew just wide, and the second was even closer as it hit off the crossbar. Another attack by Liverpool made Barcelona look shaky as Victor Valdes was force into a double save, first off Bellamy, then off Dirk Kuyt. He could get nowhere near a diving header by Riise on the same play, but defender Puyol was able to clear the ball off the line to keep Barcelonas hopes alive. Liverpool would hit the bar again several minutes later, after a poor clearing attempt by Valdes was handed straight to Sissoko, and he was unfortunate to see his first time shot bang off the bar and go safely over the net. In the whole of the first half, Barcelona were not able to stretch Liverpools keeper Jose Reina, as the Reds defence snuffed out all of Barca's offensive talent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The second half started much as the first did, with Liverpool having a scoring chance within the minute. Captain Steven Gerrard made a run down the right side and crossed the ball into Kuyt, but the Dutchman missed the ball, and Bellamy wasn't expecting the ball to come to him as it flew safely through the area. Jose Reina was finally forced into a save on 50 minutes, but Ronaldinho's long range shot was easy pickings for the Spaniard. Ronaldinho would have another great chance minutes later as he made a quick run, exchange passes with Deco, and twisted past Jamie Carragher, only to see his side footed shot slam off the post. Barcelona continued to push, and a good save by Reina was required to keep youngster Lionel Messi from scoring. Barcelona's coach Frank Rikjarrd decided it was time for some changes and sent Giuly and Gudjohnsen into the mix. Gudjohnsen was used to playing against Liverpool after his years at Chelsea, and seemed to use it to his advantage as he received a pass from Xavi and slotted the ball home to give Barcelona sight of the next round. Ronaldinho then forced a save out of Reina, and Barcelona appeared to have regained their passing game, which caused the home fans to worry. Liverpool still played strongly, and Steven Gerrard was the main point of their inspiration winning a free kick, which was wasted, and then seeing a left footed effort palmed away by Victor Valdes. Liverpool had a chance to equalise in the final minutes, but were not able to convert. The one goal would not be enough for Barcelona however, as Liverpool advances to the next round of the Champions League.

&lt;a href="Chelsea%20FC"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; survived a &lt;a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; scare today after coming back from 1-0 down to defeat &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href="FC%20Porto"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29"&gt;Stamford Bridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. The first leg of the match ended 1-1, giving Chelsea the advantage thanks to the away goals rule, and Porto needed a win or a draw of 2 all or higher to advance to the next round. Porto fielded a defensive side, leaving Portuguese international striker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHelder%20Postiga"&gt;Helder Postiga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; out of the starting lineup, while Chelsea featured &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndriy%20Shevchenko"&gt;Andriy Shevchenko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADidier%20Drogba"&gt;Didier Drogba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on attack.

Shevchenko almost opened the scoring early in the game, having a poweful shot from 20 yard fly just over the bar and out of play. The early attack did little to inspire Chelsea though, as they looked sluggish for the first parts of the game. Porto took advantage of Chelsea's poor start, and scored in the 15th minute on a counter attack. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALisandro%20L%C3%B3pez"&gt;Lopez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; quickly passed the ball up to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALucho%20Gonz%C3%A1lez"&gt;Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the center of the pitch, who split the defence with a well aimed ball that released &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Quaresma"&gt;Quaresma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on a break away. The Portuguese player made no mistake about his shot, and slid it neatly past &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APetr%20%C4%8Cech"&gt;Petr Cech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to give the visiting team the lead. Chelsea vainly attempted to draw level, but none of their first half chances were able to find the target to trouble keeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHelton%20Arruda"&gt;da Helton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Chelsea had a claim for a penalty nearing 35 minutes when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArjen%20Robben"&gt;Arjen Robben&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after he was apparently tripped up by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Raul Moreiles&lt;/span&gt; , but the Dutch midfielded was awarded a yellow card instead for his theatrical dive. Chelsea's defence supplied the most attack for the English Champions, as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAshley%20Cole"&gt;Ashley Cole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; made a fine cross into the box which was poorly cleared by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Costa%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201981%29"&gt;Ricardo Costa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the Ball broke for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ballack"&gt;Michael Ballack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Costa was quick to justify his mistake and he poked the ball away from Ballack before he could get a shot away. The biggest worry for Porto came when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJorge%20Fucile"&gt;Jorge Fucile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was struck in the face by the trailing arm off a teammate, and left the field with blood streaming from his nose.

The second half saw Fucile retake the pitch, his injury obviously not too serious. Chelsea made a change to start the second half, adding &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Obi%20Mikel"&gt;John Obi Mikel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in place of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClaude%20Mak%C3%A9l%C3%A9l%C3%A9"&gt;Claude Makelele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It took Chelsea only 3 minutes after the restart to get back into the match, and the goal came through Arjen Robben. The Dutchman cleaved a shot from 25 yards, and even though it lack power, de Helton was not able to get a grip on it and the ball slipped past him into the net. The goal tied not only the game, but also the series, and the scoreline would force extra time. Chelsea wouldn't allow the game to get that far though, and Ashley Cole, Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack all contributed to the winning goal. A cross by Cole was headed down by Shevy, and neatly volleyed into the net by the German Ballack. Porto pressed, but the Chelsea defence easily coped, and Chelsea advanded to next round of the Champions League.

A sell-out crowed showed up at the Estadio Mestalla in Spain to watch Valencia take on Inter Milan in the second leg of the Champions League round of sixteen. The first match ended 1-1 at the San Siro in Italy, and Inter needed a win or a draw of 2-2 or higher to advance.

The first half presented little in the way of goal chances for either team, with the biggest action in the form of a penalty appeal from Inter's Hernan Crespo. Crespo claimed to have been taken down by Robert Ayala, but referee Wolfgang Stark waved away the appeals. The only real attacks came in the form of long range shots, with Ibrahimovic taking one for Inter, and Sanchez attempting a blast for Valencia, but neither produced a goal. Valencias keeper Cañizares then took exception to a foul by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and both players were dealt bookings by the referee. Another penalty was appealed for by Inter, with Crespo again involved. Inter claimed the Argentine's shot was blocked off the arm of Valencia'a Raul Albiol, but again the referee waved play on. Valencia was forced into a change when Baraja was injured and replaced him with Hugo Viana.

The second half showed slightly more in the way of chances, and Valencia in particular upped the pace. Inter coped and had their own chance but a header from Dejan Stankovic was hit into the side netting. Inter again threatened, and could have taken the lead, but Marco Materazzi's header was cleared off the line by Marchena. Inter pushed now, but Valencia looked the more likely to score in the closing minutes with Marchena and Joaquin both coming close. It didn't matter however, as Valencia won the series on away goals.

The game erupted in violence and several players took swings at each other. The display was truly disgraceful after the incidents in Italy, and UEFA is sure to envoke punishment once everything has calmed down.

A full crowd showed up at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon earlier today, only to watch their home side fall to Roma of Italy. The previous leg in the series saw the two teams draw 0-0 which gave Roma a slight advantage from the start, as a draw would allow them to advance. The previous match was extremely undisciplined, and Roma was given eight yellow cards. The Italian side showed a much calmer demeanor this game, earning only two yellows in comparison to Lyon's four.

Lyon produced the first chance of the game as Romas keeper Alexandre Doni was unable to cope with Juninho, but defender Philippe Mexes was able to clear the ball from nearby strikers. Roma had their own chance soon after, as Daniele De Rossi was left open, and he headed the ball home. The goal was disallowed by the referee after he spotted a push by De Rossi on Eric Abidal. Juninho continued to threaten Roma, but his crosses were not able to do any damage to the Rossinari. Lyon fell behind on 22 minutes when Max Tonetto clipped a cross into the middle, and Francesco Totti was in the right place to head the ball past Gregory Coupet. Crosses continued to be the only attack Lyon could muster, and they produced a good chance off a Juninho corner kick. The ball ricoched off several players before Squillaci latch on for a shot, but the ball was sent directly at Doni, and the keeper made the save. Mancini then doubled the visitors lead just before halftime. After some quick stepovers to fool Anthony Reveillere, he struck the ball soundly into the top corner of the net.

After the break, Roma could have killed off the game indefinitely, as Tadei beat Lyon's offside trap, but was unable to regain the composure required to smash the ball home. Doni then produced a few saves for Roma, kicking out Sylvan Wiltord's shot, and then diving to palm away a curling shot by Juninho. Both teams then made vain attempts for a penalty, but both Fred and Perrotta diving, but the referee made the right decisions and awarded only a yellow to Perrotta. Fred was then given a yellow for cruelly smashing Chivu in the face with his arm. Fred was lucky to receive a red for his actions. Roma held on for the win, and the 5 time french champions bowed out of the Champions League.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Senators"&gt;Ottawa Senators&lt;/a&gt; thought that the game was over. Coming into the third period, the Senators led the &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; 4-1, dominating every aspect of the game. After only one goal by &lt;a href="w%3AColby%20Armstrong"&gt;Colby Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt; would blank the Penguins for the next 45 minutes the game. Things spiraled out of control when &lt;a href="w%3AMarc-Andre%20Fleury"&gt;Marc-Andre Fleury&lt;/a&gt; allowed &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Fischer"&gt;Mike Fischer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChristoph%20Schubert"&gt;Christoph Schubert&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Kelly"&gt;Chris Kelly&lt;/a&gt; to score in under 10 minutes, stopping only 4 out of the 7 shots he faced, and was pulled before the end of the first in favor of backup goaltender &lt;a href="w%3AJocelyn%20Thibault"&gt;Jocelyn Thibault&lt;/a&gt;. Thibault's only mistake of the game came at 4:32 in the second period, when the Senators' &lt;a href="w%3ADany%20Heatley"&gt;Dany Heatley&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal to make it a 3 score game. After Heatley's goal, the offensive show the Senators had been putting on suddenly vanished. Backed by Thibault's strong play in net, Penguins rookie &lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20Staal"&gt;Jordan Staal&lt;/a&gt; scored his NHL best 7th shorthanded goal to make it 4-2. Still down by multiple goals, recent acquisition &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Roberts"&gt;Gary Roberts&lt;/a&gt; scored at 11:02, to narrow the margin to 1 goal. 1 minute and 8 seconds later, &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Malone"&gt;Ryan Malone&lt;/a&gt; tied it up for his 14th goal of the season.

After a scoreless overtime period, Pittsburgh's &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Christinsen"&gt;Eric Christinsen&lt;/a&gt; and Ottawa's &lt;a href="w%3ADean%20McAmmond"&gt;Dean McAmmond&lt;/a&gt; both scored to even the shootout at one goal apiece. &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt;, who won Sunday's game in Philadelphia in a shootout, would get the chance to win it for the Penguins. Crosby took the puck and beat Emery on the right side to lift the Penguins to the overtime victory, 5-4.

A &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; passenger plane with 140 people on board has crashed and burst into flames in &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; today. At least 21 people have died after the jet plane overshot the runway at 0700 local time. The Indonesian air company Garuda said earlier that at least 49 persons were killed but have now changed the estimate.

95 people have been confirmed as having survived the crash, including Din Syamsudin, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammadiyah"&gt;Muhammadiyah&lt;/a&gt; Islamic organisation. Survivors are being treated in a local hospital for severe injuries and burns. 

Survivors report that the aircraft was shaking violently prior to the crash. The operations chief at Adisucpito International Airport said that the front wheel of the jet was on fire as it landed, causing the vehicle to skid off the runway and veer into a boundary fence. An engine then broke away from the aircraft and the fuselage burst into flames. 

It took firefighters over two hours to put out the blaze. 

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that there were 9 Australians on board the flight, 4 of whom remain missing. The Australians included officials and journalists heading to Yogyakarta to prepare for the Foreign Minister's arrival there. The journalists known to be onboard include Cynthia Banham of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Morning%20Herald"&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and Channel Seven cameraman Wayne Sukarda. Fairfax media are still attempting to contact a journalist from The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Financial%20Review"&gt;Australian Financial Review&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

In a six-monthly survey by &lt;a href="w%3AStatistics%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Statistics New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, Internet Service Provider Survey, covering the six months prior to September 30, 2006, the amount of non-analog broadband subscribers reached 28.6%, more than the previous survey conducted the previous year, reaching a total of 611,600. There are currently 14.7 broadband subscribers per 100 people in New Zealand, previously nine.
Because of the increase in broadband subscribers, dial-up subscribers have dropped 5.1% since the start of April, 2006. Chief executive of &lt;a href="w%3Aihug"&gt;ihug&lt;/a&gt;, an Internet service provider, Mark Rushworth said that dial-up will always have its place.

Out of all the broadband subscribers, 97.6% have a data cap, which limits the amount of monthly downloading that can occur, usually measured in multiples of gigabytes. 66.6% of all those who do have a data cap, have a limit of up to 5 gigabytes. Which the Internet Society of New Zealand's (InternetNZ) executive director, Keith Davidson, said was disappointing.

The increase in broadband subscribers rose the position of New Zealand from 22 to 19 on the &lt;a href="w%3AOrganisation%20for%20Economic%20Co-operation%20and%20Development"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)&lt;/a&gt; rankings for broadband uptake, dated June, 2006.

InternetNZ, has said that they welcome the survey saying that it is a good improvement, but "...with 60 percent of DSL subscribers having download speeds of less than 256Kbps and 90 percent having upload speeds of less than 256Kbps, we have a long way to go before New Zealanders are able to experience the full potential of broadband." InternetNZ also says that it will be hard for New Zealand to reach the targets set out by the Government's "Digital Strategy".

Mr Davidson said that the main reason for the uptake in broadband is the better plans and pricing for the plans.

In the 18-months leading up to the end of September, 2006, 34% of ISP's had reported that the regulatory environment had been restricting their growth.

A bill on &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20penalty"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt; for repeated child sex offenders was given preliminary approval by &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; House of Representatives. The bill is called &lt;a href="w%3AJessica%27s%20Law"&gt;Jessica's Law&lt;/a&gt;, after a nine-year old &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; girl who was raped and murdered by &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Couey"&gt;John Couey&lt;/a&gt;, who had a prior history of sexual assault on minors. 

Jessica's law is intended to crack down on sexual offenders who continually repeat the crime. With this bill Texas becomes the sixth &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; state to allow death sentence for continual sex offenders. 

The lawmakers voted to set up a new category of crime: repeated sexual assault on a child or children. This category of crime carries 25 years in prison or capital punishment for a repeated sexual abuse of a child. 

At first the Lone Star State's House of Representatives delayed voting on a broader death sentence provision as the lawmakers had worries that it could lead some assaulters to kill their victims. They came back for a vote after talking to district attorneys and victim advocacy groups.

The bill implies a so called &lt;a href="w%3ARomeo%20and%20Juliet"&gt;"Romeo and Juliet“&lt;/a&gt; exception that is intended to avoid prosecuting high school romances. 

Jessica's Law also annulates the limitations for many sex crimes against children, such as indecency with a child and aggravated sexual assault.

<h3>Pakistani airline banned by European Union</h3>

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; has banned the 35 planes in the &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20International%20Airlines"&gt;Pakistan International Airlines&lt;/a&gt; (PIA) 45 aircraft fleet from flying in EU airspace. The reason provided by EU was that these plans do not fulfill the safety requirement for international planes and thus were banned. PIA has redeployed its Boeing 777 jets from US to EU flights to facilitate passengers in Europe. Flights PK 782 and PK 790 are still running on time from Toronto in Canada.

<h1>NFL: Chicago deals Jones to New York</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NFL%3A%20Chicago%20deals%20Jones%20to%20New%20York&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Chicago Bears confirmed Tuesday that they had traded running back Thomas Jones along with one of their second round picks (which was 63rd overall) in the 2007 draft to the New York Jets. In exchange they will receive the Jet's second round pick, which is 37th overall in the upcoming NFL Draft and originally belonged to the Washington Redskins.

Jones rushed for 1,210 yards last season with the Bears and 301 yards in the playoffs including 112 yards on 15 carries in Super Bowl XLI against the Colts. Jones (who will be 29 next season) who originally signed with the Bears for a four year $10 million deal as a free agent prior to 2004. His contract was set to expire after 2007. After his 1,335 yard 2005 season (which included nine touchdowns) Jones expressed his unhappiness with his contract by boycotting the Bears' offseason voluntary workouts. Shortly after the Super Bowl, Jones expressed his desire for a change to Bears general manager Jerry Angelo. At a scouting combine two weeks ago he hinted a trade might be in the works, saying of Jones "He’s expressed some things to me personally. We’ll work on some things. I told him I would listen, and I did." Had Jones stayed with the Bears in 2007 he would have made $2.75 million. The contract with the Jets (arranged by his agent Drew Rosenhaus) is for four years and is worth $20 million with a $12 million guaranteed signing bonus. Having passed his physical for the Jets, Jones is set to receive $13.1 million in the deal's first two years. 

Reflecting on the trade Jones said "It wasn't really a situation where I wanted to be traded. It was a situation where I wanted to have an opportunity to do what I am capable of doing and that's going somewhere and providing leadership like I did in Chicago." He looked forward to playing with the Jets "I had a great time in Chicago, and it was a great experience playing there and making it to the Super Bowl last year with those guys. But I'm very, very excited to be here in New York. It's a great city. We had a chance to play the Jets this year, and the energy and the excitement that we felt up here at the Meadowlands and just being in New York in general was something that was special." Jones also addressed concerns about his age, saying "I'll be 29 years old this year, but I haven't had a lot of carries for a 29-year-old back and I'm a workout warrior. I love working out, I love taking care of my body and I'm very in tune with my body and how I feel. The way I feel right now, I could play for a long, long time."

Last season the Jets ranked 30th in rushing in the NFL, and the trade gives the Jets the starting running back they have lacked since Curtis Martin's knee injury over a year ago (Martin did not play last season and is expected to retire). Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum was happy about the trade, stating “We did a lot of research on Thomas as a person, and we think he's a good fit on and off the field. He's a tough, outdoor, northeast runner, and he provides leadership.” Jones will be sharing running duties with Leon Washington, and Cedric Houston (the Jets released their two other running backs Derrick Blaylock and Kevan Barlow). Last year Houston totaled up 374 rushing yards while Washington led the team with 650. 

Jones spoke of his admiration of his new teammate, saying "Leon Washington is a great back. I watched him last year, and he made some great plays for the Jets, helped them get to the playoffs. I have a lot of respect for him and all the other running backs out there. I'm one of the guys on the team that just wants to provide leadership and make plays and help us win." When asked if he expected to get most of the rushing duty Jones said "The best players play, and that's a great situation to be in. It gives you an opportunity to go out there and compete. Competition makes everybody better." The addition of Jones will give the Jets the option of using Washington and Houston as situational runners, which many believe will be increase their effectiveness. The Jets' general manager Tannenbaum stressed that the coaching staff would determine such questions, but said of Brown "I think he's a complete back, in terms of, he can be on the field for all three downs. How he's used and in what role will ultimately be determined by [Head Coach] Eric [Mangini] and Coach Schottenheimer, but he's a guy who can come in here and add to the productivity of the team."

In place of Jones, the Bears are expected to start Cedric Benson. Benson was the fourth overall pick in the first round of the 2005 draft and is playing for the Bears under a $35 million contract. Benson rushed for 647 yards last season, averaging 4.1 yards per carry. Benson was injured in the Super Bowl after 2 carries for a 1 yard loss. Both Jones and Benson served the Bears as tailbacks, and (baring injury) were substituted for one another every couple of series. Bears general manager Angelo said of Benson "It's his time. It's that simple. It's his time. We feel strongly that he is ready." Angelo dismissed questions surrounding Benson's hardiness (a sprained knee in 2005 kept him out of six games, and last season he suffered a shoulder injury at training camp and a sprained knee in the Super Bowl). Angelo pointed out "He’s been hurt, [but] he never was hurt in college. He had a lot of carries and four 1,000-yard seasons."

While many in Chicago view Jones' relationship with his teammates, and Benson in particular as icy, he had only complimentary things to say when discussing the trade and its effects. He told reporters "Cedric Benson has a lot of talent. He's a talented guy. When you move into the featured role, there are a lot more responsibilities. Coach Tim Spencer is a great running backs coach and I had a great relationship with him, not only as a coach but as a friend. He has so much advice for me to make me a better football player and I'm sure he'll pass that same advice to Cedric."

The Bears have declared their intent to have special-teams standout Adrian Peterson serve as a complementary player to Benson. While Peterson only had 10 carries last season, in 2005 he led the Bears with 76 carries at an average of 5.1 yards. General manager Angelo stated “We feel good about Cedric and Adrian. We still feel we have two quality running backs. That was a part of why we did what we did. We'll continue to look for a running back because we want to carry three running backs on the roster.”

The Bears top draft positions are now 31st overall in the first round, and their new acquisition of 37th overall in the second round. The Jets top draft positions are both in the second round, the 59th overall and the newly acquired 63rd overall.

The Jets also announced they signed 13-year veteran Bobby Hamilton to defensive back and Kenyon Coleman (six year veteran from Dallas) to defensive end. The Bears announced the 49ers’ offensive assistant Pep Hamilton would succeed Wade Wilson (who went to Dallas) as quarterback coach, and Charles London (formerly Duke’s assistant running back coach) would take over Mike Bajakian’s offensive quality-control coach position since he left to become offensive coordinator at Central Michigan.

A court in &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; has issued an order to block all access to &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, after a series of insults between &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; and Turkish users of the site escalated. The largest &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;internet provider&lt;/a&gt; and privatised state company, &lt;a href="w%3AT%C3%BCrk%20Telekom"&gt;Türk Telekom&lt;/a&gt;, has put the order into effect, while some smaller &lt;a href="internet"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; providers still allow access to the site.

Internet users accessing via Turk Telecom get a message in Turkish saying "Access to this site has been denied by court order! ..." and in Turkish and English "Access to www.youtube.com site has been suspended in accordance with decision no: 2007/384 dated 06.03.2007 of Istanbul First Criminal Peace Court."

The row between Turkish and Greek YouTube users started when Greek videos claimed that &lt;a href="w%3AMustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk"&gt;Atatürk&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the Turkish state, and the Turkish people, were homosexual. There were also profanities on the Turkish flag. A Turkish user responded saying that Greece was the birth place of &lt;a href="w%3Ahomosexuality"&gt;homosexuality&lt;/a&gt;. The dispute received a lot of attention in the Turkish media, which they labelled a "virtual war".

YouTube agreed to take down the offending videos, but nonetheless the prosecutor in Istanbul got a court order, based on charges of insulting Atatürk, which is illegal in Turkey. YouTube responded that it had taken down the videos and was cooperating with the government, adding that "While technology can bring great opportunity and access to information globally, it can also present new and unique cultural challenges."

&lt;a href="w%3AArticle%20301%20%28Turkish%20penal%20code%29"&gt;Article 301 of the Turkish penal code&lt;/a&gt;, which makes insulting Turkishness a crime in Turkey, received a lot of attention because it resulted in the prosecution of intellectuals like Literature Nobel Prize Winner &lt;a href="w%3AOrhan%20Pamuk"&gt;Orhan Pamuk&lt;/a&gt; and murdered journalist &lt;a href="Hrant%20Dink"&gt;Hrant Dink&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; has shown concern over the law article, and Turkey has pledged to revise it. Turkey wants to join the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; but the negotiations have not been without obstacles so far, for example in the field of freedom of expression.

One ticket was sold at a store called Campark Liquors, which is located in &lt;a href="w%3AWoodbine%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Woodbine, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. The other ticket was sold at what is called the Favorite Market, located in &lt;a href="w%3ADalton%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Dalton, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.

The drawing, the biggest in ♡❤Mega Millions♡❤ history, was moved from its usual location in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ATimes%20Square%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Times Square, New York&lt;/a&gt; because at one point, according to New York's lottery commissioner, Robert McLaughlin, at least 1,000,000 tickets an hour were being sold in the state of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.

Some people in &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; were not so lucky. In fact, the state's lottery system, for reasons still not known, went off-line at 10:25 p.m., just over a half hour before the drawing was to be held.

At least one person was one number away from winning the jackpot, matching five of the six numbers. That ticket is worth $250,000 and was bought at Burtonsville Crown Beer &amp; Wine in &lt;a href="w%3AMontgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Montgomery County, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.

The previous record for the highest multi-state lottery was set back in 2006 when the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APower%20Ball"&gt;Power Ball&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ jackpot paid out at least $365 million dollars to eight people in &lt;a href="w%3ANebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;. Another multi-state lottery, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Big%20Game"&gt;The Big Game&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (which was later named ♡❤Mega Millions♡❤) has the third highest jackpot of $363 million dollars which was paid out in 2000.

The lottery numbers were, 16-22-29-39-42 and the Mega Ball was, 20. The odds of actually winning the jackpot, by yourself, was at least one in 176 million. Each group of numbers costs only one dollar.

Chief St. Louis says that the boy pulled out a gun and began to shoot the girl after the two had a conversation. He then shot himself. St. Louis also said that the mother of the girl, who had dropped her daughter off at school for the day, tried to stop the incident from happening by driving her car in between the girl and boy, but was not successful. The boy, whose name is not known, apparently had stored the gun inside his backpack.

According to Midland Deputy Chief, Bob Lane, the boy was not a student at the school and was not granted access into the school. Lane also stated that the boy then placed a phone call to Forsyth telling her to meet him outside the school just before 11:00 a.m. [EST].

The school hosts nearly 1,500 students. The school was in lockdown, but according to a statement on the school's website, the lockdown was cancelled.

"This morning a shooting incident took place at Dow High outside the building near the cafeteria. A Code Red lock-down was issued, but has been lifted," said the statement.

&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; party member &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt; has announced his bid to run for Parliament in the riding of &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Centre"&gt;Toronto-Centre&lt;/a&gt;. This comes a month after &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt; said he will not run again in the next election.

In order to run for office in Canada, the candidate must fill papers for their nomination to run for whichever party they chose. Rae signed his nomination papers today.

Even before Rae officially said he would run for office there was speculation that he would run again.

"It's 12 years since I stood for elected office...and it's quite a while since I ran for federal Parliament so (today) is a fun moment for me," Rae said. "The last year's been terrific, getting back into the swing of debates and scrums and speeches and meeting people, and doing it all is fun."

&lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; lawyer Meredith Cartwright is also expected to contest the nomination which will likely be decided in April.

Rae was leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20New%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Ontario New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; and was premier of Ontario from 1990 to 1995. Rae was a Liberal leadership candidate and lost to &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt; in December 2006.

&lt;a href="w%3AMartha%20Hall%20Findlay"&gt;Martha Hall Findlay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, who were also Liberal leadership candidates, will run again for the Liberals in the next election. Like Rae, they ran for the leadership with no seat in the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;.

An 11-year old daughter of an Afghan widow was abducted, raped and then traded in exchange for a dog and a sum of cash by warlords in Aliabad district of &lt;a href="w%3AKondoz"&gt;Kondoz&lt;/a&gt; province in north of &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, the mother alleged. 

The mother, while crying, told the Afghan women's association RAWA, "A month ago at 11 o'clock of night armed men entered my house and after beating and threatening me by gun, abducted my only daughter." She said that it was later found that her daughter had been raped and exchanged for a dog and a sum of money to another person. The girl's whereabouts are still unknown. 
She accused the district chief Malom Zafar Shah and the powerful warlord Commander Mehmood of being responsible for the crime. 

The mother told journalists: "I approached [the] human rights office and police but none of them could help to find my daughter. The district chief himself has 4 daughters but he sold my daughters to others. With many difficulties and problems I grown up [sic] my 2 daughters, one was previously sold [by him] to a Kandahari man and taken to Pakistan and another was exchanged with a dog. Please bring them to justice." 

Both Malom Zafar Shah and warlord Mehmood are from the "Northern Alliance" and members of Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan led by Burhanuddin Rabbani (currently member of the Parliament). They have a long record of such crimes and brutalities against people of Kondoz. Malom Zafar has been appointed as district chief directly by Qasim Fahim the former defense minister and vice President and now member of Senate. 

In an interview with Ariana TV, Malom Zafar rejected all charges against himself and Commander Mehmmod telling "no Jehadi brother is involved in such crimes." 

Mohammad Zahir Zafari, chief of the human rights office in Kondoz says, they have tried since a month to find the child but the police are also unable to do anything as powerful people have links to the crime. He also revealed that his office was threatened a number of times to stop following the case. 

Pajhwok Afghan News quoted Zahir Zafari on November 7, - "The only person responsible for the abduction of Sanobar is the warlord Mehmood, who exchanged the girl with a dog which he got from Nimatullah and then sold it for 150,000 Afghanis (US$3000)." 

Such crimes happen on a daily basis in Kundoz and other parts of Afghanistan where warlords have established jungle law and have all the key positions in their possession. 

Few such cases find their way to the media, with journalists fearful of the consequences of reporting on such incidents.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

On Sunday, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Forces%20Special%20Operations%20Command"&gt;US Marine Special Forces&lt;/a&gt; who had just escaped an early-morning ambush by &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban%232007"&gt;Taliban insurgents&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMuhmand%20Dara%20District"&gt;Muhmand Dara, Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, retaliated by opening fire on nearby civilians, including pedestrians and as many as 15 passing cars, including those that had pulled to the side of the road to comply with orders. 

Haji Ihsanullah, a member of &lt;a href="w%3AHezb%20e%20Islami"&gt;Hezb e Islami&lt;/a&gt; initially drove a &lt;a href="w%3Aminivan"&gt;minivan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acarbomb"&gt;laden with explosives&lt;/a&gt; into one of the five vehicles making up the US convoy, which included three &lt;a href="w%3Ahumvee"&gt;humvee&lt;/a&gt;s, slightly wounding one Marine. Sources differ on whether or not hidden gunmen then also opened fire on the convoy.

US forces then fled the scene of the ambush "firing wildly", opening fire on every civilian and vehicle they saw for 6 miles while driving along the Afghan street.

Initial reports stated that 14 civilians had been killed in the attack, and another 35 were wounded by the gunfire. But officials at &lt;a href="w%3ABagram%20Air%20Base"&gt;Bagram Air Base&lt;/a&gt; later claimed that only 8 had been killed. Other sources reported that 4 of the wounded later died of their injuries at &lt;a href="w%3AJalalabad%20Hospital"&gt;Jalalabad Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.

The event was described as an "emotional" response by the US forces, by Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Zmarai Bashiri. Thousands of Afghans gathered to protest the shooting. US troops also forced two &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; photojournalists to delete their digital photographs of the attack's aftermath, although &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Jazeera"&gt;al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; photojournalists then visited the scene and captured similar footage.

The shooting is under investigation by both Afghan and US officials.

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; made a visit to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yesterday to watch the 2007 annual &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Hortons%20Brier"&gt;Tim Hortons Brier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACopps%20Coliseum"&gt;Copps Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Harper, who is currently writing a book about the history of Hockey, admitted he's a curling fan. He started to be a fan of curling in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWinnipeg%2C%20Manitoba"&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Manitoba"&gt;Manitoba&lt;/a&gt; 10 years ago and said his father used to play it.

"I've never curled but my father did when I was very young," he said. "I've followed the Brier for years. About the last decade or so I've made an effort to get to the Brier when I could. It is such a great Canadian tradition."

He cheered on for &lt;a href="Alberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Martin"&gt;Kevin Martin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Martin won 9&amp;ndash;8 over players from &lt;a href="Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;. Harper met with Kevin Martin after the event. Martin handed the PM his jersey from Monday's game.

"I've obviously got a soft spot for Kevin Martin and Alberta because he's had such a great career," said Harper. "But what's so great about the Brier is whoever wins is not like your normal pro athlete. They're usually great community people and Canadians. It's always easy to identify with whoever goes forward."

Robin MacPherson of Hamilton sat in front of him. She wore a large crown and was draped in gold.

She got to meet the PM and was quoted saying: "Not a lot of people get to meet a prime minister."

&lt;a href="Manchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; progressed to the quarterfinals of the &lt;a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; earlier today after defeating Lille 1-0 for the second time. After the controversial winning goal from the first leg, United had a strong advantage in the series, and Lille needed a win to advance. The scorer of that controversial goal, Ryan Giggs, was left out of the lineup, and instead the more defensive minded John O'Shea was played. Lille started the game with a defensive lineup as well, hoping to stall the Red Devils, and make a score later in the match. Manchester United came into the game short of several key players due to injury, including Louis Saha (hamstring), Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer (surgery recovery), and Darren Fletcher (ankle). Striker Alan Smith was on the bench for United hoping to get back to first team action after a broken leg kept him out of the main squad for nearly a year.

United grabbed the first of the chances 15 minutes into the game after Scholes popped in a cross to &lt;a href="Wayne%20Rooney"&gt;Rooney&lt;/a&gt;, but the young striker couldn't get his volley away in time, and Mathieu Chalme moved well to block. The ensuing corner saw another good chance present itself for United, but John O'Shea's powerful headed from Carrick's kick hit only the crossbar. Lille then had a chance of their own as Makoun strafed in behind the defence to connect with a freekick by Obraniak. Makoun's header was poor, and keeper Edwin Van Der Sar had and easy time collecting the ball. When Macnhester United earned themselves a freekick outside the Lille area, two Lille players placed themselves directly in front of Paul Scholes, not allowing him to take an early kick. Lille was appearing to be playing stronger, and made quick moves on the counter attack to worry United. One fine pass by Chalme into the box was aimed for a wide open Odemwingie, but he was not able to cleanly hit the ball, and the danger passed. &lt;a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; made his presence felt in the Lille area and was brought down by Chalme in the box. Instead of a penalty, Ronaldo was awarded a yellow card for what referee Luis Cantalejo considered a dive.

The second half saw Lille continue to dominate the football match, and the first threat came through a long range shot by Keita, but Van Der Sar saved well. Odemwingie was again on the attack, but was unfortunate to see his header smash off the post. United finally had a chance of their own in the second half when defender Nemanja Vidic connected with a free kick by Rooney, but the Serbian's header flew just over the goal. A sense of anxiety was starting to fill Old Trafford until Ronaldo and Larsson combined to put the series away after 72 minutes. Ronaldo used some of his trademark moves to outwit 3 Lille defenders and knocked a well aimed ball into Larsson, who forced a powerful header into the back of the net. The goal will be the last Larsson will score for United at Old Trafford, as his loan contract expires on the 12th of March. Larsson was applauded as he left the pitch and was replaced by Alan Smith, who was eager to impress after his extended absence from the team. Lille made two changes of their own, throwing Fauvergue and Mirallis into the fray, but they never looked likely to get the two goals they needed to advance. United went on to win, but now have even more injury worries as Mikael Silvestre had to be stretchered off the field after sustaining a head injury.

Arsenal and PSV met at the Emirates Stadium in London earlier today for the second leg of their Champions League battle. The first match ended 1-0 for PSV, giving them the advantage from the start in this game, as a tie would be all they needed to win. Arsenal, who again were without Thiery Henry to start the football match, played a very young side as usual, although 17 year old Theo Walcott was with Henry on the subs bench. PSV played an attacking side, with Arouna Kone and Jefferson Farfan in the front.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
PSV started strong out of the gate, and appeared to catch the home team by surprise with their determination. Arsenal were able to stave off the first attacks, and soon had the game under controlled and switched it into one way traffic. Fabregas and Denilson played strongly in the midfield to dictate the play for Arsenal, and soon chances began to show for the Gunners. The first fell to the Ivorian Kolo Toure, who pushed off his fellow countryman Kone, only to see his shot fly harmlessly wide of the net. More chances poured in for Arsenal, but the youngsters did not have the killer touch to finish off any clean shots on the goal. William Gallas of Arsenal had to leave the pitch to replace a contact lens, and PSV took a chance on the man advantage to press forward. Phillip Cocu put himself in a great position behind the defense, but spurned his chance as he headed the ball wide. Arsenal again pressed, as a header by Adebayor went wide, along with two volleys by Julio Baptista.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At the start of the second half, Arsenal continued to be frustrated by a combination of poor finishing and good defending by PSV. The Gunners would finally get the goal they needed after 58 minutes, thanks to an own goal by Alex. A corner by Arsenal allowed Adebayor to flick the ball on, and fortuitously it bounced off the hapless defender Alex and into the net. The goal boosted Arsenals confidence, and they continued to press the game. Arsenal nearly doubled their lead when Adebayor was sent one on one with keeper Heurelho, but his shot was directly at the keeper, and the game remained at 1-0 for the home side. As they pushed forward, Arsenal left gaps at the back, and Jefferson Farfan exposed one such gap before Denilson brought him down in the area, but no penalty was given. Henry then joined the fray from the bench, and though he didn't look completely comfortble, still managed to force Heurelho into a save with a dipping free kick. PSV would make Arsenal pay for their missed chances however, as Alex made up for his own goal and headed and Edison Mendez free kick home, tying the game and giving PSV the lead on aggregate. The aggregate loss concluded a sorrowful series of cup events for Arsenal after they lost in both the FA Cup and the Carling Cup, and now added the Champions League to the list.

&lt;a href="Bayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; hosted &lt;a href="Real%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; at the Allianz Arena today in the second leg of the &lt;a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; round of sixteen. The first leg saw Real coming out on top 3-2, but the two away goals by Bayern gave them a good chance in the second leg. Madrid were without &lt;a href="David%20Beckham"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt; for the game, who orchestrated all 3 goals in the first leg, and he was replaced in the midfield by Raúl. Bayern played a strong side, with Lucas Podolski and Roy Makaay in attack, and Owen Hargreaves in the midfield.

Any plans Real had made for the game went immediately out the window when Roy Makaay scored the fastest ever goal in a Champions League match after only 10 seconds. Real took the kickoff, and Roberto Carlos was immediately dispossessed by Salihamidzic, who passed in the ball to Makaay. The German striker neatly finished passed Iker Casillas to stun the Galacticos, and give the home side the lead. Bayern continued to press, and Real looked listless, as shots from Podolski and Makaay were saved by Casillas. Real coach Fabio Capello was quick to make changes in his team, and sent on Guti in place of Emerson. Casillas was again forced into action as van Buyten headed Sagnol's free kick towards the goal, but the keeper got down well to make the stop. Madrid finally began to play like a team, and substitute Guti had a chance after a neat backheel by &lt;a href="Gonzalo%20Higua%C3%ADn"&gt;Higuain&lt;/a&gt; found him, but the shot flew wide. Real continued pressing, and Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy headed a ball towards the net, but Oliver Kahn was easily able to cope with the low power effort. Raúl then struck an acrobatic effort towards the goal, but found only the side netting.

After the restart, Real looked shaky at the back again as van Bommel found his way in on goal, but Casillas was again on hand to snuff out the danger. Oliver Kahn was then forced into action at the other end, as he pushed out a van Nistelrooy header off of a cross by Raúl. Bayern had a penalty claim, but were denied by referee Lubos Michel. It didn't matter however, and the resulting corner was met by Lucio's head, doubling Bayerns lead. Bayern had another chance minutes later, but a open header by Salihamidzic went wide. Raúl then had a chance for Real, but his header was directed straight to Kahn. Ruud van Nistelrooy was then denied a run on goal after a mistaken offside call was given by the linesman. On 80 minutes, Robinho was hauled down by van Bommel in the penalty area, and Real was awarded a penalty. Marco van Bommel was consequently given his second yellow of the match for arguing the point, and was sent off along with Diarra of Real for his part in the confrontation. Once everything settled, van Nistelrooy stepped up to the spot and sent the ball into the net, cutting the lead in half, but still leaving Real behind on aggregate. The game finished dramatically, as Ramos thought he had scored to tie the game, but the referee correctly judged that a hand had been used in the build up, and the goal was not counted. The game ended in a win for Bayern, and they will go on to the next round, while Real is left to focus on domestic play.

A full crowd showed up at the Guiseppe Meazza in Italy today to watch AC Milan take on Scottish side Celtic. The first leg of the matches ended in a goalless draw, as both teams were spirited in defense. Kaka and Inzaghi played as frontmen for AC, while Vennegoor of Hesselink and Jiri Jarosik were the strike pair for Celtic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Milan had the first chance of the game early when Kaka found room and flashed a shot towards the bottom corner, but keeper Artur Boruc got down well to make the stop. Celtic then had a valid penalty claim after only 6 minutes when Jarosik's volley looked to be blocked by the hand of Maldini, but referee Konrad Plautz waved away the appeals. Celtic's defense continued to play well, and they limited Milan's chances to long ranged shots. Lee Naylor then performed defensive heroics for Celtic as he took the ball away from the open Inzaghi, who was waiting to tap the ball in at the back post. Kaka had two more shots from range at the net, but neither were on target. Naylor again saved Celtic by clearing the ball off the line from a Kaka attempt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Over an hour had passed when Gord Strachan sent Thomas Graveson on for Celtic in place of Jarosik, and the Dane almost scored right away. He struck a fine shot at the net, but Massimo Oddo did well to block the attempt. Milan counter attacked quickly, and Kaka saw his attempt also blocked by a defender. McManus and Naylor were forced to clear headers off the line from Ambrosini and Inzaghi, both occurring after corners. Maldini then had a header at the Celtic net, but Boruc was again in the right place to make the stop. Celtic had another claim for a penalty when Nakamura was brought down in the area, but the Austrian referee again waved away all appeals. Boruc was again forced into action from a Seedorf free kick, which he was able to deflect out with a hand. Kaka then shot towards the goal, but the crossbar saved Celtic from going a goal down. As 90 minutes approached, Celtic had two well positioned free-kicks, but could take advantage of neither, and the game entered extra time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It took Milan little time to go ahead in the extra period, and the scorer would be no other than the Brazilian Kaka. The youthful striker put on a burst of speed to beat out the tired Celtic defenders and blasted the ball through Borucs legs to give the homeside the lead. The game continued however, as the Champions League works on full extra time, and Celtic still had 27 minutes to equalize. It was Milan who pushed however, and Andrea Pirlo twice forced Boruc to make saves. Then Kaka, in search of a brace, sent a volley over the net after being left alone during a corner kick. Gravesen's long effort for Celtic was easy pickings for Dida, and Craig Beattie headed a good chance over the bar. Celtic vainly tried to tie the game, bringing on Kenny Miller, but AC finished the game comfortably, and advanced to the next round of the tournament.

The Ugandan troops, 400 of whom arrived on Tuesday and another 400 the day after, were deployed to the capital &lt;a href="w%3AMogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt; as replacements for &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;n troops to support the &lt;a href="w%3ATransitional%20Federal%20Parliament"&gt;Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP)&lt;/a&gt;. 

Ethiopia intervened to help the TFP oust the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Courts%20Union"&gt;Islamic Courts Union (IUC)&lt;/a&gt;, which had held power for six months.

"Convoys of Ugandan troops were ambushed as they were passing the main junction in Mogadishu, and they exchanged heavy gunfire with the insurgents," said Shino Abdukadir, an eyewitness.

Somalia's Deputy Defense Minister Salad Ali Jelle said the Ugandan troops suffered no casualties. There were 10 civilians killed in the attack.

Assane Ba of the African Union said: "The AU has promised to deploy in Somalia and in Mogadishu. The attacks and threats do not set back the deployment."

A Mogadishu radio station broadcast a message from IUC member and &lt;a href="w%3AHizbul%20Shabaab"&gt;Hizbul Shabaab&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="w%3AAden%20Hashi%20Farah%20%26quot%3BEyrow%26quot%3B"&gt;Aden Hashi Ayro&lt;/a&gt;, calling for attacks on the peacekeepers. "It is time for the Somali youth to fight the occupation by Ethiopia and others. The Muslims shall not surrender to non-believers."

Computer systems used by the &lt;a href="w%3ACanada_Revenue_Agency"&gt;Canada Revenue Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CRA) for the handling of tax filing data for Canadians have been temporarily shutdown due to infrastructure problems.
A March 7 article in the ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤
states that due to errors in the electronic filing system, Canada Revenue Agency will be unable to accept any tax filings electronically or corrections to prior filings.

A fact sheet from the CRA 
states that "until the problem is resolved, we cannot process returns filed on paper, or returns filed electronically before the system interruption. Refunds will be delayed until processing is resumed". 

A check of the taxing authority's website

A CRA press release dated March 6 
states "Commissioner of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) Michel Dorais today instructed some computer applications related to personal income tax filing to be temporarily halted." he also said, "there is no indication that this situation was caused by intrusion, hacking, or computer virus". Further, "These applications include online services like Efile, Netfile, and My Account. Mr. Dorais said that he instructed that this preventative measure be taken following indications that CRA computer systems have run into infrastructure problems. In order to safeguard existing systems and to maintain the integrity of CRA's taxpayer information holdings, Mr Dorais ordered tax filing processes halted." 

An article in ♡❤The Globe and Mail♡❤ 
states that taxpayers "can wait for Netfile to return to service, or they can print their returns and mail them to the CRA", which will be processed when the computer glitch is resolved.

The deadline for Canadians to submit tax returns is April 30. The CRA indicates it is too soon to speculate on whether the filing deadline will be extended. They expect to restore all services, including EFile and Netfile, well in advance of the filing deadline.
The shutdown also affects third-party companies that prepare tax returns and electronically file the data using the EFile facility on behalf of clients. According to the CRA, millions of individual Canadians use the Netfile service each year.

The Agency will provide updates daily to the media until the situation is resolved.

On Saturday, the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Constitutional%20Council"&gt;French Constitutional Council&lt;/a&gt; announced its approval for a proposed law that would make it illegal for anybody other than professional journalists to videotape acts of violence.

The law is, as the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; dubs it, a "clumsy effort" to curb the urban youth activity known as &lt;a href="w%3AHappy%20slapping"&gt;happy slapping&lt;/a&gt; in which an act of violence, such as kicking a helpless victim, is filmed by the attacker's friends for entertainment purposes.

The new law was tucked inside a much larger anti-crime bill put before the Council, and has been chastised for being "deliberately" vague and allowing the prosecution of non-guilty parties who simply videotape events of police brutality, urban riots or other violence. Under the new legislation, written by &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28France%29"&gt;Minister of the Interior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, convicted "citizen journalists" could face up to five years in prison.

Media freedom group &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; has called the act "dangerous", and warned that it can be used to target "regular citizens" who film acts of violence. The group has also attacked proposed French legislation that would designate certain media outlets as "government-approved sources of information", citing the dangers of &lt;a href="w%3Acensorship"&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt;.

Imagine coming back from a camping trip in the desert. Then a few months later you notice in your photos from the trip that you camped inside a giant impact crater so big that no one documented it before. Could it happen?

During several trips to the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Rock%20Desert"&gt;Black Rock Desert&lt;/a&gt;, mostly while supporting the Stratofox Aerospace Tracking Team for suborbital space rocket launch efforts, Ian Kluft KO6YQ noticed some oddities in rock formations. He had a little experience with volcanoes, and some rocks in the area looked unusual. There seemed to be some lava here and there - but where was the volcano? He observed that even a large caldera should have mostly volcanic rocks. He then noticed some curved geographic structures in satellite imagery which made him curious if it might be an impact crater.

A TV documentary about meteor impacts mentioned some characteristics of impact craters. He went to the Internet to learn more. He noticed some of his own pictures of the area had cone shaped structures which might be "&lt;a href="w%3AShatter%20cone"&gt;shatter cones&lt;/a&gt;" due to an impact shock wave that passed through the rocks. Discussion with others produced suggestions and volunteers who joined the effort. More circular features in satellite photographs were found. Igneous &lt;a href="w%3ADike%20%28geology%29"&gt;dike&lt;/a&gt;s through white layers of rock had been described and were visible in many photos.

The possible impact crater is 30 miles (48 km) wide east-to-west and 40 miles (64 km) north-to-south centered around &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Ff%3Dq%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bq%3D40.9834%25C2%25B0N%2B118.9157%25C2%25B0W%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bom%3D1%26amp%3Bz%3D10%26amp%3Bll%3D40.984045%2C-118.916016%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.478949%2C1.363678%26amp%3Bt%3Dk"&gt;40.984045 N, 118.916016 W&lt;/a&gt;. That is in northwestern Nevada halfway between Reno and the Oregon border. The apparent ancient geological structure is so old that much of it is eroded away. The forces that eroded the Black Rock Desert itself, whether glacier or stream, have apparently cut through the crater rims and floor to do it.

Following an expedition to the area in late January, more possible shatter cones were observed in one of the rock samples collected. These are only formed by the shock wave of an impact event or nuclear explosion. The nearest nuclear test was underground at &lt;a href="w%3ASand%20Springs%20Range"&gt;Sand Springs Range&lt;/a&gt; in central Nevada. Atmospheric tests at the &lt;a href="w%3ANevada%20Test%20Site"&gt;Nevada Test Site&lt;/a&gt; were at the southern, and opposite, end of the state. So that points toward an impact if confirmed. But professional geologists will want to have the final word on confirming them.

In addition to shatter cones, rock samples were thought to contain &lt;a href="w%3Ashocked%20quartz"&gt;shocked quartz&lt;/a&gt; because the criss-cross fractures looked like examples in online documents. But this group of volunteers doesn't have equipment for proper photography of shocked quartz. If found, that would be another way to prove the impact origin of the rocks.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeologic%20joint"&gt;Columnar jointed columns&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of feet tall appear on some bluffs in locations that appeared consistent with part of a slowly cooling crater floor. But that alone only helps as part of a bigger picture, because volcanoes can have lava cool in columnar joints as well.

They also found local geological studies which described oddities which could be explained by an impact event. Layers of rocks in the mining district called Sulphur left geologists with a mystery about the cause of chemical alterations since 1980. The group compared it with information in online geological texts like "Traces of Catastrophe" by Dr Bevan M French of the Smithsonian Institution. Layers of impact ejecta seemed to explain the rock layers better than the previous theory about acid uniformly cooking the rocks across the region, and only in one layer of rocks. A separate 1980 study 40 miles away identified an immense air-fall tuff layer in the Soldier Meadows area as having been deposited in a single unit, yet couldn't locate the volcano which produced this enormous volume. Fault diagrams published online by a mining operation at Sulphur on the edge of the circular structure from the satellite photo also look like curved terraced faults in the wall of a crater.

The mining geologists who wrote papers from 1980 to 2002 had not mentioned the possibility of a crater. But they were each gathering single puzzling pieces of information. A larger image seemed to be forming when putting the pieces together. The group hopes the information will be helpful to geologists who do further work in the region.

The theory hasn't been put to any test by professionals yet. Some responses point out that the elliptical region reported as the possible impact crater could also be the volcanic caldera that the 1980 study was looking for. If so, such a large volcanic caldera would still be a significant discovery for the region.

This will remain officially a mystery for a while until the professional geologists get to study it. There is a lot of information available online for those who are interested.

The &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Lewis%20Partnership"&gt;John Lewis Partnership&lt;/a&gt; retail group announced massively increased profits this morning, with group sales up 11% on the financial year to £6.4billion ($12.3billion) and pre-tax profits up 27% to £319million ($614.8 million). 

On the back of this, it was announced that the amount of money set aside from profits for the employees of the business would rise 29% to £155million, with each employee receiving 18% of their previous year's salary as a lump sum as part of their March pay package.

The Partnership, as the name implies, is effectively wholly owned by its own employees (termed "partners"), with all partners receiving a share of the profits yearly as a bonus along with various other benefits. The company owns the &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Lewis"&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt; chain of department stores and the upmarket supermarket chain &lt;a href="w%3AWaitrose"&gt;Waitrose&lt;/a&gt;.

It should not be confused with the &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; store &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%27s"&gt;Lewis's&lt;/a&gt; which has recently gone into receivership.

&lt;a href="w%3AAntony%20Gormley"&gt;Antony Gormley&lt;/a&gt;'s artwork &lt;a href="w%3AAnother%20Place"&gt;Another Place&lt;/a&gt; is to stay on &lt;a href="w%3ACrosby%20Beach"&gt;Crosby Beach&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASefton%20Metropolitan%20Borough%20Council"&gt;Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council&lt;/a&gt; changed its mind after revised plans were put in relocating some of the statues in order to reduce impact on wildlife and danger to visitors. &lt;a href="w%3ABootle%20Town%20Hall"&gt;Bootle Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; was packed for the meeting of the planning committee which was attended by Mr Gormley.

The original plan had been for a 2 year placement at the beach. However when it was decided to transfer the statues to another site, several local campaign groups were started with the intention of keeping the statues.

Afterwards, Mr Gormley said:♡❤It's wonderful that a piece of beach should become a permanent place of contemplation and reverie. I'm a sailor and I understand that people feel their ability to use coastal waters is being diminished, but I do not believe the loss is as great as they’re saying.♡❤

After plans to move 19 statues where submitted, 13 where to be removed from the area around a coastguard station and three to improve emergency access and the rest from the birds feeding area. Councillors voted nine to five to keep the work.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMaritime%20and%20Coastguard%20Agency"&gt;Maritime and Coastguard Agency&lt;/a&gt; still want the work removed as it draws visitors into areas of the beach were they can become stuck. While directors of art organisations in the area such as &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20Biennial"&gt;Liverpool Biennial&lt;/a&gt; have expressed support for the decision.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; stage and television actor &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Inman"&gt;John Inman&lt;/a&gt; has died at the age of 71. Mr. Inman, born in Preston, Lancashire, had been suffering from the &lt;a href="w%3AHepatitis"&gt;Hepatitis A&lt;/a&gt; infection for some time.

"John, through his character Mr. Humphries of Are You Being Served? was known and loved throughout the world. He was one of the best and finest &lt;a href="w%3Apantomime_dame"&gt;pantomime dames&lt;/a&gt; working to capacity audiences throughout Britain," said Inman's manager, Phil Dale.

Most famous for his role in the BBC comedy series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAre%20You%20Being%20Served%3F"&gt;Are You Being Served?&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Inman entered popular culture with his appearance as the camp store assistant, Mr Humphries, and popularised the catchphrase "I'm Free!" across British society.

Tributes from across the acting and stage professions have been coming in all morning, since the death was announced by Mr Inman's spokesman earlier this morning. According to the Londonpaper, dated 8th of March, &lt;a href="w%3AInman"&gt;Inman's&lt;/a&gt; long-term partner, Ron Lynch, was said to be "devastated" at his death. His co-star, &lt;a href="w%3AWendy%20Richard"&gt;Wendy Richard&lt;/a&gt; who played opposite him in the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; show, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, "John was one of the wittiest and most inventive actors I've ever worked with. He was a brilliant, brilliant pantomime dame and he was a very good all-round actor, really. He was a true professional." 

Inman’s manager Phil Dale told the BBC - "John was known and loved throughout the world. He was one of the best and finest pantomime dames working to capacity audiences throughout Britain". Mike Berry, who played Mr Spooner in ♡❤Are You Being Served?♡❤, told the BBC: "I felt like going home at the end of the day and ironing my face, he made me laugh so much! As funny as he was in front of the camera, he was funnier off.”

It was revealed on Friday, March 9 that &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s premier gay and lesbian publication, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASX%20News"&gt;SX&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, would publish a special tribute in Inman's honour, commemorating the actor with a feature article written by the magazine's star journalists, Katrina Fox and Peter Hackney.

Results are coming in for the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt; election held on Wednesday 7 March. With all first preference votes counted, both the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; (DUP) and &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt; have made gains: the DUP received 30.1% of first preferences, an increase of 4.4 percentage points on the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly%20election%2C%202003"&gt;2003 election&lt;/a&gt;, while Sinn Féin won 26.2%, up 2.6 percentage points. This means that the two parties have gained more than half of the vote. The &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic and Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; (SDLP) came third with 15.2%, the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Ulster Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; fourth with 14.9% and the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20Party%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt; fifth with 5.2%.
The election is a crucial step in restoring &lt;a href="w%3ADevolution"&gt;devolved&lt;/a&gt; government to &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, which has been under &lt;a href="w%3ADirect%20Rule"&gt;direct rule&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AWestminster"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt; since October 2002, when the Assembly was suspended after allegations that an &lt;a href="w%3AProvisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; spy ring was operating there. The resulting court case collapsed. Attempts to get the leading &lt;a href="w%3AUnionists%20%28Ireland%29"&gt;unionist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20nationalism"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; parties to resume power-sharing had failed until the &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Andrews%20Agreement"&gt;St Andrews Agreement&lt;/a&gt; was reached in October 2006. This agreement commits Sinn Féin to accepting the &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20Service%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Police Service of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and the DUP to accepting power-sharing.

All 108 seats have now been filled. The DUP are the largest party with 36 seats, followed by Sinn Féin with 28 seats. Their combined total of 64 seats gives the two parties a majority of ten in the Assembly, assuming that they are willing to work together. Among others, DUP leader &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt; has been elected in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Antrim%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29"&gt;North Antrim&lt;/a&gt;, as has Sinn Féin leader &lt;a href="Gerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast%20West%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29"&gt;West Belfast&lt;/a&gt;. DUP deputy leader &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Robinson%20%28politician%29"&gt;Peter Robinson&lt;/a&gt; topped the poll in &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast%20East%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29"&gt;East Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="w%3ANaomi%20Long"&gt;Naomi Long&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance Party was also elected. The leaders of the other two main parties were also elected: &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Durkan"&gt;Mark Durkan&lt;/a&gt; of the SDLP was elected on the first count in &lt;a href="w%3AFoyle%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29"&gt;Foyle&lt;/a&gt;, while Ulster Unionist leader &lt;a href="w%3AReg%20Empey"&gt;Sir Reg Empey&lt;/a&gt; was elected on the third count in East Belfast. Alliance Party leader &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Ford"&gt;David Ford&lt;/a&gt; was elected in his constituency of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Antrim%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29"&gt;South Antrim&lt;/a&gt; on the fifth count. &lt;a href="w%3ADawn%20Purvis"&gt;Dawn Purvis&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Progressive Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; (PUP), was elected on the last count in East Belfast. The &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20in%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; won their first ever seat in the Northern Ireland Assembly, when their Northern Ireland chairperson &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Wilson%20%28Northern%20Ireland%20politician%29"&gt;Brian Wilson&lt;/a&gt; was elected on the tenth count in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Down%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29"&gt;North Down&lt;/a&gt; with 2839 first preference votes.
&lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Lo"&gt;Anna Lo&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance Party has become the first candidate from an ethnic minority background to have been elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly, winning a seat in &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast%20South%20%28Assembly%20constituency%29"&gt;South Belfast&lt;/a&gt; with the fourth highest first preference vote in the constituency, 3829 votes. She said her decision to stand had been an extension of her community work, and that she wanted to give a voice to Chinese people who never felt they had any part to play in Northern Ireland politics. She also said she hoped that indigenous voters who were fed up with "tribal politics" would give her their support, and that she was determined "to be much more than a candidate for ethnic minorities". 

Counting the votes cast in the 600 polling stations continued through to Friday 9 March. Turnout was 63.5%, down 0.5 percentage points on the previous election. Assembly elections use the &lt;a href="w%3ASingle%20Transferable%20Vote"&gt;Single Transferable Vote&lt;/a&gt; (STV) method of &lt;a href="w%3Aproportional%20representation"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;, with each constituency returning six &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly"&gt;MLA&lt;/a&gt;s.
A new power-sharing &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Executive"&gt;Northern Ireland Executive&lt;/a&gt; is to be formed by 26 March, according to the St Andrews Agreement. The election of a &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;First Minister&lt;/a&gt; and Deputy First Minister requires the support of a majority of unionist MLAs and of nationalist MLAs ("parallel consent"). In practice this means that the largest unionist party and the largest nationalist party must agree to share power. If they cannot agree by the deadline the Northern Ireland Assembly at &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20Buildings%20%28Northern%20Ireland%29"&gt;Stormont&lt;/a&gt; will be suspended again and MLAs will have their salaries and allowances stopped. Though there has been criticism of the deal reached at St Andrews by elements within both the DUP and Sinn Féin, the &lt;a href="w%3AHer%20Majesty%27s%20Government"&gt;government in Westminster&lt;/a&gt; believes that these dissenters are in a minority.

&lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hain"&gt;Peter Hain&lt;/a&gt; said to &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;: "I'm optimistic that we can achieve a working government on March 26, but it's a very stark choice for them — get into power, or shut up shop". But he also warned that "if this falls over on March 26, there is no prospect of another settlement for a very long time, maybe years". On Friday 9 March Mr Hain began separate meetings with the leaders and deputy leaders of the DUP and Sinn Féin.

Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams said he had "no problem" with working with the Unionists and shaking the hand of Ian Paisley: "I think it is very, very important in terms of representing a community that for a long time was marginalized and excluded. We're about reaching out to the Unionists".
But Ian Paisley claimed that Sinn Féin's decision to support the police had been "qualified", and said, "you can't pick and choose how far you are prepared to go for peace." He also said that Sinn Féin had to "turn from their evil ways". To the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; he said: "We will enter into talks tomorrow with the Secretary of State, we will be meeting the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; next week, and the hard negotiations are now going to start. Sinn Féin are not entitled to be at the table until they declare themselves for democracy. I am a democrat, I don't speak to loyalist paramilitaries, I don't speak to Sinn Féin".

On Friday 9 March British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; made a joint statement. They said, "The message of the electorate is clear. After so many years of frustration and disappointment, they want Northern Ireland to move on to build a better future together through the restored institutions. Many of the practical issues which have been raised in this election campaign can and should be resolved locally." They said that they would work closely with the Northern Irish parties to restore devolved government by the deadline of 26 March and praised the progress already made in this direction. "The people of Northern Ireland have suffered grievous pain and loss. But enormous progress has been made and there is now no good reason why we should not be able to complete this historic process. All must now take responsibility in government for building and consolidating peace, this is what the people of Northern Ireland want. They deserve no less."

The first leg of the round of sixteen in the &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Cup%202006-07"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; occurred earlier today, with all eight games being played. &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; boasted the most teams in the competition with four (&lt;a href="w%3ARCD%20Espanyol"&gt;Espanyol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACelta%20de%20Vigo"&gt;Celta de Vigo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASevilla%20FC"&gt;Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACA%20Osasuna"&gt;Osasuna&lt;/a&gt;), while &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ATottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C."&gt;Tottenham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United%20F.C."&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AS.C.%20Braga"&gt;Braga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AS.L.%20Benfica"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ABayer%2004%20Leverkusen"&gt;Bayer Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASV%20Werder%20Bremen"&gt;Werder Bremen&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARC%20Lens"&gt;Lens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParis%20Saint-Germain%20FC"&gt;PSG&lt;/a&gt;) each had two teams still in the Cup. Other represented countries were &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AMaccabi%20Haifa%20F.C."&gt;Maccabi Haifa&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3A%20Rangers%20F.C."&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Shakhtar%20Donetsk"&gt;Shakhtar Donetsk&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AAZ%20Alkmaar"&gt;AZ Alkmaar&lt;/a&gt;).

<h2>Matches</h2>
<h3>Newcastle United 4 - 2 AZ Alkmaar</h3>
English side Newcastle United was visited by the Dutch AZ Alkmaar at St. James' Park. Both teams played a very disciplined match, and referee Massimo Brusca only was forced to deal out one yellow card to AZ's Steinsson. Newcastle raced out the lead with an own goal by Steinsson after 8 minutes. Kieron Dyer doubled the lead for the hosts after 22 minutes, and then Newcastle's top scorer Obafemi Martins made the game 3-0 only a minute later. AZ Finally made a reply on 31 minutes when striker Shota Arveladze scored for the visitors, but the lead would soon be restored as Martins earned himself a double on 37 minutes. Danny Koevermans scored late in the game to give AZ a crucial away goal, but the Dutch side will have to have a better defensive showing if they hope to advance in the second leg.
<h3>Maccabi Haifi 0 - 0 Espanyol</h3>
Espanyol traveled to Israel to take on Maccabai Haifi at the Kiryat-Eli'ezer Stadium. The game ended in a draw, leaving Maccabi needing only a draw in the second leg to advance to the next round.
<h3>Rangers 1 - 1 Osasuna</h3>
The Spanish team Osasuna visited Rangers at Ibrox Stadium. Osasuna scored first after 17 minutes, with Raul Garcia scoring the crucial away goal. Rangers let the game go very late before tying the match through Brahim Hemdani on 92 minutes. The tie gives Osasuna a slight advantage next game, as long as they can keep Rangers off the scoresheet.
<h3>Braga 2 - 3 Tottenham Hotspur</h3>
In a nervy game at the Estadio Municipal de Braga, Tottenham came away with a fantastic result, defeating Portuguese side Braga at their home field. All the scoring occurred in the second half, and Tottenham struck first through Robbie Keane. Steve Malbranque then doubled the lead for Spurs on 72 minutes. Braga fancied a comeback, and Paulo Jorge game them a lift on 76 minutes to cut the lead in half. Ze Carlos the tied the game for the home side after 81 minutes. All would be for naught for the homeside however, as Robbie Keane earned a brace in stoppage time to give the visitors the win.
<h3>Sevilla 2 - 2 Shakhtar Donetsk</h3>
Two penalties kept this match tied, as Shaktar of the Ukraine visited current La Liga leaders Sevilla. Sevilla, who have been on a high as of late after beating Barcelona, struck first in this match with Jose Luis Marti getting the goal. Tomas Hubschman tied the game for Shaktar on 18 minutes, and the took the lead on 60 after a penalty was awarded to them by referee Viktor Kassai. The guests looked set for the win, but Sevilla earned their own penalty on 88 minutes, and Enzo Maresca converted the chance to tie the game.
<h3>Lens 2 - 1 Bayer Leverkusen</h3>
French side Lens defeated Bayer Leverkusen of Germany at the Stade Felix-Bollaert in France. The home side scored first and Olivier Monterrubio got the goal on 17 minutes. Karim Haqui responded for the Germans after the break to tie the game at one. Lens were then awarded a penalty, and Daniel Cousin scored to give Lens the win.
<h3>Paris Saint Germain 2 - 1 Benfica</h3>
The visitors scored first in the match at the Parc des Princes in France, but PSG were not deterred by the early goal by Simao Sabrosa. Simaos compatriot Pauleta tied the game for PSG on 36 minutes, and Pierre-Alain Frau gave the homeside the lead 5 minutes later. PSG hung on to give them the advantage in the second leg of the cup series.
<h3>Celta Vigo 0 - 1 Werder Bremen</h3>
Visitors Bremen won the game thanks to an 84th minute goal by Hugo Almeida. The win gives the Bundesliga side a great chance at advancing to the quarterfinals, while Celta will have to play hard in the next leg and earn a win on the road if they hope to continue in the competition.

<h1>IAEA suspends nuclear aid for Iran</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=IAEA%20suspends%20nuclear%20aid%20for%20Iran&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Governors of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; nuclear agency &lt;a href="IAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt; approved cuts in technical aid to &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; in accordance with UN sanctions. The move reflected &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AResolution%20%28law%29"&gt;Resolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 17-37 passed last December that bans the transfer of technology or expertise that might aid in producing nuclear fuel. 

The 35-nation board, which is often split over issues on Iran, came to a consensus in ratifying the recommendation of the IAEA's Secretariat to suspend 22 of 55 technical aid programs involving Iran. These consist of four national programs in Iran and 18 regional or trans-regional programs that involve the country. The board did not suspend 33 other programs (11 national and 22 regional) all of which focus on medical and agricultural radio-pharmaceuticals and isotopes. 

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; who fund much of the IAEA's special aid programs had originally demanded more sweeping reductions.

Ali Akbar Velayati, international affairs advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt; said on Thursday that the IAEA's decision was "politically-motivated". 

Ali-Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, said his nation will not stop uranium enrichment activities and that suspended programs are not part of Iran's nuclear enrichment program and the sanctions will have no effect on it. 

He stated "The enrichment program has been indigenous and independent, nobody, even the IAEA, have co-operated or worked with us. Therefore these projects will continue as planned under the supervision of the IAEA." 

Soltanieh declared that the action had been dictated by the U.N. Security Council, and that this was an illegal act undermining the IAEA's professional independence.

IAEA board members joined in supporting IAEA's Director General &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt; call for a "double suspension" where both enrichment and sanctions would stop concurrently.

Only North Korea and Saddam Hussein's Iraq have been stripped of nuclear aid because of fear of weapons development.

The first murderer in 150 years on Australia's Norfolk Island, Glenn McNeill, has been found guilty of killing restaurant owner Janelle Patton in 2002 on Easter Sunday.

A 29-year-old New Zealand chef, Glenn McNeill was found guilty of murdering Australian Janelle Patton after the jury of 11 deliberated for two days, then delivered their guilty verdict, which either had to be unanimous, or no charges as manslaughter was not an option.

In the five week Supreme Court trial, evidence was given that said that 29-year-old Ms Patton had been abducted, then bashed, then stabbed, and then hacked to death. She sustained 64 different injuries in the prolonged attack. It was also said that the attack had sexual motives.

Outside the court room, around 11 residents of Norfolk Island cheered as it was announced that Mr McNeill had been found guilty. The forewoman of five-woman, seven-man jury, said, "We find the accused guilty of murder," which didn't result in any change by Mr McNeill.

When first being interviewed by New Zealand police in Nelson for two hours, Mr McNeill admitted to the murder by running Ms.Patton over and stabbing her under the influence of cannabis. He then later retracted that in an unsigned court statement, stating mental health problems. "I did not murder Janelle Patton."

Her body was found wrapped partially in plastic wrap at a picnic/nature reserve, with her underpants pulled down.

Her underpants being pulled down was used in Mr McNeill's defence saying that the attack was done by a woman, and the underwear was to try and throw the police off the correct path.

Mr McNeill will be sentenced at a later date.

An appeal is being considered, with Mr McNeill's lawyer stating significant grounds.

&lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACisco"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; have announced the development of a new platform, based on &lt;a href="w%3AEclipse%20%28software%29"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOSGi"&gt;OSGi&lt;/a&gt; (Open Services Gateway initiative), which should unite all communication and collaboration software developers under a single platform.

Before the UC2 (Unified Communication and Collaboration) the unified communication has suffered because of a lack of a platform to be used by all software developers, rather than a series of them and, moreover, provided by different vendors. According to Adam Gartenberg from IBM &lt;a href="w%3A%20Lotus%20Software"&gt;Lotus Software&lt;/a&gt; Group this was the main cause for this partial stagnation.

However, the UC2 is meant to ease the work of software developers. Gartenberg stated that this platform is very flexible and will certainly draw much attention form programmers. They will be able to create different plug-ins and small applications to remotely control other, major application. 

The companies have also unveiled a series of their other joint projects. These project will be based on a set of application programming interface from Lotus (SameTime) and Cisco.

The add-ons planned are integration of a series of additional functions and features into the SameTime software from Lotus. Thus, in a few months, the SameTime users will benefit from such functions as click-to-call and voicemail. This will enable easier instant messaging inside the Cisco's Unified IP phones' system.

The fact that the platform will be based on Eclipse will make the numerous developers create many communications services, mainly for remote users to benefit from a series of new functions of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Enterprise%20resource%20planning"&gt;ERP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACustomer%20relationship%20management"&gt;CRM&lt;/a&gt; applications.

&lt;a href="w%3ANortel%20Networks"&gt;Nortel Networks&lt;/a&gt; - a partner of &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; since last year and Cisco's rival in the area - didn't have much success in the communication services field.

As for &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, the experts are waiting for the reaction of the &lt;a href="Bill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;' company on the ideas and offers made by IBM and Cisco for enterprise communications and collaboration solutions.

The Pittsburgh Penguins, after three shootout victories from Sidney Crosby, were finally dealt a loss, Thursday night. The Penguins had a hard time against the Devils as, once again, the Devils brought their best and the Penguins simply fell short. In the first period, the Penguins took a 1-0 lead off an Evgeni Malkin Power Play goal, with Mark Recchi and Sidney Crosby assisting. It wasn't until the second period that the Devils really turned up the heat, scoring two unanswered goals by Andy Greene on the power play, his first in the NHL, and Sergei Brylin's goal, with Patrik Elias, Brian Rafalski, John Oduya and Scott Gomez assisting. In the final period, the Penguins rallied back to tie the game after Sergei Gonchar scored a goal on the power play, with Jordan Staal picking up the assist. But Marc-Andre Fleury let another puck past, and the Devils took the lead. Late in the third, on a great individual play, Evgeni Malkin picked off the puck in the Devils zone and set up Michel Ouellet for a beautiful goal to tie the game once again and send it in to overtime. After a stalemate in the overtime period, Patrik Elias (the only shooter to score) would win the game for Devils in a hard fought game. The Penguins managed to pick up a point against the Atlantic Division leading Devils. Both teams will have Friday off before the Penguins battle the Rangers and the Devils face the Sabres on Saturday.

<h3>Quinn shows off for NFL Scouts</h3>

Former &lt;a href="w%3ANotre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ABrady%20Quinn"&gt;Brady Quinn&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; scouts an up-close view of what he did at Notre Dame and hopes to do in the NFL, the Associated Press reported. Quinn threw 63 passes, completing 58 of them. &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Vikings"&gt;Vikings&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Childress"&gt;Brad Childress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Browns"&gt;Browns&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href="w%3ARomeo%20Crennel"&gt;Romeo Crennel&lt;/a&gt; were both impressed with Quinn's performance. Quinn could have been 62 out of 63 but the receivers could not catch a few of the passes. Quinn will show NFL scouts his speed at Notre Dame's next pro day.

<h3>Australian Muslim organization gags five clerics</h3>
The &lt;a href="w%3ALebanese%20Muslim%20Association"&gt;Lebanese Muslim Association&lt;/a&gt; has sent a letter to five &lt;a href="w%3AImam"&gt;imams&lt;/a&gt;, telling them to "pause and desist" from talking to &lt;a href="w%3AMedia"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;. The reason cited in the letter was the "immeasurable damage" the imams have caused the Australian Muslim community. If they do not comply, the imams could lose their status as spiritual leaders, the LMA letter threatened.

&lt;a href="w%3ATaj%20El-Din%20Hilaly"&gt;Sheikh Al Hilali&lt;/a&gt; was the first to flout the ban. "I'm friends with media. Media is our eyes, our heart, our blood. No worries," he said.

<h1>EU adopts renewable energy measures</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=EU%20adopts%20renewable%20energy%20measures&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; leaders on the second day of their &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20summit"&gt;summit&lt;/a&gt; have agreed on measures to decrease &lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse%20gas"&gt;emission of greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; and to start using more &lt;a href="w%3ABiofuel"&gt;biological fuels&lt;/a&gt;. The governments of the 27 countries in &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; endorsed 3 main binding targets:

<ul>
BULLET::::- to reduce greenhouse gas emission levels by the year 2020 by 20% compared to the level of 1990
BULLET::::- renewable energy should make up 20% of energy consumption by 2020
BULLET::::- a 10% share for biofuels in the total consumption of fuels in E.U. transport.

</ul>
This way, the E.U. wants to contribute in reaching the strategic goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The individual targets for countries will need to be established based on national starting points and potentials, according to the plan. The plans don't mention an enforcement mechanism yet.
In the summit's conclusions, the E.U. underlines its ambitions as a leading force in international climate protection. German Chancellor &lt;a href="Angela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; called the targets "ambitious and credible". 

Europe is prepared to even increase the objectives if other developed countries follow suit, and it invites other countries to come forward with their plans for the environment beyond 2012, when the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20protocol"&gt;Kyoto protocol&lt;/a&gt; ends. In June, Merkel plans to discuss the measures with the other members on the &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;Group of Eight&lt;/a&gt; summit.

The proposal takes into account the sovereignty of individual countries to determine exactly which energy sources they use. More specifically, each member state should decide if they wish to use &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20power"&gt;nuclear power&lt;/a&gt; or not. Some countries oppose the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to &lt;a href="w%3Afossil%20fuel"&gt;fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; is even in the process of dismantling its nuclear energy production. &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; on the other hand produces 70% of its electricity in nuclear power plants. [13% of France's total energy consumption is nuclear.] The report also stresses the importance of nuclear safety in the discussion over nuclear energy.

The summit also asked the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; to come up with proposals to reduce energy consumption in lighting and offices by 2008 and 2009. The idea is to replace conventional &lt;a href="w%3AIncandescent%20light%20bulb"&gt;light bulbs&lt;/a&gt; with more energy-efficient alternatives such as the &lt;a href="w%3ACompact%20fluorescent%20lamp"&gt;energy saving light bulb&lt;/a&gt;.

Another energy-related topic in the conclusions is an agreement on increased security of energy supply. Through member state solidarity and a more interconnected and integrated market, eastern European countries hope to secure their energy supplies in case &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; would cut the supply.

During their two-days summit, the E.U. also discussed economic growth, employment, better regulations and international relations issues.

&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; has suspended the country's top judge, Chief Justice &lt;a href="w%3AIftikhar%20Muhammad%20Chaudhry"&gt;Iftikhar Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt; under section 209 of the constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan for "misuse of authority", the country's information minister Mohammed Ali Durrani has announced. Justice &lt;a href="w%3AJaved%20Iqbal"&gt;Javed Iqbal&lt;/a&gt;, the next in line has been sworn in as acting Chief Justice.

In a public statement issued on national television, Mr. Durrani said that the chief justice is being investigated and the exact details of charges will be made public once the initial investigation is complete.

Chaudry was controversial for taking up investigations into the highly sensitive issue of the disappearance of political activists allegedly detained illegally by the security forces.

Former justice of the supreme court Justice &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Qayyum"&gt;Abdul Qayyum&lt;/a&gt; expressing his shock to the entire situation said, ""He (Chaudhry) was an upright person, and the action against him has surprised me," said Abdul Qayyum, who now works as a lawyer.

The &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20Department"&gt;United States Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; has concluded an inquest into the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;'s use of the &lt;a href="w%3APatriot%20Act"&gt;Patriot Act&lt;/a&gt; saying that the FBI had been, in some cases, misusing the Patriot Act, sometimes illegally. 
Such misuses include ordering the handover of personal information without just cause and looking at the telephone records of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; during the period of a non-emergency, Inspector General Glenn A. Fine's 126 page report said. 

The FBI sent National Security Letters or "NSLs" to Americans asking for personal information, without getting a warrant or court order, but the FBI failed to report at least 22% of letters that were sent out. 

As many as 56,000 requests per year for personal information on people have been made since 2001 when the Patriot Act was signed.

"We believe the improper or illegal uses we found involve serious misuses of national security letter authorities", said the inquest.

&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Mueller"&gt;Robert Mueller&lt;/a&gt; the director of the FBI, says that he is responsible for not taking better measures to prevent the violations.

"I am to be held accountable. The inspector general went and did the audit that I should have put in place many years ago. While we've already taken some steps to address these shortcomings. I am ordering additional corrective measures to be taken immediately," said Mueller who also stated that he has no plans to hand in his resignation.

Mueller also said that 90% of the letters sent out were used in an attempt to track down terrorists who were located in different countries around the world.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; District Judge &lt;a href="w%3AClaude%20M.%20Hilton"&gt;Claude Hilton&lt;/a&gt; ruled Friday to grant a request for a permanent &lt;a href="w%3Ainjunction"&gt;injunction&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="w%3AVonage"&gt;Vonage&lt;/a&gt; for violating patented intellectual property rights of &lt;a href="w%3AVerizon"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;.

The injunction would not take effect until after a hearing scheduled for April 6. The court will rule on whether the request by Vonage to stay the decision has sufficient merit during the time it would take for the largest U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AVoIP"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt; provider to appeal the March 8 jury finding that the company violated what it maintains are Verizon innovations too broadly defined to be patentable. 

"Despite this obvious attempt by Verizon to cripple Vonage, the litigation will not stop Vonage from continuing to provide quality VoIP service to our millions of customers," said Mike Snyder, the Vonage chief executive officer.

The March 8 jury findings dismissed Vonage of wrong-doing on 4 of Verizon's 7 claims that Vonage infringed on its patent rights.

Verizon noted as part of its complaint against Vonage that, "Vonage's expanded marketing and advertising of its infringing services threaten to shift more customers and goodwill to its business at Verizon's expense," according to Olga Kharif of ♡❤CIO Today♡❤.

Vonage says it did not know it was infringing on patents rights of the 3 Verizon claims that held up in court. The effect of an injunction on the 2.2 million Vonage customers using the services would mean:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. an inability to place Internet calls to traditional phone line services
BULLET::::2. the elimination of voice mail and call waiting
BULLET::::3. the lack of wireless to Internet phone calls

On Thursday March 8, 2007 the government of the Southern &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; part of &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; used heavy machinery to allow its military to tear down the five-meter high concrete wall on the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Line%20%28Cyprus%29"&gt;Green Line&lt;/a&gt; that divides the island.

The wall has stood in the Cyprus capital of Nicosia for more than 40 years. It has been a constant reminder of the political situation of the Mediterranean island (given independence from &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; in 1960) that has suffered divisions since communal violence in 1963 that was only prevented by establishing a &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Peacekeeping Force there in 1964. These divisions only deepened when Cyprus was &lt;a href="w%3ATurkish%20invasion%20of%20Cyprus"&gt;invaded by Turkey’s military&lt;/a&gt; in mid-July 1974 after right-wing Greek Cypriots (backed by the military junta ruling Greece at the time) attempted a coup with the intent of joining the island to Greece. The result was a split between the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government in the south and the &lt;a href="w%3ATurkish%20Republic%20of%20Northern%20Cyprus"&gt;Turkish Cypriot north&lt;/a&gt; (only recognized by &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;). The division at Nicosia has become a curiosity to tourists who look over it to see the buffer zone between the two factions (a no man’s land with abandoned homes and businesses where no civilians are allowed). The destruction of the wall also brought out curious Cypriots.

Much international pressure had been brought to bear on both sides, and thawing of the relationship between the opposing Cypriots began in 2003 when the Turkish side eased restrictions on travel. Still in 2004 before joining the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;E.U.&lt;/a&gt;, Greek Cypriots rejected the UN reunification plan that called for a federation of two states. Then in December 2005 when the Turkish Cypriots created a footbridge for Turkey’s soldiers on the other side, the action drew protests from the Greek Cypriots voicing their security concerns. In January 2007 the Turkish Cypriots began dismantling the footbridge as a gesture of good faith.
At first both Cypriot governments expressed hope of reunification when asked about the demolition. &lt;a href="w%3ATassos%20Papadopoulos"&gt;Tassos Papadopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, the president in the Greek south stated "Tonight we have demolished the checkpoint on our side.” He went on to call for the Turkish Cypriots to act, saying civilians will not be able to cross “if the troops are not withdrawn”. Rasit Pertev, chief adviser to &lt;a href="w%3AMehmet%20Ali%20Talat"&gt;Mehmet Ali Talat&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Turkish Cyprus said: "This is extremely symbolic... The dynamism created by this move will lead to the opening of the crossing." Still when the government of Turkey dismissed the move as merely a result of international pressure that did not signify anything, and refused to dismiss its troops in the area (it maintains 40,000 soldiers on the island), sheets of aluminum were put up as a barricade on the Greek Cypriot side early on the morning of March 9, 2007.

The crying woman told a constable the plant theft was the fourth from her property in four years.
"I have had three marijuana plants stolen. They were in buckets," a police communications officer was told, "I am a good person. I am sick of these low-lifes stealing my things."

Senior Sergeant Mal Lochrie said that the officer found it hard to stop smiling as the woman gave details of the theft over the phone.

The woman has now been warned that her cannabis plantation could have legal consequences. However, Snr. Sgt. Lochrie said no legal action would be taken against her.

An outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3AMethicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus"&gt;methicillin-resistant ♡❤Staphylococcus aureus♡❤&lt;/a&gt; (MRSA) in a wing of the &lt;a href="w%3AWomen%27s%20College%20Hospital"&gt;Women's College Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in the temporary closure of the hospital's High Risk Perinatal Service in the Neo-natal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

The NICU, operated by the &lt;a href="w%3ASunnybrook%20Health%20Sciences%20Centre"&gt;Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre&lt;/a&gt;, will not accept direct newborn admissions or maternal transfers, temporarily, until the outbreak is controlled. Current patients are being cared for in the NICU and Sunnybrook has created a separate area to accommodate new babies.

The closure of the NICU at Women's College Hospital is expected to put a strain on availability of high-risk neo-natal services in &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. According to Sunnybrook, the NICU cares for one in five of all babies born in Ontario weighing less than three pounds. 

Head of Sunnybrook's department of newborn and developmental pediatrics, Dr. Michael Dunn, suggests that some patients of the NICU will need to be transferred to other facilities to allow for intensive cleaning of the area.

In a CBC interview, Dunn explains that, "all the babies who developed infections have been successfully treated, but we were not able to completely prevent the spread of the organism from one baby to another."

New patients will have to be diverted to other facilities in the province of Ontario or even out of country. &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20State"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20states"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; may be a potential destination for some women in Ontario with high-risk pregnancies or premature babies.

According to a Sunnybrook press release, the High Risk Perinatal Service will remain closed until there are no new transmissions of the &lt;a href="w%3AStaphylococcus%20aureus"&gt;♡❤Staphylococcus aureus♡❤&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABacterium"&gt;bacterium&lt;/a&gt;. It further explains that outbreaks in the NICU are rare and that several measures have been put in place to keep the bacterium from spreading. The hospital has isolated babies who have symptoms and are ensuring that a specific team of clinicians only treat the affected babies.

The Sunnybrook press release suggests that, although MRSA bacteria are commonly found on the skin of newborns, the organism that has surfaced in the NICU has caused a variety of infections to the skin and eyes of the babies. The babies in the NICU are, apparently, responding to &lt;a href="w%3AAntibiotic"&gt;antibiotic&lt;/a&gt; treatment.

He is a hispanic/black male, 3'06" - 4'00", and 60-70 lbs. He has short black hair and brown eyes, and was last seen wearing a blue or green long sleeve shirt with a white T-shirt underneath and long black pants. He also was wearing white tennis shoes with a blue stripe on the side with a velcro closure on top.

Police say neighbors spotted a white car driving slowly in the area, but they are not sure if the car has anything to do with Christopher's disappearance.

If you know anything about this you are asked to call the Glynn County police at 912-554-7803 or First Coast Crime Stoppers at 1-866-845-TIPS (1-866-845-8477). There is a $27,000 reward for the return of the missing boy.

<h1>Eritrean minister warns of war over Ugandan troops in Somalia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Eritrean%20minister%20warns%20of%20war%20over%20Ugandan%20troops%20in%20Somalia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The government of &lt;a href="Eritrea"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt; warned of "dire consequences" unless &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; removes its troops from the &lt;a href="w%3A%20African%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; (AU) peacekeeping force deployed to &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;. 

Ali Abdu, Eritrea’s information minister stated, "We believe the government of Uganda must rectify its error and pull out from Somalia, otherwise the situation will become increasingly dangerous. It will not only worsen, but will become a war between the Somali people and external forces. That will have dire consequences for the whole region."

Uganda has already sent 1,000 of a planned 1,500 troops under AU auspices to the area. The AU plans to send 8,000 multinational troops in total, and has recently vowed to continue their deployment despite attacks on its first deployed forces and threats of an Islamist commander. The &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Courts"&gt;Islamic Courts&lt;/a&gt; Movement has also threatened to wage jihad against the peacekeeping forces.

Reacting to the comments, Paddy Ankunda, a spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Uganda%20People%27s%20Defence%20Force"&gt;Uganda Peoples Defense Force&lt;/a&gt; (UPDF) said, "Eritrea has no right to demand that we withdraw. Unless they are claiming they are not part of the African Union. We received a mandate, not only from the AU but also from the UN."

The UPDF forces have been attacked since arriving at Mogadishu on March 6. They came under mortar fire at the airport during a hand-over ceremony. Over this week, two UPDF troops were wounded in an ambush and a landmine was discovered on the road leading to the airport. Two UPDF soldiers were also wounded by shrapnel in the attack and were flown back to Uganda. The AU is still investigating the incident.

Another mortar attack that missed a UPDF convoy and hit a nearby restaurant on March 7 killed 13 civilians and wounded 20. 

The UPDF attributed the loss of one of its planes, which burst into flames while landing, to a technical problem and not the result of an insurgent attack. 

Eritrea also took the opportunity to condemn its rival &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; that helped install the &lt;a href="w%3ATransitional%20Federal%20Government"&gt;provisional government of Somalia&lt;/a&gt;. Eritrea claimed that Ethiopia (whom it has a border conflict with) is seeking to carve up the country and was acting as a puppet of the United States. 

In the past the United Nations has accused Eritrea of providing arms and equipment to the Islamists.

<h1>Taliban claim responsibility for kidnapping of Italian journalist</h1>

&lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; forces have claimed responsibility for the March 5 kidnapping of &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; Daniele Mastrogiacomo. Mr. Mastrogiacomo, who works as a journalist and reporter for the Italian daily ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Repubblica"&gt;La Repubblica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, was reported missing by the paper three days before the Taliban claimed they had taken him hostage. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQari%20Yousef%20Ahmadi"&gt;Qari Yousef Ahmadi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who claims he speaks for the Taliban, has told the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20press"&gt;Associated press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that they "Are investigating whether they are British spies". Mr. Ahmadi has also said that the milita had captured a man claiming to be a Briton who worked for ♡❤La Repubblica♡❤. Ahmadi then claimed "The man we arrested is an Italian and he told us he worked for the Rome-based La Repubblica newspaper," and when asked to identify the man Ahamdi responded with a text message which said "Danikel"

The Italian ambassador in Kabul has asked for proof that Mr. Mastrogiacomo is still alive before any negotiations can get underway. Mastrogriacomo, who is a father of two, was on assignment in the former Taliban stronghold of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and had not been heard from since Sunday. The Italian journalist was kidnapped along with two &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghan's&lt;/a&gt;, who Ahmadi has identified as Sayed Agha and Ajmal, with only one name given for the latter. Afghan officials have claimed they have no knowledge of the kidnappings.

♡❤La Repubblica♡❤ newspaper said that Mastrogiacomo, 52, was born in &lt;a href="Karachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, where his father worked as an engineer for an Italian company. He has dual Swiss-Italian citizenship, but only was carrying his Italian passport with him. Mr. Mastrogiacomo, who speaks English, has worked in the middle east in Afghanistan, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, Gaza, &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; since 2002 as a staff correspondent.

Executive director Joel Simon of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20to%20Protect%20Journalists"&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CPJ) has stated it was "greatly concerned about the welfare of our coleaugue Daniele Mastrogiamoco, who was doing his job documenting the news," and continued "We call on those holding any members of the press to release them unharmed immediately."

This kidnapping comes four months after the release of fellow Italian photographer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGabriele%20Torsello"&gt;Gabriele Torsello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Torsello was kidnapped on October 12th of last year while travelling by bus from Lashkar Gah to Kandahar. When the man was released on November 3rd, he said he had no idea who had kidnapped him.

<h1>United force replay against 'Boro in FA Cup</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=United%20force%20replay%20against%20%27Boro%20in%20FA%20Cup&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A penalty by Christiano Ronaldo midway through the second half kept Manchester United in the FA Cup earlier today at The Riverside. United, who have their eye on three trophies this year, were forced to scramble back for the draw against Middlesbrough, who have been forced into replays in all three previous rounds, with two going all the way to penalties. United were the strong favourites for the match, and sent Wayne Rooney and Henrik Larsson up front as strike partners, with Ronaldo supporting from midfield. 'Boro also fielded a strong attacking side, with Yakubu and Mark Viduka leading the way. United was forced into a keeper change before the match, as Edwin Van Der Sar had a calf injury and was replaced by Tomasz Kuszczak.

Middlesbrough had the first of the chances in the game through Stuart Dowing after he received a pass from Julio Arca and was able to run in alone at Kuszczak. The keeper positioned himself well however, and he deflected Downing's shot out for a corner. United soon was in control of the game, and their first chance came when Larsson passed in a ball to Rooney, but the young Englishmans shot flashed wide. Rooney would not miss on his next chance though, as he received a pass from Giggs and slotted the ball past Mark Schwarzer from outside the penalty area. Kuszczak was then called on again to keep United in the lead when Yakuba did well to turn defender Rio Ferdinand, and released a shot at the net, but Kuszczak dove to make the save. Manchester's skipper Gary Neville then provided Ryan Giggs with a long cross into the box, but the Welshman's one-time volley clipped off the opposite post and stayed out of the net. Middlesbrough made United pay for their missed chance before the break, and the 18 year old Lee Cattermole was the goal scorer. Kuszczak made an error of coming out to catch the ball, and he became mixed up with Ferdinand, who headed clear instead. The ball went to Arca however, and the Argentine headed the ball to Cattermole, who controlled, spun, and volleyed neatly past the sprawling Polish keeper, tying the match.

Middlesbrough would start the second half the same way they ended the first; with a goal. Cattermole earned a corner off Heinze, and Downing curled the free kick deep, where skipper George Boateng was waiting to head the ball easily past Kuszczak. The goal was the first for Boateng in all competitions this season. Being a goal down was a shock to United, who have rarely fallen behind after leading this season, and they soon were on the attack. Henrik Larsson had the first of the chances, but his shot was blocked by Parnaby. A flick on by Ferdinand after a Giggs corner hit Boateng's hand, and the hero soon became the villain as referee Rob Styles rewarded a penalty to Manchester United. Christiano Ronaldo stepped up, and after a studder step slotted the ball past Schwarzer's right side, even though the German keeper went the right way. The game was tied yet again, and both teams pushed for the win, neither wanting a replay. Middlesbrough looked the most likely to score for much of the rest of the match as Viduka made space for Parnaby to shoot, but the ball was aimed right at Kuszczak who collected easily. 'Boro then introduced Jason Euell and Lee Dong-gook into the match in an attempt for the win, but the game ended in stalemate instead.

The replay will take place March 19 between the two at Old Trafford, which doesn't give either club much rest after their March 17 Premiership games, when United take on Bolton at home, and 'Boro will host Manchester City at the Riverside. Manchester also will be playing their European charity match beforehand, which takes place on the 13th.

&lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt; became the youngest player in &lt;a href="w%3ANHL"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt; history to score 100 points in two consecutive seasons, and the &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Rangers"&gt;New York Rangers&lt;/a&gt; in front of 17,132 at &lt;a href="w%3AMellon%20Arena"&gt;Mellon Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, Saturday. The Rangers did manage, however, to pick up a precious point, as they managed to send the game into overtime.

The only goal of the first period was scored by the Rangers' &lt;a href="w%3AKarel%20Rachunek"&gt;Karel Rachunek&lt;/a&gt;, his 6th of the season at 19:14. The goal was assisted by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Nylander"&gt;Michael Nylander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APetr%20Prucha"&gt;Petr Prucha&lt;/a&gt;. Rangers goalie &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Lundqvist"&gt;Henrik Lundqvist&lt;/a&gt; stopped all 7 shots faced in the first.

In the second period, Lundqvist continued where he had left off in the first, stopping another 7 shots, and blanking the Penguins for a second consecutive period. Just 1:11 into the period, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Matt%20Cullen"&gt;Matt Cullen&lt;/a&gt; scored his 13th of the season to increase the Rangers' lead to 2-0. Cullen's goal was assisted by &lt;a href="w%3AJed%20Ortmeyer"&gt;Jed Ortmeyer&lt;/a&gt;.

The third period over the past several games had been where the Penguins had amassed most of their offence. This game would prove no different, as rookie &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal at 3:32, his team leading 31st of the season. Malkin was assisted by &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Whitney"&gt;Ryan Whitney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Gonchar"&gt;Sergei Gonchar&lt;/a&gt;. Gonchar would pick up his second assist of the game less than 4:00 later, when on another Penguins power play, he and Malkin would set up Sidney Crosby for his record-setting goal to tie the game at 2-2. With the score locked up at the end of regulation, the game would go into overtime.

The Penguins, quite familiar with overtime, would end the game just 1:19 into overtime. With Sidney Crosby in the locker room due to an equipment problem, &lt;a href="w%3AColby%20Armstrong"&gt;Colby Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; scored against Lundqvist to lift the Penguins to victory. It was not a total loss for the Rangers, however, as they managed to pick up a point in the contest. The Penguins don't play again until Tuesday night, when the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Sabres"&gt;Buffalo Sabres&lt;/a&gt; travel to &lt;a href="w%3AMellon%20Arena"&gt;Mellon Arena&lt;/a&gt;. The Rangers return to the ice tomorrow at home against the Carolina Hurricanes.

With an affidavit filed by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Special Agent Peter Decensi, Russell Herman, the operator of www.asianadventures4u.com changed his plea to guilty at the last moment. The charges against Herman were that he arranged and facilitated travel for the purpose of illicit sexual conduct.

Originally Herman's website was investigated by Decensi for counterfeit goods labeled as "replica" merchandise, using such brand names as &lt;a href="w%3ARolex"&gt;Rolex&lt;/a&gt;. Various guided tours of &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; were also on offer at the website, either aimed at contacting the sources of counterfeit goods or "marriage agencies where you can marry a beautiful young Thai girl between 18- 24 years old regardless of your age."

From June to late October of 2006, posing under the screen name of "david77" and claiming to be from &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, Special Agent Decensi exchanged emails with Herman who was on his seventh trip to Thailand. Herman assured that he knew all the "pick up" spots where young girls could be found. When Decensi inquired about girls aged 10-14 years he was cautioned by Herman that it was dangerous and illegal in Thailand, explaining that the punishment in Thailand would be severe. However, Herman went on to explain that he knew where to find what Decensi was looking for, and gave a cell phone number to call upon his arrival in Bangkok.

Instead of flying to Thailand, Agent Decensi passed the online persona of "david77" onto Assistant Attaché Gary Kiernan in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; who phoned Herman. After declining an offer to go to Cambodia the two arranged to meet in Udon Thani. Offering to take Kiernan to brothels where girls of 15 were kept having been illegally brought into the country from &lt;a href="Laos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;. On a tour of a number of brothels Assistant Attaché Kiernan saw girls with ages ranging from 12 to 17.

Telling Herman that he must fly back to the U.S., Kiernan avoids anything more than his tour of brothels. Assuring Herman he will return when an urgent job has been done he establishes that Herman will return to the U.S. on December 12.

Initially filed in Herman's home town of Las Vegas the case was transferred to Cleveland where Herman was detained. At present he remains in custody pending sentencing. The charge, Facilitating Travel to Engage in Illicit Sexual Content carries a sentence of up to 30 years. According to the Bangkok Post he is likely to receive a sentence between four and five years.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMalta%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Malta Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; (MLP) wins this year's round of local elections, in which the turnout was 68 per cent, which could have been higher perhaps had it not rained all day yesterday. 

The Malta Labour Party wins an absolute majority of around 53 per cent and the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APartit%20Nazzjonalista"&gt;Partit Nazzjonalista&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (Nationalist Party) 43 per cent, with the rest of the votes going to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAlternattiva%20Demokratika"&gt;Alternattiva Demokratika&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (AD) and independent candidates. 

In 2004, the last time elections were held in the same localities, the MLP won 50.2 per cent of the vote, with the Nationalists securing 46.4 per cent and AD 1.5 per cent.

The elections held in one-third of Maltese localities, in 22 localities out of 69 localities. These localities are 16 in the island of Malta: Birgu (Città Vittoriosa), Qormi (Città Pinto), Siggiewi (Città Ferdinand), Attard, Birzebbugia, Floriana, Gharghur, Gzira, Hamrun, Luqa, Marsaxlokk, Mosta, Paola, Safi, Santa Lucija, Swieqi, and in 6 localities on the island of Gozo: Kercem, Munxar, Qala, San Lawrenz, Xaghra, and Zebbug (Gozo). The largest locality in this round is Mosta and the smallest locality is San Lawrenz.

According to the Maltese Ministry for Justice and Home Affairs, local council elections are held every three years, on the second Saturday of March.

"I will not seek your votes for a new mandate." With these words, the President of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; (74) announced during a radio and television broadcast at 20:00 UTC that it's time for him to serve his country in a different way.

The announcement was widely speculated about and did not come as a surprise. The official announcement gives the candidate from the majority party &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, more freedom during the next six weeks that remain before the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20presidential%20election%2C%202007"&gt;Presidential elections in France&lt;/a&gt;. Although Sarkozy is from the same party as Chirac and hopes to receive an endorsement from him, the President has not yet expressed his support for a particular candidate to succeed him, and he did not refer to Sarkozy during any moment of his speech.

In his 4 decades in French politics, Chirac has occupied several posts as Minister and was Prime Minister twice before being elected President in 1995, and being re-elected in 2002. Shortly after taking office, he acknowledged the role of France in the &lt;a href="w%3ADeportation"&gt;deportation&lt;/a&gt; of 75,000 &lt;a href="w%3AJew"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="World%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. After he called for new elections in 1997, he had to work with a Socialist Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ALionel%20Jospin"&gt;Lionel Jospin&lt;/a&gt; for 5 years. In 2001, France became the first country to declare &lt;a href="w%3ASlavery"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="w%3Acrime%20against%20humanity"&gt;crime against humanity&lt;/a&gt;, and Chirac decided May 10 would be a day to commemorate the abolition of slavery.

In 2003, Chirac threatened to veto a resolution in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N. Security Council&lt;/a&gt; that would approve of an invasion of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; overthrew &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; without support from the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. In 2005, Chirac couldn't convince the French to approve the &lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20establishing%20a%20Constitution%20for%20Europe"&gt;European Constitution&lt;/a&gt; in a referendum. At the end of that year, minority youths in France's suburbs &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;rioted&lt;/a&gt; for three weeks.

During his address, the President also discussed the democratic values of France, his role and responsibilities, Europe and the environment.

In the polls, Sarkozy has a slight benefit over &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal"&gt;Ségolène Royal&lt;/a&gt;, the candidate from the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20%28France%29"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Bayrou"&gt;François Bayrou&lt;/a&gt;, the candidate from the centrist party &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20French%20Democracy"&gt;UDF&lt;/a&gt;, has improved his positions in the polls during the last few weeks, coming up in third position by only a few points. If none of the candidates reach an absolute majority during the first round on April 22, a second round between the two candidates with the most votes will be organised. In the polls, at least 40% of voters have said they are yet undecided about their vote in the upcoming ballot.

Premiership title hopefuls Chelsea were forced to battle back for a draw earlier today at Stamford Bridge. Tottenham seemed to have a spot in the semifinals of the FA Cup all wrapped up before two late strikes from Lampard and Kalou ruined the day for Spurs. Chelsea were again without the heart of their defence, John Terry, and it showed for much of the game as Tottenham broke through the Blues lines far too easily on several occasions. Chelsea came out to win though, and nearly all their main stars were on the pitch to start the match, including Shevchenko, Ballack, Drogba, and Lampard. Martin Jol's Tottenham also fielded a strong attacking side, even without the use of the injured Robbie Keane. Defoe, Berbatov, and Lennon lead the way for Spurs instead, with Canadian Paul Stalteri and Englishman Michael Dawson on defence. Tottenham also had to use their backup keeper Radek Cerny, as their number one Paul Robinson is with Keane on the injured list.

Tottenham came out fast and hard, scoring after only 5 minutes. Jermain Defoe cut in from the left and attempted a pass to Hossam Ghaly, but Aaron Lennon pick up the ball instead and sent it in to the Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov. Chelsea keeper Petr Cech sprinted out in an attempt to block, but Berbatov spun and volleyed the ball high into the back of the net, giving the visitors the early lead. Tottenham pressed for a second, and two chances presented themselves to Defoe and Lennon, but the crossesfrom Berbatov and Defoe were out of the players reaches. Chelsea would strike back though, and the goal would be against the run of play. Ballack received a chested down ball from Shevchenko after a Drogba cross, and the German blasted the ball low and hard. The shot was off target, but Frank Lampard was able to react quickly enough to fling out his leg and deflect the ball into the back of the net. Tottenham continued to run at the shaky Chelsea defence, and were rewarded with a goal when Aaron Lennons seemingly harmless cross was knock into Chelsea's net by Michael Essien, who was attempting to cover back on defence. Tottenham then nearly gave Chelsea an own goal of their own as Michael Dawson knocked Arjen Robbens cross toward his own net, but Paul Stalteri raced back to clear off the line. After the near tying goal, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Mourinho"&gt;Jose Mourinho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; made an early change by replacing Paulo Ferreira with Shaun Wright-Phillips. Another defensive error would see Chelsea two behind soon after though, as Ghaly beat three defenders to a high ball, and slotted the ball past Cech from 12 yards out. Chelsea had a few more chances as they tried to grab a lifeline before the break, but nothing truly troubled keeper Cerny.

Chelsea came out of the dressing room much more positively after the break, and had 3 chances to score from 2 Ballack free kicks, and a well taken shot by Lampard. Cerny did well to keep the game at 3-1 however. Spurs nearly put the game away on the counter attack, but Cech came out quick to stop Aaron Lennons run, and Defoe could not find the net after the ensuing cross by Ghaly. Chelsea then made 2 changes in just over 5 minutes, as Boulahrouz and Kalou took to the pitch. On the 70th minute, Chelsea earned a corner, and Arjen Robben stepped up to take the set piece. A goulmouth scramble occurred from the curving corner and the ball landed nicely at Lampard's feet. The Enlgishman blasted it home, cutting the deficit to one. Chelsea equliazed 4 minutes from time through substitute Salomon Kalou. Didier Drogba headed the ball to his fellow countryman Kalou, and the Ivorian volleyed the ball into the back of the net. Jermain Defoe had a chance to be the hero for Tottenham only minutes later as he beat out three defenders and struck the ball hard past Cech, but not past the crossbar. The game ended drawn, and the replay will be held at White Hart Lane on March 19th.

Coach Marcello Lippi has recently added 7 new players to his European XI squad for the March 13th charity match against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Four stars from Italian Club AC Milan join the star studded lineup, along with a player from each of Valencia, Roma and Real Madrid. The players join other European stars such as Ronaldinho, Henrik Larsson, Juninho and Gregory Coupet.

<h2>Players</h2>

♡❤♡Paolo Maldini♡❤♡: &lt;br&gt;Current Club: AC Milan&lt;br&gt;Age: 38&lt;br&gt;A veteran of the Italian game, Maldini has been playing since 1985 for AC Milan. His awards list is long, and includes 7 Serie A trophies, 5 Italian Super Cups, and 4 Champions League medals.
♡❤♡Genaro Gattuso♡❤♡: &lt;br&gt;Current Club: AC Milan&lt;br&gt;Age: 29&lt;br&gt;The defensive midfielder was part of Italian World Cup winning team in 2006, and is sure to add both defensive and offensive elements to the play of the Europe XI.
♡❤♡Andrea Pirlo♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: AC Milan&lt;br&gt;Age: 27&lt;br&gt;Pirlo is regarded as one of the best midfielders in the Serie A. He is an accurate passer, and a skilled playmaker. He has won several trophies with Milan, as well as with the Italian national squad.
♡❤♡Ronaldo♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: AC Milan&lt;br&gt;Age: 30&lt;br&gt; The Brazilian born striker is the top scorer of all time in the FIFA World Cup, and has won the award twice with his country. He was signed in January by Milan from Real Madrid of the Spanish Primera League.
♡❤♡Mancini♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: AS Roma&lt;br&gt;Age: 27&lt;br&gt; Another Brazilian born player, Mancini is often overlooked for his national team. His latest contribution for Roma was a sensational goal against Lyon in the Champions League, which involved 5 quick stepovers, and a blasted shot into the top corner of the net to guarantee Roma a spot in the quarterfinals.
♡❤♡Íker Casillas♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Real Madrid&lt;br&gt;Age: 25&lt;br&gt; Casillas is currently the number one goal keeper for both Real Madrid and the Spanish National team. He has won both the Spanish League and the Champions League twice with Madrid in his 8 years with the club.
♡❤♡Miguel♡❤♡:&lt;br&gt;Current Club: Valencia&lt;br&gt;Age: 27&lt;br&gt; The Portuguese defender is a regular to his national team, and played in the 2006 FIFA World Cup for Portugal. He won the Portuguese Championship in 2005 with Benfica.

Coach Marcello Lippi will be checking on all the players fitness on Sunday night, and will announce the entire squad in Brussels, Belgium the next day. 70,000 tickets have already been sold for the match, setting a record for a non-competition match at Old Trafford. This means only 2,000 tickets remain for the game at the 76,000 seat stadium, as capacity has been set lower to accommodate two giant screens for pre-match entertainment. All proceeds to the match will go the Manchester United Fund, and will be used to help children all over the world.

The suspension, for a minimum of 25 games, is a ruling for a hit Simon laid on &lt;a href="w%3ARyan_Hollweg"&gt;Ryan Hollweg&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew_York_Rangers"&gt;New York Rangers&lt;/a&gt; during a March 8 game at &lt;a href="w%3ANassau_Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum"&gt;Nassau Veterans' Memorial Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;.

In a press release earlier today, the NHL indicated that they considered Simon's hit on Hollweg, with a stick to the face, to be a deliberate intent to injure. "The National Hockey League will not accept the use of a stick in the manner and fashion in which Mr. Simon used his Thursday night," said &lt;a href="w%3AColin_Campbell_%2528hockey%2529"&gt;Colin Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, NHL Senior Executive Vice President and Director of Hockey Operations.

The incident occurred at 13:29 of the third period. After receiving a hard check from Hollweg, Simon swung his stick and delivered a two-handed blow to Hollweg's upper body, causing a cut on Hollweg's chin. Simon was assessed a match penalty. 

Based on his $1-million contract, which expires at the conclusion of the 2006-07 season, Simon forfeits a minimum of $80,213.90. The money goes to the Players' Emergency Assistance Fund.

The suspension could carry over into the 2007-2008 hockey season, depending on how far the Islanders advance into the playoffs. According to the NHL press release, if the Islanders do not qualify for the 2007 playoffs, or play fewer than 10 playoff games in the 2007 playoffs, Simon would serve additional games at the start of the 2007-08 regular season to satisfy the minimum term of the suspension.

&lt;a href="w%3AGarth_snow"&gt;Garth Snow&lt;/a&gt;, General Manager of the Islanders, indicated his support for Simon in a brief press release. "I spoke with Colin Campbell this morning and he informed me of his decision. Chris Simon has played a major role in our success this season and we will miss his presence in our lineup. His regret is clearly evident in the statement he released last night. Our entire organization supports Chris every step of the way."

In a statement March 10, prior to the verdict, Simon expressed regret for his actions. "After watching the tape the morning after Thursday's game, I was disgusted. There is absolutely no place in hockey for what I did. I want to apologize to Ryan Hollweg. I was grateful to learn that Ryan is okay and that he returned to the game. My hope is to reach out to him in the near future."

Simon explains that his behavior may have been influenced by a hit he received less than a minute before his stick swinging incident. "I do not remember much about Thursday's incident. When I saw the tape on Friday morning, it explained a lot to me when I saw the look on my face after being hit into the boards. I was completely out of it."

Simon didn't appear to let it excuse his hit on Hollweg. "I need to make clear that this is not justification for the danger I put Ryan Hollweg in and the damage I have caused the game. I understand disciplinary action will be taken."

The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated_press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; indicated that criminal charges against Simon are being considered. According to a spokesperson for &lt;a href="w%3ANassau_County%252C_New_York"&gt;Nassau County&lt;/a&gt; District Attorney Kathleen Rice, "no decision has been reached" on bringing charges, but that "prosecutors would review the tape."

&lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; police broke up a prayer rally protesting government policy on Sunday, arresting over 100 people, including the leader of the opposition party &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20for%20Democratic%20Change"&gt;Movement for Democratic Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Morgan%20Tsvangirai"&gt;Morgan Tsvangirai&lt;/a&gt;. Zimbabwe police claimed that the prayer rally violated a government ban on political protests.

Riot police reinforcements cordoned off the area where the rally was to be held, and searched cars as they entered. As political leaders approached the area, they were reportedly pulled out of their cars and detained. Witnesses reported heavily armed military police forces surrounding the area of Highfields, the suburb where the rally was to be held. 

Police fatally shot one person, after being reportedly attacked by a large mob of protesters. A spokesman for one of the men arrested claimed that a lawyer was beaten and chased away from the Machipisa police station in Highfields, where the arrested people were being held. 

Opponents of President &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt; have blamed him for food shortages, repression of people's rights, and failing to control Zimbabwe's record inflation of over 1600%.

A spokesperson for &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; Secretary-General &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-Moon"&gt;Ban Ki-Moon&lt;/a&gt; said the Secretary-General condemned the reported beating of the leaders, and that he urged their release.

<h1>New Zealand's Prime Minister supports daylight savings extension</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%27s%20Prime%20Minister%20supports%20daylight%20savings%20extension&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Prime Minister of &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; has expressed an interest of extending &lt;a href="w%3Adaylight%20saving%20time"&gt;daylight saving time&lt;/a&gt; in New Zealand after a petition to extend daylight saving was closed, gathering 35,000 signatures.

The petition was launched by &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Dunne"&gt;Peter Dunne&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Future%20New%20Zealand"&gt;United Future&lt;/a&gt; party, and &lt;a href="w%3ANelson%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt; city councillor, Mark Holmes in October, 2006. The petition requests "...that the House call upon the Government to provide 3 extra weeks of daylight saving to begin on the last Sunday of September and end on the first Sunday in April."

Ms Clark says that daylight savings could be stretched at the end because our summer is now lasting through till March. Ms Clark does not support a change to the start of daylight savings. Ms Clark said, "I think the way our weather and seasons have moved around we are finding that at the start of the so-called summer it's not the best, but we've just seen the most glorious Indian summer lasting well through into March and daylight savings ends in about a week's time."

Ms Clark also says she supports moving the &lt;a href="w%3ASchool%20holiday"&gt;summer school holidays&lt;/a&gt; from January to February, although she says that this would be hard to do.

The Minister for the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Internal%20Affairs"&gt;Department of Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Barker"&gt;Rick Barker&lt;/a&gt;, is considering the extension of daylight savings, as an extension does not require any law change, instead it is done by &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20in%20Council"&gt;Order in Council&lt;/a&gt; signed by the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt;, acting under section 4(1) of the Time Act 1974.

Ms Clark claims that there is a lot of public support for the extension.

If any change was to occur, it would be implemented next year, as daylight savings finishes this coming weekend.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; have both recently extended their daylight savings periods.

&lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft’s&lt;/a&gt; officials admitted that the company’s &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Live%20OneCare"&gt;Windows Live OneCare&lt;/a&gt; security suite has been accidentally deleting e-mails of those users that worked with &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Outlook"&gt;Outlook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOutlook%20Express"&gt;Outlook Express&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft’s&lt;/a&gt; OneCare forum included postings that stated the cause of message deletion. Thus the issue occurred thanks to an &lt;a href="w%3Aantivirus"&gt;antivirus&lt;/a&gt; application that finds &lt;a href="w%3Ae-mail"&gt;e-mails&lt;/a&gt; containing viruses. The problem with the software was that the antivirus, instead of deleting or quarantining the hazardous e-mail, deleted all messages from the personal folder.

The forum, however, gave hope in a post saying that some messages might be recovered but only in case they were quarantined. Thus users are able to find those e-mails in OneCare’s quarantine facility.

The administrator of the forum, Stephen Boots, outlined that he was very unhappy with the issue which, he said, appeared over a year ago and the company thought it fixed the problem with the release of 1.5 version. Boots said that the beta version of the program worked fine but when the final version was launched the problem occurred once again. 

According to the statement, reported by the spokesperson of the software giant, Microsoft is now working to fix the problem and release an updated version of OneCare on &lt;a href="w%3AMarch%2013"&gt;March 13&lt;/a&gt;.

OneCare was criticized after it failed to pass an independent test of security products that provided a certain certification. In addition to this the program did not provide enough protection for &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Vista"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt; users.

The 65-team NCAA Tournament is highlighted by top seeds &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; (Midwest regional), &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; (East regional), &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State%20University"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt; (South regional), and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; (West regional). An opening round game between &lt;a href="w%3ANiagara%20University"&gt;Niagara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20A%26amp%3BM%20University"&gt;Florida A&amp;M&lt;/a&gt; will take place on Tuesday night, with the first round of the tournament being played out on Thursday and Friday.

A number of teams widely considered to be "on the bubble" were not selected and instead will join the 32-team NIT field, which begins play on Tuesday night, March 13. The top seeds for the NIT are &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi%20State%20University"&gt;Mississippi State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Virginia%20University"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Force%20Academy"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AClemson%20University"&gt;Clemson&lt;/a&gt;. Of the top seeds, West Virginia and Air Force had a chance at being selected for the NCAA tournament. However, when they were not selected, they were relegated to the NIT.

The championship for the NIT will take place on March 29, with the championship of the NCAA tournament and the right to be called the "National Champion" taking place on April 2.

A roadside bomb killed nine &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; police officers earlier today, including one local commander, and another was left critically wounded. The remotely-controlled bomb attack was made on a police convoy travelling in the Bakwa district of Farah.

The district commander of Bakwa was also killed in the attack. The area lies on a major heroin smuggling route to Iran. Ministry spokesman Zemerai Bashary said that said that one of the vehicles in the convoy was destroyed in the explosion.

Taliban leaders have previously told reporters that they intend to step up attacks during the spring season and coalition commanders have asked for more troops to meet the expected escalation in fighting.

Elsewhere in the same province on Sunday, a police post was attacked by &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; insurgents. The attack left two militants dead and one wounded.

In Helmand, coalition and Afghan troops led by the U.S. clashed with suspected Taliban Insurgents. The coalition was targeting an alleged anti-aircraft weapons trafficker. The battle happened earlier today in Gareshk district and left two militants dead. Two Afghan troops and one coalition soldier were lightly wounded.

A &lt;a href="w%3ACSX%20Transportation"&gt;CSX&lt;/a&gt; freight train traveling from &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ASelkirk%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Selkirk&lt;/a&gt; derailed in &lt;a href="w%3AOneida%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Oneida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. 

No injuries have yet been reported as a result of the accident. It is not yet known what caused the accident; CSX and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;NTSB&lt;/a&gt; officials are investigating.

Twenty six of the train's 79 cars derailed around 7:00 a.m. local time; the derailment led to the explosion of at least one &lt;a href="w%3Atank%20car"&gt;tank car&lt;/a&gt; carrying &lt;a href="w%3Apropane"&gt;propane&lt;/a&gt;. Two other cars are known to contain hazardous materials. As many as seven cars have been reported as burning. 

As a precaution, 23 miles (37 kilometers) of the adjacent &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20State%20Thruway"&gt;Thruway&lt;/a&gt; have been closed between Syracuse and Verona. Authorities have ordered a complete evacuation for a one-mile radius around the derailment site, including a jail and two elementary schools. &lt;a href="w%3AAmtrak"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEmpire%20Service%20%28Amtrak%29"&gt;Empire Service&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ between Albany and Syracuse is suspended and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Shore%20Limited"&gt;Lake Shore Limited&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ between Syracuse and Chicago is also affected; passengers on these routes are being bused around the affected area.

At the time of the accident the train had a two-man crew and was traversing a section of track that has a 60 mile per hour (MPH) speed limit. The train crew were not injured; it is not yet known what speed the train was traveling when the accident occurred.

The lead singer of Boston, &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Delp"&gt;Brad Delp&lt;/a&gt; was found dead in his house alone last Friday.

The Atkinson police have stated that there was no "foul play" involved, and the cause was still under investigation by the medical examiner.

After the death, the bands website went down and was replaced with the message: "We just lost the nicest guy in rock and roll."

Delp joined Boston in the ealry 70's after meeting with guitarist, songwriter and producer Tom Scholz. The group later signed with the Epic label.

Their first album, which was self titled, was a huge success. The album had hits on it such as "Long Time" and "More than a Feeling".

Delp left the band in 1991, and was replaced by Fran Cosmo. Delp rejoined the band later for the Walk On tour, and shared vocal duties with Cosmo. A new album with Delp singing was reported to have been in the making, but no release date was ever given.

24 of 26 &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; Cantons rejected the proposal for a single health insurance system, in which premiums would be based on income and wealth. The vote on Sunday was the latest in a series of attempts to cut rising costs and ease the financial burden on citizens.

Around 71% of voters rejected the reform. Turnout was at about 46%, slightly above the Swiss average.

As expected, voters in the main German-speaking part of the country turned down the planned reform, which was supported by the centre-left but opposed by the centre-right as well as the business community, parliament and the government.
Opposition in the French and Italian speaking regions was less pronounced. The cantons &lt;a href="w%3ACanton%20of%20Jura"&gt;Jura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACanton%20of%20Neuch%C3%A2tel"&gt;Neuchâtel&lt;/a&gt; in the French speaking regions voted in favor of the proposed reforms.

Health insurance premiums are higher in southern and western Swiss cantons than in German-speaking areas.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASwiss%20Interior%20Minister"&gt;Swiss Interior Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Couchepin"&gt;Pascal Couchepin&lt;/a&gt; said an important part of the Swiss Population appeared to be opposed to "a revolution" in health insurance but he said that he wanted current reforms currently under discussion in the Swiss Parliament to go ahead. He called on all sides, especially health insurers and the cantonal authorities, to make efforts to reduce spending on health insurance and aim for a greater cost efficiency. Currently Switzerland has 87 private insurers providing mandatory basic health care coverage for Swiss residents under a 1996 law. But costs have sky-rocketed. Over 100,000 people are not covered by health insurance due to non payment.

Opponents to the initiative argued that a single insurance system would lead to complacency and create a two-tier system, in which the wealthy would be the only ones available to afford to have additional private insurance coverage.

Supporters of the initiative said a single health insurer would increase the system's efficiency and allow for annual savings of at least 300 million Swiss Francs (about $245 million) in administrative costs. Currently, the funding system is unbalanced, since many clients on low incomes use state subsidies to pay their premiums, according to the Green Party and the Social Democrats.

The initiative to unite all the insurance companies and introduce premiums based on wealth and income was the most recent in a series of attempts over the past ten years to reduce the public spending on health care. A proposal, similar to this recent proposal, to modify the funding system of the health insurance companies was rejected by 73% of voters in 2003.

Switzerland has the most expensive health system in Europe. Switzerland's expenditure on health care was 11.6% in 2005, in front of &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; but behind the United States.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; says it is concerned for the safety of its correspondent in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;, Alan Johnston. The BBC said it had been unable to make contact with Johnston , however it did not make any comments on &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; reports that he had been kidnapped.

Johnston's car was found abandoned in Gaza City shortly after he left his office to drive home.

Jaime Razuri, a photographer working for Agence France-Presse (AFP), was kidnapped January 1, 2007 and released a week later. On October 24, 2006, the Spanish photographer Emilio Morenatt of the Associated Press (AP) was kidnapped by Palestinian gunmen and freed later that day.

In all, 14 journalists in all have been kidnapped in Gaza since 2004. Johnston, 44, has been the BBC's correspondent in Gaza for three years.

The BBC stated that:

Details of what happened are sketchy. Palestinian police said four gunmen were seen in the vicinity of where Johnston's car was found. Palestinian Interior Minister Sayeed Sayyam said Johnston's disappearance was a "criminal act". Palestinian security forces set up checkpoints around Gaza and were searching for Johnston.

One of the few Western correspondents still inside Gaza itself, Johnston has been described by the BBC as a

According to Paul Adams, now the BBC's diplomatic correspondent, himself a former Middle East reporter, said that:

Johnston was born in Tanzania and educated in Scotland. He joined the BBC in 1991 and has spent eight of the last 16 years as a correspondent, generally in the Middle East (in Nations such as Uzbekistan and Afghanistan). Johnston is on his last few weeks in Gaza.

A gas line at &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Lake Weatherford, Texas&lt;/a&gt; exploded Monday afternoon. No one was injured in the explosion, though several vehicles were completely destroyed in the explosion. Flames are reported to be at least a hundred feet into the air.

Workers were laying pipes near pipes that were already installed and running, when the explosion occurred. As many as 20 workers were working on the site of the explosion when flames broke out. The local fire department has not ascertained exactly how many people were at the scene.

At least 10 cars can be seen on fire near the site of the explosion and homes and businesses in North Parker County have no power due to the fire.

The United States Army's Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley resigned Monday due to the recent &lt;a href="w%3AWalter%20Reed%20Army%20Medical%20Center%20neglect%20scandal"&gt;Walter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal&lt;/a&gt;. Lt. Gen. Kiley is the third official to be stripped of command due to the scandal.

Although he officially resigned, Pentagon officials made it clear that he had been dismissed over the scandal that has outraged veterans’ groups and appalled America.

Lt. Gen. Kiley was heavily criticized for his actions at &lt;a href="w%3AWalter%20Reed%20Army%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Walter Reed Army Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, where the hospital was kept in very poor condition and its patients neglected.

<h1>UN report says Sudan government guilty of orchestrating Darfur crimes</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UN%20report%20says%20Sudan%20government%20guilty%20of%20orchestrating%20Darfur%20crimes&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A report from a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Human%20Rights%20Council"&gt;United Nations Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt; mission "concludes that the government of the &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; has manifestly failed to protect the population of &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; from large-scale international crimes, and has itself orchestrated and participated in these crimes." The mission urges the U.N. to take "urgent further action", for example by deploying the proposed U.N. and &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeping forces, and co-operating with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt;.

The report team, lead by &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; laureate &lt;a href="w%3AJody%20Williams"&gt;Jody Williams&lt;/a&gt;, further urges Sudan to stop targeting civilians. The report also says the government is allowing militias such as the &lt;a href="w%3AJanjaweed"&gt;Janjaweed&lt;/a&gt; to act with impunity, and that government forces are even operating jointly with the militia. The militias themselves and the armed rebel groups aren't spared either; they are accused of serious violations of human rights and international law.

During their month of work, the researchers didn't actually get into Sudan because they were not given visas, but they interviewed hundreds of relevant people (such as refugees), and reviewed thousands of pages from documents on the humanitarian situation in Darfur.
To summarise the situation, the 35-page documents says: "Today, millions are displaced, at least 200,000 are dead, and conflict and abuse are spilling over the border into &lt;a href="Chad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;." The report says that humanitarian and human rights workers are increasingly being targeted, especially during the past six months. "Killing of civilians remains widespread, ... Rape and sexual violence are widespread and systematic. Torture continues." The experts think the conflict could destabilise the region.

The mission advises the U.N. General Assembly to "request the compilation of a list of foreign companies that have an adverse impact on the situation of human rights in Darfur." The U.N. agencies should then cease to do business with these companies.

Sudanese officials declined to respond to the report immediately, saying that the response will be made in Sudan's address to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Tuesday. Just days ago, Sudanese President &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar Hassan al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt; rejected an interim U.N. plan to bolster African Union peacekeeping forces in Darfur. Up to 24,000 troops were to replace the current 7,000 African Union peacekeepers in the western Sudan region.

The almost 4-year-old Darfur conflict is being fought between the &lt;a href="w%3AJanjaweed"&gt;Janjaweed&lt;/a&gt; militia (Arabic for "devils on horseback"; they are camel-herding Arabs) and a group of mostly land-tilling tribes. The Sudanese government in the past denied allegations against them, blaming the rebels who didn't sign the peace treaty of 2006. The International Criminal Court in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hague"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt; has already summoned a junior minister of the Sudan, and a militia leader, to answer war crime charges. The government in &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt; refused to extradite anyone, saying the people responsible would be tried in the Sudan itself.

<h1>Russia: Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant to be delayed</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Russia%3A%20Iran%27s%20Bushehr%20nuclear%20power%20plant%20to%20be%20delayed&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Federal%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;Russia's Federal Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (RosAtom) further progress on &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20programme%20of%20Iran%23Bushehr"&gt;Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; has been working to complete, will be delayed because &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; fell behind in the payment schedule. 

The decision threatens to put Iran’s atomic project in jeopardy, just as it faces the threat of more &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; sanctions over its controversial nuclear program.

"The fact is that there is no money, and it is impossible to construct without money," RosAtom spokesman Sergei Novikov told &lt;a href="w%3AInterfax%20%28press%20agency%29"&gt;♡❤Interfax News Agency♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. Iran suspended payments on January 17 and "therefore, our Iranian partners should not be surprised by an extension of the deadline for the launch of the first unit at Bushehr," he said. 

Under an agreement reached last September, Russia was to deliver nuclear fuel to Bushehr in March and the power station would open in September and begin generating power in November.

When the payment delay was first reported in February &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Saeedi"&gt;Mohammad Saeedi&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy head of the &lt;a href="w%3AAtomic%20Energy%20Organization%20of%20Iran"&gt;Atomic Energy Organization of Iran&lt;/a&gt;, denied that Tehran had been late in making payments. "Iran has had no delay whatsoever in making payments for the Bushehr nuclear power plant," Mr. Saeedi was quoted as saying by &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Republic%20News%20Agency"&gt;♡❤Islamic Republic News Agency♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Novikov said the Iranians blamed the delay on the need to switch payments from &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20currency"&gt;dollars&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;euros&lt;/a&gt;.

The announcement from RosAtom came after talks between Russian and Iranian officials last week in Moscow failed to reach agreement on the dispute over funding.

In the wake of &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement that he will not seek re-election, &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; politicians have taken the opportunity to distance themselves from him.

&lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, the frontrunner to succeed Jacques Chirac, said that he "never felt like anybody's heir" and that "France is the republic, it is not something you inherit."

French &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20minister%20of%20France"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt;, who was also considered a potential candidate, has endorsed Sarkozy. Villepin and Sarkozy are members of the same party, but fell out years ago.
Meanwhile, right-wing leader &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Marie%20Le%20Pen"&gt;Jean-Marie Le Pen&lt;/a&gt; said Mr. Chirac left France in a 'catastrophic state.' "I think Jacques Chirac was the worst president of the republic in the history of France. With him I lose my worst enemy and I'm delighted," he said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Controversial%20blog%20relaunched%20in%20New%20Zealand&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A controversial &lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; that posts personal details about many workers at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Department%20of%20Child%2C%20Youth%20and%20Family%20Services"&gt;New Zealand's Child, Youth and Family Services (CYFS)&lt;/a&gt; has been relaunched after &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABlogger%20%28service%29"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; removed the site due to a death threat.

The controversial blog, named CYFSWATCH NEW ZEALAND posts personal stories about how CYFS workers have treated them and their family, and then posts personal details about those workers. It also is targeting the chief executive of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Ministry%20of%20Social%20Development"&gt;Ministry of Social Development&lt;/a&gt;. The recent relaunch sees 127 more CYFS workers' personal details being posted on the online blog.

The site is now hosted by a &lt;a href="w%3AMasterton"&gt;Masterton, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; man known as, "Kiwi 1960", Wikinews suggests that the man's first name is Peter. Russell Brown, media commentator, found out that "Kiwi 1960" was hosting the new site. 

"Kiwi 1960" could be charged with criminal offences, but says that he is not worried about it, stating that he is a "victim" of CYFS. However Ursula Cheer, associate professor at Canterbury University said that although the content could be described as defamatory, no criminal charges are likely as there is nothing stopping anyone from setting up Internet sites.

The death threat posted online that led to Blogger removing the blog, was aimed at being the first political assassination in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. It was made against Sue Bradford because of her publicly unsupported bill that would make smacking, or correcting, a child illegal.

Ms Bradford says that she is disappointed that the blog is now running again.

&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s Chief Justice &lt;a href="w%3AIftikhar%20Muhammad%20Chaudhry"&gt;Iftikhar Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt; arrived to court to appear in front of a panel of previously subordinate judges to answer charges filed against him by the President General &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;.

The Chief Justice's motorcade was surrounded by thousands of well wishers and lawyers who have come out on the streets of Pakistan's capital to express their solidarity as Pakistan observes a nation wide partial strike and black day.

In a brief statement to the press, the Chief Justice said, "I am appearing in front of junior judges who are under investigation for corruption."

The Chief Justice has been held incommunicado without access to the outside world since Friday when he was suddenly removed from his office by Pakistan's military government. Telephone, Internet, and mobile phone service has been suspended to his house which is under “high security” according to government officials.

Chief Justice Iftikhar is well respected by his colleagues and international community for taking a firm stand against government's human rights abuses and abductions.

New York based &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; has issued a statement demanding an immediate release and reinstatement of the Chief Justice Chaudhry Iftikhar. "By brazenly and unlawfully dismissing, detaining and humiliating the chief justice of the Supreme Court, President Musharraf has created a constitutional crisis at the judiciary’s expense," said Ali Dayan Hasan of Human Rights watch.

Ikram Chaudhry, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, told a British news service: "General Musharraf is trying to bulldoze the judiciary. He wants to leave no stone unturned."

Reporting yesterday's wide spread strike by the bar associations across Pakistan two major private news channels were forced to go off air for reporting and showing “anti-government” protests.

Tensions are high and the police and other security personnel have been placed on high alert. Military government's information minister has however categorically denied that the government is considering a declaration of emergency.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have won the first Group A match in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20cricket%20team"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; by a huge-margin of 203 runs in &lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Park%20Sporting%20Complex"&gt;Warner Park Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABasseterre"&gt;Basseterre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Kitts%20and%20Nevis"&gt;Saint Kitts and Nevis&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; developed a simulation system that provides real effects of battlefield. The simulation is called Virtual &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and it is now being put in practice by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Reading"&gt;University of Reading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Virtual Iraq represents a fully-immersive system created as part of a therapy that aims to help soldiers with &lt;a href="w%3Apost-traumatic%20stress%20disorder"&gt;post-traumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt; to handle their psychological issues. 

The Director of the Visualization Center at University of Reading, Professor Paul Sharkey, has been developing the system together with two professors from the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, Albert Rizzo and Jarrell Pair. They created a virtual room at the Visualization Center where patients can experience the effects of the battlefield.

Scientists will provide in their Virtual Iraq sounds, sights and smells of the battlefield so soldiers or military staff would experience real combat scenarios but in a low threat context. Thus the therapists are able to add to the virtual world &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aroadside%20bomb"&gt;roadside bombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the smell of burning rubber, as well as the sound of gunfire and buzzing of the helicopter. Till now four patients were treated and they all reported improvement in the symptoms. 

Scientists state that the aim of the new system is to re-expose patients to relevant traumatic events and not to re-traumatize them. They look forward to manage people’s emotional responses so to make them more flexible in everyday situations.

&lt;a href="w%3AViacom"&gt;Viacom&lt;/a&gt; has announced that they are suing &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, and its owner &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, for more than 1 billion dollars. The lawsuit was filed in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court"&gt;District Court&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York"&gt;Southern District of New York&lt;/a&gt;. Viacom claims that YouTube has near 160,000 of their videos on their website without their permission, which they say is a "massive intentional &lt;a href="w%3ACopyright%20infringement"&gt;copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt;."

Viacom had negotiations with YouTube for several months, which ended unsuccessfully. The lawsuit was filed after Viacom had asked YouTube to remove 100,000 videos that belonged to them in February. They also claim that YouTube has made profits by "advertising off of unlicensed content." Neither YouTube's nor Google's representatives have yet commented on the situation and lawsuit. Wikinews is one of the media outlets which has placed a request for comment.

A group of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; embassy workers kidnapped in northern &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; 12 days ago have been released, Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt; has said. The workers - four British citizens and one &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; citizen and Ethiopian staff working with them, had been held in &lt;a href="Eritrea"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt;, she announced on Tuesday.

The party were apparently on a sightseeing tour when they were abducted on 1 March. Beckett also said that all kidnapped were safe and well and were:

The group went missing on March 1 on a tourist trip to visit geological sites in the remote Afar region, in the country's north. Two vehicles belonging to the group were later found in a north-eastern village called Hamedali. The vehicles were found were riddled with bullets, but still contained luggage and mobile telephones. 

The region in which the Hamedali is, Afar, straddles the border of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Ethiopia's Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMeles%20Zenawi"&gt;Meles Zenawi&lt;/a&gt; had said on Monday that Ethiopian officials had a "good idea" of where the hostages were being held.

Zenawi announced that embassy staff had not been specifically targeted and suggested that the kidnapping might have been a "mistake". Hamedali is a staging post for tourists venturing into the unique geological formations of the &lt;a href="w%3ADanakil%20Depression"&gt;Danakil Depression&lt;/a&gt;, including the area's famous salt lakes. The area is one of the hottest and inhospitable lands on Earth. Visitors are warned by the government to travel in a convoy with armed guards because of rebels and bandits. Witnesses stated that around 50 men burst Hamedali and marched the foreigners towards the Eritrean border.

<h1>Sub-prime lenders send jitters through global markets</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sub-prime%20lenders%20send%20jitters%20through%20global%20markets&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Just two weeks after &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; sent global markets into a tumble, growing worries about sub-prime mortgage lenders in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; are sending jitters through stock exchanges around the globe. The three major US stock market indices each fell two percent from Monday's closing price, marking the second-biggest loss of 2007. London's &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100%20Index"&gt;FTSE 100&lt;/a&gt;, Paris' &lt;a href="w%3ACAC%2040"&gt;CAC 40&lt;/a&gt; and Frankfurt's &lt;a href="w%3ADAX"&gt;DAX 30&lt;/a&gt; indices each closed down more than 1 percent.

As the &lt;a href="w%3AMortgage%20Bankers%20Association"&gt;Mortgage Bankers Association&lt;/a&gt; reported that late payments on mortgages and home foreclosures in the US homes rose in the fourth quarter to their highest level in years, investors are concerned that not only US banks but also multi-national banks around the globe could have exposure.

More than two dozen sub-prime lenders have closed or sold operations as defaults on those mortgages have risen. "The delinquencies and defaults have started to soar," said Nicolas Retsinas, director of Housing Studies at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;. "A lot of these lenders started to make loans and lost track of some of the fundamentals." 

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Century"&gt;New Century Financial Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, the second largest sub-prime lender in the US, has recently revealed that its creditors were no longer providing funds and, further, it has become subject of an &lt;a href="w%3ASecurity%20Exchange%20Commission"&gt;SEC&lt;/a&gt; investigation. The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; has said it will delist New Century. &lt;a href="w%3AAccredited%20Home%20Loan%20Lending"&gt;Accredited Home Loan Lending&lt;/a&gt;, another major sub-prime mortgage specialist, said it was seeking fresh capital and waivers on its lending covenants.

Sub-prime lenders provide mortgages to people who do not qualify for loans from mainstream lenders, typically due to their credit histories. The lenders then bundle these mortgages as &lt;a href="w%3ACollateral%20%28finance%29"&gt;collateral&lt;/a&gt; for loans that they obtain from other financing firms, such as &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors%20Acceptance%20Corporation"&gt;GMAC&lt;/a&gt;. Such firms can then repackage these loans and sell them as &lt;a href="w%3AMortgage-backed%20security"&gt;mortgage-backed securities&lt;/a&gt;. These securities may end up in the hands of major &lt;a href="w%3AMultinational%20corporation"&gt;multi-national&lt;/a&gt; banks such as &lt;a href="w%3ACitibank"&gt;Citibank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHSBC"&gt;HSBC&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACommerzbank"&gt;Commerzbank&lt;/a&gt;. Each level of lending assumes a level of &lt;a href="w%3AFinancial%20risk"&gt;financial risk&lt;/a&gt;, but trouble can arise when the risk tolerances are exceeded. If too many homeowners default on their mortgages, the sub-prime lender can end up defaulting. If too many of these lenders default, as it is feared may be happening now, the defaults can cascade upward. While no one is predicting major bank failures at this point, it is feared that their profits could be hurt.

Pennsylvania governor &lt;a href="w%3A%20Ed%20Rendell"&gt;Ed Rendell&lt;/a&gt; announced Tuesday morning that a deal had been struck between state and local officials and the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Pittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; hockey franchise. The Penguins organization will formally announce the deal tonight, prior to the Penguins game against the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Buffalo%20Sabres"&gt;Buffalo Sabres&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Mellon%20Arena"&gt;Mellon Arena&lt;/a&gt;. The deal will ensure that the Penguins will remain in the city with a 30 year lease on a new arena to be built in downtown &lt;a href="w%3A%20Pittsburgh"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;. The framework of the deal was constructed in an emergency meeting last Thursday in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Philadelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, when both government and franchise officials indicated that progress had been made, with the details laid out over the weekend. With the new deal, the Penguins organization would be expected to pay $3.8 million per year, as well as $7.5 million per year from both &lt;a href="w%3A%20Don%20Barden"&gt;Don Barden&lt;/a&gt;, owner of &lt;a href="w%3A%20The%20Majestic%20Star%20Casino%2C%20LLC"&gt;Majestic Star Casino&lt;/a&gt;, and the state economic development fund. The Penguins organization has also been given the option of building a parking garage on property of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Pittsburgh%20Sports%20Authority"&gt;Pittsburgh Sports Authority&lt;/a&gt; between Centre and Fifth avenues, by contributing $500,000 per year.

The new arena is expected to cost approximately $290 million, and should be completed and ready to host hockey games by 2009. The Penguins will sign a temporary lease to keep the team at Mellon Arena until the new building is finished.
