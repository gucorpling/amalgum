Scientists say that the heat source producing the geysers is "organic" and that the material used to spew them is caused by the decaying of radioactive material from inside the moon.

"Deep inside Enceladus, our model indicates we've got an organic brew, a heat source and liquid water, all key ingredients for life. And while no one is claiming that we have found life by any means, we probably have evidence for a place that might be hospitable to life," said Dennis Matson, a scientist for the &lt;a href="w%3ACassini-Huygens"&gt;Cassini&lt;/a&gt; project.

In a new model created by NASA scientists, data shows that Enceladus might have been created by &lt;a href="w%3Aaluminum"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Airon"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; isotopes which have begun to decay causing large amounts of heat to build up in the moon and over billions of years later, the icy mass has began to melt near the moon's core, causing the water to spew into outer space.

"Enceladus is a very small body, and it's made almost entirely of ice and rock. The puzzle is how the moon developed a warm core. The only way to achieve such high temperatures at Enceladus is through the very rapid decay of some radioactive species," said Dr. Julie Castillo, the lead scientist developing the new model at the &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion laboratory&lt;/a&gt; or JPL.

"The decomposition of those isotopes - over a period of about 7 million years - would produce enormous amounts of heat. This would result in the consolidation of rocky material at the core surrounded by a shell of ice. According to the theory, the remaining, more slowly decaying radioactivity in the core could continue to warm and melt the moon's interior for billions of years, along with tidal forces from Saturn's gravitational tug," said a statement on NASA"s website.

Data from Cassini's ion and neutral mass spectrometer further shows that the natural building blocks of life are also present within Enceladus. The results show that &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aacetylene"&gt;acetylene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Amethane"&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Apropane"&gt;propane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Anitrogen"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt;, the basic building blocks for life, are all present within the moon.

"The team concludes that so far, all the findings and the hot start model indicate that a warm, organic-rich mixture was produced below the surface of Enceladus and might still be present today, making the moon a promising kitchen for the cooking of primordial soup," added the statement.

Cassini will make a flyby on Enceladus in march of 2008. The mission will "measure the gas emanating from the plume," ended the statement.

In a press release on February 22, 2007, Disney announced the expansion of its cruise line. Disney plans to add two new ships to its current fleet of two. This expansion is expected to more than double the cruise line's current passenger capacity. By expanding, Disney hopes to meet the increasing demand for its cruise line.

The two new ships are to be very similar to each other and will weigh about 120,000 tons. They are planned to be two decks taller than the two existing ships, the ♡❤Disney Magic♡❤ and the ♡❤Disney Wonder♡❤ and will have 1,250 staterooms. These two ships are scheduled for christening in 2011 and 2012.

In the press release, Disney President and CEO Bob Iger stated: "Since our maiden voyage in 1998, Disney Cruise Line has been a huge success for our guests and for our shareholders alike. It has brought our unparalleled family vacation experience to the high seas, and has also generated high margins and double digit returns on invested capital. We're excited to announce the expansion of our fleet, which is a logical next step in what is a real growth business for us."

Names have not yet been announced for the ships.

Clif Brown led the charge for &lt;a href="w%3ANiagara%20University"&gt;Niagara&lt;/a&gt;, scoring 32 points and shooting 6-11 from behind the arc in helping the Purple Eagles defeat the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20A%26amp%3BM%20University"&gt;Florida A&amp;M Rattlers&lt;/a&gt; 77-69 on Tuesday night.

Brown, despite playing the last four minutes in danger of fouling out, shot 10-18 from the field and picked up six rebounds to lead Niagara. Charron Fisher, leading scorer for the Eagles, contributed 13 points and 8 rebounds despite being in foul trouble for much of the second half.

The Rattlers, despite outshooting the Eagles percentage-wise 46 to 40, could not catch up to the Eagles, thanks in part to a team that went 7-18 from the free throw line. Niagara, by contrast, went 21-28 from the free throw line, and also hit four more 3-pointers than the Rattlers.

It was the first opening-round experience for Niagara, who advance to play the &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20Jayhawks"&gt;Kansas Jayhawks&lt;/a&gt; on Friday in Chicago. Florida A&amp;M had been to Dayton for the "play-in" game once before, when they defeated Lehigh in 2004.

The first round of the NCAA tournament begins on Thursday at eight regional sites, and continues on Friday at eight different sites. The second round of the tournament will be played out over the weekend, with the regional semifinals and finals next Thursday through Sunday.

The &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;n government has refused to remove &lt;a href="w%3Avalue%20added%20tax"&gt;value added tax&lt;/a&gt; (VAT) on the price of milk. The Namibian Dairy producers organization requested the Namibian directorate of local income in May 2006 to follow the example of &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and declare fresh milk as a basic need upon which no taxation is applicable. 

Mnr. Calle Schlettwein, permanent Secretary of the Namibia Ministry of Finance said the decision not to discard VAT on milk is because of two reasons: “This industry is already receiving advantages because of Article 26 of the &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20African%20Customs%20Union%20Southern"&gt;African Customs Union (SACU)&lt;/a&gt;,” he said. 

"Secondly, the ministry cannot decrease the country's tax basis. Namibia is a country that spend more than what it can collect through tax. We cannot afford to discard VAT on fresh milk."

The price of fresh milk is to climb by 50c in the beginning of April 2007 following increases in production costs to producers. The dairy industry has warned of a collapse of the industry and a dependence on foreign imports if prices are not increased to match rising production costs.

&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Justices%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;Chief Justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIftikhar%20Muhammad%20Chaudhry"&gt;Iftikhar Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt; was manhandled by capital police and the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Investigation%20Agency"&gt;Federal Investigation Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s personnel yesterday at his official residence in &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;, when he refused to ride in the police personnel vehicle and insisted on a civilian automobile.

The acting Chief Justice of Pakistan in an early morning statement confirming the incident said, "Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry is our responsibility and the persons will be taken to task who have misbehaved with him."

The Chief Justice of Pakistan was removed from his office last Friday in an extrajudicial move by Pakistan's President General &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; for charges of alleged misconduct and corruption which have yet to be disclosed to the public and to the defendant.

The Chief Justice has taken a strict stand against the government's &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; abuses and abductions.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; has issued a gag order and has asked all Pakistani electronic media to show restraint and caution in airing programs. The acting Chief Justice of Pakistan &lt;a href="w%3AJavaid%20Iqbal"&gt;Javaid Iqbal&lt;/a&gt; said, "the advice of the Supreme Judicial Council will be strictly enforced from today and no government official or media will be allowed to comment on it [the case]."

<h3>Eastern stock markets fall sharply</h3>

&lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Oceania"&gt;Oceanic&lt;/a&gt; stock markets fall after &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; sell-off. Global markets have grown concerned after sub-prime mortgage lenders in the U.S. have started to go out of business and fear that the defaults may spread.
The &lt;a href="w%3ANikkei%20225"&gt;Nikkei&lt;/a&gt; 225 fell 2.9%. Hong Kong shares dropped 2.6%. Austrialian stocks gave back 2%.

<h1>Study finds children from single-parent homes more likely to be sexually abused</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Study%20finds%20children%20from%20single-parent%20homes%20more%20likely%20to%20be%20sexually%20abused&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Children from single-parent homes are much more likely to be &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20sexual%20abuse"&gt;sexually abused&lt;/a&gt; - a study carried out at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Pennsylvania"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;'s School of Medicine suggests.

Previous studies have found that children being raised in single-parent homes are at greater health and other kinds of risks. The new study shows that these risks include higher risk of childhood sexual abuse. This especially concerns low-income one-parent households.

Dr. William C. Holmes, MD, MSCE, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania says that the problem involves psychological and emotional aspects. 

Сhildren from one-parent homes do need more communication with their moms or dads. However, the parents are often absent from the home, being busy working to provide their children with basic necessities. The children have to find someone who would be a parent-substitute with whom to communicate and to share experiences. Molesters take advantage of this situation and become friends to these emotionally-needy children. 

Holmes says that low-income single-parent households are at greater risk due to the type of childcare facilities available to children from such families. Unfortunately, these are not facilities with thorough oversight of who is a caregiver of a child.

According to Holmes, studies like this one suggest that there should be some interventions to help single parents and their children, for instance through funding of better childcare facilities.

<h1>Zimbabwean opposition leader in intensive care after arrest</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Zimbabwean%20opposition%20leader%20in%20intensive%20care%20after%20arrest&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AMorgan%20Tsvangirai"&gt;Morgan Tsvangirai&lt;/a&gt;, the main opposition leader in &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;, is in intensive care after being arrested at a protest rally. Mr Tsvangirai told the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that police beat him repeatedly in the head, back, knees and arm and that he lost two pints (one litre) of blood in an attack that seemed intended "to inflict as much harm as they could." William Bango, Mr Tsvangirai's spokesman, said: "He has just had a brain scan because his skull is cracked. He will be here for some time. He is in the intensive care unit." A doctor treating Mr Tsvangirai said his condition was stable and he could be released from hospital at the weekend, as a brain scan revealed that his skull is not cracked. But he added that he had also suffered a broken hand and was "terribly badly bruised".

Mr Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition &lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20for%20Democratic%20Change"&gt;Movement for Democratic Change&lt;/a&gt; (MDC), was arrested at a prayer rally protesting against the policies of &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt;'s government, which has been blamed for the country's severe unemployment and inflation of more than 1700%. Correspondents reported an astonishing number of broken arms among the injuries of the protesters, indicating a very high level of physical violence when the rally was broken up. Zimbabwean police said that the rally violated a government ban on political protests.
Those arrested, many of them bandaged and bruised, appeared in the Harare Magistrates Court on Tuesday but were released when the prosecution apparently failed to appear. Mr Tsvangirai and more than 30 activists were then taken to hospital in a convoy of ambulances, watched by about 300 onlookers outside the courtroom.

Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said that the injuries had been inflicted when Mr Tsvangirai and others attacked police, and that "killer" weapons had been confiscated from protesters. A witness told the BBC the activists turned on police after one of their number, Gift Tandare, was shot dead at close range in the chest. But Mr Tsvangirai denied attacking the police, saying "if there were any skirmishes, it was nothing to do with me."
The violent arrests were condemned by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt;, British Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Ban condemned the "reported beating of those leaders in police custody" and said: "Such actions violate the basic democratic right of citizens to engage in peaceful assembly." Mr Blair said: "People should be able to live under the rule of law and they should be able to express their political views without harassment or intimidation or violence." South Africa urged Mr Mugabe's government to "ensure respect for human rights and leaders of various parties".

The US &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; is considering stronger sanctions against Zimbabwe, and the British government is urging European countries to bring in similar measures. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;United States Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement calling for the "immediate and unconditional release of the opposition activists". She said: "The world community again has been shown that the regime of Robert Mugabe is ruthless and repressive and creates only suffering for the people of Zimbabwe."

Mr Tsvangirai said in an interview from his hospital bed that "there are lots of people who've been subjected to this kind of torture, this kind of brutality by this regime." He continued, "It just shows the extent to which this desperate regime is trying to protect its power." "For the struggle, I think it's an inspiration to everyone. There is no freedom without struggle, and there is no freedom without sacrifice."

In an interview on &lt;a href="w%3AESPN%20Radio"&gt;ESPN Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APete%20Rose"&gt;Pete Rose&lt;/a&gt; admitted to hosts &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Patrick"&gt;Dan Patrick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Olbermann"&gt;Keith Olbermann&lt;/a&gt; that he "bet on [his] team every night" and admitted that the &lt;a href="w%3ADowd%20Report"&gt;Dowd Report&lt;/a&gt; was correct in its assessment.

Pete Rose was given a lifetime ban from any involvement in &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; in 1989. Rose accepted the lifetime ban in exchange for not returning a finding of fact that Rose did indeed bet on baseball. He initially indicated to MLB commissioner &lt;a href="w%3ABud%20Selig"&gt;Bud Selig&lt;/a&gt; and in his book ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMy%20Prison%20Without%20Bars"&gt;My Prison Without Bars&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that he did bet on Major League Baseball games, but that he never bet against his team or used his betting to influence the outcome of any game. The Dowd report concurs with this statement from Rose.

Rose acknowledged his betting in the hopes that Selig would reinstate Rose and thus make him eligible for a number of accolades of which, to this point, he had been deprived. However, Selig refused to reinstate him despite his confession. Among those accolades include a formal retirement of his uniform number 14 and induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. While his number cannot formally be retired, no player since Rose's retirement has worn the number, and it is unlikely that it will be worn again by any player on the &lt;a href="w%3ACincinnati%20Reds"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;.

Rose appeared on the Dan Patrick Show on ESPN Radio as part of promotion for an exhibit at the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20American%20Ball%20Park"&gt;Great American Ball Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACincinnati%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; detailing the baseball career of Rose. He said that "I bet on my team to win every night because I love my team, I believe in my team. I did everything in my power every night to win that game."

&lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; Brigadier General Qassim Atta al-Mussawi reported that ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Law%20and%20Order"&gt;Operation Law and Order&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (Arabic: ♡❤Fardh Al-Qanoon♡❤) has been successful in curbing violence in the capital. &lt;a href="w%3AMultinational%20force%20in%20Iraq"&gt;Coalition forces&lt;/a&gt; have swept through various &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods in the past few months. Atta, a spokesperson for the operation cited comparative statistics for the four-week periods of mid-January to mid-February versus mid-February to mid-March:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Civilian killing: 1440 to 265
BULLET::::- Roadside bombings: 163 to 102
BULLET::::- Carbombs: 56 to 36
BULLET::::- Mortar attacks: 204 to 109
BULLET::::- Assassination incidents: 519 to 22
BULLET::::- Kidnappings: 98 to 10

</ul>
It is not clear what these numbers are based on, and independent estimates of the death toll are much higher. According to data compiled by &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Body%20Count"&gt;Iraq Body Count&lt;/a&gt; (IBC), a volunteer project that maintains a database of civilian deaths in Iraq from media reports, at least 393 people died in and around Baghdad between February 15 and March 11.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ estimates 450 Iraqi civilian deaths in and around the capital in the period, using initial reports provided by hospitals and the Iraqi Interior ministry.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reports that deaths from bombings have dropped by a third (528 to 370) after the start of the operations. It also reports that the number of bodies found in Baghdad, believed to be victims of sectarian death squads, has dropped from more than 200 a week to about 80 a week.

At a separate news-conference, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; military spokesperson Major General William Caldwell said the security plan is showing signs of progress. "The murders and executions have come down by over 50 percent," Caldwell said. He did acknowledge that reduced violence in Baghdad's &lt;a href="w%3ASadr%20City"&gt;Sadr City&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood may be linked to the absence of anti-American Shiite cleric &lt;a href="w%3AMuqtada%20al-Sadr"&gt;Muqtada al-Sadr&lt;/a&gt;, who he said was still in neighboring Iran as of 24 hours ago.

All this comes as the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; is debating resolutions on re-deploying troops from Iraq. The troop surge has also been in recent debate on whether or not it is the right move as of now. Meanwhile the United Kingdom announced that it would start withdrawing soon.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanada_Revenue_Agency"&gt;Canada Revenue Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CRA) announced today that computer systems involved with the processing of tax returns for individuals are back online.

Tax processing had been halted on March 6, 2007, due to a computer glitch. The source of the problem had been traced back to software maintenance performed on March 4.

In an update on the CRA website, dated March 14, Michel Dorais, Commissioner of the Agency, stated that all of the databases had been restored and CRA employees are processing the backlog of returns and payments.

Tax processing for businesses had not been affected by the computer shutdown.

In his statement, Dorais thanked taxpayers "for their patience and understanding" during the service outage. He also stated that "the integrity and safety of personal data was never at risk".

The CRA suggests that it would work quickly to process the resulting backlog of tax returns.

The New Zealand Police have issued a warning to state broadcaster &lt;a href="w%3ATVNZ"&gt;TVNZ&lt;/a&gt; (Television New Zealand) for not telling them that they knew where a rapist on the run from police was. However, he did turn himself in after giving the interview.

John Clarke, the convicted rapist, was on the run from police after leaving his home while he was on home detention on Monday, and two probation officers were also present. Mr Clarke was labelled as a high risk offender.

One News, owned by TVNZ, were interviewing John Clarke yesterday, meanwhile a lot of time and effort from police was going into trying to hunt him down. After they have finished the interview, Mr Clarke handed himself in to the Greymouth police, which One News also recorded. "He wandered in off the street with a TV film crew," said Greymouth Sergeant David Cross.

A spokeswoman for TVNZ, Megan Williams said that they would only agree to the interview with Mr Clarke if he handed himself into police after they had finished. She said that if he had not handed himself in, they would then have gone to the police.

The police say that they would have expected TVNZ to have called them "...to say 'look Gary, perhaps if you pull back some of your resources at 5 o'clock, this guy's going to give himself up'," said Sergeant Cross. Sergeant Alison Eleam, Christchurch's central area commander, says that she is not impressed with the way TVNZ acted. TVNZ say that they are now happy to talk to the police.

In November, 2006, Mr Clarke was released from prison and placed into home detention for kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl in 1997.

An agreement to begin construction of the &lt;a href="w%3ABurgas-Alexandroupoli%20pipeline"&gt;Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline&lt;/a&gt; to transport oil from the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AMediterranean"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; was signed by &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; today.

The signing ceremony was held in the presence of the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Greece"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AHellenic%20Republic"&gt;Hellenic Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKarolos%20Papoulias"&gt;Karolos Papoulias&lt;/a&gt;, at the Presidential Palace in &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, with President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and Prime Ministers of &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKostas%20Karamanlis"&gt;Kostas Karamanlis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Stanishev"&gt;Sergei Stanishev&lt;/a&gt; respectively. 

The oil &lt;a href="w%3Apipeline"&gt;pipeline&lt;/a&gt; agreement is the end of months of negotiations between the three countries and was saluted by the Greek government as a "momentous" agreement. According to President Putin, the agreement will not only benefit the three contributing members but will also be significant for the &lt;a href="w%3Aworld%20economy"&gt;world economy&lt;/a&gt; and, furthermore, he added that ♡❤"the pipeline allows diversification in the oil routes, in the best interest of our countries, our peoples and the economy"♡❤. As for the Greek-Russian bilateral relations, Mr.Karamanlis stated that ♡❤"this visit bears witness to the excellent ties between the two nations, signalling and symbolising the construction of a major project, the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline"♡❤. This the second time that Putin visits Athens to meet with the Greek Premier, however they had also previous meetings in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APorto%20Carras"&gt;northern Greece&lt;/a&gt;, during the last two years. 

Before the signing of the pipeline agreement, President Putin and Prime Minister Stanishev had the opportunity to meet with their Greek counterparts and discuss issues of bilateral and regional significance. Yesterday night, Prime Minister Karamanlis hosted a dinner in honour of the Russian and Bulgarian heads of state in central Athens.

<h3>Wal-Mart's package reduction strategy results</h3>

After launching its Packaging Scorecard initiative on February 1, Wal-Mart has released its first in-store packaging reduction results.

On February 1, Wal-Mart announced that its trying to reduce packaging by 5% as of 2013. Their vendor site has been visited by 2268 companies, and 117 products have been entered into their sustainability calculator. It determines the score based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions created by production, materials, product-to-packing ratio, and "cube utilization", how space efficient the product can be shipped.

Buyers will be able to log onto the website in 2008, to make their purchasing decisions.

Beyond attracting environmentally conscientious customers, this move will save Wal-Mart USD$3.4 billion over the next five years.

A $2,500 reward has been issued by the Humane Society of the United States for information on an "implied terroristic threat", according to Sergeant Jim Gray of the St. Paul Police Department.

According to Crystal Brown, 17 year old owner of the dog, a gift-wrapped box with a note saying "Congratulations Crystal. This side up. Batteries included.", was left on her doorstep along with the severed head of her dog, Chevy, and a Valentine's Day candy.

The dog, an Australian shepherd mix called Chevy, went missing in February and Crystal, his owner, spent weeks searching for him, posting fliers, going door to door, and visiting the local animal shelter.

Dale Bartlett, Deputy Manager for the Humane Society said that "This case was extremely heinous. I deal with hundreds and hundreds of cruelty cases each year. When I read about this case, it just took my breath away."

"This was so cruel," Crystal said. "We're dealing with one sick, twisted person."

Kids will have to look elsewhere for educational entertainment, after the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; received complaints that the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation's&lt;/a&gt; website was "unfair competition" to the commercial online games market.

The site, called &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20jam"&gt;BBC jam&lt;/a&gt;, will be suspended on March 20, 2007, pending review, per the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Trust"&gt;BBC Trust&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤BBC jam♡❤ offers educationally-oriented games aimed at 5 to 16-year-olds, created with an operating budget of £150 million (US$290 million) over five years, US$85 million of which allocated to independent content producers. The government funded service is formally requesting proposals on how it should promote education and learning digitally, without being "non-compliant".

NUT Cymru, a &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; teachers' union, is worried about the closure.

Both NUT Cymru and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20for%20Wales"&gt;Welsh Assembly Goverment&lt;/a&gt; have questioned the extent to which commercial firms would step in and fulfill the terms of the &lt;a href="w%3AWelsh%20Language%20Act%201993"&gt;Welsh Language Act 1993&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Transcript of 9/11 confession by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed released</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Transcript%20of%209/11%20confession%20by%20Khalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed%20released&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed"&gt;Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;, alleged 9/11 mastermind and number 3 in &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;'s hierarchy, confessed on Saturday that he was responsible for beheading &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Pearl"&gt;Daniel Pearl&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, according to a military tribunal transcript released by the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;. The transcript also details how Mohammed, through a representative, confesses that he "was responsible for the 9/11 Operation, from A to Z."

<h2>September 11, 2001 attacks</h2>
"I was the Operational Director for Sheikh Usama Bin Laden for the organizing, planning, follow-up, and execution of the 9/11 Operation under the military commander, Sheikh Abu Hafs Al-Masri Subhi Abu Sittah," Mohammed confessed according to the transcript. He also expressed remorse for the children harmed during the World Trade Center operation. "I don't like to kill people," he said.

The transcript contains a list of 31 items Mohammed wholly or partially confesses to. These include alleged Al-Qaeda attacks such as the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Bali%20bombings"&gt;bombing of a night club&lt;/a&gt; in and the attempt by &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Colvin%20Reid"&gt;Richard Colvin Reid&lt;/a&gt; to use a shoe bomb to bring down a U.S. airplane. According to the document, Mohammed also confesses to planning attacks against the &lt;a href="w%3APanama%20Canal"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt;, suspension bridges in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, former U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ASears%20Tower"&gt;Sears Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Ben"&gt;Big Ben&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt; and more.

<h2>Daniel Pearl killing</h2>

Mohammed admitted to decapitating &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Pearl"&gt;Daniel Pearl&lt;/a&gt;, a reporter for the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in the city of Karachi, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.

Daniel Pearl was working on a story in Pakistan in January of 2002 when he was taken hostage. Pearl was investigating the British "shoe-bomber" &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Reid"&gt;Richard Reid&lt;/a&gt;, and links between Pakistan's intelligence agency, the &lt;a href="w%3AInter-Services%20Intelligence"&gt;Inter-Services Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and al-Qaeda.

<h2>Military tribunal for Guantánamo prisoners</h2>
The case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is being put through a closed military tribunal, consisting of three military officers and a government-selected representative. &lt;a href="Human%20rights"&gt;Human rights&lt;/a&gt; organizations have criticized this approach, because the defendant is not allowed to freely chose who represents them, and the courts are closed to public scrutiny.

Another transcript of a Guantánamo Bay hearing of &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Faraj%20al-Libbi"&gt;Abu Faraj al-Libbi&lt;/a&gt;, also released yesterday, explains the prisoner's opinion about the closed military tribunal hearings: "I have been held by the United States for over two years without any indication of how the judicial system is going to deal with my situation. It is my opinion the detainee is in a lose-lose situation."

Mohammed refused to take the oath, explaining that he wasn't lying, but that taking the oath would be recognizing the court. He also accused the U.S. of double standards, comparing the 9/11 attacks to the killing of people in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was apprehended in Rawalpindi in March 2003. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the Justice Department and the CIA approved of using harsh interrogation techniques on him, such as "&lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt;", which involves a prisoner being strapped to a board and water being poured over him, which simulates drowning. During the hearing, Mohammed presented a written statement claiming abuse by U.S. personnel during his detention.

After having a meeting in Bari, Italy, on the 13th of March, the &lt;a href="w%3APresident"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt;, gave a press-conference, summarizing the results of their conversations.

The main point the two leaders agreed on was that only diplomatic means should be used in solving such international conflicts as in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and, especially, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; with its nuclear program issue.

Mr. Putin confirmed once again his views on any use of armed forces in resolving such international conflicts. Mr. Prodi agreed with the Russian President on this point and also stated that such conflicts should be solved using a multi-lateral approach, where several nations would take part in discussions. In addition to this the potential of the UN authority should be used, added Mr. Prodi.

The Prime Minister said that Italy is looking forward to a closer cooperation with Russia in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nation%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in the energy sector. All of this could be reached only through thoroughly developed partnership agreements, he added.

The first three games of the NCAA tournament yielded two close games and one blowout. All three games featured victories by the higher seeds.

<h2>Maryland 82, Davidson 70</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3AMaryland%20Terrapins"&gt;Maryland Terrapins&lt;/a&gt; received a scare from the &lt;a href="w%3ADavidson%20University"&gt;Davidson Wildcats&lt;/a&gt;, as the Terps had to fight back from a second-half deficit to take down the Wildcats 82-70. Stephan Curry of Davidson led all scorers with 30 points.

Davidson jumped out to an eight-point halftime lead but started to show obvious signs of fatigue at the midway point of the second half. Despite the fast pace to the game, Davidson only shot 34.3% from the field during the game. They also hit ten 3-point shots, but attempted 27. It was a mistake-filled game for both teams, with Davidson turning the ball over 17 times and Maryland committing 22 turnovers.

Maryland ultimately won the game under the basket, both outscoring the Wildcats in the paint and outrebounding the Wildcats on both ends. Maryland will go on to face the winner of the Butler-Old Dominion contest.

<h2>Boston College 84, Texas Tech 75</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20College"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Tech%20University"&gt;Texas Tech&lt;/a&gt; played an evenly-matched game out in Winston-Salem, with the Eagles defeating the Red Raiders 84-75. &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Knight"&gt;Bob Knight&lt;/a&gt;'s Texas Tech team finishes the season 21-13.

The Eagles were led by game high scorer Tyrese Rice (26 points) and Sean Marshall (21 points). Boston College trailed by 4 points midway through the final half, but a 14-4 run gave the Eagles the lead. While Texas Tech would make it close, Boston College would pull away in the final minutes for the victory.

Martin Zeno led Texas Tech with 21 points. Three other players contributed double-digit point totals but as a team, Texas Tech was outrebounded 34-21.

<h2>Louisville 78, Stanford 58</h2>
For the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Louisville"&gt;Louisville Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, it may have just seemed to be another regular-season home game.

Five players scored in double figures for the Cardinals, who played their first-round matchup mere miles from Taco Bell Arena in Louisville. While on any other day, Louisville would have expected to be soundly booed, they attracted a firmly partisan crowd in their favor for a 78-58 rout of Stanford.

&lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt; started out slow, and could not string together enough successful possessions to keep the game close. Louisville forced 21 turnovers and held Stanford to 41% shooting. Of those 21 turnovers, 11 were steals for Louisville. Edgar Sosa and David Padgett led Louisville in scoring, both with 16 points. Brook Lopez led Stanford with 18 points.

Police already had George Edenfield, a convicted sex offender, his parents David and Peggy Edenfield, and Donald Dale, a family friend, in custody in connection with the case. The case is being treated as a homicide. Local police chief Doerin said it was obvious that he had been slain, but would not comment further.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Express"&gt;Mars Express&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft has discovered ice deposits in the south pole of &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; that are larger than the state of &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

Scientists say that there is enough water in the deposits to cover the entire planet with up to 36 feet of water if the ice was to melt. Some sections of the ice deposits are up to 2.3 - 2.5 miles deep. The ice is composed of carbon dioxide, a little bit of dust, and water (90 percent of the water is estimated to be frozen).

What has caught the attention of the scientists working on the Mars Express project is that this may help reveal whether or not there is any (&lt;a href="w%3AMicroorganism"&gt;microbial&lt;/a&gt;) life within the ice.

Another perplexing question that scientists are trying to solve is what happened to all the water that produced all the channels on the surface of Mars. 

Jeffrey Plaut, who is from &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and who is also leading the study, noted that, "We have this continuing question facing us in studies of Mars, which is: where did all the water go? Even if you took the water in these two (polar) ice caps and added it all up, it's still not nearly enough to do all of the work that we've seen that the water has done across the surface of Mars in its history." 

Currently, only 10 percent of the water is remaining and is located at the poles of Mars. It has been suggested that some of the remaining 90 percent of the water that disappeared could either be underground or could have simply left the atmosphere into space.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

In a narrative verdict, the Coroner investigating the death of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; soldier Lance Corporal &lt;a href="w%3AMatty%20Hull"&gt;Matty Hull&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed in a &lt;a href="w%3Afriendly%20fire"&gt;friendly fire&lt;/a&gt; incident in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on 28 March 2003, has ruled that his killing was unlawful.

L.Cpl Hull, who was from the &lt;a href="w%3AHousehold%20Cavalry"&gt;Household Cavalry&lt;/a&gt;, died inside his blazing &lt;a href="w%3AFV107%20Scimitar"&gt;Scimitar&lt;/a&gt; tank when it was attacked 25 miles north of &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; "&lt;a href="w%3AA-10%20Thunderbolt%20II"&gt;tankbuster&lt;/a&gt;" aircraft. Four other soldiers were injured in the incident. Video footage from the cockpit of the aircraft was shown privately to his family during the inquest.

The US authorities were uncooperative throughout the proceedings and refused to give evidence, only allowing the cockpit footage to be shown after it had been leaked to a British tabloid newspaper.

Extremely rare and expensive &lt;a href="w%3APatek%20Philippe"&gt;Patek Philippe&lt;/a&gt; watches will be presented at the forthcoming Antiquorum auction sale. The Antiquorum's Collectors' Wristwatches, Pocket &lt;a href="w%3AWatch"&gt;Watches&lt;/a&gt; and Clocks event is to take place on &lt;a href="w%3AMarch%2028"&gt;March 28&lt;/a&gt;. Over 300 of other timepieces will be sold at the auction.

The participants of the auction sale will have a unique chance to acquire a Patek Philippe Ref. 5029 watch. The brand's limited edition creation is estimated to reach the price of about 500,000 dollars. It is one of just ten timepieces housed in &lt;a href="w%3AGold"&gt;rose-gold&lt;/a&gt; cases that were developed in &lt;a href="w%3A1997"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt; to pay tribute to the opening of the new company's factory in &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;. The watch powered by a &lt;a href="w%3AWatch%23Self-winding_watches"&gt;self-winding&lt;/a&gt; movement offers a &lt;a href="w%3AComplication%20%28horology%29"&gt;complicated function&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href="w%3AMinute%20repeater"&gt;minute-repeater&lt;/a&gt;.

Another highlight of the auction will become an equally rare and high-priced Patek Philippe Ref. 5013 watch. The timepiece is meant to be sold at a price range of $400,000 to $500,000. The &lt;a href="w%3Aplatinum"&gt;platinum&lt;/a&gt; timekeeper is equipped with a self-winding movement. Besides providing a minute-repeater function, the complicated tonneau-shaped watch has a retrograde &lt;a href="w%3Aperpetual%20calendar"&gt;perpetual calendar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALunar%20phase"&gt;moon phase indicator&lt;/a&gt; and a 48-hour &lt;a href="w%3Apower%20reserve"&gt;power reserve&lt;/a&gt;.

Patek Philippe Ref. 2499 watch will be the third exquisite creation of the brand. It is expected to be acquired at the range of 300,000 to 400,000 dollars. The astronomic timepiece is housed in 18&lt;a href="w%3ACarat"&gt;K&lt;/a&gt; yellow gold case. The watch offers the following complicated functions - a round-button &lt;a href="w%3Achronograph"&gt;chronograph&lt;/a&gt;, a perpetual calendar, a 30-minute register and moon phase indicator.

The auction will be organized at Antiquorum's new headquarters located on &lt;a href="w%3AMadison%20Avenue"&gt;Madison Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.

The victim, Adam Regis, from &lt;a href="w%3APlaistow"&gt;Plaistow&lt;/a&gt;, east London, collapsed on the pavement before horrified witnesses on Saturday evening.

Witnesses saw two young black men, casually dressed and wearing white &lt;a href="w%3ANike"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; trainers, running away after the boy was stabbed.

A post mortem released today showed that Regis died from a single stab wound to the chest and abdomen.

&lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; boss &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20McClaren"&gt;Steve McClaren&lt;/a&gt; has announced his 23-man squad for the &lt;a href="w%3AEuro%202008"&gt;Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; qualifiers against &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAndorra"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt;.

The biggest surprise pick for the squad was 's Scott Parker. &lt;a href="w%3ABayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; midfielder Owen Hargreaves will make his England return after a broken leg kept him out of competition. Other central midfielders in the squad will include Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Michael Carrick. 

On the wings, Aaron Lennon may start down the right, while Kieron Dyer or Stewart Downing may play on the left.

Likely strikers for the club are &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;'s Wayne Rooney and Andy Johnson of Everton.

Manchester United's on-loan keeper Ben Foster started the game against Spain last time out for England, but he is sure to be backup to Paul Robinson in the qualifiers.

John Terry and Rio Ferdinand may well make up the center of the defense with Gary Neville and Ashley Cole possibly supporting from the defensive wings. 

Notable exceptions from the squad include Manchester City's Joey Barton and Gareth Barrey of .

Edinburgh Building Services (EBS) has won a national excellence award at a gala ceremony held in St Andrews last week (8 March 2007). Promises Into Action, an EBS project, won the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) award for “Securing a Workforce for the Future”. 

This award follows an innovative cultural change programme led jointly by Pinnacle and the City of Edinburgh Council, which focussed on improving communications and team-work and on recognising good performance and customer care. 

Councillor Sheila Gilmore, Executive Member for Community Safety and Housing, said, "It is encouraging to see the hard work that has been done and the changes that have been made as a result of this project is being recognised on a national level. I would like to congratulate the team and thank COSLA for recognising these achievements."

Pinnacle’s Director, Steve White, and his team accepted the award at the prize ceremony. He said: “When we first begun working with EBS, we would never have believed that within just three years, we would be winning national awards for excellence. Through Pinnacle’s partnership with &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;City of Edinburgh Council&lt;/a&gt;, we focused on changing cultures, nurturing talent and delivering outcomes and as a result, EBS has been transformed into a high achieving organisation with a culture that is inclusive, open and trusting. 

“The EBS team should feel justifiably proud of such an outstanding achievement.”

John Swinney, Chief Executive of Pinnacle, said: “EBS continues to go from strength to strength – this is the second national award for excellence that it has achieved in just six months. It highlights, yet again, the real benefits of public/private sector partnerships working together to achieve sustainable improvements for communities and customers. Congratulations again to the EBS team.”

EBS provides a range of building maintenance services for Services for Communities and other departments of the City of Edinburgh Council. Pinnacle began work with Edinburgh Building Services in 2003.

Although the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited_states"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; experienced average temperatures for the December, 2006 to February, 2007 period, overall world temperatures were the warmest on record, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA).

In a March 15, 2007 report, the NOAA indicated that a record warm January helped push the combined global land and ocean surface temperature for the past winter to its highest value since records began in 1880.

The ocean-atmosphere system, &lt;a href="w%3AEl_Ni%25C3%25B1o"&gt;El Niño&lt;/a&gt;, played a part in the season’s record warmth, according to the report's authors, but its effects did not last long, as ocean temperatures in the central equatorial &lt;a href="w%3APacific_ocean"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt; cooled more than 0.3 &lt;a href="w%3ADegrees_Celcius"&gt;degrees C&lt;/a&gt; in February and were near average for the month.

The global land-surface temperature was the warmest on record, while the ocean-surface temperature tied for second warmest in the past 128 year period, approximately 0.06 degrees C cooler than the record established during the strong El Niño episode of 1997-1998.

During the past century, global surface temperatures have increased approximately 0.06 degrees C per decade, but since 1976 the rate of increase has been about 0.18 degrees C per decade. The greatest temperature increase occurred in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, Jay Lawrimore of NOAA suggested that the data does not show &lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse_gas"&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; had an influence on the recent temperature increases, but acknowledges that by "looking at long-term trends and long-term changes, we are able to better understand natural and anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change."

A U.S. Commerce Department agency based in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%252C_D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, the NOAA conducts research and gathers data on oceans and atmosphere. The NOAA is a participant in the Group on Earth Observations, GEO, an intergovernmental effort to coordinate the collection of Earth observations worldwide.

&lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt; won the pole on the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Formula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; 2007 &lt;a href="w%3AING%20Group"&gt;ING&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Australian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Park%20Grand%20Prix%20Circuit"&gt;Albert Park Circuit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;, his teammate and the previous GP winner in &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, was out due to technical problems with his Ferrari.

Kimi's major rival for the new season &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;, who earned his place in &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;, will start second tomorrow. Alonso's former teammate, &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisicella&lt;/a&gt;, classified six.

&lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, McLaren rookie and a companion of the current world champion Alonso placed 4th after &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;.

And a very good start of the season for &lt;a href="w%3ATakuma%20Sato"&gt;Takuma Sato&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to get 10th in the third qualifying session, first time in history for &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Aguri%20F1"&gt;Super Aguri&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20F1"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; team. Together with &lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Davidson"&gt;Anthony Davidson&lt;/a&gt; who will start 11th, right after Takuma. This perfect results may be explained by the controversial use of the chassis &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Aguri%20SA07"&gt;Super Aguri SA07&lt;/a&gt; pretty similar to &lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20RA106"&gt;Honda RA106&lt;/a&gt;. Though, &lt;a href="Massa%20wins%202006%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix%2C%20Alonso%20and%20Renault%20win%20championships"&gt;Takuma was 10th&lt;/a&gt; after the previous race in Brazil when the team used &lt;a href="w%3AArrows"&gt;Arrows&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Aguri%20SA06"&gt;SA06&lt;/a&gt;.

The Formula-1 season officially started with Friday free practice sessions appears to be very competitive because of some changes in sporting regulations as well as the engines specs freezing and only one tyre supplier, &lt;a href="w%3ABridgestone"&gt;Bridgestone&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Vornado Realty Trust of Paramus NJ has completed a deal to take a majority interest in the 1.8 million sq ft building at 555 California St in San Francisco, (aka &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20America%20Center%20%28San%20Francisco%29"&gt;The Bank of America Center&lt;/a&gt;) and the 2 million sq. foot building located at 1290 Avenue of The Americas in New York City. 

In an announced deal worth $1.8 billion, the new investors get a 70 percent interest in both towers, alleviating the current owners, Hudson Waterfront Associates of any possible liability in a lawsuit brought against them by &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. 

Built in 1969, 555 California is SF's largest office tower, and 2nd tallest building at 779 ft. just a few feet shy of the 48 story Transamerica Pyramid at 853 ft which was completed in 1972.

The SF structure, whose current deal estimates it's value @ $575 per sq ft, had just sold last year for $1.05 Billion all by itself ($583 a sq ft), when property magnate Walter Shorenstein sold it to Henry Cheng and Vincent Lo's Hong Kong based Hudson Waterfront Associates, a record for a city property. 
Before 2005, 555 California had been Bank of America's World HQ, but that status ended when North Carolina based NationsBank ate up A.P Giannini's west coast banking legacy and kept the B of A name, but made the main HQ in Charlotte NC. 

For lookee loos the 52nd floor of 555 California features the popular Carnelian Room, a hang for well to do bankers, brokers, lawyers and tourists checking out wide sweeping views from what was once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi, now only the 5th Tallest Bldg on the west coast, but still impressive. For those afraid of heights and the tab for "fine dining", the ground floor also features a Starbucks.

After rain and bad light delayed proceedings, Ireland's target was reduced by the &lt;a href="w%3ADuckworth-Lewis"&gt;Duckworth-Lewis method&lt;/a&gt; to 128 runs from 47 overs.

Ireland's eventual victory eliminates Pakistan from the World Cup.

This was Ireland's first ever win over a team with test match status, and their first win in a World Cup (this tournament being their first appearance).

Doubles from Park Ji-Sung and Wayne Rooney lifted Manchester United to an easy 4-1 win over Bolton Wanderers earlier today at Old Trafford. Manchester's Christiano Ronaldo was the star of the game, as he set up all three first half goals for United. Bolton had been struggling as of late in the Premiership, loosing two of their last three games, while United were looking for their sixth straight win.

Bolton started off the game with the first chance when John O'Shea gave the ball away to Nicolas Anelka, but the Frenchman dragged his shot just wide. United hit their stride soon after, and Park Ji-Sung should have given them the lead after seven minutes. Ryan Giggs flick at the net was miss-handled by keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen, and Park was there to pick up the scraps, but he somehow poked the close range shot over the net. United suffered a blow a few minutes later when skipper Gary Neville twisted his ankle under a challenge from Gary Speed. Neville was replaced by Wes Brown, and the game continued with Ryan Giggs as captain for United. Ronaldo then had a chance after he was found by a searching ball by Brown, but the Portuguese wingers shot was from a bad angle and flew high and wide. Ronaldo would then set up the first goal of the game as he broke for the touch line and at the last minute cut the ball back to Park, who slotted home the ball with a tidy side foot finish. Bolton pushed back to tie the game, but it would be United who would score nect on a storming counterattack. Ronaldo picked up the ball in his own half, did a quick one-two with Rooney, and then delivered the ball back to the young Englishman. Rooney was all alone on the keeper, and chipped the ball over the sprawling Jaaskeleinen to double Uniteds lead. Ronaldo had another chance, but shot wide before Kevin Davies wasted Bolton's best chance by heading over the net. Park then earned himself a brace after some poor goalkeeping by Jaaskeleinen gifted him the ball and the South-Korean slotted home his second, giving Manchester a three-nil lead before halftime.

After the break, Christiano Ronaldo had a fantastic chance to score after a cross by Heinze picked him out in the box, but the Portuguese was not able to make contact and the ball flew harmlessly by. Giggs then had a chance for United, but his attempted chip went well wide of the net. Nicolas Anelka then had a chance for Bolton as he lashed a volley from the center of goal, but again was off target. Jaaskeleinen was then forced into a fine save off a blasted shot by Ronaldo, who was soon replace by Alan Smith. Smith was returning to the Premiership after thirteen months out with injury due to a broken leg which he suffered against Liverpool last year. Smith instantly made an impact on the game when his lob-pass to Rooney left the striker open to blast home his second of the game, increasing United lead to four. Bolton were given a consolation penalty as the game neared its end, and Speed's low blast from the spot snuck in past Kuszkzak, ruining his bid for a clean sheet.

The win gives United more hope in their goal of the Premiership title, but their next game is a FA Cup replay against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford. Bolton's next match is at home to strugglers Sheffield United.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Six%20Nations%20Championship"&gt;2007 RBS Six Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt; today, following their victory over &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AStade%20de%20France"&gt;Stade de France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaint-Denis"&gt;Saint-Denis&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier in the day, &lt;a href="w%3AIreland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3AItaly%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AStadio%20Flaminio"&gt;Stadio Flaminio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, and, following the France-Scotland match, &lt;a href="w%3AWales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Stadium"&gt;Millennium Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACardiff"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Italy vs. Ireland</h2>
The first match of the day, Italy versus Ireland, kicked off at 1430 local time (&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20European%20Time"&gt;UTC+1&lt;/a&gt;). It was won by Ireland, 51 points to 24. Ireland were up 21-12 at half time, and looked certain to win 51-17, but for a stoppage-time touchdown by &lt;a href="w%3ARoland%20de%20Marigny"&gt;Roland de Marigny&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately cost Ireland the title. Ireland's points came with eight &lt;a href="w%3ATry"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt; (four converted), four of which came in a 13 minute period early in the second half, as well as one &lt;a href="w%3APenalty%20%28rugby%29"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt;. Italy replied with two tries (both converted), two penalties, and two &lt;a href="w%3AField%20goal%20%28rugby%29"&gt;drop goals&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>France vs. Scotland</h2>
The second match, France versus Scotland, kicked off at 1630 local time (UTC+1), with France needing to win by at least 24 points to knock Ireland out of the running for the championship. It was won by France, 46 points to 19. Scotland started brightly, scoring a converted try in the first 7 minutes, but by the end of the first half, France were up 20-14. As with Italy, France got a decisive try, in terms of the championship, this time coming in the last play of the game, by &lt;a href="w%3AElvis%20Vermeulen"&gt;Elvis Vermeulen&lt;/a&gt;. France's points came with six tries (five converted) and two penalties. Scotland scored three tries (two converted).

<h2>Wales vs. England</h2>
The final match of the day, and the tournament, Wales versus England, kicked off at 1730 local time (&lt;a href="w%3AGreenwich%20Mean%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), with England needing to win by 57 points to win the championship. However, Wales ended the tournament with their first win of it, by 27 points to 18. Wales took the lead with a third minute try by &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Hook%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;James Hook&lt;/a&gt;, and did not lose it throughout, except for a short period in the second half when England pulled it back to 18-all. Wales's points came from two tries (one converted), a drop goal, and four penalties. England scored two tries (one converted), a drop goal, and a penalty.

<h2>Tournament results</h2>
These results meant that France were level on 8 table points with Ireland, and won the championship with a points difference of +69 to Ireland's +65. They were awarded the trophy in an empty Stade de France after the Wales-England match. England came third with 6 table points, Italy fourth with 4 points, and Wales and Scotland in the last two places level on 2 table points, with Scotland taking last place, and the &lt;a href="w%3AWooden%20Spoon%20%28award%29%23Rugby%20Union"&gt;Wooden Spoon&lt;/a&gt;, with a -58 points difference to Wales's -27. This year's competition is considered by many as the closest in years.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Lahar%20at%20New%20Zealand%27s%20Mount%20Ruapehu&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="w%3Alahar"&gt;lahar&lt;/a&gt; at New Zealand's &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Ruapehu"&gt;Mount Ruapehu&lt;/a&gt; is all but over, without causing anywhere the level of havoc for which authorities were prepared.

The event was first confirmed by a &lt;a href="w%3A3%20News"&gt;3 News&lt;/a&gt; helicopter, and then the Department of Conservation.

The Department of Conservation had said that a "moderate lahar" was moving down the side of Mount Ruapehu.

The lahar travelled down the Whangaehu Valley, past the Tongariro catchment; and then continued on to the Tangiwai Bridge, the site of the 1953 &lt;a href="w%3ATangiwai%20disaster"&gt;Tangiwai disaster&lt;/a&gt;, which was itself caused by a lahar.

The crater lake is currently being reported by a free phone number as at a warning level of 3a. The crater lake is also being reported at a level between 5.7-6.7 metres up the Crater Lake tephra dam.

The lahar emergency plan was activated by Civil Defence. The district mayor of Ruapehu, Sue Morris, and conservation minister, Chris Carter, said that the authorities had been very quick to respond to the emergency. All three electronic surveillance technologies had their alarms activated. Mr Carter said, "The lahar travelled down the path as predicted, and the early warning response system that this government provided worked exactly as planned."

Highways near Mount Ruapehu were closed by the &lt;a href="w%3AOhakune"&gt;Ohakune&lt;/a&gt; police, including the &lt;a href="w%3ADesert%20Road"&gt;Desert Road&lt;/a&gt;. The roads have now been re-opened.

A lahar has been expected for a long time now, and scientists say the lahar could have been caused by, among other things, the bad weather New Zealand has been having lately.

Since 1996 the water level in the crater lake at the top of Mount Ruapehu has been rising, which created a risk of a lahar last year.

Pakistan police stormed the offices of television news broadcaster &lt;a href="w%3AGeo%20TV"&gt;Geo news&lt;/a&gt; in the capital city using tear gas and firing rubber bullets in the building.

Police personnel charged into the facility batons drawn and thrashed offices and attacked the staff of GEO News and its sister affiliates the ♡❤The News International♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJang"&gt;Jang&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper, forcing the channel to go off air for more than six hours on Thursday.

The news channel's attempts to go on air from the port city of Karachi, some 2700 kilometers away, were thwarted by the pro-Musharraf government of Sindh.

Bomb disposal squad backed by federal paramilitary force stormed the Karachi office forcing an immediate evacuation of the premises. The bomb disposal squad took two and half hours to conduct an office to office sweep of the five story building, resulting in damage to computer and camera equipment.

Geo News continuously airing a prerecorded loop of prayers asking God to bless the nation and guide the leaders by granting them mental abilities to make proper decisions in critical times. The loop also continuously showed the footage of the nation's founder, Qaid-e-Azam &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammed%20Ali%20Jinnah"&gt;Muhammed Ali Jinnah&lt;/a&gt;, addressing the first constituent assembly of Pakistan and promising freedom of speech and press, along with clips from riots and military bombing of the former &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Pakistan"&gt;East Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;).

President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; came on live phone call within minutes of resumption of transmissions and said, “I apologize for what has happened, I see this as a conspiracy to uproot my government.”

General Musharraf came to power after a blood-less &lt;a href="w%3A1999%20Pakistani%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat"&gt;coup in 1999&lt;/a&gt; by overthrowing the democratically elected government of &lt;a href="w%3ANawaz%20Sharif"&gt;Nawaz Sharif&lt;/a&gt;, charging the government with corruption.

&lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula%20One"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AING%20Group"&gt;ING&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Australian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Park%20Grand%20Prix%20Circuit"&gt;Albert Park Circuit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. More precisely he made a &lt;a href="w%3Ahat-trick%23Auto%20racing"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt; of wins dating back to 2005.

Both &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; drivers appear to be his major rivals for the new season as &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; made a double finishing 2nd and 3rd consequently, with Hamilton on his debut race.

&lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt;, driving for &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt;, had a promising start and stayed with Kimi for the first part of the race, but his early first &lt;a href="w%3Apit-stop"&gt;pit-stop&lt;/a&gt; pushed him back to the 4th place, while his Polish teammate &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; retired due to technical problems towards the end of the race.

&lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; was penalized for the engine change after his previous engine failed during qualification, but showed a good pace and for the dying laps of the race pushed hard on &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisicella&lt;/a&gt;. The few overtaking attempts were not successful enough and so Filipe saw the &lt;a href="w%3Acheckered%20flag"&gt;checkered flag&lt;/a&gt; behind Giancarlo on the six place.

7th, 8th and 9th places fell to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANico%20Rosberg"&gt;Nico Rosberg&lt;/a&gt; driving for &lt;a href="w%3AWilliams"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt; with Toyota engines and both 
&lt;a href="w%3AToyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; drivers, &lt;a href="w%3ARalf%20Schumacher"&gt;Ralf Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJarno%20Trulli"&gt;Jarno Trulli&lt;/a&gt;.

The top 10 was closed by &lt;a href="w%3ARenault"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; rookie &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; who made numerous driving errors in the closing stages of the race.

The 2007 Formula-1 season from now appears to be a highly competitive season after &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; retired from the sport at the end of the 2006 season.

<h3>Microsoft to pay companies to use Live Search</h3>

In an effort to boost its 6.76% share of the Internet &lt;a href="w%3ASearch%20engine"&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; industry, &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has offered money to companies to get them to switch to its Windows Live search engine. A new program called "Microsoft Service Credits for Web Search" allows companies to get paid for the searches that their employees run using &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Live%20Search"&gt;Windows Live Search&lt;/a&gt;.

Companies, depending on how many searches their users run, can get paid $2 to $10 a year per computer and an addition $25,000 just for enrolling in the program. Larger companies have the potential to earn $100,000 to $200,000 per year through this program that can be used for anything they need. A browser helper object (BHO) will be used to track searches made through Windows Live Search on individual computers.

Google, which is based in &lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20View%2C%20California"&gt;Mountain View, California&lt;/a&gt;, stated that the terms of the agreement and the price paid for Adscape will remain confidential, but the cost might be about $23 million, as informed the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Herring%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Red Herring&lt;/a&gt; magazine on 15th February. 

Adscape is now fully controlled by Google and will provide the company with its first opportunity to use in-game advertising. Google has stated that it will be working with Adscape's partners the same as the company had been before.

&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Woolmer"&gt;Bob Woolmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20cricket%20team"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s cricket coach died at a university hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AKingston%2C%20Jamaica"&gt;Kingston, Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. Woolmer was found unconscious in his room at the Pegasus Hotel at 10:45 Sunday morning, only hours after Pakistan's Cricket World Cup exit at the hands of Ireland.

After being found by hotel workers in his room, he was rushed to the emergency department at the University Hospital in Kingston, but doctors where not able to save him. Team spokesman Parvez Mir reported that when he was found "He had blood on him and there was vomit on the walls."

Mir also told media that Woolmer suffered from a medical condition, but that it was too early to decide whether or not it had anything to do with his death.

Woolmer played 19 Tests for England and was the coach for Warwickshire and South Africa before becoming coach for Pakistan in 2004. He was to remain coach until after the 2007 World Cup, and was tipped to replace &lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Fletcher"&gt;Duncan Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; as the coach of &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; after his contract with the PCB expired.

Michael Auberry, a Troop 230 &lt;a href="w%3ABoy%20Scout"&gt;Boy Scout&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AGreensboro%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Greensboro, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, has been reported missing from Stone Mountain State Park, in western &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Search crew are still trying to locate the missing 12-year-old boy in the nearly 13,750 acre park. Volunteer firefighters, National Park Service staff, and rescue squads are all searching at this moment.

He began missing at 12:30 p.m. and 1 p.m EST on Saturday. The scouts went on a hike while Auberry stayed back at the camp site with an adult. After, they had lunch with him and, later, Auberry was noted to be missing.

"We are not really sure why or what happened," said Saundra Lewis of the &lt;a href="w%3AWilkes%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Wilkes County&lt;/a&gt; Rescue Squad. "He was seen at the campsite and then a few minutes later he was missing."

Auberry was last seen wearing blue jeans, a dark hat, and a red coat with reflective striping. His backpack was found at the campsite, and his mess kit was also located approximately a half-mile from the campsite.

Talks of an election are beginning to rise again in the media as Canada's &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; rallied last night in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;.

Conservative MPs came to the two day event in Toronto for a training session. It was a campaign-style event with about 5,000 party supporters. During the event, the Prime Minister talked of an expected upcoming federal election and other issues that are affecting the nation today.

"We are here to plan," said Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; at the rally held on &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Patricks%20Day"&gt;St. Patricks Day&lt;/a&gt;. "Plan for a future that could include an election... An election that the opposition could impose on Canadians at any time."
This comes two days before the spring budget, which will be announced on Monday. According to &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, the Conservative government needs another party to support the budget. If not, this would trigger an election.

According to political analysts, the Conservatives at least need 36 to 49% support. They also have been spending a large amount of money speculated to be used for the next election. Harper stated he does not want an election but one could be called by the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberals&lt;/a&gt; "at any time".

He also compared St. Patrick to the Conservative Party of Canada winning last years election.

"Legend says that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland. And last year, you, the grassroots members of the Conservative party, drove the Grits out of Ottawa. Now that's something worth saying cheers to," said Harper, who is of British ancestry.

The Conservative government was elected on January 23, 2006, ending twelve years of Liberal government.

In &lt;a href="w%3ASint-Niklaas"&gt;Sint-Niklaas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, a multicultural mass marriage event is to take place next Wednesday, on the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt;-designated &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Day%20for%20the%20Elimination%20of%20Racial%20Discrimination"&gt;International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. More than 550 couples have already registered to make a devotion pledge or renew their wedding vows before municipal officer &lt;a href="w%3AWouter%20Van%20Bellingen"&gt;Wouter Van Bellingen&lt;/a&gt;. The alderman called for the event after three couples cancelled their marriage because Wouter is black.

Van Bellingen, whose &lt;a href="Rwanda"&gt;Rwandan&lt;/a&gt; parents gave him up for adoption, grew up in Sint-Niklaas as the youngest child in a family of 4 adopted children. Van Bellingen is a member of the political party &lt;a href="w%3ASpirit%20%28Belgium%29"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, which strives for more &lt;a href="w%3AFlemish%20movement"&gt;Flemish autonomy&lt;/a&gt; in Belgium. After the &lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20municipal%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;2006 municipal elections in Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, he became the first black councillor in Belgium, responsible for civilian, youth and international affairs in Sint-Niklaas. "The combination of his black skin colour with the shiny white brides dresses will be very photogenic..." mayor Freddy Willockx predicted when he presented his councillors. One month after Van Bellingen took office, the media reported that three couples refused to be married by a black registrar.

At first, Van Bellingen wasn't very surprised. "As a coloured person, I go through this every day. That's just the reality in &lt;a href="w%3AFlanders"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt;. Only, I didn't expect this to happen so fast." After the incident, Van Bellingen got hundreds of calls and letter from people supporting him, including prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Verhofstadt"&gt;Guy Verhofstadt&lt;/a&gt;, who condemned "such as stupid form of &lt;a href="w%3Aracism"&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt;".

&lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20%E2%80%93%20Different"&gt;Socialist&lt;/a&gt; mayor Willockx accused the far-right political party &lt;a href="w%3AVlaams%20Belang"&gt;Vlaams Belang&lt;/a&gt; (Eng. ♡❤Flemish Interest♡❤) of creating the atmosphere for his deputy's experience. Vlaams Belang is second in the polls for the elections next June in Flanders. But, as Van Bellingen pointed out: "This is not just a problem in Sint-Niklaas, or in Flanders, but all over Europe. And there are racists in every political party here."

Since Van Bellingen made the news, the number of wedding ceremonies he has to lead has doubled, and even bookings for 2008 are coming in. Because many people regretted the fact that they could not be married by the famous alderman, he decided to organise a mass wedding, on the International anti-racism day. Not only future and established couples can take part in the ceremony, but even teens who want to prove their love. "Anyone can wed that day. I'm not a racist."

Similar to the television show Fata Morgana, Wouter has 5 challenges for the couples and for the city of Sint-Niklaas: together, they are to realise the biggest wedding pledge, a big wedding photo, a big group hug on the market square, a multicultural dessert buffet and a big first wedding dance.

&lt;a href="w%3AGreen_party_of_canada"&gt;Green Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth_May"&gt;Elizabeth May&lt;/a&gt; announced Sunday that she will seek the party's nomination for the seat of &lt;a href="w%3ACentral_Nova"&gt;Central Nova&lt;/a&gt; in the next federal election.

The riding is represented currently by &lt;a href="w%3AConservative_party_of_canada"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; MP &lt;a href="w%3APeter_Mackay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt;, who has held the seat since 1997. MacKay is Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. MacKay was born in New Glasgow, &lt;a href="w%3ANova_Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; and completed an Arts degree and Law degree in the province. 

His father, &lt;a href="w%3AElmer%20MacKay"&gt;Elmer MacKay&lt;/a&gt;, who was with the &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Progressive Conservative Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, had been re-elected six times in the riding. Former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Mulroney"&gt;Brian Mulroney&lt;/a&gt; also held the riding in 1983. Elmer resigned in order to give Mulroney a seat in Parliament.

As a teenager, May moved from the United States to &lt;a href="w%3ACape_Breton_Island"&gt;Cape Breton Island&lt;/a&gt; in Nova Scotia. In her press release of March 18, 2007, May explained that she began her vocation as an activist and political campaigner in Nova Scotia. "It is entirely fitting that I now come back here to launch my first full campaign as leader of the Green Party of Canada", May stated.

May ran recently in a federal by-election, held on November 26, 2006, in the Ontario riding of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon_North_Centre"&gt;London North Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Although May came in second behind &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal_party_of_canada"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href="w%3AGlen%20Pearson"&gt;Glen Pearson&lt;/a&gt;, the Green Party had increased their vote by 20% over the previous election. If May won the seat of Central Nova in the next election, she would be the first ever Green MP in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Canadian House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;.

On her choice of Central Nova, May suggested in her press release that she had to "follow [her] heart" and felt compelled to "run in Nova Scotia and that challenging a prominent member of the government will enable [her] to keep a strong focus on why Nova Scotia and Canada cannot afford another government led by &lt;a href="w%3AStephen_Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;.”

In the latest &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian_federal_election%252C_2006"&gt;federal election of January 23, 2006&lt;/a&gt;, MacKay took the seat of Central Nova with 41% of the vote. In that election, the Green Party candidate, David Orton, came in fourth with under 2% of the vote.

In the latest national &lt;a href="w%3AStrategic_Counsel"&gt;Strategic Counsel&lt;/a&gt; poll, conducted for CTV News and the Globe and Mail, the Conservatives are at 36%, the Liberals 31%, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew_Democratic_Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; at 15%, and the Green Party at 10%. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

A 34 year old obstetrician from &lt;a href="w%3AForestville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Forestville&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney's&lt;/a&gt; Northern Beaches has escaped after he was robbed, car-jacked and locked in the boot (trunk) of his BMW, which was set alight. Police say the doctor was locked in the boot while his car was set alight, but was allowed to escape before flames engulfed the vehicle.

The Doctor was believed to have been heading to The Mater Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sydney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;North Sydney&lt;/a&gt; when he was waiting at the intersection of West and Falcon Streets in &lt;a href="w%3AChatswood%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Chatswood&lt;/a&gt; around 3:15AM &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEDT&lt;/a&gt; when a small red sedan with two men claiming to be police officers signalled him to stop. After crossing the intersection, the doctor stopped his car at the side of the road.

The doctor was then approached by the two men and when he asked to see identification, one man grabbed the keys from his car's ignition before they both pulled the doctor out of his vehicle, hit him in the stomach with a hammer and stole his mobile phone and wallet. The robbers also demanded his key and credit cards along with their access codes before locking him in the boot.

Police allege that the men drove to several locations to withdraw cash and buy things before driving to Carisbook Street in &lt;a href="w%3ALinley%20Point%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Linley Point&lt;/a&gt; at around 4 a.m. local time where they set the car alight with the doctor still in the boot.

Crime Manager of the Harbourside Local Area Command, Detective Inspector Houlahan said that the doctor then "heard a click in the boot area and he heard someone call out: 'Get out of the car'"

"When he pushed the boot up he found his car engulfed in flames."

Det. Insp. Houlahan said the doctor told police he did not unlock the boot himself, and it appeared the man's captors unlocked it before fleeing.

Det Insp Houlahan said that the doctor appeared to be "very distraught" and tired after the ordeal, and wanted to get home and see his wife and two young daughters.

He could only provide police with a vague description of his captors, but said the men were both Caucasian males aged in their 20s, and that one of them was about six feet tall (183cm) with short blond hair and medium build said Det. Insp. Houlahan.

&lt;a href="w%3AIgor%20Ivanov"&gt;Igor Ivanov&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, 
said that the &lt;a href="w%3AEurasian%20Economic%20Community"&gt;Eurasian Economic Community&lt;/a&gt; (EuroAsEC) could take the place of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States"&gt;Commonwealth of Independent States&lt;/a&gt; (CIS).

Speaking at a press conference, Ivanov said that the CIS has already played a great role in the development of all the countries and that its current role is rather overestimated.

At the moment, the EuroAsEC consists of six members and three observers. 
In his speech Ivanov also expressed his concern with what he termed &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; interference into the affairs of &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;'s neighbor countries.

Speaking on behalf of the entire Security Council, one of whose members is the Russian President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, he said that Russia will have to be politically and economically active to defend its interests.

In an interview with the Daily Courier in Prescott, Fife said: 

Fife also noted that he did request information from the commander of &lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Luke Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, the general of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Guard"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and the head of the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Public%20Safety"&gt;Department of Public Safety&lt;/a&gt;. But none of the officials he contacted had an answer for what had happened, and were also "perplexed."

Frances Barwood, who was the former Phoenix city councilwoman in 1997 and who launched an investigation into the event, said that out of the more than 700 witnesses she interviewed, "The government never interviewed even one."

This week &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s on-line video sharing website &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; launches its own awards ceremony. The site will present the best user-generated videos posted during 2006 in seven categories. The starting point is Monday and users will end voting on Friday. Winners will get their trophies on March 26.

The categories that YouTube is going to present include: most creative or inspirational video, best series, as well as music video or commentary and best comedy. The last category, number seven, is called "most adorable video ever" and it is to continue the tradition of videos starring cats and dogs while asleep.

Those that are nominated are able to promote themselves on YouTube during the following five days. These users are also able to plead for votes.

The $1.65 billion Google's acquisition gathered a huge number of fans. According to Jamie Byrne, head of YouTube product marketing, 2006 was a pioneering year for sites that rely on user's content. 

However, companies like &lt;a href="w%3AViacom"&gt;Viacom&lt;/a&gt;, believe one category is missing - "Best Professionally Produced Copyrighted Video." Last week Viacom sued Google together with YouTube for more than $1 billion. The lawsuit states that the ever increasing popularity of YouTube is due to a massive uploads of copyrighted videos including "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Colbert%20Report"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Park"&gt;South Park&lt;/a&gt;".

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=A380%20makes%20maiden%20flight%20to%20US&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;A380&lt;/a&gt;, the world's largest passenger plane, was set to land in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; on Monday after a test flight. One of the A380s is flying from &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;; the airplane will be carrying about 500 people.

It is being billed as the first time it has carried a near-normal number of passengers, though most will be staff of &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; airline &lt;a href="w%3ALufthansa"&gt;Lufthansa&lt;/a&gt;.

A second A380 is also travelling to the U.S. on Monday, but without passengers. This will be branded as a &lt;a href="w%3AQantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt; flight and fly from &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20LAX%20airport"&gt;Los Angeles LAX airport&lt;/a&gt;. The first leg of the flight going towards New York will be travelling under a Lufthansa flight number, and is due to arrive at &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20airport"&gt;John F. Kennedy airport&lt;/a&gt; at 12:30 EST (16:30 UTC).

The test flights are being used to monitor everything from how easily the plane docks at the terminal gate to the way the in-flight dining and entertainment services work. Deliveries to &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Airlines"&gt;Singapore Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, its launch customer, are not due until October - two years late.

Delays of the production of the A380 have cost Airbus more than 6 billion &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;dollar&lt;/a&gt;s. Airbus has warned there could be additional charges to come.

These monetary problems have led to a recently-announced restructuring program at Airbus, called Power8, in which 10,000 jobs go and several factories will be sold to Airbus partners. &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; will lose 4,300 jobs, followed by Germany having a loss of 3,700 jobs, while the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; will see 1,600 and 400 jobs cut respectively.

The &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; government has announced that it will give up to 150 million &lt;a href="w%3A%E2%82%AC"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt; (US$ 199 million) in aid to help sub-contractors which supply Airbus and employ thousands of workers.

"Having said that, there's money on the table [for Quebec]," bloc leader &lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20Duceppe"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt; said, "so we'll take that money."

However, the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; did not back the budget. NDP Leader &lt;a href="Jack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt; said the budget is giving more money to companies and less to Canadian citizens. The budget also has been criticized by some finance critics.

"He should have had a strategy," Liberal Leader and former Environment Minister under &lt;a href="Jean%20Chr%C3%A9tien"&gt;Jean Chrétien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;, said today. "He should have explained how his budget would make us more competitive, how it would be fairer for those in need, how it would enhance the environment."

"For every step forward, there seems to be two steps back," said Layton. "We could have supported child care or environment and given less to the big board rooms of Bay Street."

Elections have to happen five years or less after a government is elected. The federal election of 2005 was held during winter.

<h1>Methane gas explosion at Ulyanovskaya Mine kills at least 108</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Methane%20gas%20explosion%20at%20Ulyanovskaya%20Mine%20kills%20at%20least%20108&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="w%3Amethane"&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Agas%20explosion"&gt;gas explosion&lt;/a&gt; occurred at the Ulyanovskaya Mine near the city of &lt;a href="w%3ANovokuznetsk"&gt;Novokuznetsk&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AKemerovo%20Oblast"&gt;Kemerovo region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASiberia"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;. At least 106 people have been reported to be killed in the blast. Conflicting reports say that at least thirteen to forty-three miners are still trapped underground or missing, as well as 75 to 93 have been reported to have survived the blast.

The mine disaster is the deadliest accident in &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;'s mining industry in over a decade. The mine, which was opened in 2002, had around 200 miners inside at the time of the methane gas explosion. 

The Kemerovo governor Aman Tuleyev said that when the blast occurred, the mine's management was underground inspecting a newly installed safety system made by a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABp"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;. British experts and representatives of a management of the mine have gone down under the ground shortly before explosion. Tuleyev stated that on mine start-up, "the newest English system on a safety of conducting mountain works under the ground" should take place. 

The operator of the mine is &lt;a href="w%3AEvraz%20Group"&gt;♡❤Yuzhkuzbassugol♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, Russia's biggest producer of deep-mined coal. The spokeswoman of the Emergencies Ministry stated that the blast occurred at 08:00 &lt;a href="w%3AGreenwich%20Mean%20Time"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt;, and that eighty-three miners had been safely evacuated from the mine shaft.

At least 10 pets, 9 cats and 1 dog have died as a result of eating contaminated pet food, says the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, or FDA. The contamination caused cats and dogs to both go into kidney failure.

At least 51 brands of cat food and 40 brands of dog food have been recalled. The manufacturer of the food is Menu Foods, which is based in &lt;a href="w%3AMississauga%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Mississauga, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. The brands include: Iams, Nutro, and Eukanuba pet foods. Nestle, Purina PetCare Co., Procter &amp; Gamble and Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc. are voluntarily recalling their pet foods as a precaution. The FDA says that only wet food has been reported to have caused the deaths. The food was sold between December of 2006 and March 3 of 2007. The recall includes pouches and cans of wet food that total over 60 million.

"We are still trying to find out what the true picture is out there of animals. We're talking about 1 percent of the pet food [supply] and it's really just impossible to extrapolate at this point," reported the FDA's head veterinarian, Stephen F. Sundlof.

The manufacturer is currently performing tests to determine what might have caused the contamination, but so far, the source has not been identified.

"We're testing and testing, but we can't identify the problem in the product," said Sarah Tuite, a spokeswoman for Menu Foods.

Anywhere from 40 to 50 cats and dogs were fed the contaminated food during testing by Menu Foods, and at least seven of those animals died. The species or how many cats or dogs died during testing is not known.

The FDA says that the possible cause of the contamination could be from heavy metals, lead or fungi inside wheat gluten which is used in pet foods as a "filler."

A complete list of the products recalled can be found here: &lt;a href="http%3A//www.menufoods.com/recall"&gt;Menu Foods Recall List&lt;/a&gt;. Pet owners are urged to stop using any and all food on that list that may still be in their home. Owners are also asked to seek immediate veterinarian attention if the pets are suspected of eating the food. 

The recall could cost over 30 million USD.

A penalty by &lt;a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; in the 76th minute was all that separated &lt;a href="Manchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C."&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; earlier today at Old Trafford. The FA Cup 6th round replay was forced after a Ronaldo penalty a week ago which tied the last match at 2-2, sending the second game to Old Trafford. Middlesbrough started with the deadly strike pair of Mark Viduka and Yakubu up front, while Manchester had Alan Smith and &lt;a href="Wayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt; as paired strikers.

United came out with the first good chances of the game as Wayne Rooney had an attempt on net, but saw his shot blocked by defender Jonathan Woodgate. Nemanja Vidic then had a chance for United off a Giggs corner, but his powerful header was held by keeper Mark Schwarzer. Ronaldo then had a shot on net after the ball fortuitously fell to his feet, but the Portuguese midfielders strike flew just wide. Middlesbrough survived through the first onslaught and had their first real chance on 16 minutes when a deflected pass by Xavier found its way to Mark Viduka, but his shot flew wide of Tomasz Kuszczak's goal. Woodgate soon saved Middlesbrough again as he blocked a cross net pass from Ronaldo which was aimed for a wide open Alan Smith. Wayne Rooney was then given a clear run in on goal after he was found by a well time through ball from Giggs, but Mark Schwarzer spread wide to snatch the ball from Rooney's feet. Mark Viduka then made space in the United penalty box and dropped off a pass for Stuart Downing, but his right footed shot flew wide yet again. 

Ronaldo again threatened 'Boro, but he saw his wide angled shot bang off the post after rounding Schwarzer. Rooney again was given a break away on net, but he was again stopped by the Australian Schwarzer. Soon after, Jonathan Woodgate brought Ronaldo down in the box, and United were awarded a penalty. Ronaldo sent the ball high and to the left of Schwarzer as the keeper went the wrong way, and United took the lead. Middlesbrough had little more in the way of attacking threat, with a wide shot by Morrison being all they could muster. The game did end on a sour note, however, after a few scuffles and a cynical challenge on Ronaldo by James Morrison saw several yellow cards handed out and Morrison was shown red. 

United will take on Watford in the semifinals of the cup while Middlesbrough have only the Premier League to focus on now, with their next match being played at West Ham.

Two second half goals by Andrei Shevchenko and Shaun Wright-Phillips were enough to give Chelsea a lift to the FA Cup semifinals earlier today at White Hart Lane. The first of the matches ended in a 3-3 draw last week at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea had to come from 3-1 down to force the replay. Dimitar Berbatov, who scored in the last game, was paired up front with Robbie Keane for Tottenham, while Chelsea played Andrei Shevchenko and Didier Drogba up front as strikers. Martin Atkinson was the match referee for the evening at White Hart Lane in London.

Both teams started at a frantic pace, neither wanting to go to extra time in the match. The first real chance fell to Tottenham's Robbie Keane after he was found by Berbatov's flick, but Ashley Cole's last gasp dive blocked the Irishman's shot. Chelsea were restricted to long range efforts at the start of the half with two shots by Ballack and one by Wright-Phillips flying wide of the net. Spurs had two more chances from Dawson and Berbatov, but neither troubled Chelsea keeper Petr Cech.

After the restart, Tottenham had several quick chances, but Cech was able to stop both a cross in to Chimbonda and a low drive from Steed Malbranque. Shevchenko then produced a well taken goal by running down the left, cutting to his left foot, and curling an unstoppable shot past England international keeper Paul Robinson. Chelsea doubled their lead 7 minutes later through Shaun Wright-Phillips after his first-time shot went across Robinson and into the back of the net. Martin Jol responded to the Chelsea goals by replacing Malbranque with Jermain Defoe, but the next few attempts on goal from Spurs would be off target shots by Zokora. Ricardo Carvalho then brought down Berbatov in the penalty area and were awarded a penalty by referee Martin Atkinson. Robbie Keane scored from the spot putting pressure on Chelsea for the last 10 minutes of the game. Spurs pushed forward, but were unable to convert any chances, and they were eliminated from the FA Cup.

The win gives Chelsea a date in the cup semifinals against Blackburn, while Tottenham's next match is at home to Reading in the Premiership.

&lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo was released by his &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; captors in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, Monday, after having been kidnapped and held hostage since March 5, 2007. Mastrogiacomo's intrepreter is believed to have been released as well, though no details are reported.

Mastrogiacomo, a reporter with Italian newspaper ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Repubblica"&gt;La Repubblica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, was taken captive in &lt;a href="Helmand%20Province"&gt;Helmand Province&lt;/a&gt; along with his Afghan interpreter and his driver, while attempting to obtain interviews with members of the Taliban.

In a television interview after his release, Mastrogiacomo expressed his gratitude to those that worked for his release. "I'm very happy, I thank you all. I knew you wouldn't abandon me", said Mastrogiacomo.

He also described some horrors that he witnessed while in captivity. Syed Agha had been killed in front of him by their captors. "I saw him being decapitated, it was horrific", Mastrogiacomo recalled.

The driver, Syed Agha was reportedly decapitated by his captors for "spying" in the presence of Mastrogiacomo. Agha's family blockaded the hospital in Lashkar Gah where Mastrogiacomo was being treated, demanding to know what happened to Agha. For reasons still unclear, security forces arrested the head of that hospital, Rahamatullah Hanafi.

Taliban commander &lt;a href="Mullah%20Dadullah"&gt;Mullah Dadullah&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that the release of Mastrogiacomo and his interpreter was secured through the exchange of five senior Taliban members.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20prime%20minister"&gt;Italian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Romano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt; suggested it was not a simple task to secure Mastrogiacomo's release, which was obtained with the help of Italian authorities, humanitarian officials and the Afghan government.

According to Italian officials, Mastrogiacomo is to travel to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday and then secure a flight to Italy.

On Monday the second largest &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; search engine &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; introduced its new service called oneSearch. The service represents a search system that delivers locally relevant answers for &lt;a href="w%3Amobile%20phone"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; users. 

The company will first launch its service in the United States and then make it international. OneSearch is to push aside Yahoo's main competitor &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; in the field of mobile Web search.

Marco Boerries, who works as a senior vice president of Yahoo's Connected Life business unit, said that the company is now working on putting search on every phone that includes a &lt;a href="w%3Aweb%20browser"&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt;.

OneSearch provides several services including: news headlines, images from Yahoo's Flickr photos site, business listings, local weather and links to other Web sites. 

Yahoo's officials said that the company has already begun offering OneSearch on 85% of existing mobile phones that include Web browsers.

The search results are delivered on a single page and are set in categories. The results are prioritized according to the calculation that Yahoo computers make about a specific information that the customer is trying to make.

The company signed deals with several major mobile phone manufacturers, including: &lt;a href="w%3ASamsung"&gt;Samsung Electronics Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANokia"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMotorola"&gt;Motorola Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALG%20Electronics"&gt;LG Electronics Inc.&lt;/a&gt;

Yahoo also promised to help advertisers gain phone customers. Because users make their searches on their phones, they can directly reach the advertiser by clicking on a link.
Yahoo's new service, oneSearch runs sponsored ad which is being linked to Web search results and display advertisements. OneSearch may also run mini-banner ads developed for mobile phone screens.

It might take some time before Yahoo could actually see positive financial results of its product. Nevertheless its developers are quite happy with the result of their work.

"We have our missing Boy Scout," said Tina White of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; National Park Service.

"Search and rescuers who located him have their hands on him. He is in the care of search and rescue workers. Probably the most important thing we heard on the radio is A-1, which means he is in good condition," added White.

The 12 year-old boy was dehydrated but unharmed. He went missing when he walked away from the campsite, during lunch time, where his scout troop was staying in the mountains of North Carolina. He wanted to sleep in Saturday morning and stayed behind at the campsite with an adult scout leader.

"He was in good spirits [when he disappeared]. He ate lunch, chatting with the boys. He was walking around with I think some Pringles and a mess kit. The next moment, sounds like a blink of the eye, he was gone," said the boy's father, Kent Auberry.

Members of the boy's church were praying for his safe return when the news broke that he was found alive.

"This shows that when everybody works together, good things happen. We just believed that he was going to be found," said Susan Norman Vickers, the associate minister of the Christ United Methodist Church.

The boy had been missing for over 4 days. Some 70 people with heat detecting equipment and a plane helped in the search.

According to &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s chief envoy, Kenichiro Sasae, &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; will not take part in 6-party talks regarding their nuclear program until the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; releases US$25 million of North Korean funds frozen by the U.S. government in a &lt;a href="Macau"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt; bank. 

A meeting, scheduled to take place today between the 6 nations involved in the talks, was cancelled as North Korea did not receive the money.

"There was no progress at all today. China as chairman (of the talks) urged North Korea to come to the table but they would not come. According to &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, North Korea said they will not come to join further discussions until they confirm that their money got into their bank account in China," said Sasae.

According to the US, however, the issue of frozen funds from the Macau lender &lt;a href="w%3ABanco_Delta_Asia"&gt;Banco Delta&lt;/a&gt; was "resolved." The money can be "used solely for the betterment of the North Korean people," said Daniel Glaser, the U.S. Deputy Assistant Treasury.

"[The funds will be released] in accordance with the instructions of the account holders," said a statement by The Monetary Authority of Macau.

The nations participating in the talks to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program are the United States, Japan, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; and host, China, as well as North Korea itself.

North Korea agreed on February 13 to dismantle their nuclear program by April 14, 2007.

&lt;a href="w%3ASpaceX"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; Corporation launched its &lt;a href="w%3AFalcon%20I"&gt;Falcon I&lt;/a&gt; rocket today from &lt;a href="w%3AKwajalein%20Atoll"&gt;Kwajalein Atoll&lt;/a&gt;. Liftoff occurred at 6:00 PM PDT, following two previous launch aborts this week.

The first stage was completely successful, although there appeared to be some problems with the second stage. The sub-orbital flight reached an altitude of 300 km, and is on a traectory for re-entry. It was intended to go into orbit, but contact was lost before this could be accomplished

This is the second launch for the low-cost SpaceX rocket, and the first successful launch for the company. The previous launch had a successful lift-off, but failed 35 seconds into the flight and crashed near to the launch pad due to a fuel leak in the engine.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASpaceX"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFalcon%201"&gt;Falcon 1&lt;/a&gt; rocket has failed to place a &lt;a href="w%3ADARPA"&gt;DARPA&lt;/a&gt; demonstration payload into orbit, on its first flight into space. The rocket launched from &lt;a href="w%3AOmelek%20Island"&gt;Omelek Island&lt;/a&gt;, at 01:10 &lt;a href="w%3AGMT"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3A21%20March"&gt;21 March&lt;/a&gt;, just less than a year after its maiden flight which failed just seconds after launch.

The rocket, which is the first privately-funded liquid-fueled &lt;a href="w%3ALaunch%20vehicle"&gt;launch vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, was intended to place the payload into a &lt;a href="w%3ALow%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;low-Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;, but all contact with the rocket was lost just over five minutes into the flight.

The first stage burn proceeded nominally, and separation occurred on schedule. As the first stage fell away from the second, it was observed to have impacted on the engine bell of the second stage. About five minutes into the flight, the second stage began to roll out of control. All data was lost at T+5 minutes, 5 seconds.

Mr Debnam has posted on &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21%20Answers"&gt;Yahoo! Answers&lt;/a&gt; asking voters how NSW could be fixed.

Mr Debnam said he felt there was a great number of issues left neglected in the state and asked for suggestions on how to fix the state. "I believe there are a great number of issues left neglected in this state what are your suggestions to fix NSW?" said Mr Debnam. It is the first time a major Australian politician has used a community-driven site to poll voters.

Mr Debnam will be contesting the &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;NSW Premiership&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; to be held on Saturday, March 24.

Posters on the site have complained about issues ranging from poor transport infrastructure, the state's economy, emergency room waiting times and the funding of NSW schools.

"Every day, you hear of another operator. It's just causing so much death so quickly that it's startling," said acting state apiarist, Dennis vanEngelsdorp who works for the &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; Department of Agriculture.

At least 30 to 60 percent of the bees on the west coast of the U.S. have died or disappeared. The east coast and the state of &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; have reported a nearly 70 percent loss of bees. A 20 percent drop in bee population is expected each winter and is considered normal.
"Anything above [a] 30 percent [loss] is concerning," added vanEngelsdorp.

"It’s as high as 100 percent in Texas and one guy in &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; has 27 hives left out of 1,400 hives. It’s to the point now where we’re starting to contact some crisis management people," said David Hackenberg who is one of the largest beekeepers in Pennsylvania.

"I’ve never seen anything like it. My hives are just getting emptied. There’s nobody home," said beekeeper, David Bradshaw.

The bees are reportedly leaving their hives to search for flowers to pollinate, and then never return home. The queen bee, nurse bee and baby bees remain in the hives only to die. Some call it a "colony collapse disorder."

"We see dead bee hives with no dead bees and nothing will live in the hive. If I had to guess, 40 percent of the bees along the East Coast are dead since September of last year. In the West Coast, it’s 25 percent and almost everybody is on either coast," said a beekeeper in &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%2C%20Montana"&gt;Columbus, Montana&lt;/a&gt;, Lance Sundberg who runs the Sunshine Apiary bee hives. Sundberg has said that his bee count went from 5,600 in June of 2006 to less than 3,800 in February of 2007. He says mites might have caused at least half of the loss with the other half unexplainable.

Scientists say that the cause of the deaths and disappearances could be natural causes. Some also say that some bees became disoriented or could have been infected with mites, which could cause a lethal virus to overcome the bees. Other theories include the spread of a bee virus or a possible fungus which could cause them to die, poor nutrition and inbreeding. Scientists say that cell phone towers and crops that have been genetically engineered are not suspected of being a cause.

The disappearances could be more serious than they sound-without bees to pollinate crops, in a few years time there could be a dramatic drop in the harvests in the affected states.

&lt;a href="w%3ATracheal%20mites"&gt;Tracheal mites&lt;/a&gt; were the cause of a drop in bee population in 1985. After two years passed, the &lt;a href="w%3AVarroa%20jacobson"&gt;Varroa jacobson mite&lt;/a&gt;, which sucks the blood out of the bees, killed nearly 80% of bees in &lt;a href="w%3AMontana"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;.

Pesticides may also be to blame which could cause the bees to literally get lost on their journey back home.

"One-third of the food you eat is dependent upon honeybee pollination. If that one-third doesn’t happen, I don’t know what will occur at the grocery store," added Sundberg.

Montana is the U.S.'s 5th largest producer of honey and exports hundreds of thousands of bees to &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to help with the pollination of almond plants.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Today, the satellite radio providers &lt;a href="w%3AXM%20Satellite%20Radio"&gt;XM Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASirius%20Satellite%20Radio"&gt;Sirius Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt; submitted a joint application to transfer control of their ground and space-based transmitters to the new, merged company. This is a major step for the XM/Sirius merger deal, as FCC approval represents a major hurdle for the merger. This document also answers some questions that have plagued subscribers of both services.

While there is not much information for the casual listener, two of the most frequently asked questions have been addressed, at least in part:

Pricing has been clarified, to some exeent. From the FCC filing: 
"After the merger, customers may elect to receive fewer channels at a monthly price lower than $12.95;
substantially similar programming at the existing $12.95 price; or more channels, including some
of the 'best of both' networks, at a modest premium to the cost of one service, and considerably
less than the cost of subscribing to both services." The document goes on to explain that channel blocking will be available, and that credit will be given for blocked channels.

The filing also addresses the potential need for new receivers. "Subscribers could continue to use their existing radios or eventually purchase new radios capable of receiving all of the content of both services when they become available." Apparently, some programming will be available on both networks, but this will be limited. To get the full range of programming, subscribers will need new equipment.

Another major stumbling block for the merger deal is the potential for monopoly. To counter the arguments that the merged company will become a monopoly, the document goes on to describe the nature of satellite radio's competition: HD radio, Internet radio, AM and FM radio, portable media players, mobile phones, and even CD players. "It is clear that all of the above providers view themselves as being in direct competition
with each other," the document alleges, and then goes on to quote statements by the National Association of Broadcasters in support of this assertion. "local radio stations compete for listeners with other forms of audio delivery offering an almost unlimited array of content. IPods and other MP3 players, music [subscription] services, podcasting and the Internet streaming of U.S. and foreign radio stations literally provide content from around the world to listeners in each local radio market in America."

As this is only the first step in the FCC process, and the FCC is only one of three major steps in the merger process, the deal is far from over. However, convincing the FCC that the merger should happen will remove a major barrier in the companies' efforts.

<h1>Church of Sweden open to homosexual weddings</h1>

The &lt;a href="w%3ALutheran"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; Church of &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; will perform gay wedding ceremonies if the government legalizes same-sex marriage, according to Claes-Bertil Ytterberg, Bishop for the &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; Church Assembly that is the decision-making body for the Church of Sweden. 

Sweden recognized same-sex civil unions in &lt;a href="w%3A1995"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;, but full marriage between persons of the same sex has remained illegal. Recently government-appointed committee has concluded civil-unions law outdated and recommended that the parliament would allow legal same-sex marriages. 

The church is going to support legalizing for same sex marriage and open its doors for gay and lesbian ceremonies. The church leaves it up to the individual priest whether to perform such a ceremony or not, according to the bishop. 

Even though &lt;a href="w%3Ahomosexual"&gt;homosexual&lt;/a&gt; couples would be wed in the same way as straight couples, the church would like the ceremony to be called something else because "the word wedding is so traditional and is reserved for men and women." 

The &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Sweden"&gt;Church of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; already performs blessings for same-sex couples, as in &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; when special church ceremonies to mark homosexual civil unions were allowed. There are still some rifts on the issue within the Church of Sweden, however they have become less visible, the bishop says. 

According to the statistics 7 million of Sweden's citizens belong to the Lutheran Church of Sweden, however fewer than 4% are reported to attend Sunday services.

Luckyrajah Paramanatha, known by his nickname "Lucky", claimed his $18 million &lt;a href="w%3ALotto%20649"&gt;Lotto 649&lt;/a&gt; jackpot Tuesday.
The previously purchased free play lottery ticket was bought at the Sunny Convenience Store on Eglinton Avenue East in &lt;a href="w%3AScarborough%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Scarborough, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; (a suburb of Toronto). He checked them on March 19, the official draw date.

"I'm so happy," Paramanathan said. "I can't stop smiling...I started screaming. I never imagined I would win this much. I'm still shocked and overwhelmed."

Paramanatha, 43, who lives in Scarborough, moved to Canada seven years ago and is a maintenance worker at a Toronto apartment building and cleans city swimming pools. He earns $48,000 a year from both jobs. Paramanatha said that he has been playing the lottery ever since he moved to get his wife and two sons, aged 7 and 10, from &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; to move to Canada.

"This win will allow me to bring my wife and two sons to Canada to start a new life," he said.

He currently lives in an apartment building with his friend but plans later to buy a house with his family.

After Armstrong scored, the Islanders' defense tightened, and would not give up another goal. &lt;a href="w%3ATrent%20Hunter"&gt;Trent Hunter&lt;/a&gt; scored a goal on an Islanders power play 2:37 into the 2nd period, assisted by &lt;a href="w%3A%20Miroslav%20Satan"&gt;Miroslav Satan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Campoli"&gt;Chris Campoli&lt;/a&gt;. Less than three minutes later, &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Blake"&gt;Jason Blake&lt;/a&gt; would notch his 36th of the year, beating Penguins goalie &lt;a href="Marc-Andre%20Fleury"&gt;Marc-Andre Fleury&lt;/a&gt;. Blake's goal was assisted by &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Smith"&gt;Ryan Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A%20Tom%20Poti"&gt;Tom Poti&lt;/a&gt;. New York would seal the deal at 1:42 in the 3rd period when &lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Kozlov"&gt;Viktor Kozlov&lt;/a&gt; scored his 22nd goal of the season, with &lt;a href="w%3AAlexei%20Yashin"&gt;Alexei Yashin&lt;/a&gt; and Miroslav Satan assisting on the play.

In a Public Safety Bulletin released March 20, 2007, a &lt;a href="w%3ACoroner"&gt;coroner&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Victoria, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, Canada, warns on the dangers of purchasing pills from online companies.

Rose Stanton, Regional Coroner for the &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Island"&gt;Vancouver Island&lt;/a&gt; area, has linked the purchase of pills on the Internet to the recent death of a &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; woman.

The woman, a 57-year old from the &lt;a href="w%3ACampbell%20River%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Campbell River&lt;/a&gt; area, died from poisoning, according to preliminary test results. The precise cause of death is still being investigated by police and the coroners service, according to Stanton.

In late December 2006, the woman had told friends of feeling unwell with flu-like symptoms, and had experienced hair-loss and blurred vision. She died a few days later.

Pills found in the possession of the dead woman were traced back to a purchase the woman made on a health-related website. The death is thought to be the first in Canada caused by pills purchased on the Internet.

Analysis of the pills by the Provincial Toxicology Centre revealed that some contained an &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-anxiety"&gt;anti-anxiety&lt;/a&gt; drug, obtained normally with a prescription in Canada. In addition, the pills contained a &lt;a href="w%3ASedative"&gt;sedative&lt;/a&gt; not legally sold in Canada, which has been linked to overdose deaths in other countries.

On further testing, the pills were found to contain a non-medicinal filler and revealed the presence of &lt;a href="w%3AHeavy_metals"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt;, some of which can cause serious illness, according to the Bulletin.

"We cannot impress upon the public strongly enough the dangers of buying medications online from a company you don't know," said Stanton. "There is just no way of knowing what you are getting."

The website in question belonged to a group of companies which, according to the coroner's investigation, change websites and Internet addresses every few days.

The B.C. Coroners Service is recommending that if someone has purchased drugs over the Internet that they are uncertain about, they should bring them, in the original packaging, to a pharmacy for proper disposal.

One full grown dinosaur and two young ones are the first evidence of any burrowing dinosaur to be discovered by scientists and is also the first evidence that a dinosaur cared for their offspring in dens.

"Burrowing behaviour allows vertebrates to escape harsh environmental conditions. Small dinosaurs could potentially have withstood severe conditions, such as drought or ... temperature extremes. Survival of terrestrial vertebrates at the end-Cretaceous event has been attributed to sheltering behaviour, with the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs resulting from their inability to find an appropriate cover," said &lt;a href="w%3AMontana%20State%20University"&gt;Montana State University&lt;/a&gt;'s chief researcher, David Varricchio.

The new dinosaur has been called "Oryctodromeus cubicularis" which is being defined as the "digging runner of the lair."

"Here we have the burrow, den, an adult with traits for digging, and two juveniles, all in the same place. It doesn't get much better than that," said researcher at &lt;a href="w%3AEmory%20University"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt;, Anthony Martin.

The remains were found in an area that was once covered by an ancient flood, but Varricchio states that the flood was not the cause of the dinosaurs death.

"The bones are disarticulated; they are not in life position. It's not like they were sitting in the burrow and a flooding event filled the chamber with sediment and they were entombed. They must have died, undergone decay and then the burrow was filled," added Varricchio.

The fully grown dinosaur is at least 2.1 meters long and weighed nearly 22 to 32 kilograms. Scientists say that the dinosaurs are nearly 95 million years old and are from the Cretaceous period of dinosaurs. In evolutionary terms, the dinosaur lived just before the asteroid impact that made dinosaurs extinct.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ministries of Public Order and Economy announced that they offer the amount of 800,000 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeuros"&gt;euros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to those who will submit information that could help authorities in the fight against local &lt;a href="terrorism%20laws"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;.

This effort by the Greek government has been fully supported by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEmbassy%20of%20the%20United%20States%20in%20Athens"&gt;Embassy of the United States in Athens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which, in a statement, announced that offers up to $1 million to those who will significantly help towards the capture of terrorists.

&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20party%20of%20canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliment%23Canada"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MP) &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Comuzzi"&gt;Joe Comuzzi&lt;/a&gt;, 73, was ousted from the Liberal caucus today by leader &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;.

The move was in response to Comuzzi's intention to support the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20party%20of%20canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; government's second budget, tabled March 20, 2007. Comuzzi supports the budget because it has funding for a cancer research centre that will hire 300 people in his riding of &lt;a href="w%3AThunder%20Bay%E2%80%94Superior%20North"&gt;Thunder Bay—Superior North&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ontario"&gt;Northern Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

"It's for a single issue that's of absolute critical importance to all the people in Thunder Bay and northwestern Ontario, and that's the cancer research centre," he said in response to his decision.

Following a March 21 caucus meeting, Dion told reporters "I spoke with him. He said that he will vote for this bad budget." Dion explained that it was obligatory for his MPs to follow party direction on confidence measures, such as the latest budget. "He's well aware, after 19 years in the House, of the consequences of what he's doing,"

Comuzzi, first elected to the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; in 1988, had resigned a junior cabinet position previously in 2005, in protest of &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Matin"&gt;Paul Matin's&lt;/a&gt; then Liberal government's support of same-sex marriage. He had held the Minister of State responsible for the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario (FedNor) portofio.

Comuzzi will sit as an Independent and had previously said he will not run in the next federal election. He is now one of the two only Independent MPs in the House.

The move will leave the Liberals with 100 seats in the House. Out of all the 308 seats in the House, the governing Conservatives have 125 seats, the Bloc Québécois have 50, and the New Democrats have 29.

The UK &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry_of_Defence_%2528United_Kingdom%2529"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; (MoD) confirmed in a news release, March 21, 2007, that two &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal_navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; crew members had been killed in an accident aboard nuclear submarine &lt;a href="w%3AHMS_Tireless_%2528S88%2529"&gt;HMS Tireless&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the day. The next of kin for both men have been informed.

Another submariner had been injured and was airlifted to a &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States military hospital&lt;/a&gt; for treatment. His injuries are not considered life-threatening.

The accident occurred at 4:20 a.m., March 21, on board HMS Tireless, a Trafalgar class submarine, during a joint US-UK exercise in the Arctic.

The MoD suggested that the accident involved a piece of air-purification equipment in the forward section of the submarine. The submarine was not in danger and its nuclear reactor was unaffected. HMS Tireless is a hunter-killer submarine and does not carry nuclear missiles.

HMS Tireless was submerged under the ice cap at the time of the incident. The crew brought the submarine to surface quickly through the ice.

The Tireless was fitted, in 2001, with an update to the piece of air-purification machinery thought to have failed. As a precaution, the MoD is restricting its use on other boats until safety checks have been carried out.

"I very much regret that this incident has occurred and my thoughts go out to the family and friends of the men who have lost their lives," said Admiral &lt;a href="w%3AJames_Burnell-Nugent"&gt;Sir James Burnell-Nugent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACommander-in-Chief%20Fleet"&gt;Commander-in-Chief Fleet&lt;/a&gt;.

He added, "I also wish to pay tribute to the crew of HMS Tireless that this incident has been dealt with and contained so professionally."

It was not stated what the official cause of death was.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mass%20wedding%20held%20against%20racism%20in%20Belgium&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
When &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWouter%20Van%20Bellingen"&gt;Wouter Van Bellingen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; became the first black registrar in &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, he knew there would be negative reactions, but he admitted that he didn't expect them to be "so direct, so soon." In February, three couples refused to pledge their wedding vows in front of the first black alderman of the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASint-Niklaas"&gt;Sint-Niklaas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , because of the colour of his skin. After the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARacism"&gt;racist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; incident, Van Bellingen told himself: "If people don't want to marry, then that's not my problem, it's the problem of those people."

But then someone gave him the idea to react with a positive signal against racial discrimination. Together with local NGOs and the Center for Equal Opportunities and against Racial Discrimination, he decided to organise a multicultural group marriage happening to, as mayor of Sint-Niklaas Freddy Willockx describes it, "forge this stupid racist behaviour into an unparallelled positive signal against racism and for tolerance."

<h2>A positive signal against racism</h2>
Mayor Willockx told the press about when he first heard about the 3 couples: "I was angry and ashamed that there were such people." He elaborated: "We are not a racist city. 400 meters from here is a center for immigrants, which was installed without contestation from the city council, in spite of fruitless attempts from an intolerant party to set people up against installation of the center."

When asked about the role of the far-right political party &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVlaams%20Belang"&gt;Vlaams Belang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Van Bellingen told Wikinews: "It's true that a climate of fear has been created, but to blame it on a single party would be too easy. It's the responsibility of all parties." Van Bellingen wants to be the councilor of civilian affairs for all citizens, "not just for those who voted for me."

Although Van Bellingen too denies Sint-Niklaas is a racist city, he is often reminded of the colour of his skin. Mayor Willockx gave the example of an incident last Friday, when someone refused to serve him a plate of mussels, because the person mistook the deputy for a waiter.

<h2>It started small</h2>
A spokeswoman for the organising committee told the press that it all started with a "nice little idea" to have a mass wedding event on March 21, the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt;-declared &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Day%20for%20the%20Elimination%20of%20Racial%20Discrimination"&gt;International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . However, they were "really surprised that the event became something huge."

Couples who wanted to renew their vows or pledge them for the first time could register on the event website. Stijn De Maeyer, a volunteer working on the registrations, told Wikinews that they had to close the online registration when some 692 couples had registered, because of logistic limitations. On the evening itself, he estimated that 1 out of 3 couples who showed up hadn't registered beforehand. There were couples from the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and even a couple from &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the Belgian couples were immigrants from &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ivory%20Coast"&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , according to De Maeyer.

<h2>The couples</h2>
While singer Axl Peleman, who demonstrated his concern about racial discrimination in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlanders"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A0110%20concerts"&gt;0110 concerts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last October, opened the podium, the couples began to register on the city's Market Square.
The symbolic wedding pledge was open to anyone, from any culture, age, or sexual preference. For Van Bellingen, "Every person who lives in Flanders is Flemish, it doesn't matter if you live here for a month or for generations." 

The couples were from all ages and all layers of society. Some came in their original wedding costume or dress, to relive the moment of their marriage. Even a group of children from a local primary school came to vow eternal fidelity to a classmate.
One duo queuing for the registration were two undercover reporters from the Dutch television, who wanted to become "the two first ♡❤heterosexual♡❤ men to be wed by a black registrar in Belgium". At the end of the evening, they threw their wedding bouquet off the main stage, shouting: "Whoever catches this, is not a racist."

<h2>Multicultural activities during the event</h2>
Several organisations promoting diversity provided free soup and Arab mint tea to warm the attendees in the rain and cold. Ahmed Hanouch from the sociocultural youth organisation Hidâya told Wikinews: "As new Belgians, we all are looked at differently from time to time. Then we get the feeling we are second-class citizens. The solution is to be open-minded about cultures, like during this event."

For Ahmed, an event like this one would be welcome each year. Van Bellingen however told the press: "At the end of the evening, I will drink a pint, and get on with my life."

On the main stage, several performers from the collective "The African Stage" entertained the growing crowd. Speeches, songs and dancing strengthened the message of diversity that the organisation wanted to send.

Several comedy acts followed, such as "Joeri", a Flemish television character. To warm up the crowd to say "I do", he set the example for registrar Van Bellingen by wedding a special couple; who lived in Sint-Niklaas with their children and who are both deaf. Joeri was assisted by an interpreter for the deaf, who was present all day at the request of Van Bellingen, whose father became deaf some years before he died.

<h2>The 5 challenges</h2>

The culmination of the event came when Van Bellingen held a final speech on the stage, and then started with the symbolic wedding ceremony. He built up the excitement during his speech, explaining that "excitement is important in a relationship." 

The ceremony was planned for about 8 p.m., but was postponed to allow as many as possible of the couples that turned up to register. Van Bellingen then joined in holy matrimony well over 700 couples. He then demonstrated to the couples how to kiss the bride, by kissing his own wife, with whom he has 2 children. The next challenge, a big group hug on the Market Square, wasn't a problem after the kisses.

At that moment, the Flemish radio station Radio 2 took over and started a live DJ set, playing the songs the couples had voted for. The number one wedding dance wasn't Bryan Adams or Clouseau, but ♡❤Ik hou van u♡❤ (I love you) by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANoordkaap"&gt;Noordkaap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a song that already proved popular in 2005 when it was reworked for the celebration of the 175th anniversary of the state of Belgium. 

For the final challenge, those who like international food could select from the wedding buffet, with desserts provided by local communities such as the &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, Syrian, &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;n and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARomani%20people"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; societies, by organisations such as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; immigration center. There were also desserts from &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; and from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Society%20for%20Krishna%20Consciousness"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Together with a wedding cake for 750 people, the organisation hoped to provide for enough desserts for all present, and to end the wedding party in beauty.

"Until today, what we have done has been in accordance with international regulation. But if they take illegal actions, we too can take illegal actions and will do so," said &lt;a href="w%3AAyatollah%20Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;, the top leader of Iran during an address to his nation.

Khamenei also said that he will attack their "enemies" who attack Iran.

"If they want to treat us with threats and enforcement of coercion and violence, undoubtedly they must know that the Iranian nation and authorities will use all their capacities to strike enemies that attack," added Khamenei.

Despite the warning, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has said that the path to resolving their issues with Iran's nuclear enrichment is with "diplomacy."

"Iran is a country very much on the defensive right now. The United States is committed to pursuing a diplomatic solution to the challenges posed by Iran. This will require patience and persistence," said U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20State"&gt;Department of State&lt;/a&gt; undersecretary for political affairs, Nicholas Burns.
Khamenei also stated that "nuclear energy is a must" and "a necessity in the long term. One day oil will dry up. ... The Iranian nation needs nuclear energy for life, not weapons."

&lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; says that they are hopeful that by the end of this week, sanctions will be drawn up and imposed on Iran. 

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; says that they "will not support excessive sanctions" on the Iranian nation and that "this is how they [the U.S.] acted in past times, during the Cold War, when they scared everyone with the Soviet threat and persuaded everybody to group together in a disciplined block," said Russian Foreign Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Lavrov"&gt;Sergei Lavrov&lt;/a&gt;.

A meeting that took place on Wednesday between all 15 member nations of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N. Security Council&lt;/a&gt; was unsuccessful as no conclusion about Iran's nuclear program could be reached.

<h1>Italy confirms swapping Taliban for Mastrogiacomo</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Italy%20confirms%20swapping%20Taliban%20for%20Mastrogiacomo&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo who was held hostage for 15 days, was traded for five &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; prisoners, as confirmed by Italian and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afgani&lt;/a&gt; authorities.

This likely represents the first time during the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29"&gt;War in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; that prisoners were openly exchanged for a hostage. An Afghani government source said the swap "was an exceptional measure taken because we value our relations and friendship with Italy."
The move received sharp criticism from allies of Italy. In Washington, a senior State Department official said the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; was pleased the journalist had been released unharmed, but was troubled by possible ramifications of the swap. A spokesperson at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office"&gt;British Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said the deal sent "the wrong signal to prospective hostage-takers".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaxime%20Verhagen"&gt;Maxime Verhagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Netherlands%29"&gt;Foreign Minister of the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spoke against the swap, "When we create situations where you can buy the freedom of Taliban fighters when you catch a journalist, in the short term there will be no journalists anymore."
The international backlash is the latest headache for &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Italy"&gt;Italian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who has fought hard to keep troops in Afghanistan despite resistance from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apacifist"&gt;pacifists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; within his centre-left coalition.

Prodi briefly resigned last month after a defeat in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over his foreign policy, including Afghanistan, and needs the Senate next week to approve a refinancing of the mission.

An opinion poll published by Mastrogiacomo's newspaper, ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Repubblica"&gt;La Repubblica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, showed that 51 percent of Italians surveyed supported the exchange, while 41 percent opposed it.

<h1>US President Bush and NZ Prime Minister Clark meet</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20President%20Bush%20and%20NZ%20Prime%20Minister%20Clark%20meet&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today, &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George Bush&lt;/a&gt; welcomed &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; to discuss common efforts in the War on Terror and review efforts to advance and strengthen bilateral relations.

The Prime Minister spent 30 minutes at the &lt;a href="w%3AOval%20Office"&gt;Oval Office&lt;/a&gt; with the President, who says the discussions were fruitful and included the importance of America and New Zealand cooperating to help democracy in places such as Afghanistan, commerce, the environment and the need for energy security. 

"We talked about the South Pacific, and I praised the prime minister on her leadership in these difficult issues," President Bush said.

He told reporters he understood that countries in the region needed New Zealand's leadership, with US and Australian assistance.

The US would help "in any way we can," he said.

It was Clark's second formal meeting with the President since she became prime minister, although they have met nine times on other occasions.

The talks in the Oval Office marked the development of a closer relationship between New Zealand and the US, and it was only the third time a New Zealand prime minister has visited the White House in 24 years.

He said he had thanked Clark for New Zealand's commitment to the international force in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Clark, who had lunch with President Bush in the White House after the meeting, said their talks had been constructive.
Clark praised U.S. involvement in Pacific affairs that has increased after a preoccupation with events in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;. The Bush administration said last week it is working to boost its diplomatic presence in the Pacific islands after years of inadequate attention. 

``The U.S. is focusing on the problems of the South Pacific,♡❤ Clark said. ``We've had close coordination.♡❤ 

She said this cooperation included addressing the aftermath of a coup by military leaders who seized power in &lt;a href="w%3AFiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; in December, as well as issues in the &lt;a href="w%3ASolomon%20Islands"&gt;Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="Tonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;, where a deadly riot destroyed most of the capital in November after the government appointed by the royal family was going to defer a plan to introduce democratic reforms. 

The Prime Minister also said that the talks covered a broad list of topics that New Zealand has been a willing partner in helping to address, including counter-terrorism, the work in Afghanistan, work around the North Korean problem and the Iran nuclear issue. However, there was no breakthrough on New Zealand's quest for a free trade deal with the US. Clark feels America is open to the proposal, but says adding any new country to the list at the moment is a fractious issue in Congress which is still trying to deal with the agreements already being negotiated. She also raised the question of trade with the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi yesterday and asked her to look at New Zealand's request sympathetically.

Images from a seismic survey has shown the crater is about 3 miles (6 kilometers) wide, buried under sediment at nearly 4,300 feet and may even still contain the asteroid which is said to still be inside the crater nearly 10 miles below the Earth's surface. The crater is reported to be below an area previously covered by water.

"Analyses of a 3-D seismic survey and well logs in the southwestern Sacramento basin, San Joaquin County, California, have revealed a subsurface, circular, 3 mile (~5.5-km-) diameter anomaly that may represent a previously unrecognized complex impact crater. This unique anomaly, buried 4,500-5,000 ft (1,490–1,600 m) below sea level under the southwestern part of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, is provisionally named the Victoria Island structure for an overlying surface geographic feature," J. R. Morrow of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20State%20University"&gt;San Diego State University&lt;/a&gt; during the 38th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, held in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

In the images, researchers found that the crater contained a "central uplift," or the peak near the center, which researchers say is a good sign that the discovery is a crater created by an asteroid.

This is the second such crater to be found in the central valley of California. The "Cowell structure" which is said to be 0.8 miles wide, is said to be nearly 25 million years old.

Researchers now call the crater "The Victoria Island Structure." The impact would have been as strong as 100,000 nuclear bombs all going off at once.

A ferry operated by &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Ferries"&gt;Sydney Ferries&lt;/a&gt; crashed into a whale-watching ship before hitting the &lt;a href="w%3APyrmont%20Bridge"&gt;Pyrmont Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADarling%20Harbour"&gt;Darling Harbour&lt;/a&gt; at around 1 PM &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEDT&lt;/a&gt; today. The accident is the second incident involving a Sydney ferry in the past two months.

The ♡❤Sirius♡❤, a First Fleet class ferry was carrying around 100 passengers when it attempted to berth at a Darling Harbour warf and failed to stop. It is thought the ferry may have suffered a technical fault. The ♡❤Sirius♡❤ collided with the ♡❤Ocean Dreaming♡❤, a 34-metre whale watching ship which was moored at the nearby Aquarium warf. The ♡❤Ocean Dreaming♡❤ had a sole crew member on board who escaped uninjured.

Sydney Ferries said that none of its passengers were injured in the accident and all disembarked safely.

Will Ford, the operations manager for the ♡❤Ocean Dreaming♡❤ recalled the incident. "It looks like one of the ferries coming into the Aquarium wharf has not stopped, and skidded past our vessel," he said.

"There's a bit of damage to the bow and it's continued on to Pyrmont Bridge where it stopped suddenly."

The incident follows an accident in January, when a Rivercat collided with a small boat, killing a fisherman and injuring his son.

Manager of Sydney Ferries, Geoff Smith defended the safety record of his services. He said ferry services have improved "out of sight" over the past year.

Mr Smith urged the public to put the incident into perspective. "We do about 1,500 along-sides every day, so to have one incident like this, one is too many obviously, but you've got to put that into perspective," he said.

"Safety is Sydney Ferries' highest priority."

Mr Smith told ABC Radio that an investigation would be held into the accident which would involve drug and alcohol testing of the ♡❤Sirius's♡❤ driver and crew but said he could give no further comments until the investigation was complete.

<h1>Study: Drying up rivers to cause freshwater crisis</h1>

Several factors including climate change and pollution may put at risk of drying up some of the largest rivers on the globe, a report by the environmental group &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature"&gt;WWF&lt;/a&gt; says. Following a study of ten rivers currently at risk of drying up, the group warns that without any action the process of drying up might lead to freshwater emergency.
The report analyzes ten rivers, including the &lt;a href="w%3AYangtze"&gt;Yangtze&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AGanges"&gt;Ganges&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASalween"&gt;Salween&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="w%3ADanube"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Grande"&gt;Rio Grande&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;.

The study raises concerns overs dams and dikes, which the report says destroy 80 percent of river basin's wetlands and floodplains.

Another problem is the extraction of water for agriculture. The environment group states that active extraction of water, such as in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndus"&gt;Indus&lt;/a&gt; river, takes its toll on our planet's rivers. Over-extraction might lead to its scarcity and have a serious negative impact on freshwater fish populations, which represents an important food source.

The report says governments should ensure better protection of rivers and provide more sustainable water use, in such a way that people's livelihoods are protected.

According to Dr David Tickner, head of WWF UK's Freshwater programme, the freshwater crisis is a serious problems that could worsen as climate changes. He said that preserving rivers and providing security of water flows should be seen as part of national security, health and economic success.

According to a survey conducted by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWebmasterWorld"&gt;WebmasterWorld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; some web sites, providing free web space for amateur bloggers contain in many cases mostly spam. Certain queries showed even a rate of 100% spam.

Experts from WebmasterWorld provided precise figures and statistics to their survey. For example the following list shows the percentage of spam on different popular sites providing free bloggers' web space:

The present research was based on most popular queries on the blog sites. Among other the WebmasterWorld experts used the query ♡❤phentermine♡❤ on &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤♡blogspot.com♡❤♡ and ♡❤ringtone♡❤ on ♡❤♡hometown.aol.com♡❤♡. These queries proved that there blogospheres contained more than 74% &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpam%20blog"&gt;splogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The researchers said that the main reason for this big amount of splogs was the fact that the web-space provided on the mentioned sites was free, thus the spammers don't have to bother buying a domain and paying its support.

&lt;a href="w%3AMarshall%20Faulk"&gt;Marshall Faulk&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;'s 9th all time rushing yards leader is expected to announce his retirement from professional football March 26th at the NFL's annual owners meeting in &lt;a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Rams"&gt;St. Louis Rams&lt;/a&gt; runningback released this statement, "It has been an honor and pleasure to play in the National Football League. I'd like to thank all my teammates and coaches with whom I've been associated over the past 13 seasons as well as the fans who supported me throughout the years. I gave the game my passion, and it gave me a wonderful career and memories that I will always be thankful for."

Faulk played for &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20State%20University"&gt;San Diego State University&lt;/a&gt; before being drafted by &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Colts"&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. After five seasons with the Colts, Faulk was traded to the &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Rams"&gt;St. Louis Rams&lt;/a&gt;, where he would lead the team to a &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; championship. Faulk spent the entire 2006 NFL season on the injured reserve after having major reconstructive knee surgery.

Besides ranking 9th in career rushing yards with 12,279, Faulk ends his 13 year pro career with 100 career touchdowns, tied for sixth all-time. Faulk was named the &lt;a href="w%3ANFL%20MVP"&gt;NFL's Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt; in 2000, after setting an NFL single-season record for rushing touchdowns in a single season with 26. He was also named the Offensive Player of the Year three times in his career.

Many professors at universities throughout the United States have recently adopted policies prohibiting &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the free online encyclopedia, from being used as a primary source in reports.

Neil Walters, a history professor at &lt;a href="w%3AMiddlebury%20College"&gt;Middlebury College&lt;/a&gt; claims that vandalism of Wikipedia was used as a source in reports submitted to him. 

Walters' department adopted a policy banning the use of Wikipedia as a primary source, while allowing it to be used for background information. Individual professors at other schools, including &lt;a href="w%3AUCLA"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Pennsylvania"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, have taken up this policy.

Wikipedia contributors regularly review the articles, but with the English version of the site recently reaching 1 million articles, they can rarely take time to protect every entry against subtle vandalism.

Wikipedia's guidelines, and the statements of its founder, &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, have advised against using Wikipedia or other encyclopedias as a primary source.

<h1>River Thames to receive clean-up with new tunnel</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=River%20Thames%20to%20receive%20clean-up%20with%20new%20tunnel&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At an event at Abbey Mills pumping station in Stratford, East London on March 22, 2007, UK Environment Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIan_Pearson"&gt;Ian Pearson&lt;/a&gt; announced an ambitious project to clean up the &lt;a href="w%3ARiver_Thames"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

A tunnel, 30 kilometres in length, will be built alongside the river to intercept sewage and stormwater runoff that flows into the Thames currently. The tunnel would shunt the wastewater to a treatment facility in East London. Some 52 million cubic metres of wastewater streams into the Thames each year.

According to a Parliamentary Statement released March 22, the discharges kill fish, create a higher health hazard for users of the river and reduce the aesthetic appeal of the Thames.

“London today is more densely populated, and the greater urbanisation – such as the increase in paved areas – has led to more and faster rainwater run-off and, unfortunately, to an increase in storm overflows into the river," said David Owens, &lt;a href="w%3AThames_Water"&gt;Thames Water’s&lt;/a&gt; Chief Executive Officer in a press release.

“London’s sewers are one of the great engineering wonders of the Victorian age and have served the capital well for more than 150 years," continued Owens.

The tunnel is projected to cost a minimum £2 billion and would be considered the largest such project undertaken in Great Britain.

The announcement comes after six years of detailed study. Experts such as the Thames Tideway Strategic Study, consultants Jacobs Babtie, and Thames Water played a significant role in determining a solution. All recommended a tunnel under the Thames as the right approach to the problem.

"We haven't reached this decision in a vacuum," said Pearson. "A wide range of players have been instrumental in getting us to this point and I thank them all." Further work on the project, such as detailed design, planning and funding, will now follow.
Funding the project, admits Pearson, may put a strain on ratepayers. "This will inevitably mean some extra costs for customers, but it will deliver tangible benefits for London in the long-term," said Pearson. It is estimated that it will add around £37 to Thames Water sewerage bills by 2017.

There has been criticism of projected expenses. "The costs will be met wholly through increases in consumers' bills," said David Bland, chairman of Consumer Council for Water Thames, in a BBC interview. He suggested the fees "will be far more than most are willing or expecting to pay."

Proceeding with the tunnel would not only improve the environmental quality of the Thames, suggests the government, it would also help satisfy European obligations on sewage treatment.

The project is expected to be completed by 2019/20.

Senior Judge Lowell Reed Jr. of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Pennsylvania"&gt;U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; issued a permanent &lt;a href="w%3AInjunction"&gt;injunction&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday against the &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20Online%20Protection%20Act"&gt;Child Online Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; (COPA) passed in 1998 that says it is a crime to make online pornography accessible for underage children.

Reed expressed "personal regret at having to set aside yet another attempt to protect our children from harmful material" but said that adults would "do the minors of this country harm, if First Amendment protections, which they will with age inherit fully, are chipped away in the name of their protection."

He added that software filters would be more effective in protecting children than the COPA.

Chris Hansen of the &lt;a href="w%3AACLU"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt;, the plaintiffs, said that were the law to go into effect, "all Internet would have had to be brought down to a level that is acceptable to a 6-year-old and that would have had a devastating effect on the kind of interactions that take place on the Internet."

According to the law, which became effective in 1998 but had been barred from enforcement by the Supreme Court, websites containing "commercial" pornography are required to verify that the person looking at the material is of age, by asking for a credit card number. The law says that it would stop minors from viewing material that is "harmful by contemporary community standards."

One advocacy group, Enough is Enough which tries to protect underage children from Internet predators and pornography, spoke out against the ruling.

"It’s a very frustrating decision. We have an epidemic problem of kids accessing pornographic material online. Pornographers continue to get a free pass on the Internet from our federal courts, and efforts by Congress keep getting trumped," said president of the organization, Donna Rice Hughes.

If websites were caught not following the law, penalties could range from a 6 month jail sentence and fines of up to $50,000 [USD].

The United States Attorney's office is reported to be looking over the ruling and trying to make a decision on whether to try and appeal the decision in Supreme Court.

Three men suspected of involvement in the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;July 7 suicide bombings&lt;/a&gt; in London have been detained by terrorist police, in the first major arrests in the case following the attacks following a lengthy police investigation.

Two of the suspects were detained at &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20Airport"&gt;Manchester Airport&lt;/a&gt; while they were attempting to board a plane to Pakistan, while the other was found in &lt;a href="w%3ALeeds"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;.

The arrests in Manchester occurred around 1300 GMT while the arrest in Leeds took place around 1600 GMT.

Fifty-two people were killed in the 2005 bombings on three London Underground trains and buses. The devices used were detonated by four bombers.

Police are able to hold the suspects for twenty-eight days under the &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorism%20Act%202006"&gt;new anti-terror laws&lt;/a&gt;. The four men have been held on the suspicion of the commission, preparation, or instigation of terrorist acts.

&lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka%20cricket%20team"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; by 69 runs in a crucial Group B match at the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Park%20Oval"&gt;Queen's Park Oval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APort%20of%20Spain"&gt;Port of Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATrinidad%20and%20Tobago"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt;.

Victory means that Sri Lanka to progress through to the Super 8 stage with 2 points, however India's loss means that they are out of the tournament if Bangladesh beats World-Cup debutants and currently winless Bermuda, who both India and Sri Lanka beat by over 200 runs. Ducks from Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar, two of India's most touted batsmen prior to the World Cup, sealed the loss although Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag built a strong partnership during the middle overs.

&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indian%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3AIreland%20cricket%20team"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; by 8 wickets (with 59 balls remaining) in the final Group D match of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ASabina%20Park"&gt;Sabina Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKingston%2C%20Jamaica"&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;.

As both teams had already sealed their progress to the Super 8 stage, this match was effectively a Super 8 encounter, as the points won today were carried through to the next stage.

Ireland were missing their captain &lt;a href="w%3ATrent%20Johnson"&gt;Trent Johnson&lt;/a&gt; after he failed to recover from a shoulder injury. Johnson was replaced by &lt;a href="w%3AJohn_Mooney_%28cricketer%29"&gt;John Mooney&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="w%3AKyle%20McCallan"&gt;Kyle McCallan&lt;/a&gt; deputised as captain.

Rain delays toward the end of Ireland's innings meant the game was reduced to a 48 over match. West Indies' target was therefore revised under the &lt;a href="w%3ADuckworth-Lewis%20method"&gt;Duckworth-Lewis method&lt;/a&gt; to 190 runs from their 48 overs.
&lt;b&gt;Toss:&lt;/b&gt; Ireland won, and decided to bat first.

&lt;b&gt;Fall of wickets:&lt;/b&gt; 1-3 (Porterfield, 1.2 ov), 2-61 (Morgan, 15.3 ov), 3-76 (NJ O'Brien, 20.2 ov), 4-82 (Bray, 21.6 ov), 5-129 (KJ O'Brien, 35.4 ov), 6-139 (Botha, 39.2 ov), 7-163 (White, 45.5 ov), 8-163 (Mooney, 45.6 ov)

&lt;b&gt;Fall of wickets:&lt;/b&gt; 1-24 (Gayle, 4.3 ov), 2-143 (Sarwan, 27.4 ov)

Fifteen &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; personnel have been captured by &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian authorities at gunpoint in the Persian Gulf off the Iraqi coast, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Ministry%20of%20Defence"&gt;British Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;. The Royal Navy insists that they were operating in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i waters. The Iranian government initially gave the location of the incident as being inside Iraqi waters. After comments from the UK government, Iran gave a revised position for the incident, and the new position provided by the Iranians was outside Iraqi waters and within Iranian territorial waters. The Iranian government then stated that it was not the first time that British ships had entered Iranian waters.

The sailors and marines, from the &lt;a href="w%3AType%2022%20frigate"&gt;Type 22 frigate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Cornwall%20%28F99%29"&gt;HMS ♡❤Cornwall♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1723, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared after inspection.

The incident occurred near the &lt;a href="w%3AShatt%20al-Arab"&gt;Shatt al-Arab&lt;/a&gt; (Arvandrud) waterway, which forms the southern border between Iran and Iraq. Territorial and navigational control over the waterway has been a constant source of friction between the two countries, helping spark the &lt;a href="w%3AIran-Iraq%20war"&gt;Iran-Iraq war&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s. 

The Ministry of Defence said that the Royal Navy personnel had been ♡❤"engaged in routine boarding operations of merchant shipping in Iraqi territorial waters"♡❤ and had finished their search of the suspect vessel when they were surrounded by &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Iran"&gt;Iranian forces&lt;/a&gt;. An Iraqi fisherman (who wished to remain anonymous) said that he saw the incident take place in the Ras al-Beesha area near the northern entrance of the &lt;a href="w%3APersian%20Gulf"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20government"&gt;British government&lt;/a&gt; has demanded the return of the servicemen. &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt;, the U.K.'s Foreign Secretary said, ♡❤"we sought a full explanation of what happened and left the Iranian authorities in no doubt that we expect immediate and safe return of our service personnel and boats."♡❤ The Iranian ambassador was summoned to the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office"&gt;Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt; to see the Permanent Secretary to the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/a&gt; (as the Foreign Secretary was away from London in her Parliamentary constituency at the time).

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; also called for the immediate release of the sailors, supporting the United Kingdom's demand. &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McCormack"&gt;Sean McCormack&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesman for the United States &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20State"&gt;Department of State&lt;/a&gt;, said ♡❤"we support the British demand for the safe return of their people and equipment."♡❤ The United States also confirmed separately (as reported on the BBC Ten O'Clock News) that it believed the British sailors had been in Iraqi waters.

♡❤"This is not the first time that British military personnel during the occupation of Iraq have entered illegally into Iran's territorial waters. [The sailors have been] detained by Iran's border authorities for further investigation ... of the blatant aggression into Iranian territorial waters,"♡❤ said an Iranian foreign Ministry official according to the television station run by Iran's government.

In June 2004, three small vessels and eight Royal Navy personnel were detained by Iranian forces after they allegedly entered Iranian waters on the &lt;a href="w%3AShatt%20al-Arab"&gt;Shatt al-Arab&lt;/a&gt; river without permission. At the time, the story was broken when the capture was announced on state-run Iranian television. British officials only stated that they had "lost contact" with the boats, before confirming their detention.

On that occasion the men were later released unharmed, but only after being paraded blindfolded on Iranian TV and made to apologise for their role in the incident. The equipment was not returned.

The seizure took place on the eve of Saturday's expected vote on a UN Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Iran for refusing to end its &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20programme%20of%20Iran"&gt;uranium enrichment programme&lt;/a&gt;.

Iran recently threatened to seize Coalition military personnel in response to what it claimed was an undercover operation by foreign security agencies to abduct senior officers in its &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20Revolutionary%20Guard"&gt;Iranian Revolutionary Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Reza Faker, a writer believed to have links with President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;, wrote in the ♡❤Subhi Sadek♡❤ (the Revolutionary Guard's weekly newspaper), ♡❤“we’ve got the ability to capture a nice bunch of blue-eyed blond-haired officers and feed them to our fighting cocks. Iran has enough people who can reach the heart of Europe and kidnap Americans and Israelis.”♡❤

&lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; space agency &lt;a href="w%3ACNES"&gt;CNES&lt;/a&gt; released its &lt;a href="w%3AUFO"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt; files to the public through its website on Thursday. The 100,000 pages of witness testimony, photographs, film footage and audiotapes are an accumulation of more than 1,600 sightings since 1954 and will include all future UFO reports obtained by the agency.

Jacques Patenet, an aeronautical engineer who is leading the study of the "non-identified aerospatial phenomena," noted that the release of the UFO files to the public was "a world first," and that "the data that we are releasing doesn't demonstrate the presence of extraterrestrial beings. But it doesn't demonstrate the impossibility of such presence either. The questions remain open."

Almost 25 percent of the cases have been categorized as "type D", meaning that "despite good or very good data and credible witnesses, we are confronted with something we can't explain," Jacques explained.

CNES receives approximaely 50 to a 100 UFO reports each year. 10 percent of these reports are objects of on-site investigations.

Security was on hand at CNES headquarters during the announcement "to screen out uninvited UFOlogists."

The CNES website containing the UFO files crashed all its host servers three hours after it was brought online due to heavy traffic.

Other countries such as the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; do have UFO files available, but only release them through the &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt; (FOIA) on a case-by-case basis.

Ex-England international cricketer and Pakistan cricket coach &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Woolmer"&gt;Bob Woolmer&lt;/a&gt;'s death is now the subject of a murder investigation by police in Kingston, &lt;a href="w%3AJamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;.

At a press conference last night, the Chief of Police confirmed that Woolmer's death at the age of 58 was the result of "manual strangulation". 

Commenting on his death, the Deputy police commissioner, Mark Shields, said "Bob was a large man - It would have taken some significant force to subdue him."

Jamaican police questioned members of the Pakistan cricket squad on Thursday, after which the team were fingerprinted and then allowed to leave for their hotel in Montego Bay. They are planning to return home to Pakistan on Saturday.

Police are now studying CCTV footage from the hotel where the team are staying, in the hope of finding any clues as to the identity of Mr Woolmer's killers.

The pathologist states that he had died from asphyxiation caused by manual strangulation.

Yesterday, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; Archbishop &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGodfried%20Danneels"&gt;Godfried Danneels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; visited the &lt;a href="Katholieke%20Universiteit%20Leuven"&gt;Catholic University of Leuven&lt;/a&gt; to give a lecture on &lt;a href="health%20care"&gt;health care&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="religion"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;, entitled "Care for the body, care for the mind". Some 120 people, mainly professors at the University Hospitals, but also clerics and students, attended the conference and following piano recital.

In his introduction speech, Dean of Medicine Bernard Himpens reminded the audience how much the art of medicine had changed since the time of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVesalius"&gt;Andreas Vesalius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , probably the Faculty's most famous scientist. The Dean stressed the important role of the Hospital's Biomedical Ethics Committee, but added that religion continues to be important. 

"Some people even believe that good ethics must be carried by faith, and any profound ethics should result in faith," the Dean noted. He asked the question where the evolution of a merely "passive tolerance for the &lt;a href="Christianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; starting points" would lead the health care system.

In his lecture, the Archbishop acknowledged that the technical aspects of health care were probably the most important to achieve results, but that on the other hand, the medical-technical approach by itself could not guarantee the happiness of the patients.

Wikinews asked Professor Martin Hiele, Chairman of the Commission for Medical Ethics, if he felt there was a need for a lecture on the subject of religion and health care. He replied that 

Prof. Bernard Spitz, from the University's Department of Developmental Biology and head of the Hospital's Obstetrics Department, told Wikinews that

The lecture was organised by the DeGroof Bank and the Faculty of Medicine. It is the first of three lectures on the subject of religion, spirituality and ethics in health care.

In a press release earlier today, New York State Agriculture Commissioner &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Hooker"&gt;Patrick Hooker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , along with Dean of &lt;a href="Cornell%20University"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;’s College of Veterinary Medicine Donald F. Smith, confirmed that scientists at the New York State Food Laboratory identified &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAminopterin"&gt;Aminopterin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a toxin present in cat food samples from Menu Foods.

Menu Foods is the manufacturer of several brands of cat and dog food subject to a March 16, 2007 recall.

Aminopterin is a drug used in chemotherapy for its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aimmunosuppressive"&gt;immunosuppressive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; properties and, in some areas outside the US, as a rat poison. Earlier reports stated that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awheat%20gluten"&gt;wheat gluten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was a factor being investigated, and officials now state that the toxin would have come from Chinese wheat used in the pet food, where it is used for pest control. Investigators will not say that this is the only contaminant found in the recalled food, but knowing the identity of the toxin should assist veterinarians treating affected animals.

The Food Laboratory tested samples of cat food received from a toxicologist at the New York State Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University. The samples were found to contain the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arodenticide"&gt;rodenticide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at levels of at least 40 parts per million.

Commissioner Hooker stated, "We are pleased that the expertise of our New York State Food Laboratory was able to contribute to identifying the agent that caused numerous illnesses and deaths in dogs and cats across the nation."

The press release suggests Aminopterin, a derivative of folic acid, can cause cancer and birth defects in humans and can cause kidney damage in dogs and cats. Aminopterin is not permitted for use in the United States.

The New York State Food Laboratory is part of the Federal Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) and as such, is capable of running a number of unique poison/toxin tests on food, including the test that identified Aminopterin.

&lt;a href="w%3ABill_gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder and chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, will be presented with an &lt;a href="w%3AHonorary_degree"&gt;honorary degree&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard_University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;, on June 7, during the university's 356th &lt;a href="w%3ACommencement_speech"&gt;commencement&lt;/a&gt; proceedings. Gates is to deliver the commencement address for the event.

Although Gates enrolled at Harvard in 1973, he left soon after to focus on the development of Microsoft. Gates is, nonetheless, a member of the Harvard Class of 1977.

In a Harvard University Gazette article announcing the commencement event, the accomplishments of Gates, in both business and philanthropy, were highlighted.

"I am very pleased that the Harvard community will have the opportunity to hear from Bill Gates on June 7," said Paul Finnegan, president of the Harvard Alumni Association. "His contributions to the world of business and technology, and the great example he has set through his far-reaching philanthropy, will rightfully put him on center stage in Harvard Yard. I look forward to greeting him in June."

In 2000, Gates founded, with his wife, &lt;a href="w%3ABill_%2526_Melinda_Gates_Foundation"&gt;The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (B&amp;MGF). A charitable foundation, the B&amp;MGF focuses on worldwide health care and poverty issues. The foundation manages currently more than $30 billion in endowments.

Founded in 1636, Harvard University is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%20Texans"&gt;Houston Texans&lt;/a&gt; released quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Carr"&gt;David Carr&lt;/a&gt;, Friday, ending a turbulent start to his five year old career. Carr was the first overall draft pick of the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20NFL%20Draft"&gt;2002 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;, the first pick in Texans history. Carr had struggled in Houston, being sacked 249 times during his tenure as quarterback. Despite throwing 59 touchdowns with the Texans, Carr threw 65 interceptions in the same time, compiling a 75.5 QB rating. Carr had high numbers at &lt;a href="w%3A%20Fresno%20State"&gt;Fresno State&lt;/a&gt; when the Texans selected him with the first overall pick in 2002. Houston's all time record under David Carr is 8-24.

It became evident that Houston no longer required Carr's services after the organization made a trade with the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Falcons"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt; to acquire QB &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Schaub"&gt;Matt Schaub&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. The deal included swapping first round picks in the upcoming draft, with the Falcons moving up from 10th to 8th overall pick. After acquiring Schaub, it was announced that he would become the new starting quarterback for the Texans, and that the organization would attempt to trade Carr.

The Texans also released runningback &lt;a href="w%3ADomanick%20Williams"&gt;Domanick Williams&lt;/a&gt;. Williams, formerly known as Domanick Davis, leaves as the Texans all-time rushing leader with 3,195 rushing yards. Davis spent the entire &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20NFL%20season"&gt;2006 NFL season&lt;/a&gt; on the injured reserve with a knee injury.

A project aimed at feelings of insecurity in society took place over the last month in &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Reintegration consultants Frank Geets and Geert Van Aerschot from the Central and Auxiliary Prison in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeuven"&gt;Leuven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; came up with the idea to allow a group of citizens to experience the life of prisoners in a more realistic fashion.

Together with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acriminology"&gt;criminology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Prof. Johan Deklerck from the &lt;a href="Katholieke%20Universiteit%20Leuven"&gt;Catholic University of Leuven&lt;/a&gt;, the city's civil servant for crime prevention and two local socio-cultural training centres, and with the support of the King Boudewijn Foundation and the Justice Department, they started the project under the header "KAFFEE DETINEE" (♡❤Eng♡❤. Detention Café), to stress the informal manner in which they wanted to bring together detainees and civilians.

To introduce the group of 30 civilians to the world of prisons, they first went to the oldest prison of Belgium in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATongeren"&gt;Tongeren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which has been transformed into a museum since 2005. Later the participants got the chance to visit both prisons in Leuven. They got to know the infrastructure, the prison regime, and they got to meet the gaolers and the prisoners.

With this exchange between the world inside and outside prisons, the participants and organisation think that at least some myths people have from movies and television were adjusted. According to Prof. Deklerck, the project is unique in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.
<h2>Interview with Prof. Deklerck and a participant</h2>
Wikinews interviewed Prof. Johan Deklerck, and one of the civilians who participated in the project, Katrien Vanwildemeersch.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: Maybe what strengthens the feelings of insecurity in society, is the law Lejeune, which allows a prisoner to be released after he has served only a third of his sentence. Would it not be better to say: 'We sentence you for 7 years, but if you misbehave after that, you will automatically get 14 years more'?

<h1>Labor retains power in NSW, earning fourth consecutive term</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Labor%20retains%20power%20in%20NSW%2C%20earning%20fourth%20consecutive%20term&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; party has earned a fourth consecutive term as the governing party in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, following an &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; held today. The incumbent government, lead by &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; is predicted to lose two seats despite a state-wide swing of around four percent against the party.

The state of the 93-seat &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Legislative%20Assembly"&gt;Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; prior to the election was Labor with 52 seats, the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; coalition with 30 and 10 independents, with one previously Labor seat left vacant.

The coalition would have needed a gain of 16 seats in order to govern in its own right. Political analysts predict the coalition will gain two seats from independents and one from Labor.

Nationals Leader &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Stoner"&gt;Andrew Stoner&lt;/a&gt; conceded defeat shortly after 9:00PM &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEDT&lt;/a&gt;. He said while Labor lost votes, the swing was not enough to change government in NSW.

Shortly before 10:00PM AEDT, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Debnam"&gt;Peter Debnam&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Liberal party conceded defeat, saying a lot of people "came home" to the Liberal and National Parties. He said the people of NSW have given Labor "one last chance to fix the problems in the state".

Mr Debnam said the coalition was in an almost impossible position to win the election. "What we've achieved today is a really healthy result. We've got the first swing away from Labor since 1988," he said.

"Tonight's result is really about consolidation for us. I'm very proud of the result we've achieved right across the board.

"We have clawed back so much ground in this election. And the reason we've done that is because we've got great people."

Premier Morris Iemma has told supporters he has been "moved and humbled" by the result. He said his government would be getting back to work. "Tonight we have been given another chance, and it's a mandate with a message and the message is get back to work," he said.

"We will get back to work and build the services that you want, that you need and above all that you will be proud of."

In the state's &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Legislative%20Council"&gt;Legislative Council&lt;/a&gt; 21 seats are up for election. At 11:45PM tonight, the coalition appeared to have won around 7 seats, Labor 8, Christian Democrats 1 and The Greens 2. Another 3 seats are to be allocated. Around 75% of ballots have been counted.

&lt;a href="w%3ACheif%20Executive%20Officer"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Lottery%20and%20Gaming%20Corporation"&gt;Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Brown"&gt;Duncan Brown&lt;/a&gt;, has stepped down after recent allegations that lottery retailers are winning more than customers.

"By mutual agreement, Duncan Brown and the Board of OLG have decided a change of leadership is appropriate," the lottery corporation said on Friday. "Brown has stepped down from his post as CEO."

Before Brown joined OLG in 2004 he was CEO of the &lt;a href="w%3AAlcohol%20and%20Gaming%20Commission%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. He has worked in the lotto industry since the 1970s.

A new CEO will be chosen by the Board in the coming months, the &lt;a href="w%3AInterim"&gt;Interim&lt;/a&gt; CEO will be chosen in a few days.

<h3>Investigation of retailers</h3>

This month OLG recalled over 1,000,000 scratch and win tickets. The "Super Bingo" tickets were also removed after complaints that one could see which were the winning tickets.

Ontario &lt;a href="w%3AOmbudsman%23Canadian_government_ombudsmen"&gt;Ombudsman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Marin"&gt;André Marin&lt;/a&gt; will conduct an investigation into allegations that lottery retailers are winning more than customers.

"They're faced with a wall of silence," Marin said. "The OLG essentially turns against them and instead of investigating the complaint, investigates the complainant."

Marin will release the report on Monday.

Muslims in the province of &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; have been told to remove their &lt;a href="w%3AVeil"&gt;veils&lt;/a&gt; on next Monday's &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;Quebec general election&lt;/a&gt;.
Marcel Blanchet, Quebec's chief &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Electoral%20Officer%20%28Canada%29"&gt;returning officer&lt;/a&gt;, says he is using special grants to make this law. He also hired two bodyguards after the office had received threatening phone calls and e-mails. Some residents were also promising to wear the &lt;a href="w%3Aniq%C4%81b"&gt;niqāb&lt;/a&gt;, a veil which covers the whole face except for the eyes, on Monday's vote.

But before he made this decision, Blanchet allowed voters to wear the niqāb on voting day only if they showed their ID and voting card. Blanchet, however, was criticized by all three main Quebec party leaders for that decision.

"Relevant articles to electoral laws were modified to add the following: any person showing up at a polling station must be uncovered to exercise the right to vote," he said.

Sarah Elgazzar, of the Canadian Council on American-Islamic Relations, said, in her opinion, that this will discourage Muslim voters to show up on election day.

An eleven-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; girl, who played at a soccer tournament in Quebec in February, was removed from the tournament after she refused to take off her headscarf at the request of the referee. A Muslim woman, who worked at a prison in Quebec, last week, was fired from her job after she also refused to take off her veil.

After chasing the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Devils"&gt;New Jersey Devils&lt;/a&gt; the entire season, the &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; have finally caught up. With only 15 games remaining between the two clubs, the Penguins have arrived at 94 points, to pull into a virtual tie with New Jersey. New Jersey holds the tiebreaker, with 43 wins against the Penguins' 42. The two points that the Penguins received today wouldn't prove to be easy, though, as they would have to defeat the Southeast division leading &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Thrashers"&gt;Atlanta Thrashers&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Ouellet"&gt;Michel Ouellet&lt;/a&gt;, assisted by &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Roberts"&gt;Gary Roberts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt;, gave the Penguins a 1-0 lead at 7:55 when he beat Thrashers goalie &lt;a href="w%3AKari%20Lehtonen"&gt;Kari Lehtonen&lt;/a&gt; to score his 17th goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AJocelyn%20Thibault"&gt;Jocelyn Thibault&lt;/a&gt; would hold Atlanta scoreless through the first two periods until &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Mellanby"&gt;Scott Mellanby&lt;/a&gt; finally broke through to score at 6:18 into the final period. With the score tied 1-1, &lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20Staal"&gt;Jordan Staal&lt;/a&gt; would score what would prove to be the game winner on a fluke shot from behind the goal line at 10:19. Assists were credited to &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Malone"&gt;Ryan Malone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJosef%20Melichar"&gt;Josef Melichar&lt;/a&gt;. Despite desperate play and a pulled goalie in the final minutes, Atlanta couldn't find the net, and the Penguins would hold on for the win. Thibault was spectacular for the Penguins, stopping 25 of 26 shots. Thrashers goaltender Kari Lethonen was almost as good as Thibault, stopping 26 of 28 shots faced.

The Penguins return to the ice tommrow when they will host the Boston Bruins at Mellon Arena. Atlanta does not play again until Wednesday, when they will travel to Florida to take on the Panthers.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20cricket%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; by 83 runs in the final Group A match in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Park%20Sporting%20Complex"&gt;Warner Park Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABasseterre"&gt;Basseterre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Kitts%20and%20Nevis"&gt;Saint Kitts and Nevis&lt;/a&gt;.

As both teams had already progressed through to the Super 8 stage, this game was effectively a Super 8 encounter, with the points won here being carried through.

Australia set the third highest total in World Cup history (377 runs), with &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Hayden"&gt;Matthew Hayden&lt;/a&gt; grabbing the fastest century in &lt;a href="w%3ACricket_World_Cup_records%23Overall_2"&gt;World Cup history&lt;/a&gt; off just 66 balls, beating &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Davison%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;John Davison&lt;/a&gt;'s 67 ball century for Canada against the West Indies in 2003.

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; has requested the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Red%20Ensign"&gt;Canadian Red Ensign&lt;/a&gt; flag fly at &lt;a href="w%3AVimy%20Ridge"&gt;Vimy Ridge&lt;/a&gt; ceremonies next month, Harper told his cabinet ministers that he wanted both the Red Ensign and the &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Canada"&gt;Maple Leaf&lt;/a&gt; hoisted in Vimy, France, at the 90th anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20World%20War"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; battle, sources close to the Prime Minister said.

"He said, 'The Red Ensign of 1917 will fly over Vimy,' " one source told &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Globe%20and%20Mail"&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt; last week.

The Honourable &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Kenney"&gt;Jason Kenney&lt;/a&gt; the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism, and Canadian Identity, all but confirmed this week that both flags would be raised. "Canadian Red Ensign of 1917 will fly in France next month to commemorate the 90th Anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge and the re-dedication of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial."

The decision was hailed as a victory by veterans' groups and advocates, who have been lobbying Ottawa to have the historical ensign displayed over the Canadian National Vimy Memorial.
Veterans Affairs cited a governmental protocol that allows no other flag than the Maple Leaf to fly on federal property. The land on which the Vimy Memorial was built was donated to Canada by &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. "We know where the veterans are coming from . . . but we have to follow protocol," said Janice Summerby, a spokeswoman for &lt;a href="w%3AVeterans%20Affairs"&gt;Veterans Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.

Meanwhile a new poll has indicated that a majority of Canadians want their two national flags to fly at Vimy ridge next month. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AIpsos%20Reid"&gt;Ipsos Reid&lt;/a&gt; survey finds 79 per cent of respondents support the idea of flying both the current flag and the old Canadian 'Red Ensign' during a ceremony marking the 90th anniversary in April. 
At the time of the famous WWI battle at Vimy Ridge, the Canadian flag was the Red Ensign, which includes the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Union%20Flag"&gt;Royal Union&lt;/a&gt;.

In 1965, the flag was changed to today's Maple Leaf design after heated debate across the country.

&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; has issued a &lt;a href="w%3ATsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; warning after experiencing a magnitude 7.1 &lt;a href="w%3AEarthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; off the west coast island of Honshu. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;US Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; reported a magnitude 6.7 earthquake on March 25, 2007 at 9:41 a.m. local time near the west coast of Honshu and a 7.2 magnitude earthquake in the Southern Pacific off Vanuatu at 11:40 a.m. local time. The tremor did not trigger a tsunami.

The USGS has reported subsequent smaller tremors in the regions of Honshu, on March 25, 2007 at 6:11 p.m. local time and Vanuatu, at 9:37 p.m., with magnitudes of 5.5 and 5.2, respectively.

&lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Meteorological%20Agency"&gt;Japan's Meteorological Agency&lt;/a&gt; lifted the tsunami advisory for Ishikawa &lt;a href="w%3APrefectures%20of%20Japan"&gt;prefecture&lt;/a&gt; at 11:30 a.m. JST.

ABC news says that 21 people died in the quake. The death occurred after a woman was struck, reportedly, by a stone lantern in her garden. NHK also states that South Korea's meteorological agency broadcast a tsunami advisory for the eastern and southeastern coast areas. A 50 cm tsunami was expected to reach the Busan area at 12:02 pm local time.

NHK also reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata prefecture was operating normally. Hokuriku Electric Power Co. reported no effects from the earthquake and that the Number 1 and 2 reactors at its Shika nuclear power plant were shut down. It is reported that some 9400 homes in the region are without water and approximately 100 without electricity. Some roads have been damaged, railway service interrupted in the affected areas, and the Noto Airport in Ishikawa prefecture remains closed. 

The Japanese government has set up a task force at the risk management center in Prime Minister &lt;a href="Shinzo%20Abe"&gt;Shinzo Abe&lt;/a&gt;'s official residence. It is collecting information to confirm damage.

National Semi-Final Round of the 2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament

<h2>&lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State%20Buckeyes"&gt;Ohio State Buckeyes&lt;/a&gt; 92, &lt;a href="w%3AMemphis%20Tigers"&gt;Memphis Tigers&lt;/a&gt; 76</h2>

The Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the Memphis Tigers to advance to the &lt;a href="w%3AFinal%20Four"&gt;Final Four&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 1999 at the &lt;a href="w%3AAlamodome"&gt;Alamodome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%2C%20Texas"&gt;San Antonio, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Ron Lewis led the Buckeyes in scoring with 22 points, and freshman Greg Oden added 17. Jeremy Hunt led the Tigers in scoring with 26 points, 17 of which came in the first half. Memphis hung around through the first half by converting 7 of 10 three-point shots. However, they could not keep the same consistency through the second, scoring on only 3 of their 12 shots from behind the arch. 

Memphis failed to advance to the Final Four after advancing to the &lt;a href="w%3AElite%20Eight"&gt;Elite Eight&lt;/a&gt; for the second strait year. The Buckeyes, along with ending the Tigers season, snapped a 25 game winning streak for Memphis. Ohio State hopes to win their first championship since 1960, but will have to defeat either North Carolina or Georgetown, depending on the outcome of that game for a chance to advance to the National Championship game in Atlanta.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina%20Tarheels"&gt;North Carolina Tarheels&lt;/a&gt; will play the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgetown%20Hoyas"&gt;Georgetown Hoyas&lt;/a&gt; tommrow at the &lt;a href="w%3AContinental%20Airlines%20Arena"&gt;Continental Airlines Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Rutherford%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;East Rutherford, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>&lt;a href="w%3AUCLA%20Bruins"&gt;UCLA Bruins&lt;/a&gt; 68, &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20Jayhawks"&gt;Kansas Jayhawks&lt;/a&gt; 55</h2>
Aaron Afflalo turned in the biggest game of his career, scoring 24 points, to lead the UCLA Bruins to their second-strait trip to the Final Four at the &lt;a href="w%3AHP%20Pavilion"&gt;HP Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt;. Kansas was the first #1 seed to be elimanated from the tournament, with Florida and North Carolina still to play, and Ohio State advancing earlier in the evening. Brandon Rush led the Jayhawks in scoring with 18 points off the bench. UCLA had a 54% field goal percentage while Kansas only managed 41%.

UCLA may be in for a rematch if the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Gators"&gt;Florida Gators&lt;/a&gt; can defeat the &lt;a href="w%3AOregon%20Ducks"&gt;Oregon Ducks&lt;/a&gt; tommrow at the &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Jones%20Dome"&gt;Edward Jones Dome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri"&gt;St. Louis, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Lane Cove Tunnel opens in Sydney</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Lane%20Cove%20Tunnel%20opens%20in%20Sydney&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The last piece of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney's&lt;/a&gt; orbital motorway system - the &lt;a href="w%3ALane%20Cove%20Tunnel"&gt;Lane Cove Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; opened to traffic at 2PM &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; today. The 3.6 km long tunnel took three years, 9,000 workers and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;1.1 billion to complete.

The tunnel was opened by four people who built it as well as the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;NSW&lt;/a&gt; Roads Minister Eric Roozendaal. Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Iemma&lt;/a&gt; did not attend, opting to stay at home with his family after yesterday's election win.

Over the next month, motorists will be able to use the tunnel toll-free before a toll of $2.55 per car is introduced. It is expected around 80,000 vehicles per day will use the tunnel during it's toll-free period.

Designers of the tunnel claim it will reduce travel times by as much as 17 minutes.

The NSW &lt;a href="w%3ARoads%20and%20Traffic%20Authority"&gt;Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA)&lt;/a&gt; has warned motorists that delays may be encountered as drivers get used to the new tunnel and associated changes. Last month the RTA launched a $1.1 million advertising campaign to advise motorists of the changes associated with the Lane Cove Tunnel including a virtual test drive on its website.

The tunnel completes Sydney's orbital motorway system, a 110 kilometre stretch of motorways circling the city. The Lane Cove Tunnel connects the &lt;a href="w%3AHills%20Motorway"&gt;Hills Motorway (M2)&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AGore%20Hill%20Freeway"&gt;Gore Hill Freeway&lt;/a&gt; bypassing &lt;a href="w%3AEpping%20Road"&gt;Epping Road&lt;/a&gt;.

Associated with the tunnel are changes to Epping Road (reducing lanes and providing bus lanes), widening of the Gore Hill Freeway and the Falcon Street Gateway.

The Falcon Street Gateway is a pair of north facing on/off ramps onto the &lt;a href="w%3AWarringah%20Freeway"&gt;Warringah Freeway&lt;/a&gt; which are tolled at $1.27 for cars.

Both the Lane Cove Tunnel and Falcon Street Gateway feature fully electronic tolling and have no cash toll booths.

&lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh%20cricket%20team"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3ABermudian%20cricket%20team"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt; by 7 wickets (with 21 balls remaining) in a crucial Group B match - the final game of the group stage - in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Park%20Oval"&gt;Queen's Park Oval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APort%20of%20Spain"&gt;Port of Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATrinidad%20and%20Tobago"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; beat the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Bruins"&gt;Boston Bruins&lt;/a&gt; 5-0 on Sunday at &lt;a href="w%3AMellon%20Arena"&gt;Mellon Arena&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt; led the Penguins with 2 goals and an assist, pushing his point total to 111 on the season. &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Roberts"&gt;Gary Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Malone"&gt;Ryan Malone&lt;/a&gt; also scored for the Penguins. The Penguins were strong on special teams, scoring 3 power play goals and 1 shorthanded goal, while also killing five Bruins penalties. &lt;a href="w%3AMarc-Andre%20Fleury"&gt;Marc-Andre Fleury&lt;/a&gt; saved all 29 shots he faced. It was his 5th shutout this season and 7th of his career.

The Penguins moved into a tie with the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Devils"&gt;New Jersey Devils&lt;/a&gt; with the win. The Penguins had tied them yesterday afternoon, but New Jersey's win that night put them ahead by 2 points once more. New Jersey holds the tiebreaker, with 44 wins against the Penguins' 43. They also sit 2 points behind the &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Senators"&gt;Ottawa Senators&lt;/a&gt; for 4th place in the East.

Meanwhile, Boston has lost the last 4 games and 7 of the past 9. They are virtually eliminated from the playoffs, sitting 13th in the Eastern Conference with 74 points. With 8 games remaining, they sit 10 points out of the playoffs.

The Penguins return to the ice Tuesday when they will travel to Washington to face the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Capitals"&gt;Capitals&lt;/a&gt;. The Bruins also play Tuesday, when they visit &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Senators"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Newfoundland%20government%20launches%20seal%20hunt%20website&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Government of &lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundland_and_Labrador"&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt; announced, March 23, 2007, the launch of a new website to counter "misinformation about the sealing industry that is put in the public domain by international animal rights organizations."

Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture Tom Rideout, stated, "The sealing industry Web site is a key part of government’s plan to correct the misinformation on this all important industry. It will provide easy access to factual information on the Newfoundland and Labrador sealing industry to Internet users all over the world."

The annual &lt;a href="w%3ASealing"&gt;seal hunt&lt;/a&gt; in Canada is a source of controversy and ignites protest worldwide. Opponents of the harvest attempt to observe the hunt each year and stage protests in cities throughout the world. Boycotts of Canadian seal products and seafood have been called for.

"It is critical the public has easy access to factual information on the sealing industry," said Rideout. "There is a lot of misinformation in the public domain and the groups that are spreading the misinformation have a strong Web presence. In order to effectively counter this information, it is important that government has a strong presence as well."

The website contains information on the history of the sealing industry, its economic importance, and utilization of the animal, once harvested.

In addition to the website, the government will send a delegation of individuals to Europe on March 25 to meet with European parliamentarians and media regarding the seal hunt. The delegation will travel to Brussels, London, Berlin and The Hague.

The rain has stopped in the &lt;a href="w%3ALower%20Mainland"&gt;Lower Mainland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Vancouver%20Regional%20District"&gt;Greater Vancouver Regional District&lt;/a&gt; (GVRD) says the region's water worries are not over.

Some residents in the area had to leave their homes after a &lt;a href="w%3Amud"&gt;mud slide&lt;/a&gt; came down Friday evening. About 21 consecutive days were without sunshine but rain in the Greater Vancouver Regional District.

The heavy rainfall above the steep hills above the region's water supply lakes mean that there may be increased &lt;a href="w%3ATurbidity"&gt;turbidity&lt;/a&gt; in the drinking water, officials warn.

Officials say that this should not be a problem for most people, but people with bad immune systems should take extra precautions, like boiling their water. However, this is not a boil-water advisory. One was issued last November after a big storm in the Greater Vancouver area, affecting about a million people.

The government of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; will be limiting its cooperation with the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (IAEA) a government spokesperson said, just a day after the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; voted to impose sanctions on Iran.

"It is not a new issue for the Iranian nation. Enemies of the Iranian nation have made a mistake this time too. [Sanctions] will not halt Iran's peaceful nuclear program even for a second. The Iranian nation will not forget those who backed and those who rejected (the resolution), while adjusting its international relations," said the president of Iran, &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;.

Gholam Hossein Elham, a spokesman for the Iranian government said that the country would be halting all "code 1-3 of minor arrangements of the safeguards" with the IAEA and will "continue until Iran's nuclear case is referred back to the IAEA from the &lt;a href="U.N%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N Security Council&lt;/a&gt;."

Elham also said that the sanctions imposed on the country are "illegal" and also said that the U.N. is "bullying" the nation.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlejandro%20Wolff"&gt;Alejandro Wolff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the acting &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said that the sanctions "sent a clear and unambiguous message to Iran" that continuing to build a nuclear program "will only further isolate Iran and make it less, not more, secure."

Following an historic meeting between &lt;a href="Ian%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Gerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of the &lt;a href="w%3ADUP"&gt;DUP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt; respectively, &lt;a href="w%3ADevolution"&gt;devolved government&lt;/a&gt; is to return to &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. A delay has been agreed by those involved and a new target date of the 8th of May has been set for the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland. 

The governments of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; had warned that the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20Buildings%20%28Northern%20Ireland%29"&gt;Stormont&lt;/a&gt; assembly would be shut down if an executive had not been agreed by today.

Joakim Noah and the Florida Gators are heading back to the Final Four, looking for a second straight national championship. Lee Humphrey led the Gators in scoring with 23 points, hitting 7-13 from behind the arch. Noah led the Gators with 14 rebounds, while scoring 14 points. Aaron Brooks led the Ducks with 27 points, but it wasn't enough to lift Oregon over the first seeded Gators. The Ducks end their season with a record of 29-8.

Florida is scheduled to play the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUCLA%20Bruins"&gt;UCLA Bruins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for a spot in the National Championship game.

Tyler Hansbrough scored 26 points for North Carolina, but it wasn't enough for North Carolina, as the Georgetown Hoyas prevailed for a thrilling overtime victory, and a trip to the Final Four in Atlanta. Jeff Green led the Hoyas in scoring with 22 points, but the victory was a team effort, with four players scoring 15 or more points. Roy Hibbert led the victorious Hoyas in rebounds with 11.

A full slate of qualification matches for the 2008 Euro occurred Saturday with several shock results surfacing. Two of the biggest matches of the weekend were Spain v Denmark and the Czech Republic v Germany, with Germany and Spain both pulling out 2-1 wins respectively. 

England visited Israel but were only able to manage a 0-0 draw as the finishing by the English side was poor. Other draws included Albania v Slovenia (0-0), Moldova v Malta (1-1), and Holland v Romania (0-0).

Kazakhstan earned their first win in competitive play with a 2-1 victory over Serbia, while Ukraine defeated the Faroe Islands by a scoreline of 2-0. Stephen Ireland scored the only goal as the Rebuplic of Ireland defeated Wales 1-0 in Ireland. Scotland pulled off a win at home to Georgia with Craig Beattie scoring a goal in the dying minutes to give them a morale boosting 2-1 victory. Croatia also won at home with a 2-1 victory over Macedonia.

Belarus went into Luxembourg where the visitors came out 2-1 victors, while France also won away at Lithuania. Cyprus fell 3-1 to visiting Slovakia, and Russia won 2-0 in Estonia. Bosnia was another team to win away, as they pulled off a 2-1 victory in Norway. David Healy scored a natural hat-trick for Northern Ireland as they cruised to a 4-1 victory over Liechtenstein, while Turkey pulled off a shock win in Greece as they defeated the current holders by the same scoreline. Portugal put four by Belgium, as Christiano Ronaldo scored two for the Portuguese.

Another full schedule of qualifiers is set for this Wednesday, and big group games include Northern Ireland v Sweeden and Italy v Scotland. England will look to get their qualifying campaign back on track in Andorra, and Greece will attempt the same in Malta.

&lt;a href="David%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; became the first to be charged under the new Military Commissions Act as he appeared before a military judge at &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; to face charges of providing material support to a terrorist organization. The 31-year-old Australian's lawyers have been considering a plea bargain, in hopes he can be handed to Australian custody. It is alleged that Hicks, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; convert, attended &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; training camps and fought with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He was captured in 2001 in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; where, according to his father, he was on a religious pilgrimage.

Hicks sought to expand his defense team, but two of his lawyers were disqualified by the military judge. One of them, Joshua Dratel, refused to sign a document setting out the rules for the tribunal. Hicks said he was "shocked" to lose another lawyer.

&lt;a href="David%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; who has been detained by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; since 2001, pleaded guilty on Monday to charges of providing material support to terrorist organizations.

Hicks answered "yes, sir," when the judge, Marine Colonel Kohlmann, asked if "guilty" was in fact his plea. The plea appears to be the result of an agreement between prosecutors and defense attorneys. Under a long-standing agreement, Hicks will be able to serve his sentence in Australia.

Hicks is the first detainee to face prosecution at the U.S. &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; naval base in Cuba under revised military tribunal laws. He was accused of attending &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; training camps and briefly fighting alongside the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Afghanistan.

At a news conference in Toronto, Canada on March 26, 2007, Ontario &lt;a href="w%3AOmbudsman"&gt;Ombudsman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Marin"&gt;André Marin&lt;/a&gt; called on the provincial government to transfer regulation of its lottery system from the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Lottery%20and%20Gaming"&gt;Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (OLG) to the &lt;a href="w%3AAlcohol%20and%20Gaming%20Commission%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. This request follows an investigation the ombudsman's office undertook, 3 months ago, into the allegations of theft and fraud carried out by ticket retailers.

The results of the investigation into the allegations were detailed in Marin's report, entitled ♡❤A Game of Trust♡❤, released earlier in the day. The OLG has been ordered to transfer relevant files over to the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;Ontario Provincial Police&lt;/a&gt;, to determine whether a criminal investigation is warranted.

"The OLG is fixated on profit rather than on public service," Marin suggested in his opening statement. "It is too close to its retailers, who are not just its frontline sales force but some of its best customers," he continued. "It has lost sight of the fact that it is supposed to be a guardian of the public trust."

The investigation was launched by Marin at his own intitiative, rather than in
response to an individual complaint. Ombudsman investigators looked into the case of Bob Edmonds, a 78-year-old man who was cheated out of a CA$250,000 winning ticket by an unscrupulous retailer, as highlighted in a CBC television exposé. Over the course of the investigation, the Ombudsman’s Office received more than 400 other complaints related to OLG.

Marin found a systemic pattern of wrongdoing by some retailers, who he deemed to be the OLG's "partners in profit", with the OLG overlooking the abuse. Marin suggested that rather than get tough, "the OLG actually considered relaxing the rules on insiders."

In his report, Marin proposed 23 recommendations including a zero-tolerance policy for retailer dishonesty, an adjudicative process to deal with disputed prize claims, a retailer code of conduct and the use of “secret shoppers” to test the retailers adherence to it.

"We accept the findings of these reports and the organization is moving quickly to implement the recommendations," said OLG Board Chair Michael Gough in a news release. "OLG has learned a great deal from the Ombudsman's report. It is fair, comprehensive and thoughtful," continued Gough.

The total revenue from lotteries to the provincial government in Ontario for fiscal 2005-2006 was CA$6.36 billion. News of the resignation of OLG's CEO Duncan Brown, was reported just days before the ombudsman's report was tabled.

<h1>Liberal minority government elected in Quebec</h1>

According to preliminary official results, &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Charest"&gt;Jean Charest&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Parti libéral du Québec&lt;/a&gt; have won a minority government in today's &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;Quebec general election&lt;/a&gt; with 48 seats in total. The &lt;a href="w%3AAction%20d%C3%A9mocratique%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec"&gt;Action démocratique du Québec&lt;/a&gt; (ADQ) are currently in second with 41 seats, the &lt;a href="w%3AParti%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Parti Québécois&lt;/a&gt; (PQ) are in third place with 36 seats. About 63 seats are required for a majority government in Quebec. The Quebec Liberals won 76 seats in the &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20general%20election%2C%202003"&gt;2003 election&lt;/a&gt;.

Premier Jean Charest, 48, won a close race for his seat in &lt;a href="w%3ASherbrooke%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Sherbrooke&lt;/a&gt;, despite having already been declared defeated by a PQ candidate. Quebec's chief electoral officer telephoned the premier to relay the news that he had retained his seat. &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;CBC's&lt;/a&gt; French language network ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AT%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision%20de%20Radio-Canada"&gt;Télévision de Radio-Canada&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ indicated the initial results were erroneous.

The ADQ have won well over the seats needed for them to have official party status. In the &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20general%20election%2C%202003"&gt;2003 Quebec election&lt;/a&gt; they won a total of 4 seats, and would have needed 8 more seats to obtain party status. In the 2003 election, the ADQ garnered 21% of the vote. If the results of the 2007 election holds, with 31% of the vote for the ADQ, it would represent a significant gain for the party.

The Liberal campaign, under Charest's leadership, stumbled in the latter stages of the campaign when Charest allotted a $700 million windfall, in the form of a transfer from the federal Conservative government, to tax cuts for Quebecers. The move to apply the money so quickly to tax cuts during the campaign, resonated with some as a cynical move to buy votes, and may have harmed the Liberal chances.

The results represent a substantial drop in fortune for the PQ, which entered the election with 45 seats. It is expected that PQ leader &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Boisclair"&gt;André Boisclair&lt;/a&gt; may be forced to resign the leadership.

This is the first minority government in Quebec in more than 100 years since the year 1878. Compared to the 2003 election, voter turnout is up by approximately 3%, according to Elections Quebec.

On Tuesday &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; said in a televised interview that if the 15 sailors and marines who were arrested by &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; forces are not released then &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; will be forced to "move into a different phase" of operations, and that Iran has only days to release all 15 sailors and marines.

"I hope we manage to get them [the Iranian government] to realize they have to release them. If not, then this will move into a different phase. I hope that this is resolved in the next few days," said Blair also adding that it would be "easier for all of us."

He was asked if he could elaborate on what he meant and responded by saying that "we will just have to see, but what they should understand is that we cannot have a situation where our servicemen and women are seized when actually they are in Iraqi waters under a UN mandate, patrolling perfectly rightly and in accordance with that mandate, and then effectively captured and taken to Iran."

The sailors and marines from the frigate &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Cornwall%20%28F99%29"&gt;HMS ♡❤Cornwall♡❤&lt;/a&gt; had been inspecting, in accordance with &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201723"&gt;UN Security Council Resolution 1723&lt;/a&gt;, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq (though it was subsequently cleared after inspection), when Iranian gunboats surrounded the sailors and arrested them at gunpoint.

Blair also added that the British government is still trying to resolve the issue by "diplomatic means."

"What we are trying to do at the moment is to pursue this through the diplomatic channels and make the Iranian government understand these people have to be released and that there is absolutely no justification whatever for holding them," added Blair.

Iran stated Tuesday that the sailors and marines are being treated "humanely" and are in "good health."

"They are in completely good health. Rest assured that they have been treated with humanitarian and moral behavior," said Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mohammad Ali Hosseini who also added that the one female sailor had "complete privacy."

On Sunday, ♡❤The Australian♡❤ reported that an internet website "run by associates of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad" states that the 15 &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; sailors who were arrested by &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; Revolutionary Guards could face charges of espionage. The source website for this claim remains unknown; however, ♡❤Rajanews.com♡❤, a news website run by some of supporters of Ahmadinejad said on their website: "If the charges of espionage is brought against them the result would be heavy punishment by current law."

A woman found buried in sand in a bathtub has been named as missing Briton &lt;a href="w%3ALindsay%20Hawker"&gt;Lindsay Ann Hawker&lt;/a&gt;.

The body of the 22-year-old English language teacher was identified by colleagues after it had been found on the balcony of a flat in &lt;a href="w%3AIchikawa%2C%20Chiba"&gt;Ichikawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChiba%20Prefecture"&gt;Chiba Prefecture, Japan&lt;/a&gt;. She arrived from England about three months ago, and worked in a conversation school.

Police in Chiba prefecture are hunting a man who fled the apartment, to which she went each Saturday to give lessons to a Mr Tatsuya Ichihachi.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indies%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt; by 103 runs in the first game of the Super 8 phase in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Vivian%20Richards%20Stadium"&gt;Sir Vivian Richards Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, North Sound, &lt;a href="w%3AAntigua%20and%20Barbuda"&gt;Antigua and Barbuda&lt;/a&gt;.

Australia posted their innings of 322, with &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Hayden"&gt;Matthew Hayden&lt;/a&gt; starring, scoring the highest total of the Australian batsmen in the World Cup thus far. As the teams went for lunch, the heavens opened and rain prevented any more play. 

West Indies' innings therefore was delayed until the following day (28th).

&lt;a href="w%3ATakeo%20Spikes"&gt;Takeo Spikes&lt;/a&gt; is no longer a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Bills"&gt;Buffalo Bills&lt;/a&gt;. Spikes was involved in a trade Monday that sent the 2-time Pro-Bowl linebacker, as well as backup quarterback &lt;a href="w%3AKelly%20Holcomb"&gt;Kelly Holcomb&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Eagles"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; for defensive tackle &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%20Walker"&gt;Darwin Walker&lt;/a&gt; and an undisclosed draft pick, probably in a later round of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20NFL%20Draft"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt;. Of Spikes, Eagles general manager &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Heckert"&gt;Tom Heckert&lt;/a&gt; said: "Takeo Spikes is a proven playmaker in the &lt;a href="w%3ANFL"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;." Heckert added, "He has the ability to play all three &lt;a href="w%3Alinebacker"&gt;linebacking&lt;/a&gt; positions and were happy to add him to our defense."

Spikes has dealt with injuries throughout his career, missing 13 games in 2005 with an Achillies tendon injury. He also missed four games this past season with problems in his hamstring. Despite his injuries, Spikes has been a playmaker for Buffalo, and previously for Cincinnati, rolling up 878 tackles, 21.5 sacks, 12 interceptions, 12 forced fumbles, and 14 fumble recoveries.

Kelly Holcomb, also involved in the deal, is 33 years old, with 11 years experience as the backup quarterback in &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Colts"&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Browns"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently Buffalo. Holcomb spent the 2006 season behind &lt;a href="w%3AJ.P.%20Losman"&gt;J.P. Losman&lt;/a&gt;.

Darwin Walker is a 7-year veteran of the league. In that time span, Walker has accumulated 170 tackles, 27.5 sacks, and 5 fourced fumbles, as well as 5 recoveries.

The publisher &lt;a href="w%3ADawn%20Group%20of%20Newspapers"&gt;Dawn Group&lt;/a&gt; has been under increasing pressure from the government to stop negative coverage of events happening on the troubled &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; border as well as recent events in the troubled province of &lt;a href="w%3ABalochistan%20%28Pakistan%29"&gt;Balochistan&lt;/a&gt;.

A series of emails written last week by &lt;a href="w%3AHameed%20Haroon"&gt;Hameed Haroon&lt;/a&gt;, the managing CEO of Dawn Goup and Pakistan's biggest English language newspaper, the &lt;a href="w%3ADawn%20%28newspaper%29"&gt;♡❤Dawn♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, have been circulated over the Internet. The emails allege that the government is depriving the newspaper of advertising revenue as a means of placing increasing pressure on it.

Mr. Haroon wrote, "It has always been difficult for governments to coexist with a free and independent press in Pakistan. Of late, however, the government headed by President Musharraf has become increasingly intolerant towards criticism in the press and towards the publishing of news that reflects poorly on the performance of his government on security matters." according to ♡❤AsiansInMedia.org♡❤.

The allegations came recently after the offices of the &lt;a href="w%3AGeo%20TV"&gt;Geo TV&lt;/a&gt; network and its affiliates, a media group unrelated to Dawn Group, were stormed by Islamabad police while the network was airing live video coverage of unrest caused by the dismissal of Chief Justice &lt;a href="w%3AIftikhar%20Muhammad%20Chaudhry"&gt;Iftikhar Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;President of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; has denied his government is targeting the media, and in the controversy sparked by the revelations insisted that he supports press freedom. "I granted freedom which the (Pakistani) media enjoys today," he said in a speech delivered Saturday in Pakpattan.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Allister"&gt;Jim Allister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (DUP) &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;Member of the European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MEP) for &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, resigned because of his party's decision to enter into a power-sharing Government with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Mr Allister said that party colleagues had been "lured by office" and that he had not returned to politics in 2004 to "help ease Sinn Féin into Government". He acknowledged that although he had fought within the DUP against Sinn Féin being permitted to be members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Stormont Assembly Executive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , he had failed to persuade the vast majority of the party's ruling executive on the issue. Yesterday, &lt;a href="Ian%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, DUP leader, and &lt;a href="Gerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt;, Sinn Féin President, agreed to enter into a power sharing executive in May. This is the second time that Jim Allister has resigned from the DUP over disagreements with Ian Paisley entering pacts with other political parties.

At &lt;a href="w%3AWilfrid%20Laurier%20University"&gt;Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWaterloo%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Waterloo, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, students are finding that popular &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20audio%20player"&gt;MP3 players&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;, are very convenient devices for listening to music at the gym, while traveling on foot, and in the car.

In a recent ad-hoc survey conducted by Wikinews contributor Darren Mar, 150 students were randomly pulled aside in the hallways of the university, and asked if they own an MP3 player. 94 of the 150 students (62.66%) did in fact own MP3 devices, most of who were found to be carrying it on them when questioned. There was one simple follow up question for those who had a player: "If it were possible to have complete and safe control of the device on the steering wheel of a car, would you rather listen to your device, or the radio?" There were three answers possible, yes, no or both. Of the 94, 78 (82.98%) said yes, eleven (11.70%) said no, and five (5.32%) said both. The reporting took place primarily on March 16, 2007. The reasons for those who would listen to their device were commercial free music, personalized choice of music, and complete control of what you are listening to.

This study was motivated by the new design of 2006+ model cars. Many are being built with auxiliary jacks for the stock radio, allowing the driver to easily connect any audio playing device to the car's sound system with a simple 3.5mm plug. What's more, cars in the upper price echelon are being built with (1) a custom made area in the dash for MP3 players (iPod's being the most popular), and (2) implementing audio device control right onto the steering wheel. A good example of this is the Ford Fusion or the 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ALexus%20IS"&gt;Lexus IS250&lt;/a&gt;: "The centre console input port allows an iPod, MP3 or Windows Media Audio player to be plugged into the IS audio system."

<h3>US Senate endorses spending bill with Iraq withdrawal date</h3>

By defeating an amendment that would have stricken language for a withdrawal date of March 31, 2008, the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; endorsed a spending bill that provides $121.6 billion mostly for the ongoing efforts in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; version of the bill has a mandatory withdrawal date of September 30, 2008. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has publicly stated that he would &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aveto"&gt;veto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; any legislation that included a withdrawal date. The Senate will soon vote on the bill.

<h3>Global stock markets are lower</h3>

US stocks fell on Tuesday starting another round of global selling, as worries about the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; housing market and weaker consumer confidence. &lt;a href="w%3ALennar%20Corporation"&gt;Lennar Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest US home builders reported that profits fell 73%. Wednesday, Asia markets opened steady to higher, but fell as rising oil prices and the geopolitcal standoff between Britain and Iran made investors seek the safety of government bonds. European and North American markets are trading lower in the Wednesday trading session.

The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; secured a spot in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Stanley%20Cup%20Playoffs"&gt;2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs&lt;/a&gt; when they defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Capitals"&gt;Washington Capitals&lt;/a&gt; Thursday night, before 18,227 at the Verizon Center.

The Capitals got off to a fast start, after Washington's &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Semin"&gt;Alexander Semin&lt;/a&gt; took a pass from &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Ovechkin"&gt;Alexander Ovechkin&lt;/a&gt;, and backhanded it past Pittsburgh goalie &lt;a href="w%3AMarc-Andre%20Fleury"&gt;Marc-Andre Fleury&lt;/a&gt; at 5:59 in the first period. Less than five minutes later, &lt;a href="w%3ABoyd%20Gordon"&gt;Boyd Gordon&lt;/a&gt; would double the Capitals lead, scoring his 6th goal of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Ouellet"&gt;Michel Ouellet&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of a Penguins power play at 12:08, sending an &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Christinsen"&gt;Erik Christinsen&lt;/a&gt; pass past &lt;a href="w%3AOlaf%20Kolzig"&gt;Olaf Kolzig&lt;/a&gt; to narrow the Capitals lead to one goal. Pittsburgh dominated the second period, with &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Crosby"&gt;Sidney Crosby&lt;/a&gt; picking up his 35th goal in between two goals by &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Whitney"&gt;Ryan Whitney&lt;/a&gt;. In a last minute desprate attempt at a comeback, &lt;a href="w%3AMilan%20Jurcina"&gt;Milan Jurcina&lt;/a&gt; scored to make it 4-3. Unfortunatley for the Capitals, Jurcina's goal came with only 32 seconds remaining in regulation. Washington was unable to score again, lifting the Penguins to victory, and securing their berth into the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

Washington has dropped 13 of their last 15 games while the Penguins have won 3 strait. The Caps return to the ice Friday, when they will travel to Miami to battle the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Panthers"&gt;Panthers&lt;/a&gt;. The Pens will travel to Boston to take on the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Bruins"&gt;Bruins&lt;/a&gt;, Thursday. The &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/wiki/NHL%3A_Penguins_blank_Bruins_to_catch_Devils"&gt;Penguins defeated Boston 5-0&lt;/a&gt; Sunday afternoon in Pittsburgh.

The head of a day care centre in &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, has boarded a bus containing 32 children and 2 teachers from the centre and is holding them hostage, demanding better education rights and better housing for them.

Jun Ducat and one other armed individual took the party hostage while they were going out on a trip with the day care centre. 

The bus has been surrounded by armed Filipino police, and through negotiation, the hostage takers agreed to release all the remaining children on the bus at 11:00am BST (10:00am GMT), but the deadline for this has now passed with no sign of the remaining children being released as per the agreement.

One child has been released from the bus and taken away by police and emergency medical services suffering from a high fever.

Mr Ducat said that he had no intention of harming the people aboard the bus in any way, and indeed, the siege has ended with his surrender.

"I accept that I should be jailed because what I did was against the law," Ducat said in an interview with ♡❤Associated Press♡❤. No child was reported physically injured, but they are undergoing medical checkups and psychological debriefings.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20cricket%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka%20cricket%20team"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; by 1 wicket (with 10 balls remaining) in a dramatic finish in the Super 8 phase of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AProvidence%20Stadium"&gt;Providence Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgetown"&gt;Georgetown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGuyana"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt;.

South Africa looked to be cruising to victory, needing just 4 more runs at 206-5, before Sri Lanka's &lt;a href="w%3ALasith%20Malinga"&gt;Lasith Malinga&lt;/a&gt; set a new &lt;a href="w%3ACricket_World_Cup_records%23Bowling"&gt;World Cup record&lt;/a&gt; - and also ODI level record - with 4 wickets from 4 balls. Nevertheless, South Africa held their nerve to scrape home by one wicket.

&lt;a href="w%3ACharl%20Langeveldt"&gt;Charl Langeveldt&lt;/a&gt; had earlier taken the first 5 wicket haul of the competition - dismissing 3 in his final over.

This was both teams' first game in the Super 8 stage, although Sri Lanka already had 2 points on the board, thanks to their victory over &lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh%20cricket%20team"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; in the group stage. South Africa entered empty-handed, having lost to their fellow group qualifiers, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

Another Full day of matches occurred Wednesday in the qualification rounds of the 2008 Euro. Big games of the day included Italy taking on Scotland, and Sweden visiting Northern Ireland.

<h4>Group A</h4>
Azerbaijan played host to second place Finland, and Azerbaijan earned their first win of the tournament with a goal from Emin Imamaliev giving them the 1-0 win. Poland played host to last place Armenia, and the group leaders came out on top 1-0. Portugal jumped past Finland into second place with a 1-1 draw with Serbia. Tiago scored after only 5 minutes to give Portugal the lead, but a thirty-seventh minute goal by Bosko Jankovic tied the game for the Serbs.

<h4>Group B</h4>
Georgia defeated last place Faroe Islands by a scoreline of 3-1, while the Ukraine pulled out a 1-0 win at home to Lithuania. In one of the biggest group matches, Scotland travelled to Italy to take on the Azzuri. A brace from Luca Toni gave Italy a 2-0 win, giving the Italians a great chance of qualifying.

<h4>Group C</h4>
Hungary jumped over Malta into fifth place with a 1-0 win over Moldova, while Malta lost to visiting Greece by the same scoreline. Group leaders Turkey battled back from a 2-0 deficit to earn a 2-2 draw against fourth place Norway, leaving Turkey one point clear of Greece.
<h4>Group D</h4>
The Czech Republic squeaked by Cyprus 1-0, giving the Czech's commanding control of second in Group D. The Republic of Ireland kept in close contention for a place in the Euro finals with a 1-0 win over Slovakia. The win leaves the Irish two points back of the second place Czech's. Wales put three past San Marino to give their Euro campaign a boost. A goal after only three minutes by Ryan Giggs was all they needed to win, but defender Gareth Bale and Jason Koumas scored to ensure the points for the Welsh.

<h4>Group E</h4>
Israel thumped Estonia 4-0 with Chelsea youngster Ben Sahar earning a brace three minutes apart in the second half. In the only other game in the group, England visited Andorra in an attempt to quiet the critics over head coach Steve McClaren. Though the game went into the break 0-0, two goals by Steven Gerrard after the restart and a stoppage time marker by David Nugent lifted England to a convincing away win. The win puts England on 11 points, equal to both Israel and Russia, but the Russians have a game in hand.

<h4>Group F</h4>
Mario Frick's goal in the seventeenth minute was enough to lift Liechtenstein over Latvia, giving them their first win of the Euro campaign. Northern Ireland came back from a 1-0 deficit to defeat Sweden by a score of 2-1. Both goals scored for Ireland were by David Healy, who has scored 5 in his past two games. The win pushes Northern Ireland into first over Sweden. A goal in the eighty-first minute by Andres Iniesta lifted Spain over Iceland 1-0. The win lifted Spain past idle Denamrk into fourth place.

<h4>Group G</h4>
Bulgaria and Albania played out to a stalemate, while Romania put three by Luxembourg to jump into second spot in the group. A goal in the 86th minute by Giovanni van Bronckhorst gave the Netherlands a 1-0 win over Slovenia, and leaves Holland three points clear of Romania at the top of the group.

The publishing companies &lt;a href="w%3ABloomsbury%20Publishing"&gt;Bloomsbury&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3AScholastic%20Corporation"&gt;Scholastic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;) released cover art for the seventh &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; book, &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Deathly%20Hallows"&gt;♡❤Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

"The structures around Harry show evident destruction and in the shadows behind him, we see outlines of other people," David Saylor, Scholastic's art director, said in a statement describing the U.S. version. "For the first time, the cover is a wraparound. On the back cover spidery hands are outstretched toward Harry. Only when the book is opened does one see a powerful image of "&lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Voldemort"&gt;He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named&lt;/a&gt;", his glowing red eyes peering out from his hood."

The children's U.K. version of the cover shows an adult Harry, &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Weasley"&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AHermione%20Granger"&gt;Hermione&lt;/a&gt;. The adult U.K. version shows a locket with a serpentine forming an 'S'. It is believed to be a &lt;a href="w%3AHorcrux"&gt;horcrux&lt;/a&gt; in which Lord Voldemort stores part of his soul.

The seventh, and final, book is due out on July 21, 2007.

The U.S. covers for the Harry Potter series are drawn by &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20GrandPr%C3%A9"&gt;Mary GrandPré&lt;/a&gt;. The U.K. covers are drawn by Jason Crockcroft.

A &lt;a href="w%3ALAN%20Airlines"&gt;LAN Airlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A340"&gt;Airbus A340&lt;/a&gt; was making its approach into Auckland when incandescent objects flew by at super-sonic speeds. &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; media initially reported that it was debris from a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n satellite breaking up during re-entry. &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; said it was more likely to be &lt;a href="w%3AMeteoroid"&gt;meteors&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Aviation%20Authority%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; is set to investigate the incident.

<h3>North Korea asks for food aid</h3>

According to an official for &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Programme"&gt;World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt; (WFP), North Korea has admitted that the country faces food shortages and needs help. WFP is appealing to donor countries to step up aid, and to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; to keep food aid outside of the nuclear debate. Food donations dropped dramatically after North Korea carried out its &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20North%20Korean%20nuclear%20test"&gt;nuclear test bombing&lt;/a&gt;. North Korea's shortage may be approaching 20% of what it needs to feed its people.

<h3>Man killed during hooligans clashes in Athens</h3>

A 25 year old man was killed during clashes between fans of &lt;a href="w%3AOlympiacos"&gt;Olympiacos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APanathinaikos"&gt;Panathinaikos&lt;/a&gt; in the suburb of &lt;a href="w%3APeania"&gt;Peania&lt;/a&gt;, in east &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;. The victim died at a central hospital from several injuries he suffered. The fight happened prior to a local women &lt;a href="w%3Avolleyball"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt; game in Peania. However, witnesses and residents told &lt;a href="w%3AAlter%20Channel"&gt;Alter Channel&lt;/a&gt; that the clashes had no relation with the game but were pre-organized by &lt;a href="w%3AHooliganism"&gt;hooligan clubs&lt;/a&gt; in the area. The event caused political turbulent in &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; as long as Greek police and the Minister of Public Order have been accused by some media for their failure to prevent fans' clashes.

<h3>Senate passes spending bill with withdrawal date</h3>

Despite a &lt;a href="w%3AVeto"&gt;veto&lt;/a&gt; threat from &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;US President Bush&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt; today passed a spending bill that includes a time-table for a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; withdrawal from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Passing 51-47, the legislation echoes that passed recently by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt;. It sets a goal of pulling all combat troops out of Iraq by the end of March 2008, without explicitly demanding their removal.

<h3>Further escalation of sectarian violence in Iraq</h3>

<h1>Iran Foreign Minister: Britain must admit to trespassing before soldiers are released</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iran%20Foreign%20Minister%3A%20Britain%20must%20admit%20to%20trespassing%20before%20soldiers%20are%20released&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Iran%29"&gt;Foreign Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Manouchehr%20Mottaki"&gt;Manouchehr Mottaki&lt;/a&gt; has said that &lt;a href="UK"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; must admit to illegally entering Iranian waters before the 15 sailors and marines detained by Iran on March 23 are to be released.

"This [situation] can be solved. But they have to show that it was a mistake, that will help us to end this issue. Admitting the mistake will facilitate a solution to the problem," Mottaki said during a summit in &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;.

Britain has not yet responded to the comment. 

According to a UK government report, the Iranian government initially gave the position of the incident as a location outside Iranian territorial waters. However, on March 24, General Alireza Afshar, Iran's top military general, stated that the sailors were engaged "in illegal and suspicious activities" inside Iranian waterways at the time of their detention and that the sailors "have admitted to violating the territorial waters of the Islamic republic". 

After the UK government queried the statement by General Alireza Afshar, the Iranian government gave a revised position for the incident, now placing it ♡❤inside♡❤ Iranian territorial waters.
Despite the increased tension, Mottaki stated that officials from Britain will be able to see the soldiers.

"We have accepted that [the request by Britain], there is no problem. Measures are underway [to allow officials to meet] them. They can meet them," said Mottaki.

Meanwhile, the Secretary General of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; called for the release of the soldiers saying "I'd like to see them released." 

Ban has a scheduled meeting on Friday morning with Mottaki to discuss the current detainment of the British soldiers and plans to ask for their release.

The sailors and marines, from the frigate &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Cornwall%20%28F99%29"&gt;HMS ♡❤Cornwall♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, had been inspecting, in accordance with &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201723"&gt;UN Security Council Resolution 1723&lt;/a&gt;, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared after inspection, when Iranian gunboats surrounded the troops.

In parliament yesterday, UK Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; was asked about the rules of engagement for UK forces operating under a UN mandate in Iraqi waters. Blair suggested that "the rules of engagement do allow [UK] forces to take whatever measures are necessary in their own self-defence...I think that [the soldiers] took the right decision and did what was entirely sensible," said Blair in reference to the UK forces not engaging in military combat when first confronted by the Iranians.

Blair also commented on the response by the crew of HMS ♡❤Cornwall♡❤. "By the time HMS ♡❤Cornwall♡❤ knew that our forces had been detained unlawfully by the Iranians, they were in Iranian waters, and again military engagement would have put a lot of lives at risk. I think that they took the right decision," said Blair.

Eswar Prasad, a professor at the trade policy from the Cornell University, warns the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; legislators, that their bill could poison the relationship between USA and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

This warning was given regarding the U.S. bill, which is meant to force China to raise the value of its national currency &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20yuan"&gt;yuan&lt;/a&gt;. Currently yuan has a value, which is about 40% lower than it should be, as stated by the legislators, which gives the Chinese trading companies a huge advantage on the international trading ground. 

Professor Prasad, who was a China trade expert and an economist at the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; until late last year, said that this bill would not have a long lasting effect and would not influence the problems the legislators are trying to avoid. 

The opinion of the China trade specialist was that the USA should try to collaborate with Chinese officials in order to fix the problem of U.S. trade deficit and the current instabilities in the Chinese economy. The strategy to force the Chinese Government to do something would only worsen the relationship between the two countries.

The expert's opinion was it was more important to concentrate on the question what framework of the monetary policy could substitute the fixed exchange rate of the Chinese currency, which helped China in anchoring the inflation expectations.

Mr. Prasad added that the best way to stabilize the Chinese economy would be to couple an inflation objective with a flexibility of exchange rate.

The bill needs two thirds of the votes both in the U.S. House of Representatives and in the Senate, in order President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; would not have the possibility to veto the bill.

This was West Indies second game of the Super 8 stage, having already lost to Australia only yesterday. For New Zealand it was their first game in this stage, although they already had two points carried forward from their group stage victory over England.

The body of Anson Tripp, 29, of Amherst, Massachusetts, a &lt;a href="w%3ARensselaer%20Polytechnic%20Institute"&gt;Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&lt;/a&gt; alumnus was found in the South East stairwell of the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20M.%20Low%20Center%20for%20Industrial%20Innovation"&gt;CII building&lt;/a&gt; of the school's &lt;a href="w%3ATroy%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Troy, New York&lt;/a&gt; campus by a college employee at approximately 10 AM. The former student had driven to RPI that morning from his home in Amherst, Massachusetts. Tripp left his home in Amherst in the morning and drove to Rensselaer, where he entered the CII and climbed to the top of one of the stairwells and apparently jumped to his death. He suffered multiple broken bones and head trauma in the jump, and his body came to rest between the fourth and fifth floors.

In a letter to the school community, &lt;a href="w%3AShirley%20Jackson%20%28physicist%29"&gt;President Shirley Jackson&lt;/a&gt; begins:
Initially authorities said the wound was "consistent with that from a gunshot," however an autopsy determined that the broken bones and trauma to the head were sustained during the fall. Earlier in the day, police indicated that "it’s possible the victim fell from the ninth floor after being injured somehow." (&lt;a href="w%3AWNYT"&gt;WNYT&lt;/a&gt;) People in the building had reported hearing shots, but authorities were unable to confirm a shooting and later determined there was no weapon involved.

The building was locked down as the Troy police emergency response team and Colonie &lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; team went room to room securing the facility. School president Dr. Jackson (quoted above) urged students and all non-essential staff to also leave campus (except for the dorms).

Tripp was in the class of 2000 with majors in computer science and mathematics, and a member of &lt;a href="w%3AAlpha%20Phi%20Omega"&gt;Alpha Phi Omega&lt;/a&gt;, Epsilon Zeta chapter. 

Memorial service were held at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gracechurchamherst.org"&gt;Grace Episcopal Church&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, April 4th at 3PM EST.

The Devils came into Wednesday night's game trailing the Buffalo Sabres by five points in the Eastern Conference, and with the Pittsburgh Penguins hot on their trail. New Jersey needed the win to close the gap to three points, and to stay ahead of the Penguins. Neither happened, however, as the Sabres defeated the Devils before 18,690 at HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York.

Just 1:55 into the first period, Jochen Hecht scored his first of two goals, his 18th of the season, assisted by Jason Pominville and Dmitri Kalinin, who would pick up two assists in the game. At 6:42, Scott Gomez responded for the Devils to tie the game at 1-1. Patrik Elias and Brian Rafalski were credited with assists. In the second period, Buffalo would make it 2-1 at 7:25, when Daniel Paille, assisted by Adam Mair and Teppo Numminen scored. The Sabres scored again at 11:47, when Jochen Hecht would tally his second goal of the game from a pass by Daniel Briere. Dmitri Kalinin was also credited with an assist on the goal. Trailing 3-1, New Jersey came back with their own goal at 13:49, when Paul Martin picked up his third goal of the season, narrowing the deficit to one goal. Ales Kotalik would put the game out of reach at 15:52, when he would beat Martin Brodeur for his 15th goal of the season. Dainius Zubrus, along with Chris Drury, would be given credit for assisting the play. With two seconds remaining in the game, the Devils Zach Parise scored, but it was too late, as the Sabres would hold on for the win.

Martin Brodeur saved 19 of 23 shots faced. Ryan Miller, the 3rd star of the game, stopped 28 of 31 shots faced, accumulating a .903 save percentage in the game.

Today, several trade unions and women's organisations organised actions in public places and companies all over &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; to promote &lt;a href="w%3Aequal%20pay%20for%20women"&gt;equal pay for women&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteers handed out flyers about the issue at the &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels%20Airport"&gt;Brussels Airport&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; subway and in train stations, companies, hospitals and schools throughout the country.

The third edition of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;-inspired Equal Pay Day was called for by the socialist women's organisations ♡❤zij-kant♡❤ and the women-section of the trade union &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Federation%20of%20Belgian%20Labour"&gt;ABVV&lt;/a&gt;, in partnership with their &lt;a href="w%3AWallonia"&gt;Francophone&lt;/a&gt; equivalents, &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20%28francophone%20Belgium%29"&gt;PS&lt;/a&gt;-women and the union FGTB, the Institute for Equality of Women and Men, the Catholic Worker's Women Movement (KAV) and the union &lt;a href="w%3AConfederation%20of%20Christian%20Trade%20Unions"&gt;ACV&lt;/a&gt;.

The Institute for Equality of Women and Men reports that wages are still on average 15% lower for women in Belgium. This figures varies in different studies. In a report ordered by the trade unions, the Higher Institute for Work of the &lt;a href="w%3AKatholieke%20Universiteit%20Leuven"&gt;Catholic University of Leuven&lt;/a&gt; reports a pay difference of 26%, based on an analysis of the wages of 20 000 men and women. This also results in an inequity in pensions.

According to the Structure of Earnings Survey by &lt;a href="w%3AEurostat"&gt;Eurostat&lt;/a&gt;, the European gender pay-gap mounts to 26%, whereas in Belgium the difference is around 17%. &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; are doing even better, while in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; women earn around 30% less.
The inequity in payment results from company's human resource management, but is also influenced by the role of the women in the family, education, and so on. But even when these factors are taken into account, there is still a difference of 5 to 7%.

The organisations acknowledge that there have been small improvements, and that there have been hopeful political steps since their action last year. Because their target of equal wages for men and woman has moved a little bit closer, they've decided to hold the third edition one day earlier, on March 30 instead of March 31. This date symbolises the 15 months a woman has to work on average to earn the same as her male colleague. &lt;a href="w%3AMale-female%20income%20disparity%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;In the United States&lt;/a&gt;, the difference is bigger, and hence the Equal Pay Day is only held on April 24. The &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an Equal Pay Day was been held last February 22.

With their campaign, the organisation urges politicians to improve the rapports on the phenomenon, to encourage gender-friendly human resource management in businesses, to address gender-issues in the schools, and to keep their previous promises.

&lt;a href="w%3ADell%20Inc."&gt;Dell Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a global leader in computer hardware manufacturing and sales, announced yesterday that it will delay filing of its annual performance report, the &lt;a href="w%3AForm%2010-k"&gt;Form 10-K&lt;/a&gt;, required for compliance with &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission"&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; (SEC) and &lt;a href="w%3ANasdaq"&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; listing rules.

In a press release, Dell explained that an audit committee of the company's board of directors is carrying out an investigation into accounting and financial reporting issues. The company stated that it would delay filing of the 10-K since the investigation had not been completed.

The internal investigation has found evidence of accounting errors, misconduct, and deficiencies in areas of financial control.

The chairman of Dell's audit committee, Thomas Luce III, indicated that the delay in filing would extend past the April 3, 2007 deadline as well as an April 18, 2007 extension date. "As we move toward the conclusion of our investigation, we are committing the time and resources required to ensure a thorough and comprehensive review and resolution of all identified issues and the implementation of appropriate remedial measures,” said Luce.

The investigation is to determine whether the restatement of any financial disclosures are warranted, based on the accounting errors identified. The probe will also assess whether there are deficiencies in Dell’s internal control over financial reporting.

<h3>Boat capsizes in Guinea, up to 60 dead</h3>

A boat carrying around 120 passengers capsized and sank off the coast of &lt;a href="Guinea"&gt;Guinea&lt;/a&gt; and as many as 60 did not survive. State television called the type of boat a &lt;a href="w%3APirogue"&gt;pirogue&lt;/a&gt;, which is usually used for fishing. However, many people living in coastal communities in Guinea use open boats to travel between towns due to the poor roads.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; has issued a statement calling for a "early resolution" to the rising tensions between &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; by releasing all 15 British sailors and marines who were detained by Iranian forces on March 23.

"Members of the Security Council expressed grave concern at the capture by the Revolutionary Guard and the continuing detention by the government of Iran of 15 United Kingdom naval personnel and appealed to the government of Iran to allow consular access in terms of the relevant international laws," said the U.N. Security Council in a statement.

"Members of the Security Council support calls, including by the secretary general in his March 29 meeting with the Iranian foreign minister, for an early resolution of this problem including the release of the 15 UK personnel," added the statement.

All 15 members of the Council agreed to the wording of the statement and released it after nearly four hours of debate, but &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; opposed to having the statement or the Council's recommendations be "too harsh" or to put the blame fully on the Iranian government.

Iran released a statement shortly after the Security Council met saying that getting the U.N. involved, "will not be helpful."

"This case can and should be settled through bilateral channels. The British government's attempt to engage third parties, including the Security Council, with this case is not helpful," said a statement released by Iran's U.N Mission.

The sailors and marines from the frigate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Cornwall%20%28F99%29"&gt;HMS ♡❤Cornwall♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1723, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared after inspection when Iranian gunboats surrounded the sailors and arrested them at gunpoint.

On Thursday, Iran stated that they are "suspending" the release of the 15 soldiers, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFaye%20Turney"&gt;Faye Turney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a female soldier, 26, who was supposed to be released "very soon."

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i firm Environmental Energy Resources (EER) has announced that it has developed a new technology, plasma &lt;a href="w%3AGasification"&gt;gasification&lt;/a&gt; melting technology (PGM), to safely dispose of low- and medium-level &lt;a href="w%3ARadioactive%20waste"&gt;nuclear waste&lt;/a&gt;. Extremely high temperatures are used to turn the waste into a mildly radioactive glass-like substance, which can be used as a building material. The process also releases an extremely hot mixture of gases that can be used to power steam turbines, generating electricity. The company claims that 70% of this electricity is used to drive the PGM process, while 30% is available as exportable energy.

<h2>Environmental impact</h2>

The solid waste produced by PGM is resistant to leeching, so there is little danger of radiation contaminating water supplies. However, it remains to be seen how openly companies will accept the use of mildly radioactive slag as a building material, even for use as a road bed filler.

The waste gases (hydrogen gas, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen gas, and various hydrocarbons) are produced by &lt;a href="w%3Apyrolysis"&gt;pyrolysis&lt;/a&gt; of organic substances in the input waste, and are therefore mainly harmless. If they were instead burned in the presence of oxygen, many of the usual pollutants would be produced, such as &lt;a href="w%3Anitrogen%20dioxide"&gt;nitrogen dioxide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adioxin"&gt;dioxin&lt;/a&gt;. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are examples of pollutants that ♡❤are♡❤ generated by PGM, however, so the process cannot be called entirely clean.

<h2>Origins</h2>

PGM was developed by EER with the help of &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n scientists from Russia's Kurchatov Institute research center, the Radon Institute in Russia, and Israel's Technion Institute. The company, founded in 2000, won the bid to clean up after the &lt;a href="w%3AChernobyl%20disaster"&gt;nuclear disaster at Chernobyl&lt;/a&gt;.

Iranian television has aired new video footage of three of the fifteen &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; sailors and marines seized by Iran a week ago. On Thursday evening, the Iranian Embassy in London released a second letter purported to be written by detained servicewoman &lt;a href="w%3AFaye%20Turney"&gt;Faye Turney&lt;/a&gt;. 

The footage was released hours after Iran criticized yesterday's &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; statement, which voiced “grave concern” over the incident and called for an "early resolution" of the matter. 

"I would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ... I deeply apologize," continued Summers. "They have looked after us really well."

According to the BBC, the UK Foreign Office described the latest video as "disgraceful exploitation".

A hand-written note, the second letter apparently written by Faye Turney, was released by Iran on Thursday evening. The letter requests the UK government to withdraw its troops from Iraq. "Isn't it time for us to start withdrawing our forces from Iraq and let them determine their own future," the letter states.

In reply, a Prime Minister's office spokesman said: "It is wrong. It is wrong in terms of the usual conventions that cover this. It is wrong in terms of basic humanity".

Iran has also released a third letter purporting to be from Leading Seaman Turney, addressed to the "British People". The letter states that she has been "sacrificed due to the intervening policies of the Bush and Blair governments" and repeats the call for the withdrawal of British and US forces from Iraq. British &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; said in response: "I really don't know why the Iranian regime keep doing this. All it does is enhance people's sense of disgust at captured personnel being paraded and manipulated in this way."

The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; says it has been able to confirm the names of six of the 15 sailors and marines held by Iran. Apart from Leading Seaman Turney and Seaman Summers (from &lt;a href="w%3AShropshire"&gt;Shropshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACornwall"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt; respectively), they are: Paul Barton from &lt;a href="w%3ASouthport"&gt;Southport&lt;/a&gt;, Danny Masterton from &lt;a href="w%3AAyrshire"&gt;Ayrshire&lt;/a&gt;, Joe Tindall from south &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and Adam Sperry from &lt;a href="w%3ALeicester"&gt;Leicester&lt;/a&gt;.

On March 23, the fifteen sailors and marines from the frigate &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Cornwall%20%28F99%29"&gt;HMS ♡❤Cornwall♡❤&lt;/a&gt; had been inspecting a ship, in what the UK identified as Iraqi waters, when they were surrounded by Iranian gunboats and taken into Iranian custody. Iran claims the UK forces were in Iranian waters, and are still detaining the fifteen.

The creation of the proposed "adult-only" &lt;a href="w%3ATop-Level%20Domain%20name"&gt;Top-Level Domain name&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A.xxx"&gt;.xxx&lt;/a&gt;, has again been rejected today by the board of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Corporation%20for%20Assigned%20Names%20and%20Numbers"&gt;Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers&lt;/a&gt; (ICANN), which manages the Internet's domain name systems. The creation of the TLD was opposed by a 9 to 4 vote, with one abstention on the part of ICANN CEO &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Twomey"&gt;Paul Twomey&lt;/a&gt;.

The domain was first proposed in 2001, with reasons stated as creating an "adults-only" section of the Internet, making it easier to filter out pornographic or otherwise unsuitable websites for children. The proposal was approved in June 2005, with a final decision to be made in December of the same year. However, in May 2006, the decision was reversed, and the approval was revoked. In January of this year, the proposal was reopened.

The rejection of the creation of the TLD today was focused on the main reason of ICANN not wanting to become involved in "content regulation". Steve Goldstein, ICANN board member, told the Associated Press that "the last point in our board's resolution that under the revised agreement that we, ICANN, would be forced to assume ongoing management and oversight roles regarding the content, and that is inconsistent with ICANN's technical mandate."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) announced at a press conference today that a chemical used in the manufacture of plastics was found in recalled pet food from &lt;a href="w%3AMenu%20Foods"&gt;Menu Foods&lt;/a&gt;.

The FDA found &lt;a href="w%3AMelamine"&gt;melamine&lt;/a&gt; in samples of Menu Foods pet food and in samples of &lt;a href="w%3AWheat%20gluten%20%28food%29"&gt;wheat gluten&lt;/a&gt;, imported from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, which was used as an ingredient. The FDA analysis, however, does not confirm the presence of the rodenticide &lt;a href="w%3AAminopterin"&gt;aminopterin&lt;/a&gt;, which was reported March 23 by the &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; State Food Laboratory.

According to Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, melamine is used primarily to make plastic kitchenware, although it has been used as a fertilizer in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;.

Sundlof also indicated that the presence of melamine in the urine of cats that died from &lt;a href="w%3ARenal%20failure"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt; was revealed through testing. He stressed that melamine was not determined to be the source of illness or deaths in the affected animals.

Sundlof suggested that melamine would not be found normally in pet food.

At a news conference Friday, Paul Henderson, President and CEO of Menu Foods, indicated that Menu Foods is satisfied that the contamination problem was related to melamine and not aminopterin. "One week ago, some of the dedicated researchers who had been investigating this matter reported the discovery of a single, toxic compound in our pet food," said Henderson in his opening statement. "That, seemingly, cleared the way for us to address the problem, deal fairly with the pet-owners who had been injured, put our business back together, and move on," he continued. 

"In the intervening week, other top scientists have been unable to validate the findings. That is, they were unable to find the toxin – called aminopterin – in our pet food, or in any of the component ingredients. It was also brought to our attention that some veterinary experts held the view that aminopterin was inconsistent with what was being observed in dogs and cats," Henderson said.

Menu Foods has determined that melamine in wheat gluten from a new US supplier was the likely source of contamination, and that they are confident that the issue has been resolved. "Melamine has been found in the wheat gluten from a new supplier in the United States, who sourced this wheat gluten in China," said Henderson. "This is the same ingredient that Menu Foods made reference to in its recall press release of March 16. Melamine has not been found in the wheat gluten that we obtain from our other suppliers." 

Henderson refused to name the supplier of the wheat gluten, leaving that up to the FDA. "We have had correspondence with the FDA and we know that they are diligently following-up on the supply of the suspect wheat gluten. It is not our place to name the supplier as we do not want to interfere in any way with the important investigation they are conducting."

Menu Foods is maintaining the warning on the previously recalled product. "The recalled product is unfit for consumption by pets. It contains melamine. The pet food that we have manufactured after March 6 is safe and healthy," stated Henderson.

Menu Foods is the manufacturer of several brands of cat and dog food subject to a March 16, 2007 recall.

<h1>Israeli website reports speculation over U.S. attack on Iran in April</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Israeli%20website%20reports%20speculation%20over%20U.S.%20attack%20on%20Iran%20in%20April&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Reports from the &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i website Debka.com, which reports on intelligence matters, say that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is planning to launch air strikes on &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; targets on &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday"&gt;Good Friday&lt;/a&gt;, April 6 at 4:00 a.m. local time (UTC+3:30), citing unnamed &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n intelligence officials. 
The Under Secretary for Political Affairs at the United States State Department, &lt;a href="w%3ANicholas%20Burns"&gt;Nicholas Burns&lt;/a&gt;, however, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday that diplomacy was the "best and preferred" course of action in dealing with Iran, adding "I do not believe a military confrontation with Iran is either desirable or inevitable." 

Another newspaper, the Russian weekly "Argoumenty Nedeli" (♡❤Week Arguments♡❤) is quoted by the Russian Information Agency (RIA) &lt;a href="w%3ANovosti"&gt;Novosti&lt;/a&gt; as saying that the attack is planned for a single continuous attack of 12 hours from 4am to 4pm, with the choice of the &lt;a href="w%3AEaster"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt; holidays in many Western countries likely since "Western opinion" will be "on holidays". Friday 6 April is cited by Novosti as a likely, though not definite, date. Another RIA Novosti report written in French and dated March 30 states that the US military command is ready to make an attack during the first fortnight of April, but that any final decision will be made by US political leaders.

The targets will be "Iranian nuclear installations" that will be "designed to be devastating enough to set &lt;a href="w%3ATehran%2C%20Iran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;’s nuclear program several years back," said the website quoting unnamed Russian intelligence officials.

United States forces completed a large-scale series of military exercises in the Persian gulf off the Iranian coastline this week, involving 15 ships, 125 aircraft and 13,000 sailors. Naval commanders said the exercises were meant to demonstrate United States' commitment to security in the region, including keeping sea-lanes open for oil shipment and were defensive in nature.

Despite the claims by the Russian official, Iran does not think that the U.S. can "pressure" the U.S. tax payers into another war.

"U.S. officials are under pressure from Americans. I don't think the U.S. is in a position to mount its pressure on the U.S. taxpayers," said &lt;a href="Manuchehr%20Mottaki"&gt;Manuchehr Mottaki&lt;/a&gt;, Iran's Foreign Minister.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Cooperation%20Council"&gt;Gulf Cooperation Council&lt;/a&gt; has called on its member nations - &lt;a href="Kuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Qatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oman"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;, all home to U.S. forces in the region, to not take part in an attack on Iran. Qatar and the Emirates have already said that they would not.

"Russian intelligence has information that the U.S. Armed Forces stationed in the Persian Gulf have nearly completed preparations for a missile strike against Iranian territory. The Pentagon has drafted a highly effective plan that will allow the Americans to bring Iran to its knees at minimal cost," said the unnamed Russian intelligence official as reported by ♡❤RIA Novosti♡❤ a Russian based news agency.

The strike force is allegedly going to be composed of the "&lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Nimitz"&gt;USS Nimitz&lt;/a&gt; and its support ships" which will join forces with the ♡❤John C. Stennis strike group♡❤ when it leaves the U.S. on April 2.

Although the Nimitz is scheduled to relieve the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower"&gt;USS Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt;, all three ships will remain in the &lt;a href="w%3APersian%20Gulf"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt; if the 15 &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; sailors and marines being detained by Iran are not released and will also remain if any armed conflict begins between the two nations.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Bataan"&gt;USS Bataan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Boxer"&gt;USS Boxer&lt;/a&gt; will also be part of the strike force.

The Nimitz strike force will be "composed of the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Princeton%20%28CG-59%29"&gt;USS Princeton&lt;/a&gt; guided-missile cruiser, four guided missile destroyers – the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Higgins%20%28DDG-76%29"&gt;USS Higgins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Chafee%20%28DDG-90%29"&gt;USS Chafee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20John%20Paul%20Jones%20%28DDG-53%29"&gt;USS John Paul Jones&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Pinckney%20%28DDG-91%29"&gt;USS Pinckney&lt;/a&gt;. The strike force is armed with two helicopter squadrons and a special unit for dismantling sea mines and other explosive devices," said Debka according to Russian intelligence officials.

"We are constantly working on how to resolve the situation around the Iranian nuclear program and other conflicts peacefully. This policy is unchanged and we will pursue it in the future," said Lavrov.

Russian intelligence officials also say that the recent U.S. military exercise in the Gulf on March 27 was "practice" for the strike in April and that it will be up the U.S. "leadership" to give the go ahead as by April, the military is expected to be ready for the strike.

Different sources agree that the attack is allegedly only going to take place by air and will last 12 hours. No attack by land is expected. The attack is allegedly going to be called "Operation Bite."

Russia's Defense Ministry refuses to comment on the reports.

Three goals by Peter Crouch gave Liverpool a comfortable 4-1 win over rivals Arsenal on Saturday at Anfield. The two teams are in a battle for third place in the league at the moment, and both are in need of points to guarantee a Champion's League berth for next season. Liverpool's win puts them in third for the time being, but Arsenal have a game in hand still to be played out against Manchester City. Saturday's match acted as a return to the Premiership for Peter Crouch after his broken nose kept him out for several games, and he played as a lone striker with Steven Gerrard acting as close support from midfield. Arsenal meanwhile played two strikers with Emmanuel Adebayor returning from suspension being paired with Julio Baptista.

Liverpool started the game very strongly, with Peter Crouch scoring after only four minutes. A back heeled one-two between Pennant and Arbeloa release Arbeloa on the right side, and his low cross found Crouch, who slotted the ball past Jens Lehmann. Arsenal responded positively with a header by Adebayor, but the ball flew just over the crossbar and landed on top of the netting. Baptista then had a chance on goal for Arsenal after he was found open by Adebayor, but the Brazilian's shot was scuffed well wide of the net and failed to trouble Jose Reina. Arsenal would be made to pay for their missed chances minutes later as Crouch bagged his second of the afternoon when he headed in a cross from Fabio Aurelio.

Jens Lehmann was awarded a yellow card during the halftime break for allegedly spitting water at a Liverpool supporter, but the game continued without further incident. Steven Gerrard had the first of the chances in the second half, but his shot from just outside the box was directly at Lehmann. Arsenal then had their best chance through Adebayor, but he was unlucky to see his low drive cannon off the base of the post with Reina well beaten. Liverpool then increased their lead on sixty minutes when Agger directed Aurelio's curling free kick into the back of the net past a diving Lehmann. Adebayor continued to threaten Liverpool's goal however, and if not for a fingertip save from Reina, he would have pulled one back for Arsenal off a header. Arsenal would pull one back minutes later through William Gallas has he tapped home a corner from Cesc Fabregas. Arsenal put on pressure for a few minutes in an attempt to force a grand-stand finish, but it was to be Liverpool who would score next. Germain Pennant's cross into the box found Crouch, and after some good control and a flick between his legs, the tall Englishman powered his third into the back of the net, sealing the victory for Liverpool. 

Liverpool now travel to Holland to take on PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League, the team that dropped Arsenal out of the same competition. Arsenal meanwhile have no competitions left but the Premiership to take part in, and their next game is at home to strugglers West Ham United.

Many lights in , 's largest city, were turned off for one hour at 19:30 local time (09:30 UTC) on March 31, 2007 to raise awareness of climate change. This ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEarth%20hour"&gt;Earth hour&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which was organised by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature"&gt;World Wide Fund for Nature&lt;/a&gt; (WWF), received support from the government of New South Wales, many environmental groups and some businesses.

Many famous buildings such as the Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge and Luna Park took part.

Organisers also hoped the event would encourage Australians to conserve energy, claiming if various electronics were switched off when they were not in use the country's greenhouse gas emissions could reduce by up to 5%.

Brad Patrick and Danny Wool announced their resignations from the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; last week.

Danny Wool, previous Grants Coordinator for the Foundation made his resignation first known on March 20, by removing his name from the listing on the Foundation's website. Unlike Patrick, this was the first indication of Wool's resignation.

According to a &lt;a href="http%3A//lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2007-March/028398.html"&gt;mailing list post&lt;/a&gt; by Wool, he will be running for a seat on the Board of Trustees, the Wikimedia Foundation's governing body, in June. Earlier in the same message, he says that he is unwilling to discuss the reasons of his resignation with the community.

Brad Patrick's resignation was known to the Board of Trustees about a month previously and was made public on March 22. Patrick says in his &lt;a href="http%3A//lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2007-March/028404.html"&gt;mailing list message&lt;/a&gt; that his resignation is not related to Wools, and that "the timing is just unfortunate". Patrick says that he will not be leaving the Wikimedia projects, just "not going to be the WMF's General Counsel" anymore.

In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AWired%20News"&gt;Wired News&lt;/a&gt;, Patrick criticized the Board's ability to "handle things", as well as concerns with the "informal structure of the Board" and "the inexperience of its seven members". When contacted by phone, &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimbo Wales&lt;/a&gt; said that he was confused by Patrick's statements.

"What I hope for is for the board to decide to choose a future that will be conducive to a very powerful executive director who can provide some much needed leadership right now," Patrick said.

The Colorado Avalanche beat the Minnesota Wild 2-1 with goalie &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Budaj"&gt;Peter Budaj&lt;/a&gt;'s 10th win in March, keeping their playoff hopes alive.

Marian Gaborik scored the opener for the Wild only 1:21 into the first period, but answered goals from Justin Lilles and Peter Stastny in the second period lifted the Avalanche to victory.

With the win, the Avalanche tied a team record with 11 wins in a month. Budaj had a 10-0-2 record this March, tying the franchise record for wins in any month. It was set by the &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20Nordiques"&gt;Quebec Nordiques&lt;/a&gt;'s Daniel Bouchard in February 1981.

Colorado is five games behind the &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary%20Flames"&gt;Calgary Flames&lt;/a&gt; in the race for the 8th spot the Western Conference, the last spot for the playoffs. The Flames play the &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Canucks"&gt;Vancouver Canucks&lt;/a&gt; Saturday night and play Colorado Tuesday night.

Minnesota lost its third straight game, jeapordizing their chances in their close race with Vancouver for the Northwest Division title.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGuant%C3%A1namo%20Bay"&gt;Guantánamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; prisoner &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; was sentenced Friday by a special military court after pleading guilty to providing material support to the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but will only need to complete nine months of his penalty, most of it back in Australia, under the terms of his plea agreement.

Hicks, who has been detained for more than 5 years, is to be transferred to Australia within 60 days. The plea bargain also forbids Hicks from speaking to the media for one year after his sentence, suing the U.S. government for alleged abuse during his imprisonment, or appealing his sentence. The deal also mentions that he should not profit from selling his story. These terms were criticised by Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, as a "modern cutting out of his tongue", with prosecutors using the leverage of a plea deal to stifle information and public debate about the controversial detention process.

David's father, Terry Hicks, responded that he was glad that his son was returning home, but also told Australian Broadcasting Corp.: 

Prosecutor Marine Lt. Col. Kevin Chenail asked for the maximum sentence, referring to Hicks by his pseudonym 'Muhammad Dawood'. He told the panel of military officers that, "Today in this courtroom, we are on the front lines of the global war on terror... The enemy is sitting at the defense table. We are face to face with the enemy... [who was] trying to kill Americans."

Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; told reporters in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; that:
&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; Senator Bob Brown suggested yesterday that the speech restrictions in the plea deal were put in place as a deliberate attempt to meddle in upcoming elections. "Of course it's a fix," said Brown. "The message has gone very clearly from Canberra to Washington to Guantanamo Bay: don't allow Hicks to be released until after the elections and certainly don't allow him to speak."

Howard disputed that interpretation of events. "We didn't impose the sentence, the sentence was imposed by the military commission and the plea bargain was worked out between the military prosecution and Mr Hicks's lawyers, and the suggestion...that it's got something to do with the Australian election is absurd."

<h3>Nepal: Former rebels join government; elections set for June</h3>

Five former &lt;a href="w%3AMaoist"&gt;Maoist&lt;/a&gt; rebels were sworn in as ministers as part of a peace pact designed to end a decade-long insurgency that has killed more than 13,000 people in &lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;. The new government has announced assembly elections for late June, 2007. Thereafter, the new assembly is due to write a new &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3AHimalayas"&gt;Himalayan&lt;/a&gt; nation.

<h3>Russia bans foreigners from retail sales jobs</h3>

Under a new law that went into effect today, non-&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;ns will not be allowed to work as salespeople in shops and markets. The ban was presented by &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; as a way of improving employment prospects for Russian citizens. Russian media warns that it will increase the labor costs for retailers and drive up inflation. The Federal Migration Service, a government agency, reported nearly full compliance in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Iranian students protest outside British embassy in Tehran</h3>
Between 100 and 200 students gathered outside the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20diplomatic%20missions"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; to protest the alleged incursion into &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian waters by the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;.
The protesters threw rocks, chanted "Death to Britain" and called for the expulsion of the ambassador. Police prevented the protesters from entering the compound.

<h1>Strong earthquake near Solomon Islands, tsunami reported</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Strong%20earthquake%20near%20Solomon%20Islands%2C%20tsunami%20reported&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A magnitude 8.1 undersea earthquake triggered a tsunami that has killed at least fifteen people, including six children, in the &lt;a href="w%3ASolomon%20Islands"&gt;Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Tsunami warnings have been issued for parts of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; as well. 

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;US Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AReichter%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 8.0 quake struck Sunday, April 1, 2007 at 20:39:56 (UTC) about 45 km (25 mi) south-southeast of Gizo, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Georgia%20Islands"&gt;New Georgia Islands&lt;/a&gt;, Solomon Islands, at a depth of 10 km.

<h2>'Disaster' declared in the Solomons</h2>
The tsunami was reported as several yards, possibly ten feet, high on the western side of the &lt;a href="w%3ASolomon%20Islands"&gt;Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt; and has destroyed at least two villages, leaving at least four people missing and fifteen dead. At least six of those who died were children. The town of Munda reports heavy damage from the tsunami.

"Two villages were reported to have been completely inundated. We have received reports of four people missing," said Solomon Islands National Disaster Management official, Julian McLeod who also said that communication is difficult because most communication lines are under water.

The government of the Solomon Islands reported in a press release, April 2, two confirmed deaths and several others missing in Sasamunga village in South Choiseul. The press release described 10 meters high waves that pushed 500 meters inland. The hospital in Sasamunga village was destroyed by the waves. In addition, nearby villages reported damage to health centres and schools. The premier of Choiseul, Jackson Kiloe, declared his province "in disaster" and called on the Solomon government disaster authorities to contact the province.

<h2>Region on alert</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3ATsunami"&gt;Tsunami&lt;/a&gt; warnings had been issued for &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; Australia's &lt;a href="w%3ABarrier%20Reef%20Islands"&gt;Barrier Reef Islands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWillis%20Island"&gt;Willis Island&lt;/a&gt; in the Coral Sea, as well as South Pacific states. The earthquake was centred 2145 km &lt;a href="w%3ABoxing%20the%20compass"&gt;North-northeast&lt;/a&gt; of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

Australia's National Meteorological and Oceanographic Centre in Melbourne warned that a possible tsunami could affect Willis Island at 8.30 a.m. (AEST) and Cooktown about 9.30 a.m. (AEST). The Centre later extended the tsunami warning to Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island and the whole eastern coast down to Tasmania. People were warned to exit the water and move away from low lying coastal areas. Afterward, at 11:30 am, all fears of the tsunami were put to rest as the Willis Islands reported no tsunami. All warnings for Eastern Australian coasts have been cleared, with no imminent threat perceived.

Japan's Meteorological Agency is determining whether the Japanese archipelago is at risk of a tsunami, reported the Kyodo news agency. 

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ANoaa"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;NWS&lt;/a&gt; West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Centre, a tsunami has been observed at the following sites:

<dl>
BULLET::::- Honiara, Solomon Island : (9.4S, 159.9E) 0.215m (0.7ft) at 22:52 UTC
BULLET::::- Port Vila Vanuatu : (17.8S, 168.3E) 0.12m (0.4ft) at 23:27 UTC

</dl>
The tsunami amplitudes are measured relative to normal sea level, not crest-to-trough heights. Forecast models indicate the tsunami energy will be mainly contained to the south of the Solomon Islands. A bulletin from the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre&lt;/a&gt; (PTWC), dated April 2, 2007 01:17 UTC, provided further information. "Sea level readings indicate a tsunami was generated. It may have been destructive along coasts near the earthquake epicentre and could also be a threat to more distant coasts. Authorities should take appropriate action in response to this possibility."

In addition, the PTWC suggested that "when no major waves are observed for two hours after the estimated time of arrival or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours then local authorities can assume the threat is passed. Danger to boats and coastal structures can continue for several hours due to rapid currents. As local conditions can cause a wide variation in tsunami wave action the all clear determination must be made by local authorities."

The Red Wings beat the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20Blue%20Jackets"&gt;Columbus Blue Jackets&lt;/a&gt; 4-1 today with&lt;a href="w%3A%20Tomas%20Holmstroms"&gt;Tomas Holmstroms&lt;/a&gt; scoring twice to move into first place in the NHL.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Lebda"&gt;Brett Lebda&lt;/a&gt; had a goal and an assist while &lt;a href="w%3APavel%20Datsyuk"&gt;Pavel Datsyuk&lt;/a&gt; also scored on the slapshot for Detroit. There were a game-breaking 3 goals in the second period.

The Red Wings have a 3-0-3 record for the last three games, for a total of 108 points, surpassing The &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Sabres"&gt;Buffalo Sabres&lt;/a&gt; in the race to be the team with the most regular season points to win the President's Trophy.

The Red Wings have won five straight Central Division titles, and increased their division lead to three points over Nashville for this season. There are three games remaining for both teams.

&lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Nash"&gt;Rick Nash&lt;/a&gt; with a wraparound for the Blue Jackets with just 59 seconds left, Nash's 25th goal this season. This ended goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ADominik%20Hasek"&gt;Dominik Hasek's&lt;/a&gt; bid for his 76th career shutout. The Blue Jackets had 32 shots.

Columbus has lost three games straight. This is just after a 4-game winning streak.

As many as five children were killed Sunday during a suicide bomb attack on a military convoy in Mehtar Lam, &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

The children were close to the convoy when it was hit. Police said two soldiers and two civilians were also killed, and several civilians injured. Local witnesses report that over a dozen were injured in the bombing.

The convoy was moving through Mehtar Lam, the capital of eastern &lt;a href="w%3ALaghman%20Province"&gt;Laghman province&lt;/a&gt;, when a car packed with explosives detonated near the Afghan army vehicles. Mehtar Lam is approximately 100 km east of &lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;.

The Afghan soldiers were traveling back to their base after assisting citizens affected by recent flooding, according to an Associated Press contact in the defence ministry.

Actor &lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Cage"&gt;Nicolas Cage&lt;/a&gt; was seen around various Washington, D.C.-area monuments this week by Wikinews contributor Patrick Mannion, filming the sequel to 2004's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Treasure"&gt;National Treasure&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. He was seen on March 28 outside on the steps of the &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%20Memorial"&gt;Lincoln Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, sitting in his chair talking with a director. Cage has also been seen in the company of costars from the earlier film. The Memorial was closed to the public by police and park rangers while filming took place.

The sequel to the 2004 film, entitled ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Treasure%3A%20The%20Book%20of%20Secrets"&gt;National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, is currently filming through April 16. In addition to the Lincoln Memorial, crews were also spotted along the Capitol's small Reflecting Pool, outside the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href="w%3ALayfette%20Square"&gt;Layfette Square&lt;/a&gt;.

The District of Columbia hopes to see a large economic return on the film by granting the long-term filming rights and a financial incentive to keep filming in Washington on-location, instead of doing principal photography and then moving to another city where production costs are cheaper.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; of New Zealand visited &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s corporate headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%2C%20Washington"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt; last week. She was welcomed by CEO &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Ballmer"&gt;Steve Ballmer&lt;/a&gt;, senior vice-president and CFO Chris Liddell, a New Zealander, and Microsoft New Zealand managing director Helen Robinson.

During the visit, they looked at ways technology could help the continuing growth of New Zealand's economic development. Ms Clark also examined Microsoft's newest productivity software, mainly including offerings in the areas of video conferencing and online collaboration tools. "There is no comparison" between Microsoft's technology and that of the &lt;a href="w%3ABeehive%20%28building%29"&gt;Beehive&lt;/a&gt;, Clark said after the meeting.

This disparity she blamed "unquestionably" on the state of New Zealand &lt;a href="w%3Abroadband%20Internet%20access"&gt;broadband Internet access&lt;/a&gt;, which still uses the outdated copper 'local loop' system. She also referred to the importance of fibre optic networks, which "some are now calling the 'fourth utility'."

Mr Liddell responded that despite New Zealand being behind in some areas, "...the rate of change is such that that is not really such a big issue. ...I don't see New Zealand at a disadvantage and one of the great things about New Zealand is we are early adopters of technology. Attitude is as important as current status."

"We have got what is radical telecommunications legislation reform, but you can't stand still and think that will do the trick either. We have got a lot of technological challenges but I think the will to address them," Ms Clark said.

Unlike other guests, Ms Clark was not given a copy of the new &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Vista"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt; during her visit. Instead, she was given a glass plate and a paperweight.

The visit to Microsoft follows her meeting with &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President Bush.

Yesterday, Iranian students demonstrated in front of the British embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; over the incident.

Demonstrators threw stones, firecrackers and a smoke grenade but were prevented from entering the embassy compound by police. No damage was reported and no one at the embassy was injured. The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;'s correspondent on the location reported that the protestors were hardline Islamist students from &lt;a href="w%3ATehran%20University"&gt;Tehran University&lt;/a&gt;, who chanted "Death to Britain" and called for an apology from the UK for the incident and putting the seized soldiers on trial. Protestors also carried banners saying "finally wipe Israel from the face of the Earth".

The new video shows one of the servicemen, Royal Marine Capt. Chris Air, pointed to an area on a map where Iran says they were when the British troops were arrested.

"We were seized apparently at this point here on their maps and on the GPS they've shown us, which is inside Iranian territorial waters. And so far we have been treated very well by all the people here. They have looked after us and made sure there's been enough food and we've been treated very well by them, so we thank them for that," said Air.

Lt. Felix Carman is the second serviceman to appear in the video. Carman was also showing viewers where they were detained by Iranian forces.

"[It is] completely unacceptable for these pictures to be shown on TV," said a British Foreign Ministry spokesman, echoing previous statements from the Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt;.

On March 23, the fifteen sailors and marines from the frigate &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Cornwall%20%28F99%29"&gt;HMS ♡❤Cornwall♡❤&lt;/a&gt; were inspecting a ship, in what the UK identified as Iraqi waters, when they were surrounded by Iranian gunboats and taken into custody. Iran claims the UK forces were in Iranian waters, though they have released the 15.

<h1>Seinfeld on HBO award: &quot;Awards are stupid&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Seinfeld%20on%20HBO%20award%3A%20%26quot%3BAwards%20are%20stupid%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Stand-up comedian and sitcom star &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Seinfeld"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt; was "honored" Sunday in an &lt;a href="w%3AHBO"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; TV special entitled "Jerry Seinfeld: The Comedian Award," hosted by CNN's &lt;a href="w%3AAnderson%20Cooper"&gt;Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt; and featuring fellow comedians &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Klein"&gt;Robert Klein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Rock"&gt;Chris Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AGarry%20Shandling"&gt;Garry Shandling&lt;/a&gt; as panel members.

A several minute recording of Mr. Seinfeld's stand-up started off the event, but the focus was on the panel discussion. Topics included Jerry's decision to re-enter the world of stand-up comedy post-♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASeinfeld"&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, his and Shandling's first gigs on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Tonight%20Show"&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and the panelists' typical methods for creating and presenting material. Klein also shared colorful anecdotes regarding his late mentor, &lt;a href="w%3ARodney%20Dangerfield"&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;.

Though the Las Vegas ceremony was taped in 2005, for reasons not known its inaugural airing was not until now, several years later. Although &lt;a href="w%3AHBO"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; execs claim it was not originally intended for broadcast, the panelists referred to the event on-camera as a "TV show".

Perhaps some of Seinfeld's derisive on-camera commentary is to blame for the delay. "Your whole career as a comedian is about making fun of pretentious, high-minded, self-congratulatory, B.S. events like this one," he explained in his cutting acceptance speech as Cooper laughed uncomfortably with the crowd. "I really don't want to be up here."

This, after long-time colleague Robert Klein praised Mr. Seinfeld's lack of reliance on "mean-spirited" or "vulgar" humor. Klein sought to draw contrast between Jerry and ♡❤Seinfeld&lt;i&gt; co-creator &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20David"&gt;Larry David&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACurb%20Your%20Enthusiasm"&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ generates laughs from the sociopathic behavior of David's character.

Explaining that he and the other panelists were only in attendance because they owed HBO for getting them their starts, Seinfeld seemed to prove Klein wrong. "Awards are stupid," he said repeatedly. "It's a jerkoff."

The show's debut was April 1 at 9 p.m. ET/PT, and it is also available on HBO's On Demand service.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Twins"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; are ready to take the field for their season opener Monday, April 2, but they will be doing it without their legendary radio announcer &lt;a href="w%3AHerb%20Carneal"&gt;Herb Carneal&lt;/a&gt;. Carneal died at age 83 in his &lt;a href="w%3AMinnetonka%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Minnetonka&lt;/a&gt; home Sunday of &lt;a href="w%3Aheart%20failure"&gt;congestive heart failure&lt;/a&gt;. He had declared a week prior to his death that he would not announce the season home opener due to health concerns, but was hopeful to make a return later in the season.

Carneal's death marks the third consecutive year in which the Twins have started the season with a loss of someone close to the organization; veteran public address announcer &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Casey%20%28baseball%20announcer%29"&gt;Bob Casey&lt;/a&gt; died March 28, 2005, and former Twin and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum"&gt;Hall of Famer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKirby%20Puckett"&gt;Kirby Puckett&lt;/a&gt; died March 6, 2006.

"Herb Carneal's voice was the signature element of Twins baseball for multiple generations of fans. Clearly he was one of the most beloved figures in Minnesota sports history. The Minnesota Twins will proudly dedicate the 2007 season to the memory of Herb Carneal," Twins President Dave St. Peter said. Last year, Twins uniforms bore the number 34, in dedication to Puckett; to mourn Carneal's passing, the Twins will wear black arm-bands, until a more permanent uniform patch can be designed.

In 1998, Carneal cut back his schedule to only include home games, thus avoiding travel, and he was only scheduled to announce 36 home games this season. A 1996 winner of the &lt;a href="w%3AFord%20C.%20Frick%20Award"&gt;Ford C. Frick Award&lt;/a&gt;, Herb Carneal announced baseball for 51 seasons, and was the "voice of the Twins" since 1962.

A 33-year-old woman is arrested and charged with child sexually abusive behavior as she offered an undercover investigator to take pornographic pictures of her young daughter. She also offered the investigator to have sex with the 7-year-girl, authorities say.

The woman is was charged with five crimes, including child sexually abusive behavior, use of the internet for child sexually abusive actions, and distribution of child sexually abusive material, according to Wayne County Sheriff's Department spokesman John Roach. The woman was also charged with prostitution since she propositioned the investigator herself, and it is known that she advertised herself online as a prostitute. If found guilty, the woman would face up 20 years in prison. The child and four siblings, aged 12, 11, 9, and 6, have been placed into protective custody.

The woman was arrested on March 30 when she took her daughter to a hotel near &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Metropolitan%20Airport"&gt;Detroit Metropolitan Airport&lt;/a&gt; where she was to meet the investigator who agreed to take pornographic photos of the girl for a fee. After the woman met the investigator, she offered him to have sex with her daughter for additional money. Also she offered the undercover investigator herself for a fee, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Sheriff Warren Evans says that this is "truly a horrifying case" and thinks that offering ones' own child for sex is "impossible to comprehend". The name of the woman was not made public in order to avoid identifying the girl and her four siblings.

<h3>Yushchenko calls early elections in Ukraine</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Ukraine"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Yushchenko"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt; dissolved &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AVerkhovna%20Rada"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt; and called early elections Monday. "My actions are dictated by the strict necessity to save the state's sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said in a televised address. However, members of the parliament said it would continue to function as-is, and would refuse to fund the election. Ukraine has been in a political turmoil as the president and his rival &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Ukraine"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Yanukovych"&gt;Viktor Yanukovych&lt;/a&gt; position for power.

According to BBC News reports, the official election is set for May 27.

The Pittsburgh Penguins need points, but not as bad as the Toronto Maple Leafs. It was evident, Saturday, as the Maple Leafs held on to defeat the Penguins 5-4 in overtime. Toronto threw away a four goal advantage, as the Penguins managed to pick up a precious point in the quest for home-ice advantage in the playoffs. Every game is crucial for Toronto, as they currently sit in ninth spot in the east, one point back of Montreal for the final playoff spot.

It didn't take long for Toronto to take over the game, scoring 4:28 into the first period. Chad Kilger beat starting goaltender Jocelyn Thibault for his 14th goal of the season. Kyle Wellwood and Darcy Tucker assisted Kilger on the goal. Gary Roberts, the product of one of Pittsburgh's deadline trades anwsered just over two minutes later to tie the match. Sergei Gonchar, one of the NHL's highest scoring defenders picked up an assist along with Rookie of the Year contender Evgeni Malkin. Toronto would strike back at 18:30, when Alexei Ponikarovsky scored his 20th goal of the season, assisted by Nik Antropov and Mats Sundin. The Maple Leafs kept piling on goals, with Tomas Kaberle and Bryan McCabe each scoring to make it 4-1. The goals caused Pens coach Michael Therrien to pull goaltender Jocelyn Thibault in favor of Mark Andre Fleury. Pittsburgh's Max Talbot scored at 16:31 to end the second period at 4-2. Pittsburgh climbed back into the game with less than five minutes remaining, when Sidney Crosby, assisted by Ryan Whitney and Evgeni Malkin, scored his team-high 36th goal of the season. Trailing by one goal, Ryan Whitney stepped up for the Penguins, firing a pass from Sergei Gonchar beyond Leafs goalie Andrew Raycroft with four seconds remaining in regulation. The stunned fans inside the AirCanada Center got their money's worth, however, as Toronto's Tomas Kaberle, the eventual 1st star of the game would score in overtime to give the Maple Leafs the win and the critical extra point.

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Safety"&gt;Public Safety&lt;/a&gt; Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStockwell%20Day"&gt;Stockwell Day&lt;/a&gt; says a new and permanent commissioner for the &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; (RCMP) will be hired in June.

Day said he is still not sure if the new chief will come from within the force who has worked up the ranks, or will be appointed from outside the force.

"We've said we want the best person," said Day. "That could be somebody who's worked their way up through the ranks, that inspires confidence from within. But we've also said that it can't be limited to that."

Bev Busson, the Deputy Commissioner, who has been doing the big job as the &lt;a href="w%3AInterim"&gt;interim&lt;/a&gt; since Giuliano Zaccardelli resigned over the &lt;a href="w%3AMaher%20Arar"&gt;Maher Arar&lt;/a&gt; incident, stating last December that she didn't want the post to be permanent for her.

Recently a parliamentary committee alleged mismanagement and possible fraud in the RCMP's pension plan.

Busson says that anyone with possible evidence will show up. Day also has called an investigation into the suspected "mismanagement and possible fraud" that the parliamentary committee found.

The investigation will be carried out in private but a report that has yet to be made public will be released. Day is resisting calls for a full-scale inquiry. A person to head the investigation has not been named.

Superior Court Justice Peter Howden has decided to let former &lt;a href="w%3AVaughan%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Vaughan, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Di%20Biase"&gt;Michael Di Biase&lt;/a&gt; bring his case again to court after claims of uncounted votes in last November's mayoral election that he lost to current Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ALinda%20Jackson"&gt;Linda Jackson&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2002, Mr. Di Biase served as interim mayor of the city after former mayor &lt;a href="w%3ALorna%20Jackson"&gt;Lorna Jackson&lt;/a&gt; died. He was then elected to mayor in the 2003 municipal election. 

Mr. Di Biase ran against deceased mayor Lorna Jackson's daughter Linda Jackson last November but lost by 94 votes. After the results accounced that he lost, he requested a full recount and then brought it to the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Superior%20Court"&gt;Ontario Superior Court&lt;/a&gt; to declare the votes illegal and void. The judge said some votes we not counted nor were some voters even on the voters list at the time.

The City of Vaughan put forward a motion to leave the case but Justice Peter Howden ruled against it yesterday. "There are serious issues here that may well affect the outcome of the election."

This new decision could let another hand recount of the votes or a complete by-election be called if Di Biase wins his case.

"I am pleased with the response from Judge Howden, he validated my application, which is very important," Di Biase said yesterday. "Democracy is very important and the integrity of every vote counts. I want to make sure that every citizen has the right to vote and that their vote will count."

The court hearing will start on Tuesday.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Twins"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; lit a fire in front of a sold-out &lt;a href="w%3AHubert%20H.%20Humphrey%20Metrodome"&gt;Metrodome&lt;/a&gt; crowd during Monday's season opener against the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%20Orioles"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;. The fans came to cheer on the 2006 American League Central Division champions and remember veteran radio broadcaster &lt;a href="w%3AHerb%20Carneal"&gt;Herb Carneal&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href="Twins%20announcer%20Herb%20Carneal%20dies%20at%2083"&gt;passed away a day ago&lt;/a&gt;.

Orioles starter &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Bedard"&gt;Erik Bedard&lt;/a&gt; pitched five innings, giving up ten hits and six runs, including back-to-back home runs in the second inning to reigning American League MVP &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Morneau"&gt;Justin Morneau&lt;/a&gt; and outfielder &lt;a href="w%3ATorii%20Hunter"&gt;Torii Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.

Twins closer &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Nathan"&gt;Joe Nathan&lt;/a&gt; picked up his first save of 2007.

The Twins players sported black armbands to honor Carneal, and a tribute was shown prior to the game to honor the legendary broadcaster. Between innings, people spoke about their memories of Carneal. This is the first time since 1978 that the Baltimore Orioles have started their season away from home.

<h3>US: Former FBI agent missing in Iran</h3>

On Monday, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; said it sent an official inquiry to Iran via Swiss diplomats about a former &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; agent who went missing while in &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; on private business. He is believed to have gone missing several weeks ago on the island of Kish. The FBI say he has not worked for them in a decade nor is he a contractor for them. A US &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson declined to give name, age or occupation of the missing man. The spokesperson also said that they have no indication that he is being held by any Iranian entity.

<h3>British hacker to be extradited to US</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AGary%20McKinnon"&gt;Gary McKinnon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; lost his appeal challenging an extradition order to face charges in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; that he hacked into military and &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; computers there. "We do not find any grounds of appeal against the decision," said one of the judges, Lord Justice Maurice Kay.
In what has been called the "biggest military hack of all time," McKinnon allegedly used the code-name ♡❤Solo♡❤ as he hacked into 97 computers and caused $700,000 worth of damage according to US prosecutors. In 2006, he told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that he was searching for evidence the Americans might have about &lt;a href="w%3AUnidentified%20flying%20object"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt;s.

<h3>US Supreme Court rules against EPA on carbon dioxide regulation</h3>

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that carbon dioxide should be regulated by the &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; (EPA). The majority opinion said that the EPA had offered "no reasoned explanation" for refusing to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from cars. Previously the EPA had argued that the 1970 &lt;a href="w%3AClean%20Air%20Act"&gt;Clean Air Act&lt;/a&gt; did not give it the powers to regulate green house gases because they were not deemed to be pollutants. Twelve states and several environmental groups jointly brought the case against the EPA, contending that it was failing in its legal duty to regulate environmental pollution by not regulating green house gas emissions.

&lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Kaine"&gt;Tim Kaine&lt;/a&gt; signed a bill into law on Friday last week that prohibits the use of &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20phone"&gt;mobile phones&lt;/a&gt; by newly licensed drivers under the age of 18 while operating a motor vehicle. Mobile phone users must pull off to the side of the road, or into a parking lot, to use a phone. The law takes effect July 1.

The newly signed bill by Virginia's governor makes it the 14th state in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; to enact a partial ban on mobile phone use. The age group affected, 16 and 17-year-olds, need consent from their parents or guardians to obtain a driver's license in the state.

"I believe this is a common-sense restriction on those new drivers who may be tempted to pay more attention to phone calls and text messages than the road, endangering themselves and other drivers," said Governor Kaine.

State legislative proposals to restrict mobile phone use while driving have failed in 17 U.S. states where similar bills were introduced. There are currently four U.S. states, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AConnecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, that have passed laws limiting mobile phone use as an on-road hazard while driving. For example, both New York and New Jersey classify use of a handheld mobile phone without an earpiece as a moving violation.

California governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; signed into law mobile phone use limitations that will take effect on July 2008. It imposes of fine of $20 for, "... anyone caught driving and using a cell phone unless the driver uses a headset, ear bud or other technology that frees both hands." according to Matt Hamblen of ComputerWorld.com. 

45 countries currently ban use of the hand held devices while driving. &lt;a href="Botswana"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; are debating similar measures.

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has said that the 15 &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; troops detained on March 23 do not have to go through any trial, according to &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Larijani"&gt;Ali Larijani&lt;/a&gt;, the highest ranking diplomat for Iran who also said that a delegation should review the case against the sailors and marines.

"We are not interested in this issue getting more complicated. Our interest is in solving this problem as soon as possible. This issue can be resolved, and there is no need for any trial. There should be a delegation to review the case ... to clarify whether they have been in our territorial waters or not," said Larijani who hopes that the situation between Britain and Iran can be solved bilaterally.

"There remain some differences between us, but we can confirm we share his preference for early bilateral discussions to find a diplomatic solution to this problem. We will be following this up with the Iranian authorities tomorrow, given our shared desire to make early progress," said a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office.

On March 23, the fifteen sailors and marines from the frigate &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Cornwall%20%28F99%29"&gt;HMS ♡❤Cornwall♡❤&lt;/a&gt; were inspecting a ship, in what the UK identified as Iraqi waters, when they were surrounded by Iranian gunboats and taken into custody. Iran claims the UK forces were in Iranian waters, and are still detaining the fifteen.

A wax figure of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABollywood"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; star &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShah%20Rukh%20Khan"&gt;Shah Rukh Khan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been unveiled at London’s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMadame%20Tussauds"&gt;Madame Tussauds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 
The likeness of Khan, widely known as 'King Khan', has today become the third official figure of a Bollywood celebrity to grace the attraction.

Khan, star of over 50 films, specially flew to &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to unveil his wax figure at the prestigious venue, with a special documentary on the actor's movie career showcased on the day. The lifesize model was uncloaked to applause and cheers from the crowd.

Artists from Madame Tussauds had spent time in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year in order to obtain precise measurements of the film star's physical features, face and hair.

Speaking of the privilege, Khan said, "It has been a lifelong dream since I visited the attraction as a child to be immortalised in wax and meet my very own Madame Tussauds double. 

"This is truly a great honour; I was delighted to be involved in the whole creative process."
The actor met with special guests before spending time with British fans. He also met winners of competitions organised by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Asian%20Network"&gt;BBC Asian Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIkonz"&gt;Ikonz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Britain is believed to be home to one of Bollywood's largest fan bases within Europe.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReena%20Combo"&gt;Reena Combo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , editor of British Asian magazine Ikonz was at the event. She explained, "For most British Asians, Shah Rukh Khan is the equivalent to Hollywood's Brad Pitt. He is one of the biggest stars in the world and the new wax figure in Madame Tussauds will help in further introducing him to those who may still be unaware of his popularity."

Khan, 41, has in the past been described by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATIME%20magazine"&gt;TIME magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as "the most recognisable actor in the world with an audience of 3.6 billion", while ♡❤&lt;a href="The%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ once referred to him as 'the world's biggest film star'.

"The unveiling here in London has been long overdue but fans of Bollywood, especially those in the UK, will be extremely grateful to Madame Tussauds' for the opportunity to meet the real Shah Rukh Khan and his artificial 'twin'," added Ms Combo.

Other Bollywood luminaries represented at the attraction include &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmitabh%20Bachchan"&gt;Amitabh Bachchan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAishwarya%20Rai"&gt;Aishwarya Rai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Khan's wax figure is among the only 15 new figures created this year. 
Madame Tussauds said they did not currently have any plans to create a figure of &lt;a href="Shilpa%20Shetty"&gt;Shilpa Shetty&lt;/a&gt;, the Bollywood actress who recently won &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACelebrity%20Big%20Brother"&gt;Celebrity Big Brother&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but they hadn't ruled anything out.

Spokesperson for the attraction, Ben Lovett, stated, "We only launch 8 figures per year, and each takes a number of months to make, so it’s vital that we regularly ask guests who they want to see in the attraction. Madame Tussauds London has commitments until early 2008, which means Shah Rukh Khan will be the only Bollywood figure for this year.

"In terms of Shilpa Shetty, we have been asked but at present we have no plans to make her."

A &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤Train à Grande Vitesse♡❤ (High-Speed Train or &lt;a href="w%3ATGV"&gt;TGV&lt;/a&gt;) has smashed the world record for a train on conventional rails by a big margin, reaching 574.8km/h (356mph) The TGV travelled over 59.8 km/h (36 mph) faster than its previous record of 515 km/h (320 mph)

The record attempt by a modified TGV took place on a track between &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and the eastern city of &lt;a href="w%3AStrasbourg"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is not the fastest train speed. A &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href="w%3AMaglev%20train"&gt;Maglev&lt;/a&gt; (Magnetive Levitation Train) reached a top speed of 581km/h (361mph) in 2003. The TGV made history at 13:14 CEST (11:14 UTC). The TGV had been modfied and was called V150 - a TGV with larger wheels than usual and two engines driving three double-decker cars. The vehicle's horsepower was 25,000.

Reporters said the three train drivers were seen grinning on French TV after they realised they had broken the record. The TGV travelled almost as fast as a World War II &lt;a href="w%3ASupermarine%20Spitfire"&gt;Spitfire&lt;/a&gt; fighter at top speed. Even the electrical tension in the overhead cable was increased 6000 volts from 25,000 volts to 31,000 for the record attempt.

"We saw the countryside go by a little faster than we did during the tests," engineer Eric Pieczac said.

"Everything went very well. There are about 10,000 engineers who would want to be in my place," Mr Pieczac said. "It makes me very happy, a mixed feeling of pride and honour to be able to reach this speed." Since their introduction in 1981, TGVs generally travel at about 300km/h (187.5 mph) however, on the recently opened Paris-Strasbourg LGV (♡❤Ligne à Grande Vitesse♡❤ or High-Speed line) trains will travel at 320 km/h (200 mph) 

&lt;a href="w%3ASNCF"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlstom"&gt;Alstom&lt;/a&gt; - the TGV's manufacturer - have said that the record test was performed to see how a TGV would react in extreme conditions - conditions that cannot be performed in a laboratory. 

After the record was broken, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;French President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; conveyed his congratulations on "this new proof of the excellence of the French rail industry." The President also said that "Economically efficient and respectful of the environment, the TGV is a major asset in efforts to ensure sustainable development in transport

"What is important for us today is to prove that the TGV technology which was invented in France 30 years ago is a technology for the future," said Guillaume Pepy 

Alstom plans to increase TGV sales abroad, where it is competing with high-speed trains such as the Japanese &lt;a href="w%3AShinkansen"&gt;Shinkansen&lt;/a&gt; and the German &lt;a href="w%3AInterCityExpress"&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, nations of the Far East such as &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, Japan and &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; are the "top" customers for high-speed trains. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ said that a high-speed rail link in between &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; was being looked into.

The discovery of an old &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; bomb in a construction site has caused at least 1000 residents in &lt;a href="w%3APlymouth"&gt;Plymouth&lt;/a&gt; located in South-West &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, to be evacuated.

"Evacuations are being carried out of properties within 100m [328ft] of the scene. Properties within the 100m-300m [328-984ft] zone are being advised to open windows and draw curtains," said a spokesman for the police department in Plymouth.

Workers on the site discovered the bomb at about 10:30 a.m. local time in Plymouth, England on Brentor Road.

Reports say that the bomb is sticking out of the ground by about 6 inches, and weighed an estimated 113 kilograms, or 250 pounds, but could have weighed as much as 500 pounds.

"The item was protruding about six inches from the ground and was described as being up to 10-inches in diameter," said a spokesman for the Devon and Cornwall Police.

The Army bomb disposal team from &lt;a href="w%3AWales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; is currently trying to figure out what to do with the bomb and it could take several hours before authorities can dispose of it. Reports say that the bomb will be taken to the ocean to be detonated.

"The precise nature of this operation and any potential route are yet to be confirmed," added the spokesman.

"He'll be remembered as the guy who just wouldn't go away," said Ontario Ombudsman &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Marin"&gt;André Marin&lt;/a&gt; speaking of the loss. "I was the speakerphone and he was the speaker – I merely amplified what he had to say. He deserves the credit for the entire thing."

Edmonds of &lt;a href="w%3ACoboconk%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Coboconk, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; first came to fight the OLG in 2001 when he was "robbed" of his lottery winning of CAN$250,000 by a store clerk. He asked the store clerk's wife Phyllis LaPlante to check the tickets and she said he did not win but won a free ticket (when someone wins a lottery prize in Canada a small sound goes off in the store). Days after, the couple who owned the store were in the local newspaper saying they had won the jackpot of $250,000. When he contacted the OLG they denied the allegations, and when the couple were arrested for fraud they refused to return his winnings. He sued the LaPlantes for the winnings and settled for $150,000.

In 2002, Edmonds sued the corporation and signed a confidentiality agreement on behalf of the OLG after a judge asked them to rightfully give him the money he won. They gave him $200,000 three years later. Last Friday they gave him $50,000 dollars more, for a total of $250,000.

In October 2006, &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;CBC's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Fifth%20Estate"&gt;The Fifth Estate&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ showed that more retailers from 1999 to 2006 were winning instead of the customers. After the broadcast OLG's former CEO called him and personally apologised and the company started to create more security measures for customers.

Following the allegations, 1,000,000 scratch tickets were recalled and on March 23, 2007 CEO Duncan Brown announced he resigned his position. Days later Ontario Ombudsman André Marin sparked up an investingation into the OLG however it is still ongoing.

Edmonds leaves his wife, daughter, and two sons.

In the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; today, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%20Saints"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt; traded a sixth-round draft pick to the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Dolphins"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; for kicker &lt;a href="w%3AOlindo%20Mare"&gt;Olindo Mare&lt;/a&gt;. Mare will compete with &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Carney"&gt;John Carney&lt;/a&gt;, the Saints 44 year old kicker who has had a hard time hitting field goals over 35 yards. The Saints visited with former &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Cowboys"&gt;Dallas Cowboy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Colts"&gt;Indianapolis Colts&lt;/a&gt; kicker Mike Vanderjagt, but never offered anything. The Saints also used kicker Billy Cundiff last year.

Over the past ten seasons with the Dolphins, Mare amassed 1,048 points, while converting 245 of 303 field goals and 313 of 318 extra points.

Dolphins General Manager Randy Mueller indicated that Miami pursued the trade in hopes of improving future prospects. "Adding another draft pick is another chip that hopefully we can turn into a player for the Dolphins down the road," said Mueller. "We need to build this team a nucleus of young talent that has kind of been void for the last few years," he continued.

It had been speculated that Mare might be traded from the Dolphins, since they inked an off-season deal with &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Giants"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; kicker Jay Feely.

After two games into the season, the &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Twins"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; are the sole leader of the American League Central division, something they couldn't accomplish last year until an hour after their final game ended. The Twins, now 2-0, defeated the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%20Orioles"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday night at the &lt;a href="w%3AHubert%20H.%20Humphrey%20Metrodome"&gt;Metrodome&lt;/a&gt;. The Twins played offensively, stealing five bases in the night, and tomorrow will attempt at a sweep of the three-game series.

Twins starter &lt;a href="w%3ABoof%20Bonser"&gt;Boof Bonser&lt;/a&gt; pitched six innings, giving up three hits and two runs with six strikeouts. &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Neshek"&gt;Pat Neshek&lt;/a&gt; pitched one inning with one strikeout. &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Rincon"&gt;Juan Rincon&lt;/a&gt; pitched a third of an inning, giving up one hit with one strikeout. &lt;a href="w%3ADennys%20Reyes"&gt;Dennys Reyes&lt;/a&gt; pitched a third of an inning, giving up one hit. &lt;a href="w%3AJesse%20Crain"&gt;Jesse Crain&lt;/a&gt; pitched a third of an inning with one strikeout. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Nathan"&gt;Joe Nathan&lt;/a&gt; picked up his second save with one strikeout.

Orioles starter &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Cabrera"&gt;Daniel Cabrera&lt;/a&gt; pitched seven innings, giving up six hits and three runs with nine strikeouts. &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Walker"&gt;Jamie Walker&lt;/a&gt; pitched two thirds of an inning, giving up one hit with one strikeout. &lt;a href="w%3AChad%20Bradford"&gt;Chad Bradford&lt;/a&gt; pitched a third of an inning.

Baltimore struck first, with &lt;a href="w%3AMelvin%20Mora"&gt;Melvin Mora&lt;/a&gt; hitting a solo home run in the top of the third. Later in the third inning, Oriole &lt;a href="w%3AAubrey%20Huff"&gt;Aubrey Huff&lt;/a&gt; hit an RBI single to score &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Markakis"&gt;Nick Markakis&lt;/a&gt; from second base.

Orioles shortstop &lt;a href="w%3AMiguel%20Tejada"&gt;Miguel Tejada&lt;/a&gt; made an amazing defensive play in the fourth inning, diving to grab a line drive and setting up a double play. The same play also led to the Twins' first run with &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Punto"&gt;Nick Punto&lt;/a&gt; scoring on the sacrifice. The Twins tied the game in the fifth when &lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Castillo%20%28baseball%20player%29"&gt;Luis Castillo&lt;/a&gt; hit to the pitcher, but the ball bounced out of Cabrera's glove, scoring &lt;a href="w%3ATorii%20Hunter"&gt;Torii Hunter&lt;/a&gt; from third base. The tie would remain until the seventh inning when &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Bartlett"&gt;Jason Bartlett&lt;/a&gt; hit a single to left, scoring &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Tyner"&gt;Jason Tyner&lt;/a&gt; from second base.

&lt;a href="Liverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; all but guaranteed a spot in the semifinals of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Champions%20League%202006-07%23Quarter-finals"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Tuesday night with a convincing 3-0 win over &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APSV%20Eindhoven"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Holland"&gt;Holland&lt;/a&gt;. A full crowd of 36,500 fans showed up at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhillips%20Stadion"&gt;Phillips Stadion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to support their teams. Liverpool went into the game on a high having beaten &lt;a href="Arsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; 4-1 at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnfield"&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Saturday. PSV on the other hand have been in a slump as of late in the Eredivise, as they have let &lt;a href="Ajax%20Amsterdam"&gt;Ajax Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; back into the title race. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Crouch"&gt;Peter Crouch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who scored a hat-trick on Saturday, was partnered with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADirk%20Kuyt"&gt;Dirk Kuyt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Liverpool, while PSV paired &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJefferson%20Farfan"&gt;Jefferson Farfan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADiego%20Tardelli"&gt;Diego Tardelli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as strikers.

PSV were the first to threaten either goal, when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMika%20Vayrynen"&gt;Mika Vayrynen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; blasted a shot over the bar from well out after a one-two with Jefferson Farfan. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Arne%20Riise"&gt;John Arne Riise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; then had Liverpool's first chance as his shot was deflected wide, and the ensuing corner by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Gerrard"&gt;Steven Gerrard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was met by the head of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Carragher"&gt;Jamie Carragher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but keeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHeurelho%20Gomes"&gt;Heurelho Gomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; produced a fine diving stop to keep the scores level. Carragher then nearly gave the hosts a goal as he deflected a corner barely over the crossbar. Reds captain Steven Gerrard then scored as he met &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Finnan"&gt;Steve Finnan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's cross strongly with his head, and Gomes could do nothing as Gerrard scored his team record 16th goal in international play. 

PSV suffered a blow at the break with striker Jefferson Farfan having to leave the match. He was replaced by Chinese international &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AXiang%20Sun"&gt;Xiang Sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A soft clearance attempt by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATimmy%20Simmons"&gt;Timmy Simmons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; then handed the ball to Riise, and the big Dane powered the ball past Gomes, giving the Reds a demanding 2-0 lead. Liverpool continued to pressure for a third goal, and Riise had another chance when Gomes mishandled a cross, but the keeper was able to recover and save his blushes. Finnan supplied the ball for the final goal of the match as well, as his cross was met by the head of Peter Crouch. The 3-0 lead guaranteed the reds the win, but they did suffer a blow on the night when midfielder &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFabio%20Aurelio"&gt;Fabio Aurelio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was forced to leave the pitch with injury. Kuyt also revieved a yellow card in the dying minutes, ruling him out of the second leg with suspension, but Liverpool have a fitting substitute in the form of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Bellamy"&gt;Craig Bellamy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

The return leg of the series occurs on April 11th at Anfield in Liverpool. PSV will now have to win by a margin of 3 goals in order to hope to advance.

Pupils who are given detention at a &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; high school are being forced to wear orange overalls with the words 'Work Crew' on the back.

The New Zealand Parent Teacher Association (NZPTA) have said that this is unacceptable humiliation and will make each student stand out. The vice-president of the NZPTA, Margaret Mooney described the overalls as radical. The principal of Shirley Boys' High School, John Laurenson, denied these allegations, stating that the only reason for the overalls is to keep uniforms clean. Since each pupil's punishment is the opposite of what they committed, then the uniforms need to remain clean. "The average fellow, he [sic] doesn't want to get mud or muck on his uniform."

"If a boy's seen dropping litter, he picks up litter. If he's treading all over the rose garden, he might do weeding," he said.

He added that the school has received no complaints about the overalls from students or parents, and that the system has been running for many years.

This follows a magnitude 8.1 undersea earthquake three days ago that triggered a tsunami that killed at least fifteen people, including six children, in the Solomon Islands. A series of aftershocks have shaken the area since then. A smaller 6.0 magnitude quake was reported at 8:39:44 PM (EDT) and on Monday, two quakes of magnitudes 6.0 and 6.2 quake struck the same area, the second 70 km (45 miles) South East of &lt;a href="w%3AGizo%2C%20New%20Georgia%20Islands"&gt;Gizo, New Georgia Islands&lt;/a&gt;, Solomon Islands.

<h1>One killed at CNN Atlanta shooting</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=One%20killed%20at%20CNN%20Atlanta%20shooting&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A domestic dispute resulted in shots being fired around the Headquarters of CNN in Atlanta, GA on Tuesday, killing a woman and critically wounding the ex-boyfriend who pulled a gun on her according to the authorities. The man and woman were arguing near the main entrance of the complex when the man shot her, police officer James Polite said. The armed man was then shot by a CNN security guard.

The woman was Clara Riddles, 22, of College Park, said Caryn Kboudi, a spokeswoman for the Texas-based Omni Hotel chain.

Upon arrival at Grady Hospital, Riddles was pronounced dead said hospital spokeswoman Denise Simpson. The shooter, a man in his late thirties, and Riddles's ex-boyfriend, Arthur Mann was in stable condition. He is being charged with murder, Police said.

Victims were seen being carried out of the building on stretchers. Mann's face was covered in blood and his shirt had been removed.

CNN also reported that the offices of its Internet operations, CNN.com, were immediately evacuated. Video footage also showed police pointing guns at a man lying on the ground at the bottom of an escalator inside the building.

An announcement over the building's PA system announced that there had been gunfire "with potential casualties." Police cordoned off an area by the escalators near the main entrance, facing Centennial Olympic Park - a park that had been the site of a bombing that killed a woman and injured more than 100 people during the 1996
Summer Olympics.

"I heard four or five shots. I really didn't see it. I got out of there quick," said Jas Stanford, 27, who had been helping take down a temporary stage in the park used for college basketball's. When Mann fired his gun, security guard Odell Adams shot him, said Lisa Tobias, director of corporate responsibility for Turner Broadcasting System, which operates CNN.

Turner officials are satisfied with the response of Adams and the Atlanta police, Tobias said. The company does not discuss its security publicly, she said, but "we are constantly evaluating our procedures to make sure that we have ensured the safety of CNN employees and visitors." Besides the Omni Hotel, the CNN complex also includes a large atrium and a food court. It is connected to Philips Arena, the home of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks.

In the food court, Trina Johnson, 44, of Atlanta, was with her daughter on a family outing. "All of a sudden we heard a big boom. We thought it was an explosion," Johnson said. "We didn't see the gun. Everybody just started running."

Soon afterward, CNN coverage of the shooting was being shown on large-screen televisions inside the atrium, near where the shooting had taken place.

On Monday, a woman was shot and killed at the University of Washington in Seattle by an ex-boyfriend on whom she had sought a restraining order, police said. The man killed himself afterward.

<h3>Iranian diplomats to see detained Iranians in Iraq</h3>

Reports say that &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; diplomats will get to meet with 5 detained Iranians in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. It is not known when the meeting is scheduled to be held. The men, alleged to be members of the Revolutionary Guards, were detained back in January by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; troops, who believed they were playing a role in insurgency.

Over half of the 100,000 donors came from online contributions totaling $6.9M.

&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Iran"&gt;Iranian President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the fifteen &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; captured navy personnel detained by &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; would be released, saying they have been pardoned as a gift to the British people. Ahmadinejad met with the detainees shortly after a press conference where he announced that the release will be immediate, and that they will be taken to the airport. 
Speaking at a press conference that marked the end of &lt;a href="w%3ASizdah%20Bedar"&gt;Sizdah Bedar&lt;/a&gt;, Ahmadinejad said the British soldiers had violated Iranian territory and praised the southwest coast guards for capturing them. He presented their commander, Captain Abol-Ghassem Amangah, with Iran's third degree medal of courage.

The President went on to accuse the British government of not being "brave enough to tell their people the truth" about the incident during the 13 days after their detention. He added that he was "asking Mr Blair to not put these 15 personnel on trial because they admitted they came to Iranian territorial water,", apparently trying to imply that the British servicemen were on a secret mission into Iranian waters, and should not have "confessed" on television to being in Iranian waters. 

The British government claims that the confessions were extracted under duress. The United Kingdom has maintained that the captured sailors and marines were in Iraqi territorial waters under a &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; mandate and has called for them to be released. 

The President said that he had issued the order for release on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Prophet Mohammed, &lt;a href="w%3AMawlid%20an-Nabi"&gt;Mawlid an-Nabi&lt;/a&gt;, and on the occasion of Easter and Passover.

Iranian media said that the British sailors 'shouted for joy' at the news.

The President said that "[After this meeting] they are free. They can go to the airport and they can go to their families".

<h1>NCAA Basketball: Florida Gators win Men's Basketball Championship</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NCAA%20Basketball%3A%20Florida%20Gators%20win%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Championship&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Gators"&gt;Florida Gators&lt;/a&gt; became the &lt;a href="w%3ANCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship"&gt;NCAA Men's Basketball&lt;/a&gt; champions for the second straight year Monday night, defeating the &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State%20Buckeyes"&gt;Ohio State Buckeyes&lt;/a&gt; 84-75 for the title. Despite &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Oden"&gt;Greg Oden's&lt;/a&gt; 25 points and 12 rebounds, Ohio State couldn't top &lt;a href="w%3AJoakim%20Noah"&gt;Joakim Noah&lt;/a&gt; and the Gators. Said Florida guard &lt;a href="w%3ACorey%20Brewer"&gt;Corey Brewer&lt;/a&gt; of the victory, ""This is what we're all about at the University of Florida, winning championships." The Gators became the first back-to-back champions since the &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20University"&gt;Duke Blue Devils&lt;/a&gt; won back-to-back in 1991 and 1992.

Winning the Men's Basketball championship gives the University of Florida wins in both of the NCAA's top sporting events, basketball and football. The Gators defeated Ohio State 41-14 in the football championship in January.

Ohio State's troubles many, going just 4 for 23 from three point range in the game, and 30 for 64 on field goals. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Conley%2C%20Jr."&gt;Mike Conley, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; added 20 points to Oden's 25, but Florida's four players scoring in double-digits were too much for the Buckeyes to overcome. The Gators went 26 of 53 from field goal range and 10 of 18 on three point attempts.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Retired%20hockey%20enforcer%20Tie%20Domi%20to%20sue%20coach%20of%20son%27s%20team&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Through a press release, by &lt;a href="w%3ATie%20Domi"&gt;Tie Domi's&lt;/a&gt; lawyer Tuesday evening, it was revealed that Domi may initiate legal action against Lee Miller, coach of the Toronto Marlboros peewee AAA hockey club.

Domi, who retired from the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Maple%20Leafs"&gt;Toronto Maple Leafs&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, was known as an enforcer and fighter during his playing days. Domi accrued the most penalty minutes of any player in the history of the Leafs and is ranked third overall for penalty minutes in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (NHL).

On Friday, March 30, Domi was involved in a verbal confrontation with coach Miller over differences of opinion on coaching styles and, allegedly, the amount of ice time Domi's son was receiving. Domi's 11-year-old son, Max, plays for the Marlboros.

According to a &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Toronto%20Hockey%20League"&gt;Greater Toronto Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (GTHL) media release yesterday, Domi had confronted Miller using, allegedly, foul and profane language. Toronto Police were called to the rink to deal with the situation, but no charges were laid.

On Monday, April 2, the GTHL received a formal complaint from Miller outlining his version of events. A review by the league is expected to finish up by April 18.

According to Symon Zucker, Domi's counsel, the suggestion that an assault, or threat of assault, by Domi had occurred during the altercation with Miller, was without merit. Although Zucker admitted that Domi and Miller did have a disagreement over Miller's coaching skills, he suggested the discussion did not escalate to threats. Zucker alleged that the police investigation, which cleared Domi of the allegations, left Miller dissatisfied and that Miller "decided to report his allegations to the media with the intent of embarrassing Mr. Domi."

Zucker indicated that Domi instructed him to put "Miller on notice of an intention to seek damages for libel and slander," according to the press release. "Mr. Miller's public campaign to discredit Mr. Domi is actionable and will be strenuously defended," said Zucker.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AGrambling%20State%20University"&gt;Grambling State&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href="w%3AEddie%20Robinson%20%28football%20coach%29"&gt;Eddie Robinson&lt;/a&gt; died Tuesday night, after a lengthy fight with &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. Robinson was diagnosed with the disease in 1997, and spent the last year in a nursing home.
Robinson passed, not long after being admitted to Lincoln General Hospital in Ruston, La., as reported by former Grambling State quarterback and Super Bowl MVP, &lt;a href="w%3ADoug%20Williams"&gt;Doug Williams&lt;/a&gt;. Williams added, "He'd been fighting that battle for a long time, It was one of the many he fought in his lifetime. We all know it's coming. But that's Eddie Robinson. Eddie Robinson is not supposed to go. But when you look back at it, there's lot of joy in it too. I don't think none of us have to worry about where he's going to be from now on. He is a gate keeper."

The following is a statement from Ms. Doris Robinson, wife of Eddie Robinson: "The many expressions of support, sympathy, and gratitude that we have received from all over the country have been overwhelming. I truly appreciate each and every person, so many of whom we have never met, who has said such kind and inspiring words about Eddie, his legacy, and our family. Our love and admiration for Eddie were unyielding, as was Eddie’s for his immediate family and his extended Grambling family. Eddie was the consummate husband, father, teacher, leader, role model, and, most of all, the greatest of Americans. Words cannot express the loneliness that I will feel without my beloved Eddie. However, I realize, and the immediate family realizes, the greatness that Eddie contributed to our society. He will forever fill our hearts, minds, and souls."

Robinson's career highlights included 57 years as head coach at &lt;a href="w%3AGrambling%20State%20University"&gt;Grambling State University&lt;/a&gt;, 408 victories, 45 winning seasons, 17 Southwestern Conference Championships, and over 200 players sent into the NFL. Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, April 11, beginning at 11:00 a.m. in the Assembly Center on the campus of Grambling State University (across from Robinson Stadium). Internment will be at Memorial Gardens in Grambling, La.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Twins"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; swept the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%20Orioles"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt; in a 7-2 victory at the &lt;a href="w%3AHubert%20H.%20Humphrey%20Metrodome"&gt;Metrodome&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. &lt;a href="w%3ARam%C3%B3n%20Ortiz"&gt;Ramón Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; made an impressive Twins debut, giving up only two runs in seven innings of play and picking up the win. This was the first time Minnesota has swept a series with the Orioles at home since they faced them in May 1994, and their first 3-0 start since 2003.

Baltimore pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AJaret%20Wright"&gt;Jaret Wright&lt;/a&gt; made his debut for the Orioles Wednesday, but he gave up six runs (four earned) and five walks in less than three innings. Oriole fielders were charged with three errors. This was the first time Baltimore has started the season 0-3 since 1995.

Twins got things started early, with &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Cuddyer"&gt;Michael Cuddyer&lt;/a&gt; hitting in &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Punto"&gt;Nick Punto&lt;/a&gt; in both the first and third innings. &lt;a href="w%3ARondell%20White"&gt;Rondell White&lt;/a&gt; got his first hit of the season and picked up two RBIs. &lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Castillo"&gt;Luis Castillo&lt;/a&gt;, who hit in the Twins the winning run on Tuesday picked up two RBIs as well. In the fifth inning, &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Kubel"&gt;Jason Kubel&lt;/a&gt; hit in &lt;a href="w%3ATorii%20Hunter"&gt;Torii Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, making the score 7-0.

Baltimore attempted a rally in the sixth inning, &lt;a href="w%3AMelvin%20Mora"&gt;Melvin Mora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMiguel%20Tejada"&gt;Miguel Tejada&lt;/a&gt; hitting in a run each, but the pitching by Ortiz and the Twins' defense held them to only two runs.

Cuddyer left the game following the fourth inning after being hit by a bouncing foul ball in the chin. He was given five stitches and is expected to be ready to play on Friday when the team travels to &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; to face the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20White%20Sox"&gt;White Sox&lt;/a&gt;. Baltimore will head to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; to face the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;Yankees&lt;/a&gt; after their off day.

In the course of the game, reliever &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Nathan"&gt;Joe Nathan&lt;/a&gt; became a father for a second time, his wife giving birth to his son Riley. Nathan, being allowed to miss the game, left the hospital shortly after the birth to attend the final inning. He was able to congratulate his team immediately following their win, while being congratulated himself.

<h1>Keith Richards denies reports that he snorted his father's ashes</h1>

In an interview with the &lt;a href="w%3ANME"&gt;NME magazine&lt;/a&gt; he is quoted as saying "The strangest thing I've tried to snort? My father. I snorted my father. He was cremated and I couldn't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow. My dad wouldn't have cared, he didn't give a shit. It went down pretty well, and I'm still alive. He went down pretty well."

Despite the interview, Richards denies he said anything like that and that he ever used cocaine.

"I wouldn't take cocaine at this point in my life unless I wished to commit suicide. The truth of the matter is that I planted a sturdy English Oak. I took the lid off the box of ashes [of his father] and he is now growing oak trees and would love me for it!," said Richards in a statement also adding that the interview was "lost in the usual slanting."

Bert, who had been the father of Richards, died when he was 84, back in 2002.

Richard's manager later told the NME that the remarks had been made "in jest", and should not be taken seriously.

The Pittsburgh Pirates swept the Houston Astros in a 5-4 victory at the &lt;a href="w%3AMinute%20Maid%20Park"&gt;Minute Maid Park&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. &lt;a href="w%3AXavier%20Nady"&gt;Xavier Nady&lt;/a&gt; did very well in the first three games of the season, going 1 for 4 with 2 runs to lift the Pirates over the Astros. &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Gorzelanny"&gt;Tom Gorzelanny&lt;/a&gt; made his debut in the last game of the series, giving up 3 runs on 7 hits, with 2 errors, with one ball batted and four strikeouts. This is the first time since May 1991 that the Pirates swept the Astros.

Trailing by two runs in the fifth, Pittsburgh capitalized on three fielding errors to put them ahead by two. &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Biggio"&gt;Craig Biggio&lt;/a&gt; hit a solo home run with two outs in the ninth inning, but Pittsburgh closer &lt;a href="w%3ASalomon%20Torres"&gt;Salomon Torres&lt;/a&gt; struck out the last batter and picked up the save.

The Astros are off until Friday when the &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Cardinals"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; visit for three games. Meanwhile, the Pirates are concluding their opening road trip in Cincinnati before returning home to face the Cardinals.

An evacuation operation was carried out today as a &lt;a href="w%3ACruise%20ship"&gt;cruise ship&lt;/a&gt; ran aground off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ASantorini"&gt;Santorini&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; island, leaving up to 1,167 passengers and 391 crew to abandon the ship.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Diamond"&gt;Sea Diamond&lt;/a&gt; took on water and listed twelve degrees after running aground, but had been stabilized. Fifteen hours after the grounding, the ship sank.
Cruise operator Louis Cruise Lines had announced earlier that all passengers and crew were accounted for. Officials are now reporting that two passengers are missing. A 45-year-old man, Jean-Christophe Allain, and his 16-year-old daughter, Maud, were reported missing by family members also on the cruise, according to a merchant marine ministry official.

BBC journalist Malcolm Brabant reported that the missing passengers had been in a lower-deck cabin when the ship ran aground. Allain's wife and son escaped safely to the upper decks.

Most of the passengers on board the ♡❤Sea Diamond♡❤ ship are either &lt;a href="USA"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;. Local news reported that the ship is taking on water after striking a reef in the volcanic island's lagoon, similar to a lake, and issued a distress signal, launching an operation that led more than a dozen ships and five &lt;a href="w%3AGreek%20Navy"&gt;Greek Navy&lt;/a&gt; helicopters to evacuate all the people on board, with many boarding a small ferry.
The ship was about one nautical mile - 1.8km - from the island's coast when it ran aground. The ship's operators, Louis Cruise Lines, earlier said that a "controlled evacuation" was underway, but that "there is no danger to passengers". The ship had left the &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athenian&lt;/a&gt; port of &lt;a href="w%3APiraeus"&gt;Piraeus&lt;/a&gt; on Monday for a five-day tour of the islands. The sea was calm when the incident occurred.

"Some passengers have already reached the island and no-one has been hurt," an official at the Santorini coastguard has said, whilst Merchant Marine Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManolis%20Kefaloyiannis"&gt;Manolis Kefaloyiannis&lt;/a&gt; said to reporters, "Thankfully, everything has gone well so far. Emergency services responded very quickly and very well."

The Carolina Hurricanes, the current holders of the Stanley Cup, will not be in the NHL Playoffs to defend their title. With Carolina losing 3-2 to the Tampa Bay Lightning Tuesday night, and the Montreal Canadians defeating the Boston Bruins to hold onto their spot in the postseason, the Hurricanes found themselves on the outside looking in.

The Edmonton Oilers, champions of the Western Conference last season, were elimanated from playoff contention several weeks ago, but only two teams, the 1970 Montreal Canadiens and 1995 New Jersey Devils, have won the Stanley Cup, and miss the playoffs entirely the next season. This marks the first time both teams previously in the Stanley Cup Finals totally miss the playoffs the following year.

Hurricanes center Eric Staal said: "The year went by so fast, it just felt like we were right in the mix and all of a sudden, in a blink of an eye, we're out."

<h3>Relics believed to have belonged to Joan of Arc, found to be fake</h3>

Scientists who studied relics that were thought to have belonged to the saint &lt;a href="w%3AJoan%20of%20Arc"&gt;Joan of Arc&lt;/a&gt; and were said to have been found at a pharmacy in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris, France&lt;/a&gt;, have turned out to be forgeries. Tests show that the items are actually the remains of a &lt;a href="w%3Amummy"&gt;mummy&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.

The relics were originally authenticated by the Roman Catholic Church and are now in a museum in &lt;a href="w%3AChinon"&gt;Chinon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%203"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; Entertainment System has been banned in prisons. One of its key features is built in &lt;a href="w%3AWi-Fi"&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; which has the ability to send radio signals. To prevent prisoners from sending messages about jail breaks and other possible violations, it has been banned.

"The Sony PlayStation 3 was barred from the prison estate because of the equipment's ability to send and receive radio signals," said British Home Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reid"&gt;John Reid&lt;/a&gt;.

The PlayStation 3 was launched in the United Kingdom last month. A similar ban was put in for Sony's &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%202"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; which was alleged that inmates could use it to look at pornography.

Five fifth grade students were charged with obscenity after allegedly having sex in an unattended classroom. Two 11-year-old girls, a 12-year-old boy, and a 13-year-old boy were charged with obscenity, a &lt;a href="w%3Afelony"&gt;felony&lt;/a&gt;. An 11-year-old boy was posted as a lookout at the door to watch for teachers. The lookout has been charged as an accessory.

Local authorities said the incident occurred on March 27th, with 10 other students in the classroom at the time the incident took place. Local sherriff Bob Buckley told the Associated Press that "...after 44 years of work, nothing shocks me. But this comes pretty close."

The students were alone for about 15 minutes. Authorities did not learn of the incident until a day later, on March 28th. A student, who asked to remain anonymous, told a high school student, who reported it to a teacher, who subsequently told the local officials.

On Wednesday, approximately forty &lt;a href="w%3AHells%20Angels%23Canada"&gt;Hells Angels&lt;/a&gt; locations were raided by police in &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, , and . Police arrested more than thirty people in the three provinces.

The largest Hells Angels location in Canada, located in &lt;a href="w%3ADowntown%20Toronto"&gt;downtown Toronto&lt;/a&gt; on 498 Eastern Ave., was raided early Wednesday morning. Nearly sixteen members were arrested with two members still on the wanted list. &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Police"&gt;Toronto Police&lt;/a&gt; removed the sign and are now investigating. They are currently planning a large crackdown on the Hells Angels in the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Toronto%20Area"&gt;Greater Toronto Area&lt;/a&gt; (GTA).

"Hopefully by now biker gangs and their associates are getting the message: we're here to shut you down. You can run but you can't hide, and we will do all that we can to bring you to justice," said &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police%20Commissioner"&gt;Ontario Provincial Police Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; (OPP) &lt;a href="w%3AJulian%20Fantino"&gt;Julian Fantino&lt;/a&gt;. "I believe that we have to continue the attack on organized crime however it's manifested, and we owe the citizens of our community no less." "It's a good day for policing in Toronto, a good day for policing in Ontario."

"Project Develop was an 18-month investigation that utilized a full-patch Hells Angels member as a police agent to infiltrate the Toronto downtown chapter of the Hells Angels," OPP Inspector Dan Redmond said yesterday. "Hells Angels criminal activity has been exposed by one of their own."

Nearly 170 charges were laid against thirty-one people, police said, though they provided no list of charges or names. Sixteen full-patch members are said to be in custody, with arrest warrants outstanding for another two. Police seized vehicles, drugs, weapons, property and real-estate, but were not specific about the amounts.

The Hells Angels is a large biker gang founded 1948 in &lt;a href="w%3AFontana%2C%20California"&gt;Fontana, California&lt;/a&gt; and is estimated to have 1,800 members in 22 countries. Since they started many other biker gangs merged with them, due to the fact that the Hells Angels are larger. The Hells Angels have 500 members in Canada, thirty-four active chapters in Canada, sixteen in Ontario, seven in British Columbia, five in , three in , two in , and one in . A number of raids have been made since, with two in September and January 2006.

A location on Sherwood Ave. in &lt;a href="w%3AScarborough%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Scarborough, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, and a house on Berard Court in &lt;a href="w%3ABarrie%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Barrie, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; are under a &lt;a href="w%3Arestraining%20order"&gt;restraining order&lt;/a&gt; as they may have drug related crimes.

The Toronto chapter of Hells Angels, in the "Real Deal News" section of their website, alleged that the police were staging a show for the media and that the raids were overly dramatic to make Hells Angels look bad on television.

It was an unusual ending to Thursday's game at &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Cellular%20Field"&gt;U.S. Cellular Field&lt;/a&gt; between the Chicago White Sox and the Cleveland Indians. With the game tied in the bottom of the ninth inning, Cleveland pitcher &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28baseball%29"&gt;Roberto Hernández&lt;/a&gt; hit batter &lt;a href="w%3AA.J.%20Pierzynski"&gt;A.J. Pierzynski&lt;/a&gt; with the bases loaded, walking in the winning run.

&lt;a href="w%3AGrady%20Sizemore"&gt;Grady Sizemore&lt;/a&gt; got things started for the Indians by hitting a solo home run in the first, but the Sox would tie it up in the second on a &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Konerko"&gt;Paul Konerko&lt;/a&gt; RBI groundout. Another Indian homer came from the bat of &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Michaels"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt;, but the Sox again tie it up in the fourth with &lt;a href="w%3ATadahito%20Iguchi"&gt;Tadahito Iguchi&lt;/a&gt; hitting an RBI sacrifice fly. Chicago took their first lead of the game in the seventh with a &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Podsednik"&gt;Scott Podsednik&lt;/a&gt; RBI, but Jason Michaels would tie it up again in the eighth. In the bottom of the ninth inning, an inside pitch hit batter A.J. Pierzynski, walking in the winning run and ending the game.

Chicago starter &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Buehrle"&gt;Mark Buehrle&lt;/a&gt; left the game in the second inning suffering from bruising on his forearm after being hit just below the elbow of his pitching arm. He has been diagnosed with having a contusion on his left forearm, and his status will be day-to-day. &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Thornton"&gt;Matt Thornton&lt;/a&gt; is credited a blown save for giving up Chicago's one run lead in the eighth. Cleveland starter &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Sowers"&gt;Jeremy Sowers&lt;/a&gt; pitched the first six innings, giving up just a hit and two runs.

The White Sox, now 1-2, are staying in town to play the visiting &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Twins"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; while Cleveland, now 2-1, will go home to face off against the &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20Mariners"&gt;Seattle Mariners&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOrganisation%20for%20Economic%20Co-operation%20and%20Development"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&lt;/a&gt; (OECD) has released a report on the environmental performance of the &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; Government. Although the Government applauds the findings as vindicating its path to sustainability the report makes a wide range of recommendations in order to improve environmental performance. It calls for better protection of water, a clarification and strengthening of climate change policy, an upgrade of waste management and improvement environmental reporting.

The previous report was released in 1996 and a number of improvements have been noted. Thse include minimising harmful substances in agriculture and fisheries, improving drinking water, balancing social and environmental concerns and expanding protected areas. 

It is part of a second cycle of peer reviewed reports on the OECD member countries.

The first leg of the Champions League quarter-finals were played out on Tuesday and Wednesday. Of the three English teams remaining in the competition, only one was able to earn themselves a win in the first leg, that being Liverpool. Draws occurred in the Chelsea/Valencia and Milan/Bayern games, while Manchester United lost on the road in Rome.

<h2>Matches</h2>
<h4>PSV Eindhoven 0 - 3 Liverpool</h4>
Liverpool thumped Dutch side PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday, with Steven Gerrard, John Arne Riise, and Peter Crouch all scoring for the reds. The huge away win leaves Liverpool in the driving seat of the series, with PSV coach Koeman telling the press "we're as good as out (of the competition)." 

For a full recap of the match, see: 

<h4>AC Milan 2 - 2 Bayern Munich</h4>
In the other Tuesday night match, German side Bayern Munich travelled to the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to play Serie A side AC Milan. With both teams in good domestic form as of late, it was certain it would be hard to separate the two in the match, and as it turned out, that assumption was correct. Andrea Pirlo struck first for the home side, as his looping header evaded keeper Michael Rensing. Bayern eventually tied the match in the 78th minute through defender Daniel van Buyten, as his close range effort left no chance for Dida to make a save. A controversial penalty for Milan followed when a clean challenge by Lucio on Kaka was misjudged by the referee, and Kaka scored from the spot to restore Milan's lead. Bayern pushed back and were rewarded with a goal in the 94th minute, as van Buyten half volleyed the ball home with virtually the last kick of the game, earning himself a brace, and Bayern the draw.

<h4>Chelsea 1 - 1 Valencia</h4>
Spanish side Valencia travelled to London to take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. Valencia went into the game several men short due to injury as well as suspension due to the brawl with Internazionale players following the round of sixteen match last month. Even without the likes of Fernando Morientes, Valencia took a lead after 30 minutes when David Silva scored a screamer from well over 30 yards out. Chelsea equalised through Didier Drogba in the second half as he headed home a long ball from Ashley Cole. The goal was Drogba's 30th of the season in all competitions. The draw means Chelsea will have to win in Spain during the second leg to advance due to the away goals rule. 

<h4>Roma 2 - 1 Manchester United</h4>
The Stadio Olympico was filled with 77000 fans for this match between Manchester United and home side AS Roma on Wednesday. The first big event of the game was the sending off of United midfielder Paul Scholes after only 34 minutes of play. Scholes was yellow carded twice for dangerous challenges, and was subsequently red carded by referee Herbert Fandel. Roma would then use the man advantage to take the lead before the half time break when Rodrigo Taddei's shot deflected off Wes Brown and into the back of the net. It looked as if Roma was going to take full control of the game, but Wayne Rooney struck back after 60 minutes, ending his European goal draught. Christiano Ronaldo set up the play after breaking through three challenges and feeding Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who crossed into Rooney. Rooney chested down the cross and slotted the ball past Doni tying the match, and giving United a crucial away goal. Mancini's shot on net was then punched instead of caught by United keeper Edwin van Der Sar, and Mirko Vucinic was in the right place to restore Roma's lead, and effectively win them the match.

Return legs will be played on the 10th/11th of April.

The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Senators"&gt;Ottawa Senators&lt;/a&gt; in the closing seconds of Thursday night's game, pulling the Penguins into a tie with the Senators for points, with 103 each. With &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Devils"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; clinching the &lt;a href="w%3ANHL%20Atlantic%20Divison"&gt;Atlantic Division&lt;/a&gt; title after defeating &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, Pittsburgh locks into a first round matchup with Ottawa in the &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Cup%20Playoffs"&gt;Stanley Cup Playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, though who will claim home ice advantage is still unknown. Pittsburgh can still claim home ice advantage if Ottawa loses their season finale Saturday in &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Bruins"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Spezza"&gt;Jason Spezza&lt;/a&gt; struck first in the game, scoring a power play goal at 7:59. &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt; would hold the Penguins scoreless until 14:05 in the first, when &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Ouellet"&gt;Michel Ouellet&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal to even the score at 1-1. &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Roberts"&gt;Gary Roberts&lt;/a&gt; gave the Penguins the lead 55 seconds later, scoring the third power play goal of the game, and Roberts' 19th of the season to give the Pens the edge, 2-1 heading into the second period. &lt;a href="w%3ADany%20Heatley"&gt;Dany Heatley&lt;/a&gt; would make it four power play goals in the game, when he scored his NHL best 49th goal of the season, assisted by &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Spezza"&gt;Jason Spezza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Comrie"&gt;Mike Comrie&lt;/a&gt;, to tie the game at two goals apiece. Both teams would tighten up on defense, holding each other scoreless until the final period, when &lt;a href="w%3AMaxime%20Talbot"&gt;Maxime Talbot&lt;/a&gt; would give the Penguins the 3-2 lead and the victory, with 9.8 seconds remaining in the game, stunning the 24,064 in attendance at &lt;a href="w%3AScotiabank%20Place"&gt;Scotiabank Place&lt;/a&gt; in Ottawa.

&lt;a href="w%3AMarc-Andre%20Fleury"&gt;Marc-Andre Fleury&lt;/a&gt; picked up the win, stopping 35 of the 37 shots he faced. &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt; was saddled with the loss, stopping 24 of 27 shots faced.

The Senators will try to claim home ice advantage Saturday, when the Boston Bruins host Ottawa. Game time is scheduled for 7:00. Pittsburgh needs to win Saturday, as well as hope for a Bruins victory, when the Pens host the New York Rangers at Mellon Arena. Opening face off is scheduled for 7:30.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Overcrowded%20Montreal%20hospital%20asks%20public%20to%20stay%20away&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%20Heart%20Institute"&gt;Montreal Heart Institute&lt;/a&gt; (MHI) notified the public, through a news release Wednesday, that a recent high volume of patients has put a strain on the hospital's resources. The MHI requested that the public avoid its emergency department and find alternate care, if possible. It did indicate that acute care emergency patients would not be turned away.

The notice was to be in place for 24 hours from Wednesday. On Thursday, the MHI issued a extension to the public notice for an additional 24-hour period.

The number of patients that visited the MHI over the past few months had been abnormally high and reached a peak in the past two weeks, according to the head of emergency services. Alain Vadeboncoeur indicated that it was unusual for the MHI to put out such an advisory, but assured the public that the hospital would "always take the big emergencies."

The hospital treats 45 to 50 emergency patients per day, typically, but that number jumped to as many as 70 patients per day in the past two weeks. The MHI maintains 153 beds, including 42 in medical intensive care and 29 in surgical intensive care and performs 1,850 &lt;a href="w%3ACardiac%20surgery"&gt;cardiac surgeries&lt;/a&gt; yearly.

It was suggested by the MHI that people requiring non-emergency care contact their regional Info-Santé for telephone-based advice, or visit a local clinic.

Founded in 1954, the MHI specializes in cardiovascular treatment, with an emphasis on prevention, specialized care, research, and assessment of new technologies. The MHI is a teaching facility affiliated with the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversit%C3%A9%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al"&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/a&gt;.

All four quarterfinal matches occurred Thursday in the UEFA Cup, with all three Spanish sides remaining in the competition winning their games. Only one match ended in a draw, that being the game between AZ Alkmaar and Werder Bremen.

<h2>Matches</h2>
<h4>Sevilla 2 - 1 Tottenham</h4>
English side Tottenham Hotspur travelled to Spain to take on La Liga title hopeful's Sevilla. Robbie Keane scored the opener for the visitors only two minutes into the match, but a controversial penalty off a challenge by keeper Paul Robinson saw Sevilla draw level as Freddie Kanoute slotted the spot kick home. Both teams battled for a win, but Sevilla eventually came out the victors as Alexander Kerzhakov scored the winning goal, and Spurs could not recover.

<h4>AZ Alkmaar 0 - 0 Werder Bremen</h4>
Two clubs battling for the title in their respective domestic leagues met Thursday at the DSB Stadion in Alkmaar, Netherlands. Both sides put in respectable efforts, but the eventual outcome of the game would be a nil-nil draw. The draw means Bremen will have to win at home in the return leg in order to qualify automatically for the semi-finals.

<h4>Bayer Leverkusen 0 - 3 Osasuna</h4>
Osasuna all but booked their place in the semi's with a convincing 3-0 win over Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen at the Bay Arena. The visitors came out very strong with Carlos Cuellar scoring within the first minute. Two goals two minutes apart midway through the second half from Lopez and Webo secured the game for Osasuna, and Bayer will have to improve greatly if they hope to advance after the second leg.

<h4>Espanyol 3 - 2 Benfica</h4>
In a hard fought affair, Espanyol took a demanding 3-0 lead in under an hour, but Portuguese side Benfica fought hard and earned themselves two crucial away goals in Spain. Tamudo opened the scoring for Espanyol after 15 minutes before Riera and Pandiani scored to put pressure on Benfica. Nuno Gomes and Simao Sabrosa responded well for the Eagles, tallying in the 64th and 66th minutes respectively. The goals by Benfica leave the result of the tie up in the air, as a 1-0 victory in the return leg is all Benfica require to advance, while Espanyol will only need a draw.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Thailand%20bans%20YouTube%20over%20videos%20insulting%20king&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The first video which was "removed by user," has turned up again, uploaded from a different user than the first posting, claiming to be from &lt;a href="w%3AIceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;. The second video was uploaded as recently as April 5 and the third has been on YouTube since March 12.

The government states that the ban on YouTube will continue. &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, who owns ♡❤YouTube♡❤, refused to remove the video saying videos of the current &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; are worse than those of Thailand's King. 

"It's hard to tell how they [Google] will respond. In some countries, it's a norm to have their leaders mocked, but this is different. With the king, it is very offensive to the Thai public. YouTube said it thought there was not enough reason to remove the clip after viewing the video and making its judgement on the content," added Pookaiyaudom.

Google later replied to the King stating that the video will not be removed, but that YouTube has a plan to only allow certain videos to be viewed without blocking the whole site.

"He said pulling out those clips would not be an effective way to stop the damage, since users could re-post them again. He said a more effective way would be to block certain pages not to be seen in Thailand. It will be a few days before we lift the ban on the entire site," added Pookaiyaudom.

The text of the first video, scrolled across the screen, stated "This video would give up to 15 years prison in Thailand, because their leaders are evil (sic) and hate free speech. A Swiss man, Oliver Rudolf Jufer, 57, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spray-painting graffiti over Thailand's revered King. Fuck Thailand leaders and the ape king."

The 44 second-long video, posted April 4, 2007 shows images of King Adulyadej drawn over and made to look like a monkey or an ape and a "juxtaposed" image with feet on top of King Adulyadej, pointing just under his nose. In Thailand, feet are seen as a dirty side of humans and people there think of feet as being offensive and rude. Playing in the background of the video was the music of the national anthem of Thailand.

In the second video, posted on March 12, 2007, shows still images of leaders from different nations around the world, King Adulyadej is seen with black painted over his face, imitating thick dark eyebrows and a mustache. 

In the third video, the feet are again placed just under the King's nose when halfway through the film, his image is vandalized by showing his eyed "bugged out of his head" and the Wat Kaow Roop Chang Temple in Songkhla in between his eyes.

The first video was viewed nearly 70,000 times before the original user removed it from YouTube.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Defense%20Secretary%20evaluates%20Iraq%20and%20the%20political%20climate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

U.S. Defence Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt; warned that limiting funding for the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; efforts in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; could lead to more bloodshed in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;ern country. In an interview with radio talk show host &lt;a href="w%3ALaura%20Ingraham"&gt;Laura Ingraham&lt;/a&gt;, he said it might even lead to &lt;a href="w%3AEthnic%20cleansing"&gt;ethnic cleansing&lt;/a&gt; in Bahgdad and elsewhere in Iraq.

Gates' comment followed a proposal from Senate Majority Leader &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; to end most spending on the Iraq war in 2008, limiting it to targeted operations against &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Qaeda"&gt;al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, training for Iraqi troops and U.S. force protection.

Sec. Gates also said that the duration of the troop increase is not clear and that evaluating whether the Administration's new strategy was working will have to wait till mid-summer. The Army general charged with day-to-day operations has suggested that the increased deployment may extend to early next year.

<h2>Congressional funding</h2>
Gates discussed the military’s need for funding to finance the war effort. He said he is concerned about delays in enacting an emergency supplemental bill. Each house of Congress has passed a version of the bill, and both versions contain a time line for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq. The House version sets benchmarks of progress to be met by the Iraqi government. President Bush has vowed to veto any bill containing the withdrawal language. 

Gates said each of the armed services will be affected by a delay, with the Army being the worst off. The service may be forced to suspend training for deploying forces, repairing equipment and putting in place a civilian hiring freeze. The secretary said a threatened complete cut-off of war "would be dramatic." 

The Bush administration presents congress with war funding requests as emergency supplementals, not as part of the Pentagon's budget, a practice that began as costs were difficult to estimate during the start of the war. On October 10 of last year, Lt. Gen. David Melcher, deputy chief of staff for Army programming, material integration and management, told reporters that costs were now predictable enough to be included in the Pentagon budget proposals. The Bush administration, however, continues with the use of emergency supplementals. The supplemental funding requests are not accounted in national deficits, which, in the short term, gives the impression of a more positive-looking balance-sheet.

Until recently, the Administration had been sending supplemental requests six months after the fiscal year had started, rather than the six months prior to the start of the Pentagon's fiscal year. This meant the military used funds alloted originally for procurement, training and repair, instead for its war efforts during the first six months of the fiscal year. This put pressure on Congress to approve the funding bills quickly to prevent military funding from drying up. Even a separate bridge fund of $50 billion set up to offset the time pressure did not go very far, as $10 billion are used up every month in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2007 and 2008 supplemental requests were sent to Capitol Hill in February, at the same time as the 2008 Defense Department budget request.

<h2>Security situation in Iraq</h2>
Gates said Thursday that increasing troop strength in Iraq and stepping up security in Baghdad is working. 

Planners predicted the increase in major bombings by insurgents, Gates told reporters at a news conference. He blamed a "relatively small" number of people for sectarian killings. An unnamed U.S. military analyst told reporters last month that 70,000 "hard-line operators and part-time supporters" were actively resisting the current security operations. 

"So far, so good…the early signs are positive," Gates said. "There is a great reluctance to engage in happy talk about this. It's a tough environment." 

"One real possibility is if we abandon some of these areas and withdraw into the countryside or whatever to do these targeted missions that you could have a fairly significant ethnic cleansing inside Baghdad and in Iraq more broadly," 

"What we do know is if Baghdad is in flames and the whole city is engulfed in violence, the prospects for a political solution are almost non-existent," 

Al Qaeda continues to launch dramatic terror attacks against population centres, Gates said, adding some of these attacks are in reaction to the progress being made.

“It’s been part of their strategy since last year to foment sectarian violence,” Gates said. “I think some of these large car bombs are to counteract some of the positive things that have been happening as a result of even the two brigades going into Baghdad along with a significant number of Iraqi forces.” 

Gates said he is pleased with the commitment and cooperation from the Iraqi government. The Iraqis have delivered the additional troops they promised, and Iraqi commanders in Baghdad are directing operations. The Iraqi government is allowing Iraqi security forces and coalition forces into any neighbourhood. 

The Iraqi government also is maintaining its commitment to no political interference in operations, Gates said.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; was located 40 km [25 miles] south east of Gizo, New Georgia Islands in the Solomon Isle.

It is not known if there is any damage associated with the tremor, but shake maps from the USGS say that "light to moderate" damage could be reported.

On April 4, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck the same area. Before that, two quakes measuring 6.0 struck in roughly the same area. There were no reports of damage with any of those quakes. These follow the massive 8.1 magnitude quake that struck on April 1 that triggered a tsunami killing at least 15 people.

The &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in the Asia-Oceania Group Two semi-final opening singles matches for the &lt;a href="w%3ADavis%20Cup"&gt;Davis Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the intimate surroundings of the Parnell Club Courts.

The Philippine team took the lead over New Zealand with two wins to zero.

The Good Friday morning match showcased the Philippines’ Cecil Mamiit, ranked 194 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), against the 19-year-old Rubin Statham, New Zealand's second ranked player and ranked 749 by the ATP. Mamiit defeated Statham with straight set wins of 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.

The following match featured Eric Taino (547) against Kiwi, Simon Rea (668). Taino took command of the match at 6-1, 6-2, 6-4.

The Filipino duo showed their best form amidst a home court crowd favouring their opponents.

Team Manager, Jean Henri Lhuillier President of Cebuna Lhuillier hailed the victory and said, "We are delighted over this victory. We have always believed that Cecil (Mamiit) and Eric (Taino) can carry the game against New Zealand even if it’s in their home court advantage."

Lhuillier further added, "We are hoping to sweep matches. It’s a tall order but with the wins, we hope our momentum will carry us to the next match."

Philippine Tennis Association president Luis Mendoza and Lhuillier applauded Eric Taino for playing a very good game against Rea.

Dan King-Turner (ATP 480) was omitted from the single’s match with Statham by team captain James Greenhalgh believing that Statham and Rea would be the best to beat Mamiit and Taino.
Patrick John "PJ" Tierro (ATP 890) and Johnny Arcilla (no ATP rank) is expected to play against King-Turner and Rea to determine if New Zealand can even the series against the Philippines.

At a press conference held Friday at the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Marines%20Base%20Chivenor"&gt;Royal Marine Base Chivenor&lt;/a&gt; in Devon, first-hand details of the fifteen UK Royal Navy crew's capture and detention by Iran were revealed.

The fifteen navy crew, eight from the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; (RN) and seven from the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Marines"&gt;Royal Marines&lt;/a&gt; (RM), arrived by helicopter at the base on Thursday. Following a period of debriefing and rest, the crew spoke at a press conference on Friday. Captain Christopher Air, RM, and Lieutenant Felix Carman, RN, spoke for the group.

Carman and Air thanked the staff of the British Embassy in Tehran, the Foreign Office, and Ministry of Defence for securing their release. In addition, Air stated that the crew "would like to thank the very many members of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines who have been working so hard over the last 2 weeks supporting our families and friends and for arranging our return to here."

Carman provided details of the navigational equipment and hand held &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Positioning%20System"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; used by the UK crew. A support helicopter also provided continuous navigational confirmation. The boarding crew were linked electronically to &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Cornwall%20%28F99%29"&gt;HMS ♡❤Cornwall♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which monitored the crew's position continually. "Let me make it absolutely clear," said Carman. "Irrespective of what has been said in the past, when we were detained by the IRG we were inside internationally recognised Iraqi territorial waters and I can clearly state we were 1.7 nautical miles from Iranian waters."
Having boarded an unidentified merchant vessel in the Shatt Al Arab waterway, the crew were stopped by two Iranian boats, which prevented them from leaving. "When we tried to leave, they prevented us by blocking us in," explained Air. "By now it was becoming increasingly clear that they had arrived with a planned intent. Some of the Iranian sailors were becoming deliberately aggressive and unstable. They rammed our boat and trained their heavy machine guns, RPGs and weapons on us."

Six other Iranian boats arrived. "We made a conscious decision to not engage the Iranians and do as they asked," said Air. "They boarded our boats, removed our weapons and steered the boats towards the Iranian shore."

On arrival at an Iranian naval base, the UK crew were stripped of their gear, blindfolded, and led to an interrogation room. The following morning the group was flown to Tehran and transported to a prison where they faced "constant psychological pressure." The crew were stripped and dressed in pajamas. According to Carman, "the next few nights were spent in stone cells, approximately 8'x 6', sleeping on piles of blankets. All of us were kept in isolation."

They were interrogated most nights and offered two options. "If we admitted we had strayed, we would be on a plane back to the UK soon," said Carman. "If we didn't we faced up to seven years in prison." The crew were kept in isolation until the last few nights, when they were allowed to gather together for a couple of hours at a time.

On the subject of deciding to resist the Iranians or not, Air was adamant that it would have made the situation worse. "Let me be absolutely clear, from the outset it was very apparent that fighting back was simply not an option," said Air. "Had we chosen to do so then many of us would not be standing here today."

The allegation is that under the &lt;a href="African%20Union%20Mission%20to%20Somalia"&gt;AMISOM&lt;/a&gt; commander, civilians were attacked. The EU could be at risk of being seen as complicit, if it does not act to stop abuses, because it is providing funding to the Somali government.

Another Good Friday, another fund-raising record broken. That seems to be how it goes these days for &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; annual &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday%20Appeal"&gt;Good Friday Appeal&lt;/a&gt;. The 2007 Royal Children's Hospital Good Friday Appeal raised a record-breaking &lt;a href="w%3AAU%24"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;11,788,970.80, amounting to an increase of $1,508,438.30 over last year's total of $10,280,532.50.

For 50 years, the Seven Network has been part of and televised the Good Friday Appeal, which raises money to support programs for children with life-threatening illnesses. The money raised benefits the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Children%27s%20Hospital%2C%20Melbourne"&gt;Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.

For this year's Appeal, Seven Network, The Herald, and the Weekly Times Herald Sun teamed up with 3AW, and, according to HSV7 Melbourne boss Ian Johnson, the Appeal will remain on the Seven Network for many years to come.

Good Friday Appeal director Christine Unsworth thanked all who pledged money in the Appeal, and the many volunteers who donated their time to the cause. "I'd like to thank all Victorians for giving their money, their time and their dedication to the appeal," she said. "We've had people working all over the state and without them the appeal wouldn't be what it is."

The Appeal's telethon receives support from Melbourne celebrities in raising funds from all sectors of the community, from corporations to households. The Appeal started in 1931, when journalists from the Herald and Weekly Times organized a sporting event to help the children's hospital raise funds.

Everton came from behind to thrash Fulham 4-1 on Friday at Goodison Park. Everton had a chance to jump into fifth place in the league ahead of Bolton, while Fulham could have jumped from fifteenth all the way to eleventh, boosting their chances of league survival. England international Andy Johnson was paired with 18 year old James Vaughan up front for Everton, while Chris Coleman's Fulham had a full North American strike force through American Bryan McBride and Canadian Thomasz Radzinski. 

The visitors started the game strongly with long range efforts from Rosenior and Smertin, but neither were able to bother Tim Howard in the Everton goal. Mikel Arteta was able to trouble Antti Niemi, however, in the Fulham goal, but the Finnish keeper did well to keep the ball out of the bottom corner. Carlos Bocanegra then opened Everton wide open as he stole away from the defenders and headed home Simon Davies' cross, giving Fulham the lead after 22 minutes. Everton answered back quickly through Lee Carsley after Joleon Lescott's ball found him in the box, and Carsley knocked home the equalizing goal. Everton put Fulham on the back foot after their goal, and shoul have taken the lead when a nice interchange of play between Vaughan and Johnson left Vaughaun all alone on net, but his shot was hit off the post, and bobbled safely to a Fulham defender. Everton were then awarded a free kick in the Fulham zone, and Mikel Arteta stepped up to take. His outswinging ball was glanced off the head of Alan Stubbs, and it somehow eluded Niemi, as the homeside took the lead. Vaughaun would hit the post again several minutes later, but he finally notched him name on the scoresheet just before the break. Arteta and Johnson made room on the left side, and Arteta's cross was finished well by the young Vaughan, giving Everton a demanding 3-1 lead. 

After the break, Fulham came out strongly, eager to get back into the match. McBride had two good chances from headers, but he was unable to find the net on either. Zat Knight then had a chance for Fulham, but the cottagers where again unable to get their attempts on target. Vuaghan was soon replaced by fellow youngster Victor Anichebe, and he made a nearly instant impact. Anichebee received a pass within the box, and he cooly side-footed the ball hard and low past Niemi, leaving the keeper no chance, and guaranteeing Everton the win on the afternoon. Substitute Helguson had two chances in quick succession for Fulham, but it wasn't to be their day, as the cottagers drop dangerously into relegation contention. 

Everton's next match in the league is in only 3 days time against Bolton, who are now in sixth place after the Toffee's win. Fulham on the other hand will be facing off with fellow relegation contenders Manchester City at Craven Cottage, and it is looking up to be a true relegation six-pointer.

A new interesting feature of the F1 cars was presented by &lt;a href="w%3ABridgestone"&gt;Bridgestone&lt;/a&gt;, the tyre supplier. All tyres of softer compound will be marked by a white stria along the tyre groove starting from this race onwards. As intended, this will help audience to distinguish the tyres, it will be more helpful than the previous white heavy dot on the outer side of the tyre.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Red%20Wings"&gt;Detroit Red Wings&lt;/a&gt; hockey club announced Friday that they had signed a multi-year contract with centre &lt;a href="w%3APavel%20Datsyuk"&gt;Pavel Datsyuk&lt;/a&gt;. The seven year deal is worth US$46.9 million, averaging out to $6.7 million per season.

The 28-year-old Datsyuk is the leading scorer for the Red Wings this season. In 2006-2007, he has accrued 27 goals and 60 assists for 87 points. "Pavel is one of the world's most skilled players and has developed into a bona fide superstar over the past two seasons," Red Wings general manager &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Holland"&gt;Ken Holland&lt;/a&gt; said in the press release.

Datsyuk, who has been with the Red Wings his entire &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt; career, is considered by the Red Wings to be a valuable part of the team's future. "We think securing Pavel, who is moving into the prime of his career, is key to ensuring the long-term success of this franchise," said Holland.

"I am very pleased to announce that I am continuing my hockey career with the Detroit Red Wings by signing a seven-year contract," Datsyuk said. "This contract was extremely important to me. Especially since I have been a Red Wing since 2001." Datsyuk is earning US3.9 million this season in his current contract.

Datsyuk won the &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Cup"&gt;Stanley Cup&lt;/a&gt; with the Red Wings in his first year with the franchise. In the 2005-2006 season, Datsyuk was awarded the &lt;a href="w%3ALady%20Byng%20Memorial%20Trophy"&gt;Lady Byng Memorial Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, for best sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with performance in play.

&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%20University%20Boat%20Club"&gt;Cambridge University&lt;/a&gt; have defeated &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20University%20Boat%20Club"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; by 1¼ lengths to win the 153rd &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Boat%20Race"&gt;Boat Race&lt;/a&gt;. The Light Blues won with a time of 17 minutes and 49 seconds to record their first win in three years. Oxford finished with a time of 18 minutes and 2 seconds.

Oxford won the toss and chose to row on the &lt;a href="w%3ASurrey"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt; side of the river, with Cambridge rowing on the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddlesex"&gt;Middlesex&lt;/a&gt; side. Oxford had the stronger start and were ahead for much of the first half of the race. They had a slight advantage over Cambridge at &lt;a href="w%3AHammersmith%20Bridge"&gt;Hammersmith Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, where they would be favoured by racing the inside of the upcoming bend. However Cambridge never lost touch and pulled ahead at &lt;a href="w%3AChiswick"&gt;Chiswick&lt;/a&gt; steps, maintaining their lead for the remainder of the race. 

Before the race, Cambridge were strong favourites, being 9lb heavier per man on average. The Cambridge crew had 5 returning blues compared to Oxford's one. Furthermore the international achievement of Cambridge's rowers far exceeded that of Oxford: the World Champion stern pair of Germans &lt;a href="w%3AThorsten%20Engelmann"&gt;Thorsten Engelmann&lt;/a&gt; (the heaviest ever oarsman at 110.8kg) and Sebastian Schulte, Olympic Gold medallist &lt;a href="w%3AKieran%20West"&gt;Kieran West&lt;/a&gt; MBE and GB medal winner Tom James. 

The heavily fancied Cambridge crew did not win by the margin expected by many, thanks in part to a strong row from Oxford, and 
the sagging stern containing the heaviest Cambridge oarsmen. 

Also of note, only a week before, Cambridge were victorious at the prestigious &lt;a href="w%3AHead%20of%20the%20River%20Race"&gt;Head of the River Race&lt;/a&gt; (raced on the same course, but from Mortlake to Putney). However the race was abandoned due to weather conditions with only 29 out of 420 crews finishing. 

The race, first held in 1829, is currently held on a 6,779 m (4 miles and 374 yards) stretch of the River Thames in London from 
&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Championship%20Course"&gt;Putney to Mortlake&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, Cambridge lead Oxford by 79 wins to 73 with one dead heat.

In the earlier race for reserve crews, Goldie (Cambridge) beat Isis (Oxford).

Racing for the women's and &lt;a href="w%3ALightweight%20rowing"&gt;lightweight&lt;/a&gt; crews took place at &lt;a href="w%3AHenley%20Boat%20Races"&gt;Henley&lt;/a&gt; on April 1st, where Cambridge won the Women's Boat Race and 
Oxford won the reserve women's, lightweight women's, lightweight men's and reserve lightweight men's races.

<h3>Company's spill turns Saguenay River into Red sea</h3>

The &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; based Canadian company &lt;a href="w%3AAlcan"&gt;Alcan&lt;/a&gt;'s aluminum production residue spilled into &lt;a href="w%3ASaguenay%20River"&gt;Saguenay River&lt;/a&gt; making several kilometres turn red. Company spokeswoman Renée Larouche said the incident is no danger to local citizens and aquatic life. &lt;a href="w%3ASaguenay%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Saguenay&lt;/a&gt; Mayor Jean Tremblay has requested for a meeting with officials about how they will cleanup the river. The Quebec Environment Ministry is currently investigating.

<h3>Wendy's plans to get 'younger customers' by changing menu</h3>

The Number 3 fast food chain &lt;a href="w%3AWendy%27s"&gt;Wendy's&lt;/a&gt; will make some revamps to its menu to attract a younger audience. The changes include more flavours to its frosty's, wider straws, and plastic bubble tops. They also will add a new breakfast menu and plan to have it added to half of their 6,700 stores by 2008. Wendy's last had a breakfast menu in the mid-1980s but was unsuccessful.

The former State Lunatic Hospital at Danvers better known as &lt;a href="w%3ADanvers%20State%20Hospital"&gt;Danvers State Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADanvers%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Danvers, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; suffered a major fire last night that could be seen for miles and led to temporary shut down of &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Route%201"&gt;US Route 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2095"&gt;Interstate 95&lt;/a&gt; in the area.

The infamous American former mental hospital has been closed since 1992 is the site of a new &lt;a href="w%3Acondominium"&gt;condominium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aapartment"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; buliding complex being developed by Avalon Bay Communities. Four apartment units and four utilities bulidings went in up in smoke in the four-alarm fire. The units were not occupied, however, two were nearing completion which is a major financial setback for Avalon Bay. The fire did not spread to the famous &lt;a href="w%3AKirkbride%20Plan"&gt;Kirkbride&lt;/a&gt; building though, which is being renovated into apartments, aside from a cupola due to radiant heat.

Calls started coming just before 2:00 am EDT Saturday morning to report a fire on the hospital's grounds which before the development sat unused, decaying and abandoned and became a popular target for ghost-hunters, vandals and urban explorers and also served as the focus of the 2001 thriller/horror film, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASession%209"&gt;Session 9&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ which brought renewed attention to infamous hospital which led to increased security at the site over the years. Reports of explosions before the fire started were noted by neighbors and residents.

About 20 residents on the other side of the 77-acre property were evacuated to Danvers High School as a precaution, they are expected to return later today. Their homes were not harmed by the fire, nor were any injuries reported from them. However, about seven firefighters suffered some minor burns from battling the fire, which took seven hours to bring under control. Firefighters will remain on the scene to make sure no hot spots flare up as the fire is still smoldering.

The cause of the fire is not yet known.

In a chilly Saturday afternoon game at &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Cellular%20Field"&gt;U.S. Cellular Field&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago, the air temperature hovering around freezing the entire game, the Minnesota bats were ice cold. White Sox pitching staff held the Minnesota Twins to only three hits. White Sox starter &lt;a href="w%3AJavier%20V%C3%A1zquez"&gt;Javier Vázquez&lt;/a&gt; pitched more than six innings and gave up only a single hit in the second. Twins starter &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Silva"&gt;Carlos Silva&lt;/a&gt; gave up what would end up being the winning run in the first.

&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Konerko"&gt;Paul Konerko&lt;/a&gt; picked up an RBI in the first inning on a single to the outfield that scored &lt;a href="w%3ADarin%20Erstad"&gt;Darin Erstad&lt;/a&gt;, putting Chicago ahead by one. &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Uribe"&gt;Juan Uribe&lt;/a&gt; would extend the lead with a solo home run in the eighth before an attempted pickoff throw failed and the ball trickled to the outfield, allowing &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Podsednik"&gt;Scott Podsednik&lt;/a&gt; to score from second base.

Friday evening's series opener between the AL-Central Division rivals was postponed due to the inclement cold weather, and has not yet been rescheduled. The White Sox, now 2-2, and Twins, now 3-1, will finish their series with an Easter Sunday matinée game. Highs tomorrow in Chicago are forecasted to be slightly warmer in the upper-30s.

Three players for the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Minnesota"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Golden%20Gophers%20football"&gt;Golden Gophers football team&lt;/a&gt; have been arrested following a rape allegation. The three players have been identified as defensive end Alex Daniels, cornerback Keith Massey, and running back E.J. Jones, all sophomores. They are in custody at the Hennepin County Jail pending charges. Bail has been set at $100,000 for each player.

The three are accused of raping an 18-year old woman at the University Village Apartments, where the accused players live. "Overnight one of the University Officers was flagged down by a young woman who wanted to make a report that she'd been sexually assaulted," said University Police Chief Greg Hestness. Hestness did not disclose further details of the allegations, though he stated the players "were booked on criminal sexual conduct in the third degree. And that usually does involve penetration, non-consensual penetration." Once an investigation is complete, the case will be presented to the Hennepin County attorney for possible charges.

Following Saturday's spring scrimmage at the &lt;a href="w%3AHubert%20H.%20Humphrey%20Metrodome"&gt;Metrodome&lt;/a&gt;, new coach &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Brewster"&gt;Tim Brewster&lt;/a&gt; said "Obviously it's a disappointing situation that's been presented to me. There's an investigation that's ongoing that we're going to cooperate fully with." The players have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation, and did not participate in the annual intrasquad game.

Gophers athletic director Joel Maturi said "We will let the process take its course and then do the appropriate thing. But I'm not ready to abandon these kids. It's our responsibility to stand by them and their families."

U.S. warplanes bombed suspected Iraqi insurgents in the Iraqi city of Diwaniya on Saturday. The reports from the United States military stated that the insurgents were armed with rocket propelled grenades and were a danger to their forces in the southern city of Diwaniya, 110 miles (177 kilometres) south of Baghdad.

The United States military said that residents in the predominantly Shi'ite city tipped them off to the arrival of insurgents carrying rocket propelled grenades in the area. "The troops made positive identification of the militiamen and called for the air strike," a military statement said.

A U.S. military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Scott Bleichwehl, said:

In a statement the Iraqi police informed The Associated Press that one civilian was killed and five seriously injured when a U.S. tank fired upon a house in Diwaniya. The air strike was a part of a military program on insurgents located in the city of Diwaniya, which is widely known to be the home of Shi'ite insurgents. It is spearheaded by the new Iraqi army and is supported by soldiers and paratroopers within the coalition.

U.S. troops and Iraqi soldiers stormed the city before dawn on Friday the 6th of April, killing three insurgents and capturing 27 people, the U.S. military said. Code named Operation Black Eagle, the operation is targeting insurgents loyal to anti-American Shi'ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.

Among the discoveries and captures the assault force in Diwaniya came upon a site where powerful explosives were being assembled.

A spokesman for al-Sadr stated that on Saturday militia fighters in Diwaniya had destroyed three American vehicles and captured a robot used to detonate roadside bombs.

It was the second consecutive 50-goal season for the talented winger. Heatley also picked up two assists in the game at &lt;a href="w%3ATD%20Banknorth%20Garden"&gt;TD Banknorth Garden&lt;/a&gt; in Boston.

Heatley's goal came at 5:15 of the second period and gave the Senators the go-ahead, breaking a 2-2 tie. &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Spezza"&gt;Jason Spezza&lt;/a&gt; scored twice and &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Alfredsson"&gt;Daniel Alfredsson&lt;/a&gt; had a three-point night. &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt; made 29 saves for the Senators.

The captain and five of his crew on &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Diamond"&gt;Sea Diamond&lt;/a&gt; have been charged following the cruise ship's collision with a known and well-charted reef. The charges laid against the captain were "causing a shipwreck through negligence". Additional charges of breaching shipping safety regulations and pollution were laid against the captain. All six accused were released shortly after questioning and their full testimony will be taken in the following weeks.

At the time of the crash the ship had been a few kilometers away from the dock under the spectacular cliffs that make Santorini one of Greece's top tourist destinations. At the time of the collision the Sea Diamond was carrying more than 1,500 people, 1,154 passengers and 391 crew members.

The damaged vessel was quickly evacuated in a 3 hour operation, but it failed to find Jean-Christophe Allain, 45, and his 16 year old daughter, Maud, both from the Doué-la-Fontaine state in western France.

A 3 day search and rescue has failed to find them with officials stating that a robot submarine would investigate the wreck, which is lying under 330 feet (100 meters) of water, within the following weeks. The panicked evacuation soon brought to the fore memories of the September 2000 Express Samina ferry shipwreck of the island of Paros, killing 80 people. 

The spokesman for the Cyprus based operator, Louis Cruise lines, read out a statement saying that the company was working closely with Greek investigators. 
The Sea Diamond, a 21 year old vessel sank at the end of a four day cruise, which included visits to Rhodes, Patios, Crete and Mykonos islands. Officials at the Greek Tourism board went into damage control to lessen the impact on its industry which accounts for 18 percent of its &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"&gt;GDP (Gross Domestic Product).&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AMcLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; drivers &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; placed first and second in the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula%20One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APetronas"&gt;Petronas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Malaysian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ASepang%20International%20Circuit"&gt;Sepang International Circuit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKuala%20Lumpur"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;.

From the start to the end of the race, the two "silver arrows" held the lead against their competitors from &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;. Alonso created a comfortable gap, while Hamilton held off &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt;. Massa pushed very hard on the rookie, who was driving in only his second race, trying to overtake him, but made a crucial mistake before the first pit-stop and found himself off the track. Massa finally finished fifth, behind &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt; team driver. Räikkönen showed much more careful driving than Massa, finishing third.

&lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt;, driving for &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;, came sixth,
with his young teammate &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; eighth. &lt;a href="w%3AJarno%20Trulli"&gt;Jarno Trulli&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="w%3AToyota%20F1"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;, split the two Renaults in seventh.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Wurz"&gt;Alexander Wurz&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamsF1"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt;-Toyota, finished ninth, while his teammate, &lt;a href="w%3ANico%20Rosberg"&gt;Nico Rosberg&lt;/a&gt;, who had been driving in sixth place, retired following the second round of &lt;a href="w%3Apit%20stop"&gt;pit stops&lt;/a&gt; due to engine failure.

&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Webber"&gt;Mark Webber&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt;-Renault, completed the top ten, making his first finish in the Malaysian Grand Prix, following retirements in his 5 previous seasons.

An Afghan interpreter, Ajmal Naqshbandi, kidnapped and held since March 5 by the &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, was reported killed Sunday, according to a spokesman for the group.

Naqshbandi was taken hostage in &lt;a href="Helmand%20Province"&gt;Helmand Province&lt;/a&gt;, along with Italian reporter &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaniele%20Mastrogiacomo"&gt;Daniele Mastrogiacomo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and their driver, Syed Agha. Mastrogiacomo was freed March 20 in a controversial hostage exchange, while Agha was killed by the Taliban early in his captivity.

The exchange of ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Repubblica"&gt;La Repubblica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reporter Mastrogiacomo for five Taliban prisoners was criticized, by security experts, as a precedent that could encourage further kidnappings. It was thought originally that Naqshbandi was also released as part of the exchange deal, but was later revealed by the Taliban that he was not released.

Mastrogiacomo and his editor at La Repubblica, Ezio Mauro, had made several appeals to the Afghan government to do what it could to secure the release of Naqshbandi. "This has already cost the life of Sayed Agha...we ask President Karzai to do all he considers just and possible to save [Naqshbandi's] life," said Mastrogiacomo and Mauro in their latest appeal.

The Taliban are holding two &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; aid workers and three Afghan colleagues, kidnapped last week in &lt;a href="Nimroz%20Province"&gt;Nimroz Province&lt;/a&gt;, and are threatening to decide their fate next week. Ransom demands or deadlines have not yet been reported.

Afghan president &lt;a href="Hamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, has ruled out any further exchange deals with the Taliban. 

A BBC correspondent in Afghanistan reported that there was outrage in Afghanistan over the exchange deal that saw the safe release of Mastrogiacomo. Afghans were incensed that the government not only gave in to Taliban demands, but would do so to save a foreigner and not an Afghan.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Foreign%20Minister"&gt;Indian external affairs minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APranab%20Mukherjee"&gt;Pranab Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been taken to a Delhi Army Hospital after being injured in a car mishap in &lt;a href="West%20Bengal"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;. His condition is said to be stable. He has received injuries on the head and other body parts. 

In statement, he said he would be back at work soon: "I am well but doctors have advised me 48 hours rest. I hope to be back to work after that period," the Press Trust of India reported. 

Mukherjee is one of the senior most politicians in the ruling &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20National%20Congress"&gt;Congress Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and is close to party supremo &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASonia%20Gandhi"&gt;Sonia Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In a cabinet reshuffle in October last year, Mukherjee had been given the high profile post of India's foreign minister which was lying vacant after the resignation of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANatwar%20Singh"&gt;Natwar Singh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Until then he had been the minister for defence. 

In view of this accident Mukherjee's two day visit to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where he was expected to call upon the Saudi king has been cancelled.

Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; received Mukherjee at the airport when he was brought back from West Bengal.
