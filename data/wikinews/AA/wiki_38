Invited to participate in a debate at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during his visit to &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; this week to address the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; engaged University president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Bollinger"&gt;Lee Bollinger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on a number of topics, including his country's human rights record, opinions on Israel and the Holocaust and the role of nuclear weapons and terrorism on the global stage. The Iranian president's speech was marked by protests, but also drew applause from students.

Bollinger opened the debate addressing critics, stating that "To those who believe that this event should never have happened, that it is inappropriate for the university to conduct such an event, I want to say that I understand your perspective and respect it as reasonable...it is an experiment, as all life is an experiment. This is the right thing to do and indeed, it is required by the existing norms of free speech"

Bollinger then gave his opening address, turning to Ahmadinejad and stating:

After reciting the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABismillah"&gt;Bismillah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and asking for guidance from God, Ahmadinejad countered that "In Iran, tradition requires that when we invite a person to be a speaker, we actually respect our students and the professors by allowing them to make their own judgment and we don’t think it’s necessary before the speech is even given to come in with a series of claims..." 

Ahmadinejad's most pointed arguments, though, were directed at the administration of George W. Bush. "They do not respect the privacy of their own people. They tap telephone calls … They create an insecure psychological atmosphere, in order to justify their war-mongering acts in different parts of the world." 

The Iranian president attacked what he considered to be errors of American imperialism. "By using precise scientific methods and planning, they begin their onslaught on the domestic cultures of nations, which are the result of thousands of years of interaction, creativity and artistic activity. They try to eliminate these cultures in order to strip people of their identity."

Ahmadinejad questioned U.S. nuclear policy. "Making nuclear, chemical and biological bombs and weapons of mass destruction is yet another result of the misuse of science and research by the big powers." He added, "Without the cooperation of certain scientists and scholars, we would not have witnessed production of different nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Are these weapons to protect global security? What can a perpetual nuclear umbrella achieve for the sake of humanity? If nuclear war is waged between nuclear powers, what human catastrophe will take place?"

In a rebuttal to claims that his country oppressed women and homosexuals, Ahmadinejad responded by claiming "It is wrong for some governments, when they disagree with another government, to...spread lies", pointing to the fact that over 50% of Iranian voters are female, and the two female Vice Presidents. When challenged by Bollinger for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALGBT%20rights%20in%20Iran"&gt;Iran's treatment of gays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; he stated that "In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country," drawing laughter from the audience. "In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it." 

He framed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AControversies%20surrounding%20Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad%23Denial%20of%20the%20Holocaust"&gt;questioning of the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as stifled academic debate: "Right now, there are a number of European academics who have been sent to prison because they attempted to write about the Holocaust or research it from a different perspective, questioning certain aspects of it," later adding that "you shouldn't ask me why I'm asking questions, you should ask yourselves why you...want to stop. Do you ever take what is known as absolute in physics? We had principles in mathematics that were granted to be absolute for over 800 years, but new science has...gone forward."

The first question from the audience addressed the controversial issue of the leader's position on Israel. Ahmadinejad did not directly respond to the subject of Israel - stating "We love all nations. We love the Jewish people. There are many Jews living in Iran, with peace and security.", and concluded that it was not a question of Israel's right to exist, but of Palestinian self-determination. 

Countering claims that his country supports terrorism, he replied, "We’re a cultured nation. We don’t need to resort to terrorism. We’ve been victims of terrorism ourselves. It’s regrettable that people who argued they are fighting terrorism — instead of supporting the Iranian nation — are supporting the terrorists and then turn the finger at us."

The final question from the audience asked whether Iran would engage in talks with the United States, to which he replied "If the U.S. government recognizes the rights of the Iranian people, respects all nations and extends a hand of friendship to all Iranians, they will see that Iranians will be among their best friends."

In closing, Ahmadinejad extended gratitude and thanks to the University, and welcomed both students and faculty to attend Iranian universities and give lectures themselves to the students.

73,000 &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Auto%20Workers"&gt;United Auto Workers&lt;/a&gt; (UAW) union members launched a nationwide strike today against &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; (GM), the largest auto manufacturer in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

UAW President &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Gettelfinger"&gt;Ron Gettelfinger&lt;/a&gt; said GM would need to meet pay, health care, and job security issues. Gettelfinge said, "This is nothing we wanted...No one benefits in a strike. But there comes a point where someone can push you off a cliff. That's what happened here."

The strike was officially launched at 11 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;) today.

Negotiations were reportedly going to occur again this afternoon, but there have been no reports of any negotiating going on from either side.

80 facilities in 30 different states closed today because of the strike.

&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reports that GM facilities in &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; may close soon, too. 

The vice president of global vehicle forecasts for CSM Worldwide, Michael Robinet, said today that dealerships in the US likely won't feel the effects of the strike for several weeks.

A statement from GM today said, "We are disappointed in the UAW's decision to call a national strike. The bargaining involved complex, difficult issues that affect the job security of our U.S. work force, and the long-term viability of the company. We are fully committed to working with the UAW to develop solutions together to address the competitive challenges facing General Motors. We will continue focusing our efforts on reaching an agreement as soon as possible." 

If the strike continues, UAW strike funds will supply each striker with &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;200 a month and medical coverage.

18-year-old, Loyer D. Braden, who is being accused of shooting two &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware%20State%20University"&gt;Delaware State University&lt;/a&gt; students was arrested today by police.

Braden has been charged with a gun charge, assault and reckless endangerment and attempted murder in connection with the &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware%20State%20University%20shooting"&gt;shooting of two students&lt;/a&gt; on September 21, 2007, in &lt;a href="w%3ADover%2C%20Delaware"&gt;Dover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Delaware"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Braden is currently being held on &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;60,000 secure bond and was ordered to stay away from the victims and the University if bail is granted.

Nathaniel Pugh III and Shalita Middleton, both 17-year-old students at the University, were injured by the attack on Friday. Pugh was shot in the ankle, while Middelton was shot twice in the abdomen.

Court documents also say that Braden fired at a third student, James Richmond.

Braden responded to questions by the media by saying "I'm sorry." And, when asked what exactly he was sorry for, he replied, "She's in the hospital."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires%2C%20Argentina"&gt;Buenos Aires, Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — With more than twenty-eight teams from across the world, the 10 Gay World Cup begins in the city of Buenos Aires. These events are held in part to aid in the fight against &lt;a href="w%3ASexism"&gt;sexual discrimination&lt;/a&gt;.

This year marks the first time the World Gay Cup will be held in a Latin-American city. Twenty-eight teams will participate, and some countries will be represented by more than one team.

Some of the countries that will participate in this championship are &lt;a href="Uruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, represented by the Dogos, the Amerika team and SAFG. Also, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is one of the countries that will be represented by more than one team. A few of the American teams are: Boston Americas, New York Ramblers, Seattle Rain, Florida Storm and Philadelphia Falcons.

The World Cup that began yesterday, is being held in the ♡❤Parque Sarmiento♡❤ (Sarmiento Park), located in the Saavedra neighbourhood and has the support of the AFA (&lt;a href="w%3AAsociaci%C3%B3n%20del%20F%C3%BAtbol%20Argentino"&gt;Argentine Football Association&lt;/a&gt;), the secretary of sports of Buenos Aires, the &lt;a href="w%3AOmbudsman"&gt;Ombudswoman of the city&lt;/a&gt; and the INADI (National Institute Against the Discrimination). The championship will last until next September 29.

In an interview with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, the president of the Homosexual Community Argentina (CHA) César Cigliuti expressed that this is an opportunity to show the fight against discrimination, for example in an area like football, where sexual discrimination occurs each day in the fields of the Argentina, Cigliuti said. The final will be played in the &lt;a href="w%3ADefensores%20de%20Belgrano"&gt;Defensores de Belgrano&lt;/a&gt;'s field.

Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has announced a national "Clean Energy Target". The target requires that by 2020, 30,000 gigawatt hours of electricity each year comes from low emissions sources. The plan is an attempt to consolidate the different state-based targets. 

"What this initiative will do is gather up all of the different state schemes, many of which are contradictory or at the very least dissimilar," Mr Howard said.

The announcement was criticised by Labor environment spokesman &lt;a href="Peter%20Garrett"&gt;Peter Garrett&lt;/a&gt;. "This is just piggybacking on the hard work of state Labor governments," Mr Garrett said. "The Howard Government has an appalling record on renewable energy and cannot be trusted to deliver on this commitment. 

The Greens pointed out that the target did not take account of an increase in demand. “Under the Prime Minister’s target, greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector will blow out to be 44% higher than the present day, because this feeble addition of low emission technology won’t be able to keep pace with growth in electricity demand," said Greens Senate candidate Scott Ludlam.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; today announced medical research grants totalling AU$560 million. The grants are the result of the Australian Government's 2008 National Health and Medical Research grants. According to a government media release, the grants will fund research into &lt;a href="w%3Aheart%20disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aobesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, child health, &lt;a href="w%3Adepression"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and chronic diseases such as &lt;a href="w%3Adiabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aasthma"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;.

Howard said that the grants were possible because of the good state of the &lt;a href="economy"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt;. "It's an extraordinary human dividend out of good economic times," he said. "You couldn't do it if you were paying off debt. The fact that we're not paying off debt [means] we've got $8-9 billion a year in saved interest that we can spend on good things like medical research."

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Federal Government today announced an additional AU$714 million in aid to farmers affected by the drought. Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; announced $430 million on September 17, bringing the total aid to over $1 billion. 

Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile has said that the farming sector is important to the Australian economy. "There's about 130,000 farming units across Australia that contribute over $100 billion into our GDP - up to about 18-20 per cent of our exports in a good year," he said. "We cannot afford as a nation to lose our agricultural industries."

Opposition primary industries spokesman &lt;a href="Kerry%20O%27Brien"&gt;Kerry O'Brien&lt;/a&gt; has stated that if elected Labor will honour drought assistance measures put in place by the present government. "But I have given the assurance wherever I have gone that we don't see the midst of a drought as a time to undo settings in relation to Exceptional Circumstances funding, so the horticultural community can be assured they can rely on settings in place for this drought," he said.

On Monday, a 24-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt; Reservist became the 71 &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces"&gt;Canadian soldier&lt;/a&gt; killed in Afghanistan.

Four others were injured in the incident, which killed Corporal Nathan Hornburg, who was operating as part of Operation Sadiq Sarbaaz, a joint Afghan-&lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; mission designed to "set the conditions for a continuous security presence and the establishment of a new police sub-station in the northern part of (&lt;a href="w%3APanjwaye%20District"&gt;Panjwaii&lt;/a&gt;)." 

Media reports indicated he died from mortar fire at around 16:30 local time while he was repairing the track on a Canadian &lt;a href="w%3ALeopard%20tank"&gt;Leopard tank&lt;/a&gt; near a cluster of villages known as Zangabad. Brigadier-General Guy Laroche stated "The terrain was very rough and (tank treads falling off) is something we see on a regular basis."

One of the soldiers was injured in the mortar attack, while three others were hurt in a nearby armoured vehicle by a rocket propelled grenade during the ensuing firefight. The injured have not been identified, but a military official says two are part of the Royal 22nd Regiment based in &lt;a href="w%3ACFB%20Valcartier"&gt;Valcartier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, and one is from &lt;a href="w%3ACFB%20Petawawa"&gt;Canadian Forces Base Petawawa&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3APembroke%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Pembroke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. The injured were evacuated to a hospital at &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar%20International%20Airport"&gt;Kandahar Air Field&lt;/a&gt;, where their injuries are described as non-life threatening.

Corporal Hornburg was a member of the King's Own Calgary Regiment, a Reserve armoured unit based in Calgary, Alberta, and was serving with the Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) while in Afghanistan.

Billy Murrell, a persistent graffiti vandal from South East London, has become the first recipient of an &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Social%20Behaviour%20Order"&gt;Anti-Social Behaviour Order&lt;/a&gt; (Asbo) granted to &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20for%20London"&gt;Transport for London&lt;/a&gt; (TfL) by Greenwich Magistrates. The civil order also bans him from the top deck of buses throughout England and Wales for three years.

Murrell, a 17-year-old from Plumstead, has a history of convictions for criminal damage on public transport, including vandalising a Tube carriage in Brixton station and for damaging buses and other public property using marker pens.

This is Transport for London's first Anti-Social Behaviour Order against a graffiti vandal &amp;mdash; TfL was granted the power to apply for Asbos by the &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt; in September 2006.

The Anti-Social Behaviour Order was issued at Greenwich Magistrates Court on 12 September and also bans him from carrying any permanent marker pens or any glass cutting equipment on London Underground, railway property or any other transport provider's property.

&lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Transport%20Police"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt; police have been made aware of Murrell's Asbo, and have distributed his photo.

Superior Court Judge Neil Shuster ruled that a &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; ballot proposal to fund &lt;a href="w%3Astem%20cell"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; research would stay on the November 6 ballot. Under the proposal, previously approved by the state Senate and Assembly and signed by the governor &lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Corzine"&gt;Jon Corzine&lt;/a&gt;, New Jersey would borrow US$450 million over a ten-year period to be used to fund stem cell research. Shuster's ruling was in response to a suit by the &lt;a href="w%3Apro-life"&gt;pro-life&lt;/a&gt; Legal Center for the Defense of Life on behalf of 15 New Jersey residents and the anti-abortion group New Jersey Right to Life.

The suit asked for an injunction to keep the proposal off the ballot, arguing that the ballot measure was deceptive since it did not reveal that the funding might go to &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20cloning"&gt;human cloning&lt;/a&gt; and that property taxes might be raised as a means of paying off the debt. Proponents of the measure argued that the bill would not in fact allow cloning and that allowing the use of property tax to pay off debt was standard for similar ballot measures. 

Shuster ruled that the plaintiffs had waited too long to file their case and that they did not made a convincing enough claim of imminent harm to justify the unusual and disruptive measure of removing an item from the ballot. An injunction now would create complications to military personnel who vote by mail as well as civilians who use absentee ballots. 

Stem cell research has been a &lt;a href="w%3AStem%20cell%20controversy"&gt;controversial topic&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, where it is wrapped up in the &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion%20debate"&gt;abortion debate&lt;/a&gt;. Opponents, principally religious groups, have condemned such research when it would use embryonic stem cells which they view as endorsement of abortion. Since many of them view abortion as murder, the use of embryonic stem cells is in their eyes tantamount to murdering people for scientific research. Also, some have expressed concern that the research is a slippery slope to &lt;a href="w%3Areproductive%20cloning"&gt;reproductive cloning&lt;/a&gt;. In response to funding restrictions on federal money to stem cell research and an earlier &lt;a href="Bush%20uses%20his%20first%20veto%20ever%20on%20stem%20cell%20bill"&gt;veto by President Bush of a federal bill for stem cell research&lt;/a&gt; a number of states such as New Jersey and &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; have adopted measures to fund stem cell research, which proponents argue could be useful for curing a variety of diseases, including &lt;a href="w%3AAlzeimer%27s"&gt;Alzeimer's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParkinson%27s"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adiabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Tancredo"&gt;Tom Tancredo&lt;/a&gt; has been a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; since 1999, representing the 6th Congressional District of &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. He rose to national prominence for his strong stance against illegal immigration and his announcement that he was a Republican candidate in the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Presidential%20election"&gt;2008 Presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. recently spoke with the Congressman and posed questions from Wikipedia editors and Wikinews reporters:

♡❤♡DS: Throughout my life my father, a lifelong Republican and an avid listener of &lt;a href="w%3ARush%20Limbaugh"&gt;Rush Limbaugh&lt;/a&gt;, told me that all we needed in this country was a Republican Congress, Republican Senate and a Republican White House to get this country on the right track. Last year he expressed his disappointment to me. So many Republicans, like my father, feel lied to or let down by the party. The rationale for the Iraq War, the sex and bribery scandals, the pork barrel projects, and, as &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Greenspan"&gt;Alan Greenspan&lt;/a&gt; recently pointed out, the fiscal irresponsibility. People feel there have been many broken promises. Why should someone vote Republican today?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: You yourself said you would only serve three terms in Congress, but then broke that promise. What caused you to reverse yourself?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: There are an estimated 12 million illegal aliens in the U.S. To round up and deport millions of people would be a major government undertaking, requiring massive federal spending and invasive enforcement. What level of funding would be necessary for &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Department%20for%20Immigration%20and%20Customs"&gt;U.S. Immigration and Customs&lt;/a&gt; to achieve the level of enforcement that you'd like to see?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: How long would full enforcement take for you to succeed?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Can you explain your remarks about bombing the Islamic holy sites of &lt;a href="w%3AMecca"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMedina"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt; as a deterrent to terrorists operating against the United States.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: But wouldn’t an attack on &lt;a href="w%3AMecca"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMedina"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt; be an attack on a sovereign state?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Aside from becoming President, if you could be granted three wishes, what would they be?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Farmers rely heavily on seasonal manual labor. Strict enforcement of immigration laws will inevitably reduce the pool of migrant labor and thus increase costs. Do you support tariffs or other government intervention to keep American farm products competitive?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Do you agree that our forefathers intended birthright citizenship? ♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: You and &lt;a href="w%3AKarl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt; engaged, in your words, in a screaming match over immigration, and Rove said that you would never again "darken the doorstep of the White House." Are you still considered ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Apersona%20non%20grata"&gt;persona non grata&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ at the White House?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Psychologist &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Hare%20%28psychologist%29"&gt;Robert Hare&lt;/a&gt; has discussed in his work the use of &lt;a href="w%3Adoublespeak"&gt;doublespeak&lt;/a&gt; as a hallmark of psychopaths, and social scientists have pointed out that the use of doublespeak is most prevalent in the fields of law and politics. Do these two trends alarm you?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: What is the proper &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20Powers%20Clause"&gt;role of Congress&lt;/a&gt; in the time of war?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Politics is dominated by lawyers. What other group of people or professions would you prefer to see dominate the field of politics and why?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Do you think lawyers are better for handling legislation and as politicians? ♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: You have supported proposed constitutional amendments that would ban &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;. You are also a strong supporter of the &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Second Amendment&lt;/a&gt;. Why do you believe that the U.S. Constitution should regulate medical procedures and personal relationships, but not gun ownership?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: You recently spoke out against the Black and Hispanic Congressional caucuses, stating, "It is utterly hypocritical for Congress to extol the virtues of a color-blind society while officially sanctioning caucuses that are based solely on race. If we are serious about achieving the goal of a colorblind society, Congress should lead by example and end these divisive, race-based caucuses." Do you also believe there is no longer a need for the NAACP?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: You were one of a handful of Republicans who voted for a bill proposed by Maurice Hinchey and Dana Rohrabacher to stop the Department of Justice from raiding medical marijuana patients and caregivers in states where medical marijuana is legal, citing states' rights concerns. On the other hand, you have suggested state legislators and mayors should be imprisoned for passing laws contrary to federal immigration law, and you support the Federal Marriage Amendment to ban gay marriage nationally. How do you reconcile these seemingly contradictory positions?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: If you had to support one of the Democratic candidates, which one would it be and why?♡❤♡

<h3>Canadian UAW workers forced to strike</h3>

Canadian workers with the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Auto%20Workers%20Union"&gt;Canadian Auto Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; have gone on strike due to 70,000 American employees of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Auto%20Workers%20Union"&gt;United Auto Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (UAW) forced to strike against &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; (GM), just one day ago.

GM Canada's Windsor, Ontario plant, which employs 1,400 people shut down on Monday. On Tuesday Car Plant 1 in Oshawa, Ontario, which employs 3,000, closed at 3:00am ET. Car Plant 2, also in Oshawa, which employs 2,500 workers, could make a speedy close today or tomorrow. Other GM car plants in Ontario are also feared to close during the strike.

If the strike in the U.S. stays, up to 100,000 Canadian UAW workers could be laid off, according to &lt;a href="w%3ABuzz%20Hargrove"&gt;Buzz Hargrove&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union. Eighty-thousand Canadians work for the auto-parts industry in Canada, and 40,000 could be laid off, Hargrove also says.

According to the ♡❤BBC♡❤, analysts say the strike will only last for two weeks. The UAW last called a national strike on GM 30 years ago.

<h3>UK researchers publish new survey on sleep</h3>

Findings on a new "sleep survey" seem to be mixed as a sleep analysis of 10,308 government workers over seventeen years was recently made public. The study was conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Warwick"&gt;University of Warwick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20College%20London"&gt;University College London&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

The participants were aged 35-55. Researchers examined the participants' sleeping habits between the years of 1995 to 1998, and 1992 to 1993, and mortality rates until 2004. It also compared the social lives of the participants to sleeping habits.

The study shows that, if a person cuts their sleep from seven hours to five hours they ultimately risk an increase of death and death from cardiovascular problems. But sleeping more than eight hours doubles the risk of death, and death would be triggered from non-cardiovascular diseases. Sleeping less than five hours per night increases a risk of weight gain, &lt;a href="w%3AType%202%20diabetes"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and other diseases, which could end up in leading to death.

"A third of the population of the UK and over 40 percent in the U.S. regularly sleep less than five hours a night, so it is not a trivial problem," said Francesco Cappuccio, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Warwick. "The current pressures in society to cut out sleep, in order to squeeze in more, may not be a good idea -- particularly if you go below five hours."

"This change, largely the result of sleep curtailment to create more time for leisure and shift-work, has meant that reports of fatigue, tiredness and excessive daytime sleepiness are more common than a few decades ago. Sleep represents the daily process of physiological restitution and recovery, and lack of sleep has far-reaching effects," he said on the university's website.

"In terms of prevention, our findings indicate that consistently sleeping around seven hours per night is optimal for health," Cappuccio added.

The new findings have been published on medical journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASLEEP"&gt;SLEEP&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡s website. It will officially be published in the magazines next issue.

All airline traffic within 250 miles of &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston, Texas&lt;/a&gt; was suspended today by the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FAA) because of an equipment failure at the control center at &lt;a href="w%3AMemphis%20International%20Airport"&gt;Memphis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.

Numerous flights from all around the country had to be grounded today because of the problem. It is not known exactly how many flights were affected.

FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said air traffic control centers from neighboring regions handled flights that were in the air when the problem was discovered around 12:30 p.m. EDT. "The airspace was completely cleared by 1:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;Eastern time&lt;/a&gt;," Bergen said.

Bergen also said, "What we did is put a ground stop in place for any flight that would transition through that airspace. We held them on the ground wherever they were, whether it was Miami, Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston."

An airport spokesman said the problem was fixed at Memphis International Airport and scheduled flights have resumed.

The &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; campus in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; City erupted today in protest over President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;'s debate with Columbia President &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Bollinger"&gt;Lee Bollinger&lt;/a&gt;. Ahmadinejad's presence on one of the United States' most prestigious universities brought out protesters from many causes to make their opinions known: whether Ahmadinejad should speak or not, the war in Iraq, Israel,&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Imperialism"&gt;American imperialism&lt;/a&gt;', &lt;a href="w%3AGod"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; and morality, all of which created a powder keg of opinions which made the air feel as if at any moment it would explode into fisticuffs. 

Ahmadinejad has been widely criticized for his &lt;a href="w%3AAntisemitism"&gt;anti-semitic&lt;/a&gt; remarks and as a &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust%20denial"&gt;holocaust denier&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s support for terrorism. He also believes that &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt; was an “inside job”, involving Israel's &lt;a href="w%3AMossad"&gt;Mossad&lt;/a&gt; or American ‘intelligence and security services.’ 9/11 family members have been loudly critical of Ahmadinejad, since last week when he requested a visit to &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center%20site"&gt;Ground Zero&lt;/a&gt; to lay a wreath -- what has been widely viewed as a photo op.

The New York tabloid press splashed their covers with antagonizing headlines. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Daily%20News"&gt;Daily News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ ran the headline "The evil has landed" and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Post"&gt;The New York Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ labeled Ahmadinejad the "Madman Iran Prez". Since New York hosts the headquarters of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, whose charter requires that all member nations have access to the governing body, delegations of governments identified as enemies of the United States --North Korea, Cuba, Iran-- live and work in the city. At times, their governments come to address the governing body, as the Iranian President did on Monday. 

Ahmadinejad's presence tore apart the usually close-knit community of students and academics that inhabit Columbia's enclave in &lt;a href="w%3AMorningside%20Heights"&gt;Morningside Heights&lt;/a&gt;. "A high-quality academic discussion depends on intellectual honesty," wrote &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20Law%20School"&gt;Columbia Law&lt;/a&gt; Dean &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Schizer"&gt;David M. Schizer&lt;/a&gt;, "but, unfortunately, Mr. Ahmadinejad has proven himself, time and again, to be uninterested in whether his words are true. Therefore, my personal opinion is that he should not be invited to speak." The Columbia Conservative Alumni Association said "the university is extending not a courtesy, but continuing a policy of anti-Israeli and anti-American leftist nihilism under the guise of academic freedom." 

Richard Bulliet, an Iranian expert at Columbia who was instrumental in arranging the visit, defended the notion that it is imperative to listen to one's enemies. "If there is any likelihood of war between the U.S. and Iran, it is important for Americans to have some access to the direct words of the president of the other country. At least they are getting Ahmadinejad's views directly from him and not a reporter who has an ax to grind."

Sunsara Taylor, a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Revolutionary Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; and a student, had a mixed view. Although in theory Taylor did not have an issue with the Iranian President's presence on campus, she had a problem with "The event without any intervention or debate from the students...is reinforcing a bad dynamic where people feel they need to choose between Islamic Fundamentalism and U.S. Imperialism. I think it's fine for him to speak, but I think it's a responsibility of people in this country not to be bamboozled into going along with a war against a country's people just because that country's leader is a reactionary."

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; have attacked the governments green energy targets. Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; announced the national targets yesterday, requiring that by 2020, 30,000 gigawatt hours of electricity each year comes from low emissions sources. The Greens claim that the targets do not go far enough. “John Howard’s 15% ‘clean’ target by 2020 is too little, too late,” said Greens Senate candidate for &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASarah%20Hanson-Young"&gt;Sarah Hanson-Young&lt;/a&gt;.

The Greens also claim that the inclusion of clean coal technology in the definition of "green energy" is misleading. “Howard’s spin doctors have been at it again. The target is misleading – it includes the unproven ‘clean coal’ technology, so the proportion of genuine clean, renewable energy generated is far less than we are led to believe," Ms Hanson-Young said.

The clean energy target is part of the government's &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;3.5 billion climate change strategy.

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Minister for Foreign Affairs, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;, has announced that the Australian government is following events in &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Burma) closely, and urged the Myanmar government to show restraint. He also called for the respect of "the legitimate right of Burmese citizens to peaceful protest."

The Minister also called for the release of political prisoners. "The continued detention of &lt;a href="w%3ADaw%20Aung%20San%20Suu%20Kyi"&gt;Daw Aung San Suu Kyi&lt;/a&gt; and over one thousand political prisoners is unacceptable. I repeat calls for the Burmese regime to release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners immediately and unconditionally," he said in a media release. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; criticised the Australian government, accusing them of hypocrisy over the issue of Myanmar. "Alexander Downer's fear that the military will subject the pro-democracy protest leaders to 'very harsh treatment' is in absurd contrast with the Howard government’s twin policies of training the Burmese military and keeping open unrestricted trade," he said in a media release.

&lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; police have beaten up to 700 protesters with batons, according to witnesses. The crowd was gathered near a pagoda in &lt;a href="w%3ARangoon"&gt;Rangoon&lt;/a&gt;, and included students and &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhism"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; monks. AFP reported that only monks were allowed to enter the pagoda, and Reuters has quoted witnesses as saying that tear gas was used to disperse the monks. 

Some monks were taken away by police in trucks. This is the first time that Myanmar security forces have used violence against the protests, which are now in their ninth day. 

Myanmar authorities have imposed a curfew from dusk until dawn, and have also banned public gatherings of more than five people. Troops and riot police have begun taking positions near monasteries, opposition party headquarters, and the house of pro-democracy activist &lt;a href="w%3AAung%20San%20Suu%20Kyi"&gt;Aung San Suu Kyi&lt;/a&gt;. 

Comedian &lt;a href="w%3AZaganar"&gt;Zaganar&lt;/a&gt; was arrested at his home overnight. He has previously spoken publicly in support of the protests. 

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Minister for Foreign Affairs, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;, announced earlier today that the Australian government is following events in Myanmar closely, and urged the Myanmar government to show restraint.

Up to 20,000 people have protested against the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n governments industrial relations legislation (&lt;a href="WorkChoices"&gt;WorkChoices&lt;/a&gt; in central Melbourne today. Protestors, including children wearing hardhats and holding anti-Work Choices signs, blocked traffic for up to two hours. 

&lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Trades%20Hall%20Council"&gt;Victorian Trades Hall Council&lt;/a&gt; secretary Brian Boyd linked the &lt;a href="WorkChoices"&gt;WorkChoices&lt;/a&gt; legislation to the upcoming election. “The key thing we have to do is make sure that &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; is not re-elected, that is our number one task over the next coming weeks and months," he said.

"As the workers' kids leave school, they're getting ripped off straight away by AWA (Australian Workplace Agreement) individual contracts - that's what we've found out over the last 12 months," Mr Boyd added. 

Employers were warned before the protests that they should not pay employees who took time off work to attend.

<h1>Torrent tracker Demonoid.com down, possibly shut by Canadian Recording Industry Association</h1>

Unconfirmed reports are claiming that &lt;a href="w%3ADemonoid"&gt;Demonoid&lt;/a&gt;, a popular semi-private &lt;a href="w%3Abittorrent%20tracker"&gt;torrent tracker&lt;/a&gt;, has been shut down by the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association"&gt;Canadian Recording Industry Association&lt;/a&gt; (CRIA). If true, this would be the latest in many shutdowns of &lt;a href="w%3AP2P"&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;/a&gt; websites by anti-piracy groups. Earlier this week, trackers Torrentbox, isoHunt, and Podtropolis were disabled for visitors in the United States due to a lawsuit by the &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (MPAA).

Demonoid is one of the largest torrent trackers on the internet, second only to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pirate%20Bay"&gt;The Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and tracks over a million torrent files. The site has recently moved its servers from the Netherlands to Canada in June after a Dutch piracy group &lt;a href="w%3ABREIN"&gt;BREIN&lt;/a&gt; subpoenaed Demonoid's ISP, demanding that the site be taken offline.

The site founder and administrator Deimos has not commented yet regarding the shutdown. Both the tracker and the website are inaccessible as of September 26 at 0700 UTC.

Some within the company have suggested that it all simply is a case of heavy maintenance.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft Global&lt;/a&gt; announced that &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; first-person shooter ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHalo%203"&gt;Halo 3&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ launched world-wide during September 25 to 27. This launch of ♡❤Halo 3♡❤ focuses on strategy, shooting, co-operating, and global linking between different languages.

In the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, more than 10,000 retailers opened their stores at midnight on September 25. They provided a ♡❤Halo 3♡❤ painted car as a grand prize. Gamers lined up for hours in excitement for the long awaited game to come out.

Shane Kim (Director of Microsoft Games Studio) awarded the first gamer who lined up for the launch at the &lt;a href="w%3ABest%20Buy"&gt;Best Buy store&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, taking pictures with Jim Cush who dressed as "Master Chief", and remarked that other 37 countries will play this game with different languages except English, with the sales of 10 million game copies.

In &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, after Microsoft's local division separately invited Taiwanese Band "Mayday" last Sunday (September 16) and SBL Yulon Dinosaur Team Players (Hsueh-lin Li and Chih-chung Chen) 4 days ago (September 22) at the "♡❤Halo 3♡❤ Pre-launch Carnival" in Taiwan, the company invited famous model Ruru Lin from Catwalk Co., Ltd. for the launch, and held a friendship match with 4 players who lined up from first place to fourth place.

Meanwhile, Microsoft Hong Kong held a "♡❤Halo 3♡❤: Ultimate Collection Exhibition" launch activity to show the ♡❤Halo♡❤ series figures, posters, game packs, and history. The first Chinese version of "♡❤Halo 3♡❤: Midnight Ultimate Madness" was published prior to Taiwan's and USA's release, at the Grand Century Place in Mong Kok, Kowloon in Hong Kong.

A &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; teenager has accomplished an unprecedented feat in the history of world aviation. He flew a distance of 1,300 &lt;a href="w%3Akilometer"&gt;kilometre&lt;/a&gt;s in a wheel well of a &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt; and lived. The fifteen year old Andrey Scherbakov spent two hours in the wheel well of the airplane at extreme temperature of −50° &lt;a href="w%3ACentigrade"&gt;centigrade&lt;/a&gt;. The rear wheels do not go all the way into the plane; the wheel merely retracts into an opening and remains exposed. The boy managed to bypass security at the &lt;a href="w%3APerm"&gt;Perm&lt;/a&gt; city airport to hide in the plane as it took off. Airport workers found the boy after the plane had landed at &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. He had collapsed on the tarmac.

The boy was delivered to the hospital by the airport staff and is said to be in a critical condition. His arms and legs were so severely frozen and swollen that the rescuers were not able to remove his coat and shoes. There is a probability that his hands may have to be amputated. However, according to the medical staff at the hospital, it is nothing short of a miracle that the boy survived the ordeal. The Boeing 737 has a cruising speed of 900 kilometres per hour and was flying constantly at an altitude of 10,000 &lt;a href="w%3Ameter"&gt;metres&lt;/a&gt; for two hours. As a result, the boy suffered severe frostbite in both of his hands. Doctors in Ural city would have to remove his fingertips, which contracted &lt;a href="w%3Agangrene"&gt;gangrene&lt;/a&gt; after they had frozen, but they were committed to do everything within their power to stop it from spreading.

When Scherbakov finally came to his senses, he told the police that he had run away from his family so as to escape his alcoholic father. He said that he was wandering around the territory of the airport and noticed a hole in the fence. He fell asleep during his examination of the stowaway of the plane. He woke up when the plane was already flying. It is curious how the inspection staff and the technicians found nothing on their inspection of the aircraft just before the flight. The boy claims that he fainted soon after and came around only when the plane had landed in Moscow after traveling hundreds of kilometres from Perm.

The airport did not confirm the report. However, Moscow's air and water transport control department said that the claim was true. A department spokesperson said that the incident happened on Friday, and the boy's parents were immediately informed and flew into the capital on the same day.

Stowaways in wheel wells risk freezing to death after take-off or being crushed when the wheels retract. This year, a body was found in the wheel well of a jet in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; after a flight from &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; and another body was found in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; after a flight from &lt;a href="w%3ADakar"&gt;Dakar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASenegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;.

Police in &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood%2C%20Florida"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; are investigating a strange bank robbery involving a bomb-like device being attached to a bank teller.

Law enforcement sources said the bomb-like device was comprised of cylinders taped together with wires.

The bank teller said that yesterday three armed men came into his house in Dania Beach, Florida and strapped the fake bomb to him. The armed men ordered the man to rob the &lt;a href="w%3AWachovia%20bank"&gt;Wachovia bank&lt;/a&gt; in which the man works.

Hollywood police spokesman Tony Rode said the men questioned the teller about the bank's procedures hours before the robbery.

One of the armed men made the teller and his girlfriend drive to the bank at gunpoint. The teller entered the bank and removed over &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;25,000. Once the armed man received the money, he drove away, leaving the teller and his girlfriend at the bank.

Video footage from ♡❤CNN♡❤ showed two police officers removing the device that had been strapped to the teller. A robot was then used to detonate and destroy the device.

Rode said police questioned the teller for hours, but said "There are a lot of holes, a lot of loose ends that we're not quite sure with..."Is this legit? Was this all a hoax? Is he truly a victim?" 

Police are looking for the suspects based on some vague descriptions.

After testing positive for marijuana amid the latest drug test, former &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Vick"&gt;Michael Vick&lt;/a&gt; was placed under tighter restrictions by U.S. District Judge &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Hudson"&gt;Henry Hudson&lt;/a&gt;.

Vick must be home between between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and he must submit to random drug tests that will be conducted in the future.

Hudson also ordered that Vick may have to attend and pay for inpatient or outpatient substance therapy and mental health counseling if a supervising officer deems so.

A document filed in U.S. District Court today said Vick tested positive amid a urine sample that was submitted on September 13, 2007.

Vick is scheduled for sentencing on December 10 for bankrolling a dogfighting operation on his property.

A &lt;a href="w%3ACatholicism"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; school in &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; was evacuated today after several students became sick during a church service.

&lt;a href="w%3ABloomfield%20Hills%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Bloomfield Hills&lt;/a&gt; Public Safety Director Rick Matott said St. Hugo of the Hills Catholic School evacuated its 860 students around 9 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; today. At least three children had passed out during the church service. Two children reportedly had to be taken to area hospitals.

Medical crews and hazardous material experts responded to the school to determine the cause of the illness. However, it is still not known what caused the students to become sick.

Students walked to the nearby &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20Community%20College"&gt;Oakland Community College&lt;/a&gt; campus while they waited for their parents to pick them up.

St. Hugo of the Hills Catholic School is about 15 miles northwest of &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Scientists discover 11 new species of life in Vietnam</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Scientists%20discover%2011%20new%20species%20of%20life%20in%20Vietnam&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At least 11 new species of life have been discovered in the &lt;a href="w%3Arainforest"&gt;rainforests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AThua%20Thien-Hue%20Province"&gt;Thua Thien-Hue Province&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; in a region of the forest described as the "&lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%27s%20Green%20Corridor"&gt;Green Corridor&lt;/a&gt;." The discovery was made by researchers from the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature"&gt;World Wide Fund for Nature&lt;/a&gt; (WWF).

Among the new species are five &lt;a href="w%3Aorchid"&gt;orchids&lt;/a&gt; and at least three other species of plants, two &lt;a href="w%3Abutterfly"&gt;butterflies&lt;/a&gt; and a snake. At least ten more species of plants are believed to be new species but are still being studied.

"You only discover so many new species in very special places, and the Green Corridor is one of them. Several large mammal species were discovered in the 1990s in the same forests, which means that these latest discoveries could be just the tip of the iceberg," said a technical adviser in Vietnam for the WWF, Chris Dickinson.

The new species of life are exclusive to the rainforest in Thua Thien-Hue Province.

The new snake, which can grow to 80 centimeters long, has been given the name ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmphiesma%20leucomystax"&gt;white-lipped keelback&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ because of a yellow-white stripe on the top of its head and makes its home near small streams and feeds on small animals and frogs.

The new species of butterflies are one subfamily of the &lt;a href="w%3ASatyrinae"&gt;Satyrinae&lt;/a&gt; species and the other a species of the &lt;a href="w%3ASkipper%20%28butterfly%29"&gt;Skipper butterfly&lt;/a&gt;.

The orchids, all of which are considered very rare because they were found to have no leaves whatsoever on the plant, grow in "matter" that is rotting and also contain no &lt;a href="w%3Achlorophyll"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;. The other two new plant species are of &lt;a href="w%3AArum"&gt;Arum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAspidistra"&gt;Aspidistra&lt;/a&gt;.

The WWF is concerned that civilization may move closer into the rainforest, destroying the homes of these new species, but the government of Thua Thien-Hue Province says it's dedicated to making sure that they are protected, along with the rainforest.

"The area is extremely important for conservation and the province wants to protect the forests and their environmental services, as well as contribute to sustainable development," said Provincial Forest Protection Department Director for the province, Hoang Ngoc Khanh.

The species were found in the rainforest in 2005 and 2006.

The long awaited finale in the &lt;a href="w%3AHalo%20%28series%29"&gt;"Halo"&lt;/a&gt; series, &lt;a href="w%3AHalo%203"&gt;"Halo 3"&lt;/a&gt;, has beaten the previous record of opening day sales held by "Spiderman 3" of &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;151 million. In the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, "Halo 3" got $170 million worth of retail sales in the opening day alone.

The game by &lt;a href="w%3ABungie%20Studios"&gt;Bungie Studios&lt;/a&gt; is available in 37 countries, which means the exact opening day figure will be much higher.

More than one million &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20Live"&gt;Xbox Live&lt;/a&gt; subscribers logged on to play "Halo 3" against each other over the Internet in the first 20 hours of launch, according to &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Game%20Studios"&gt;Microsoft Game Studio's&lt;/a&gt; corporate Vice-President, Shane Kim.

In comparison, &lt;a href="w%3AHalo%202"&gt;"Halo 2"&lt;/a&gt;, only sold $125 million on its first day of retail sales back in 2004. The first two "Halo" games have sold a combined total of 15 million copies.

It has been reported that Microsoft spent millions of dollars on marketing the third installment of the popular "Halo" series.

"Halo 3" was launched on September 25 at midnight in each time zone, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; being the first country to play the game, followed by &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20Council%20of%20Australia"&gt;Law Council of Australia&lt;/a&gt; has criticised both major parties for failing to commit to increases in legal aid funding. The LCA said that the Greens and Democrats have both committed to an immediate increase of $140 million, but that Labor and the Coalition are still yet to make any commitment. 

Law Council President Tim Bugg said, “The Budget surplus in 2006/07 was $17.3 billion; this year it is projected to be $10.6 billion – yet we’re supposed to accept that a fraction of this amount cannot be spared to assist less fortunate Australians pursue their right to justice.”

An Australian Democrats policy document says that low levels of legal aid funding results in poorer Australians receiving a reduced level of justice from the legal system. "This has increased community frustration with the legal system, which undermines respect for the rule of law," the document says. The document commits the Democrats to, "an urgent injection of Commonwealth funding into legal aid and community legal centres."

The Greens policy document commits to "adequate funding" of legal aid, but does not specifically call for an increase in funding.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Vanderslice"&gt;John Vanderslice&lt;/a&gt; has recently learned to enjoy America again. The singer-songwriter, who &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Public%20Radio"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt; called "one of the most imaginative, prolific and consistently rewarding artists making music today," found it through an unlikely source: his French girlfriend. "For the first time in my life I wouldn't say I was defending the country but I was in this very strange position..." 

Since breaking off from San Francisco local legends, &lt;a href="w%3Amk%20Ultra"&gt;mk Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, Vanderslice has produced six critically-acclaimed albums. His most recent, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEmerald%20City%20%28album%29"&gt;Emerald City&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, was released July 24th. Titled after the nickname given to the American-occupied &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Zone"&gt;Green Zone&lt;/a&gt; in Baghdad, it chronicles a world on the verge of imminent collapse under the weight of its own paranoia and loneliness. recently went to the &lt;a href="w%3ABowery%20Ballroom"&gt;Bowery Ballroom&lt;/a&gt; and spoke with Vanderslice about music, photography, touring and what makes a depressed liberal angry.
♡❤♡DS: How is the tour going?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Anywhere, or just outside of the country?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: I can relate: You and I have moved around a lot, and we have a lot in common. Pranks, for one. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Bowie"&gt;David Bowie&lt;/a&gt; is another.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: When I was in college I listened to him nonstop. Do you have a favorite album of his?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: You said seventh and eighth grade. Were you always listening to people like Bowie or bands like the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Velvet%20Underground"&gt;Velvets&lt;/a&gt;, or did you have an Eddie Murphy ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AParty%20All%20The%20Time"&gt;My Girl Wants to Party All the Time&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ phase?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Do you shun that music now or is it still a part of you?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Do you think New York or San Francisco suffers from artistic elitism more?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Everything is fusion now, like cuisine. It's hard to find a purely French or purely Vietnamese restaurant. ♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: You still find some &lt;a href="w%3AEmo"&gt;emos&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: You could clearly create music that is more mainstream pop and be successful with it, but you choose a lot of very personal and political themes for your music. Are you ever tempted to put out a studio album geared toward the charts just to make some cash?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Do you think &lt;a href="w%3ASpoon%20%28band%29"&gt;Spoon&lt;/a&gt; burned their indie credibility for allowing their music to be used in commercials and by making more studio-oriented albums? They are one of my favorite bands, but they have come a long way from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Series%20of%20Sneaks"&gt;A Series of Sneaks&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGirls%20Can%20Tell"&gt;Girls Can Tell&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.♡❤♡ &lt;br&gt; 

♡❤♡DS: Do you think letting your music be used on commercials does not bring the credibility problem it once did? That used to be the line of demarcation--the whole Sting thing--that if you did commercials you sold out. ♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Do you believe the only philosophical question is whether to commit suicide?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: When you see artists like &lt;a href="w%3APete%20Doherty"&gt;Pete Doherty&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AAmy%20Winehouse"&gt;Amy Winehouse&lt;/a&gt; out on suicidal binges of drug use, what do you think as a musician? What do you get from what you see them go through in their personal lives and their music?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Glorification of drugs? The rock lifestyle?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: As tragic figures?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: They are examples, as well. I recently covered for Wikinews the Iranian President speaking at Columbia and a student named Matt Glick told me that he supported the Iranian President speaking so that he could protest him, that if we don't give a platform and voice for people, how can we say that they are wrong? I think it's almost the same thing; they are beautiful as examples of how living a certain way can destroy you, and to look at them and say, "Don't be that." ♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Is it a problem for you to work with people who are using drugs? ♡❤♡&lt;br&gt; 

♡❤♡DS: Your latest CD is ♡❤Emerald City♡❤ and that is an allusion to the compound that we created in Baghdad. How has the current political client affected you in terms of your music?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: There are two times I felt deeply connected to New York City, and that was 9/11 and the re-election of George Bush. The depression of the city was palpable during both. I was in law school during the Iraq War, and then when &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; hit, we watched our countrymen debate the logic of rebuilding one of our most culturally significant cities, as we were funding almost without question the destruction of another country to then rebuild it, which seems less and less likely. Do you find it is difficult to enjoy living in America when you see all of these sorts of things going on, and the sort of arguments we have amongst ourselves as a people?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: --you, John Vanderslice, how can you allow this---♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: But he doesn't compare to George Bush or Dick Cheney. He's almost a liberal by American standards.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: What's the reaction to you and your music when you play off the coasts? ♡❤♡ &lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Have you ever been &lt;a href="w%3ADixie%20Chicks%3A%20Shut%20Up%20and%20Sing"&gt;Dixiechicked&lt;/a&gt;?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Depression breeds apathy, and your music seems geared toward anger, trying to wake people from their apathy. Your music is not maudlin and sad, but seems to be an attempt to awaken a spirit, with a self-reflective bent.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Is there a feeling in San Francisco that if an earthquake struck, you all would be on your own?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Organ failure. That's our baseline...♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: I &lt;a href="Interview%20with%20U.S.%20Republican%20Presidential%20candidate%20Tom%20Tancredo"&gt;interviewed Congressman Tom Tancredo&lt;/a&gt;, who is running for President, and he feels we should use as a deterrent against Islam the bombing of the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: You read a lot of the stuff that is written about you on blogs and on the Internet. Do you ever respond?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Often people assume an artist makes an achievement, say wins a &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20award"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20award"&gt;Grammy&lt;/a&gt; or even a &lt;a href="w%3ACable%20Ace%20Award"&gt;Cable Ace Award&lt;/a&gt; and people think the artist must feel this lasting sense of accomplishment, but it doesn't typically happen that way, does it? Often there is some time of elation and satisfaction, but almost immediately the artist is being asked, "Okay, what's the next thing? What's next?" and there is an internal pressure to move beyond that achievement and not focus on it.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Do you try?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: —but a lot of it's crap—♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: I've done a lot of photography for Wikipedia and the genesis of it was an attempt to pin down reality, to try to understand a world that I felt had fallen out of my grasp of understanding, because I felt I had no sense of what this world was about anymore. For that, my work is very encyclopedic, and it fit well with Wikipedia. What was the reason you began investing time and effort into photography?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: What bands are working with your studio, Tiny Telephone?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Do they approach you, or do you approach them?♡❤♡

At least 200 &lt;a href="w%3AMonk"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s have been arrested in &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; during night-time raids on &lt;a href="w%3AMonastery"&gt;monasteries&lt;/a&gt; not long before sunrise. Government forces began to crack down on protesters after several days of peaceful demonstrations, but despite the violent treatment from military personnel, the monks returned to the streets in the morning.

100 monks were taken by security forces when they raided a monastery at &lt;a href="w%3ANgwe%20Kyaryan"&gt;Ngwe Kyaryan&lt;/a&gt;. "Only two or three sick monks were left behind", a witness near the monastery said. Some reports state that shots have been fired at demonstrators, with one "collapsing", but it's not known if the individual was shot.

"There are fire trucks, water cannons positioned in a number of places - there are about three of them outside city hall. There are a number of prison vans also to be seen in certain places", said Mark Canning, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; ambassador in &lt;a href="w%3ARangoon"&gt;Rangoon&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; have said that they are deeply troubled by events, issuing a statement calling on the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; to consider sanctions, but &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; do not believe sanctions will "be helpful" and immediately dismissed the call, calling the situation a matter for the "internal government" of Myanmar.
"France will not accept the gagging of Burma's opposition", said &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; President, who also said that "[the Security Council] expressed their concern vis-a-vis the situation, and have urged restraint, especially from the government of Myanmar."

Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced that it will investigate implementing "targeted financial sanctions against regime figures and supporters," but has ruled out economic sanctions against Myanmar. He noted that economic sanctions could harm the people of Myanmar. "You always have a conflict in these situations between demonstrating your position by some kind of sanction, but making sure that those sanctions don't hurt the people who we are really trying to help," he said. 

Howard noted the important role that China has in the crisis. "The country that can exert most pressure on Burma is China and we will be encouraging, and we are doing it already, encouraging China to exert a positive influence on the regime to encourage it to hold back on the repression and to adopt a more accommodating attitude towards the people," he said. 

Howard described the government of Myanmar as "a thoroughly loathsome regime." He said that his government would tighten visa restrictions for regime officials, and maintain the ban on defence exports to Myanmar.

A Siberian woman, Tatyana Barabanova, 43, residing in Russia was shocked, after giving birth to her twelfth child, to see a 17-pound (7.75 kg) baby.

Nadia, born on September 17, 2007, by &lt;a href="w%3ACesarean%20section"&gt;Cesarean section&lt;/a&gt; at a maternity clinic in &lt;a href="w%3AAleisk%2C%20Russia"&gt;Aleisk, Russia&lt;/a&gt;, weighed in at a massive 17 pounds 1 ounce. "We were all simply in shock," the mother stated. When asked what the father said, she answered "He couldn't say a thing - he just stood there blinking."

Barabanova said they did not have the money for "special foods", so she "ate everything". Nadia's eight sisters and three brothers all weighed in at more than 11 pounds (5 kg), according to a local news reported, quoted by the &lt;a href="w%3AReuters%20news%20agency"&gt;Reuters news agency&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the second time this has happened, a Brazilian woman gave birth to a 17lb (7.73kg) baby in January 2005.

&lt;a href="w%3ABat%20for%20Lashes"&gt;Bat for Lashes&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href="w%3Adoppelg%C3%A4nger"&gt;doppelgänger&lt;/a&gt; band ego of one of the leading millennial lights in British music, &lt;a href="w%3ANatasha%20Khan"&gt;Natasha Khan&lt;/a&gt;. Caroline Weeks, &lt;a href="w%3AAbi%20Fry"&gt;Abi Fry&lt;/a&gt; and Lizzy Carey comprise the &lt;a href="w%3Aaurora%20borealis"&gt;aurora borealis&lt;/a&gt; that backs this haunting, shimmering &lt;a href="w%3Azither"&gt;zither&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aglockenspiel"&gt;glockenspiel&lt;/a&gt; peacock, and the only complaint coming from the audience at the &lt;a href="w%3ABowery%20Ballroom"&gt;Bowery Ballroom&lt;/a&gt; last Tuesday was that they could not camp out all night underneath these celestial bodies. 

We live in the age of the lazy tendency to categorize the work of one artist against another, and Khan has had endless exultations as the next &lt;a href="w%3ABj%C3%B6rk"&gt;Björk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKate%20Bush"&gt;Kate Bush&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="w%3ASixousie%20Sioux"&gt;Sixousie Sioux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStevie%20Nicks"&gt;Stevie Nicks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASinead%20O%27Connor"&gt;Sinead O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;, the list goes on until it is almost meaningless as comparison does little justice to the sound and vision of the band. "I think Bat For Lashes are beyond a trend or fashion band," said Jefferson Hack, publisher of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADazed%20%26amp%3B%20Confused%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Dazed &amp; Confused&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ magazine. "[Khan] has an ancient power...she is in part shamanic." She describes her aesthetic as "powerful women with a cosmic edge" as seen in &lt;a href="w%3AJane%20Birkin"&gt;Jane Birkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANico"&gt;Nico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACleopatra"&gt;Cleopatra&lt;/a&gt;. And these women are being heard. "I love the harpsichord and the sexual ghost voices and bowed saws," said &lt;a href="w%3ARadiohead"&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AThom%20Yorke"&gt;Thom Yorke&lt;/a&gt; of the track ♡❤Horse and I♡❤. "This song seems to come from the world of Grimm's fairytales."

Bat's debut album, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFur%20And%20Gold"&gt;Fur And Gold&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, was nominated for the 2007 &lt;a href="w%3AMercury%20Prize"&gt;Mercury Prize&lt;/a&gt;, and they were seen as the dark horse favorite until it was announced &lt;a href="w%3AKlaxons"&gt;Klaxons&lt;/a&gt; had won. Even &lt;a href="w%3ALadbrokes%20of%20England"&gt;Ladbrokes&lt;/a&gt;, the largest gambling company in the United Kingdom, had put their money on Bat for Lashes. "It was a surprise that Klaxons won," said Khan, "but I think everyone up for the award is brilliant and would have deserved to win."

Natasha recently spoke with about art, transvestism and drug use in the music business. 

♡❤♡DS: Do you have any favorite books?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Lynch just came out with a movie last year called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AInland%20Empire%20%28film%29"&gt;Inland Empire&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. I last night at the Bowery Ballroom and he ♡❤raved♡❤ about it!♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Do you notice a difference between playing in front of British and American audiences?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: How many instruments do you play and, please, include the glockenspiel in that number.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: --I have a great photo of you playing the bass.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: You look cool with it!♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Do you design your own clothes?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: —that's Will Lemon from Moon and Moon, right? There is such good buzz about them here in New York.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: You are often compared to Björk and Kate Bush; do those constant comparisons tend to bother you as an artist who is trying to define herself on her own terms?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: —as are you—♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: I'd imagine it's preferable to be considered the next Björk or Kate Bush instead of the next &lt;a href="w%3ABritney%20Spears"&gt;Britney&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Does music feed your artwork, or does you artwork feed your music more? Or is the relationship completely symbiotic?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: When you are composing music, do you see notes and words as colors and images in your mind, and then you put those down on paper?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Is it always pine trees that you see?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: What things in nature inspire you?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
♡❤♡DS: Are there man-made things that inspire you?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: I photographed some of the famous drag queens here in New York. They are just such great creatures to photograph; they will do just about anything for the camera. I photographed a famous drag queen named &lt;a href="w%3AMiss%20Understood"&gt;Miss Understood&lt;/a&gt; who is the emcee at a drag queen restaurant here named Lucky Cheng's. We were out in front of Lucky Cheng's taking photographs and a bus was coming down &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29"&gt;First Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, and I said, "Go out and stop that bus!" and she did! It's an amazing shot. 

♡❤♡DS: If you go on her Wikipedia article it's there.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: There are just so few areas left where there is natural edge and art that is not contrived. It's taking a contrived thing like changing your gender, but in the backdrop of how that is still so socially unacceptable.♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: How are you received in the Pakistani community?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: When you see artists like &lt;a href="w%3APete%20Doherty"&gt;Pete Doherty&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AAmy%20Winehouse"&gt;Amy Winehouse&lt;/a&gt; out on these suicidal binges of drug use, what do you think as a musician? What do you get from what you see them go through in their personal lives and with their music?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Is it difficult to come to the United States to play considering all the wars we start?♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;

<h1>Canada posts record $14 billion budget surplus</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Canada%20posts%20record%20%2414%20billion%20budget%20surplus&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; has a budget surplus of CA$13.8 billion for the 2006–2007 fiscal year, totaling 1% of Canada's &lt;a href="w%3Agross%20domestic%20product"&gt;gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt; (GDP), Finance Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Flaherty"&gt;Jim Flaherty&lt;/a&gt; announced today. The record surplus was boosted by revenue from government corporations to $14.2 billion, far exceeding the government's projections of $9.2 billion and surpassing the record set by the previous year's $13.2 billion surplus.

By federal law, all surplus must be used to pay down Canada's debt, and is not available for spending. $90 billion in debt payments over the last ten years have reduced its debt to $467 billion or 32.3% of national GDP, its lowest level in a quarter century. The announced debt payment is the largest in Canadian history.

The payment also reduced Canada's annual interest payments by $725 million, which the government pledged to pass on to taxpayers through tax returns and reduced income taxes. The Conservative's "Tax Back Guarantee", proposed in the March budget, promises that money saved on interest payments will be deducted from Canadians' taxes. The ♡❤Globe and Mail♡❤ predicts the tax returns will be 30–40 dollars per taxpayer.

Canada has posted ten consecutive budget surpluses in the last decade. The Canadian economy, the 8 largest in the world, has benefited from rising global demand for its export commodities, particularly oil and copper, as well as record corporate profits. This surplus was further increased by a $700 million drop from expected government spending.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; cautioned that the Canadian economy is still facing "tough times" in its forestry, manufacturing, and some export industries. Critics point out that the Conservative government had said Canadians were overtaxed when they took office, and had vowed to eliminate "surplus surprises".

According to a report released by the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20African%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;South African Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (SABC), a warrant has been issued by the South African National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), which operates separately from the police, for the arrest of &lt;a href="w%3AJackie%20Selebi"&gt;Jackie Selebi&lt;/a&gt; national commissioner of the &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n police and president of &lt;a href="Interpol"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt;.
Recent media coverage of the murder of &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Kebble"&gt;Brett Kebble&lt;/a&gt; have raised questions of the close friendship between Jackie Selebi and Glenn Agliotti.
Agliotti was later arrested in connection with the murder of Brett Kebble.

Agliotti is alleged to have strong links with organized crime and racketeering.

Three American men were arrested after they robbed a jewelry courier at gunpoint today. The robbery was made at a &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonalds"&gt;McDonalds restaurant&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFactoria%2C%20Washington"&gt;Factoria, Washington&lt;/a&gt; at approximately 9:40 a.m.

The men drove away but the courier was lucky enough to provide a description of the white van and the robbers, who were pursued by local police towards Interstate 90 in &lt;a href="w%3ASnoqualmie%2C%20Washington"&gt;Snoqualmie, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, east of Factoria, where the van was stopped. The three men were arrested and the van was searched by a K-9 unit.

The value of the jewels is unknown.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; won their first ever match in a World Cup with a 30-0 victory over &lt;a href="w%3ANamibia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. &lt;a href="w%3ARomania%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; came from behind to defeat &lt;a href="w%3APortugal%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; 14-10, while &lt;a href="w%3ASamoa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt; won 25-21 despite a late fightback from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; scored a last minute try to draw 12-12 with &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; took an early lead when &lt;a href="w%3AKosuke%20Endo"&gt;Kosuke Endo&lt;/a&gt; scored a try in the only score of the first half. Pat Riordan and D T H van der Merwe both scored in the second half as &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; led 12-5. However Koji Taira scored for Japan in injury time and Shotaro Onishi added the conversion to tie the match 12-12. Both sides are eliminated from &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20-%20Pool%20B"&gt;Pool B&lt;/a&gt;. Australia have qualified for the quarter-finals, while Wales and Fiji face each other for second place.

In &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20-%20Pool%20C"&gt;Pool C&lt;/a&gt;, World Cup debutants &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; led &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; 7-0 at half time thanks to a try from Joaquim Ferreira. Marius Tincu scored for Romania with less than twenty minutes left to level the scores, before Goncalo Malheiro kicked Portugal back into the lead with a penalty. Florin Corodeanu however won the match for Romania with a 72nd minute try. Neither side can qualify from the pool, but Portugal pick up a bonus point while Romania move on to five points behind Italy, who must play Scotland to decide second place as New Zealand have won the pool.

In &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20-%20Pool%20A"&gt;Pool A&lt;/a&gt;, won their first match of their World Cup with a 25-21 victory over the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ALome%20Fa%27atau"&gt;Lome Fa'atau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlesana%20Tuilagi"&gt;Alesana Tuilagi&lt;/a&gt; scored tries for Samoa as they raced to an early lead. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Hercus"&gt;Mike Hercus&lt;/a&gt; scored a penalty for the Americans, but just before half time &lt;a href="w%3AKane%20Thompson"&gt;Kane Thompson&lt;/a&gt; scored Samoa's third try bringing the score to 22-3 at the interval. A late fightback from the United States, with tries from Takudzwa Ngwenya and &lt;a href="w%3ALouis%20Stanfill"&gt;Louis Stanfill&lt;/a&gt;, was not enough to win the match but earned them a bonus point. Both Samoa and the USA are eliminated from Pool A. South Africa are top of the group, while England play Tonga for second place.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAnglican%20Church"&gt;Anglican Church&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has cleared the way for women to become &lt;a href="w%3ADiocese"&gt;diocesan&lt;/a&gt; bishops. In a majority decision the Anglican Church’s highest legal authority, the Appellate Tribunal, found that there was nothing in the Church Constitution to prevent a female priest from being consecrated as a Bishop. The decision means there could be female Bishops as early as next year. The Church has permitted female priests for more than a decade. 

&lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; Anglican Archbishop &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Jensen"&gt;Peter Jensen&lt;/a&gt; opposed the decision. "While I respect the judicial procedures which have led to this result I am disappointed that the matter has now been resolved in this way," Dr Jensen said. "Those who are opposed to this development base their objection on conscientious grounds as a matter of biblical principle."

According to &lt;a href="Burma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;'s government, the military has killed at least nine protesters and wounded 42 others in their second day crackdown on peaceful demonstrations that have been taking place for nearly almost a month. At least one monk is rumored to have been killed and a 50-year-old &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; journalist was also killed.

Witnesses on scene claim that troops fired into the crowd of 10,000 "pro-democracy" protesters with automatic weapons in an attempt to break up the crowds. The military sent troops through the city street warning protesters that they would use deadly force if they did not stop their demonstrations.

Some media agencies in the area claim that the protesters are to blame for the violence, accusing them of "intimidating" the military, and injuring at least 31 troops.

On September 27, at least 200 &lt;a href="w%3AMonk"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s were arrested in &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; during night-time raids on &lt;a href="w%3AMonastery"&gt;monasteries&lt;/a&gt; not long before sunrise. 100 of those monks were taken by security forces when they raided a monastery at &lt;a href="w%3ANgwe%20Kyaryan"&gt;Ngwe Kyaryan&lt;/a&gt;.

The protests in Burma began last month after the military abruptly raised fuel prices by 100 percent. They have since expanded into countrywide demonstrations against 45 uninterrupted years of military rule.

A &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; student of &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgetown%20University"&gt;Georgetown University&lt;/a&gt; has been arrested on suspicion of a hate crime, in which he allegedly beat up another man because the victim was gay. News reports confirm that the victim - who also goes to the same school - recognized the alleged assailant, because of his profile and photos on &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.

Washington DC Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier announced yesterday that Philip Cooney had been arrested after a warrant was issued for the September 9 attack, which occurred in the 1400 block of 36th Street NW (Between O and P Streets, NW). The victim was allegedly attacked by a group of males yelling homophobic slurs. "He made it a point to etch the suspect's face in his mind and remember him," Police Lt. Alberto Jova said. "Because of that he was able to give a very positive identification." The victim in this case suffered a broken thumb and cuts and bruises to his face. 

The victim suspected his attacker was also a student at Georgetown, and did extensive examination of information available on Facebook, a popular web site used by students to socialize online.

Cooney could not be reached for comment, and will be arraigned in D.C. Superior Court today. A friend of the alleged assailant was shocked at the allegations and said he is "one of the nicest and most gentle people that we know at this school."

The attack is considered unrelated to two other hate crimes which occurred this month in the Northwest quadrant of the city.

&lt;a href="w%3ASymphonic%20power%20metal"&gt;Symphonic power metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Nightwish"&gt;Nightwish&lt;/a&gt; have released &lt;a href="w%3ADark%20Passion%20Play"&gt;Dark Passion Play&lt;/a&gt;, the album with the highest production costs in the history of the band's native &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. When drummer &lt;a href="w%3AJukka%20Nevalainen"&gt;Jukka Nevalainen&lt;/a&gt; was asked the overall cost of the new album, he was quoted as saying “Roughly half a million... We don’t know the exact sum down to the euros and cents as yet.”

Half of this cost was incurred in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, over an expensive eight days at the &lt;a href="w%3AAbbey%20Road%20Studios"&gt;Abbey Road Studios&lt;/a&gt;, during which time the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Session%20Orchestra"&gt;London Session Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AMetro%20Voices%20Choir"&gt;Metro Voices Choir&lt;/a&gt;, a gospel choir, and two &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; musicians recorded their parts at the studio. The rest was spent during the ten months between September 2006 and June this year, when the band were recording the rest of the album in Finland.

The album is the sixth full-length studio album by the band, and sports some impressive figures, boasting the contributions of almost 130 different musicians and requiring a total of almost 250 separate recording tracks. Nightwish is paying for the album via the company Scene Nation, who are entirely owned by Nightwish, and have sold the license for it to &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Blast"&gt;Nuclear Blast&lt;/a&gt; Records.

The album is the first to feature new vocalist &lt;a href="w%3AAnette%20Olzon"&gt;Anette Olzon&lt;/a&gt;, who earlier this year replaced &lt;a href="w%3ATarja%20Turunen"&gt;Tarja Turunen&lt;/a&gt;, the latter having departed the band in 2005.

The album went platinum (sold more than 30,000 copies) within hours of its Finnish release date of September 26, with 42,000 copies sold.

Nightwish are currently rehearsing for a world tour to promote the album.

&lt;a href="w%3AKenji%20Nagai"&gt;Kenji Nagai&lt;/a&gt;, 50, a &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese video journalist shot dead in &lt;a href="w%3AMyanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; (Burma) this Thursday, is alleged to have been shot intentionally, a report says. On Friday Japanese television station Fuji TV aired a film in which Nagai had been shown. In that film, VOA reports Nagai was "thrown to the ground by a soldier and shot at close range." Tokyo based &lt;a href="w%3AYomiuri%20Shimbun"&gt;Yomiuri Shimbun&lt;/a&gt; reports the anonymous local testimonies of that incident: Nagai was shot from a near distance while he filmed the anti-government demonstration. The local testimonials state that military and polices aimed at many citizens with cameras.

After being informed of the death of Nagai, the Japanese government demanded that the Burmese government investigate the death and punish the killer, Yomiuri reports. 

APF, the Tokyo based news agency for which Nagai worked, reports that Reporters Without Borders, the Paris based non-profit, issued a protest against the Burmese government in response to his death. According to APF, RWB states Burmese government disturbs communications in several ways, including disturbance of cellular connection and blocking of blogs. According to Jiji, a Tokyo based newswire, RWB also requested Japanese government sanction of Myanmar. 

Also, European Committee spokesperson accused the Burmese military government of being responsible for Nagai's death as well as all other violence in Burma. European Committee expresses their concern of the Burmese government attitude toward foreign press.

The United States announced today that an airstrike against a house in &lt;a href="w%3AYusufiyah"&gt;Yusufiyah, Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday completed its mission, killing insurgent commander &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Usama%20al-Tunisi"&gt;Abu Usama al-Tunisi&lt;/a&gt; and two others. The airstrike, by an &lt;a href="w%3AF-16"&gt;F-16&lt;/a&gt; carrying two 500 lb bombs, came hours after a tip that al-Tunisi would be holding a meeting that day. 

However, al-Tunisi had been reported dead more than a year ago. 

The Tunisian militant had come to American attention during the &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Battle%20of%20Fallujah"&gt;Second Battle of Fallujah&lt;/a&gt; in November 2004, and had overseen anti-aircraft missions and participated in the 2005 &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Abu%20Ghraib"&gt;attack against Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt;. His death was reported by &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt;'s army on May 20, 2006 in an &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Hesbah"&gt;al-Hesbah&lt;/a&gt; communique later translated and released by FBI Terrorism consultant &lt;a href="w%3AEvan%20Kohlmann"&gt;Evan Kohlmann&lt;/a&gt;. He was reportedly killed after a US helicopter attack in Yusufiyah killed him and four other insurgents.

Following this week's bombing, Brig. Gen. Joseph Anderson addressed a press conference at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; stating that the death of al-Tunisi would "fracture" the Sunni insurgency within the country - claiming that the man was "one of the most senior leaders" and "part of the inner leadership circle". His name did not appear on the Iraqi Government's list of 41 Most Wanted.

Anderson also stated that al-Tunisi's group, the Aisha Battalion of anti-aircraft operations, was responsible for the kidnappings and deaths of US soldiers in June of 2006, a month after he was reported killed. While the Army could not confirm which soldiers Anderson was referencing, a June 16 kidnapping led to the death of Spc. David J. Babineau, Pfc. Kristian Menchaca and Pfc. Thomas Tucker who were guarding a bridge into &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. 

al-Tunisi was said to be a potential replacement for &lt;a href="w%3AAQI"&gt;al-Qaeda in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Hamza%20al-Muhajir"&gt;Abu Hamza al-Muhajir&lt;/a&gt; who was killed by tribesmen in May of this year. &lt;a href="w%3AMultinational%20Force%20Iraq"&gt;Multinational Force Iraq&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Maj. Winfield Danielson stated that “This is one more al-Qaeda in Iraq criminal who will never kill another innocent civilian,” although all of al-Tunisi's known targets were American soldiers, not Iraqi civilians.

While the military stated that they had "definitively identified" the body as being al-Tunisi, they refused to elaborate on their methods of verification - stating only that two captured Iraqis told them that it was al-Tunisi. Although a letter found inside the house referred to being "desperate" and being unable to travel outside the city - it was unsigned, and the only evidence that it was written by al-Tunisi was that it "was with his belongings".

The tip was confirmed by a local Iraqi arrested near the site of the house just before the bombing, which killed three. Military press releases reported that al-Tunisi's body had been "definitively" identified and that his handwriting was evident on papers inside the bombed house.

Kohlmann said the contradiction raised "some pretty serious questions", and that any claims that al-Tunisi could have faked his own death to deceive US military intelligence would be "virtually unprecedented" behaviour for the insurgents.

In May, the US military was forced to admit that Brig. Gen. Kevin Bergner's announcement declaring the death of al-Qaeda in Iraq lieutenant &lt;a href="w%3AKamal%20Jalil%20Uthman"&gt;Kamal Jalil Uthman&lt;/a&gt; was incorrect after the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Examiner"&gt;San Francisco Examiner&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that the army had already reported Uthman killed a year earlier, in a document entitled "Tearing Down al Qaeda".

An assembly man in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; stole one million &lt;a href="w%3Ascrews"&gt;screws&lt;/a&gt; from his co-workers and auctioned them over the internet. He was arrested at his apartment on Wednesday.

For two years, the 33-year-old stole up to 7,000 screws per day and hid them in a hiding place. Today he has 1.1 million screws that are valued at 110,000 &lt;a href="w%3Aeuros"&gt;euros&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;155,000).

"In the end, it became obvious that screws were being sold for much less than they usually cost," said police spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AW%C3%BCrzburg"&gt;Würzburg&lt;/a&gt; police. The man's name has not been released and he is in custody awaiting charges.

In &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20-%20Pool%20A"&gt;Pool A&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, defending champions &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; secured qualification for the quarter final stage of the tournament with a 36-20 victory over &lt;a href="Tonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AParc%20des%20Princes"&gt;Parc des Princes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Hola"&gt;Pierre Hola&lt;/a&gt; scored a penalty to give Tonga an early 3-0 lead, but &lt;a href="w%3AJonny%20Wilkinson"&gt;Jonny Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt; equalised soon afterwards. Sukanaivalu Hufanga restored Tonga's lead with a 17th minute try. At the interval England led 19-10 after &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Sackey"&gt;Paul Sackey&lt;/a&gt; scored two tries and Jonny Wilkinson added another penalty and a drop goal.

Tries from &lt;a href="w%3AMathew%20Tait"&gt;Mathew Tait&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Farrell"&gt;Andy Farrell&lt;/a&gt; and another Johnny Wilkinson drop goal completed a comfortable win for England, while Hale T Pole scored a late consolation try for Tonga.

England finish second in the pool with fourteen points, behind South Africa who top the group with one game left to play. Tonga are eliminated from the tournament but qualify automatically for the 2011 World Cup by finishing third in the group. England will play Australia in the quarter finals in a repeat of the 2003 final.

For the first time after the fall of the iron curtain &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; will host the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Games"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – in 2014 the Winter Olympics will take place in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASochi"&gt;Sochi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; resort town. The games are considered a matter of national prestige and generate more media attention than the recent changes in Russian government (Russia’s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recently installed the new prime-minister, who, incidentally, also became the chair of the Russian Olympic committee.) 

As Russia takes enormous efforts to prepare for the Olympics and build a modern sport infrastructure from scratch, the Russian public is more concerned with the mascot for the upcoming games. When &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hosted the Summer Olympics in the 1980, the mascot for the Moscow Games was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMisha"&gt;Misha the Bear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , developed by children’s book illustrator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictor%20Chizhikov"&gt;Victor Chizhikov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Misha instantly became a graphic-design hit, especially in the Soviet bloc. Olympic posters were snatched up and t-shirts were fought over. And as Sochi is set to become the new Olympic city, Russians are keen to see the old bear return. 

There is a long way to the Sochi Olympics, but the Bear is already coming back from retirement. ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia%21%20magazine"&gt;Russia! magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, an English-language publication distributed in the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, has commissioned the most prominent designers and artists to do their own renditions of the famed mascot. “The Olympic Bear turns any Russian between the ages of 25 and 50 to quivering jelly. Our artistic compatriots were happy to whip the old bear into shape for 21st century use” – says Ilya Merenzon, the magazine’s publisher. “And the readers’ response was overwhelming. As soon as the new issue arrived at the stores, we constantly get emails requesting the Bear t-shirts. The animal is regaining his popularity”. – adds Merenzon. 

It has not been decided, however, on the Sochi Games mascot. Another option is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACheburashka"&gt;Cheburashka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a famous Russian cartoon character with big ears and humble smile. Cheburashka was the mascot for the Russian Olympic team in Turin and is one of the best-selling children’s toys in former USSR countries and, surprisingly, Japan, where it is known as “Chebu”.

A 17-year-old high school student was arrested after holding a high school class hostage in &lt;a href="w%3AOroville%2C%20California"&gt;Oroville, California&lt;/a&gt;. The gunman had reportedly planned to shoot a romantic rival, but been stymied when he couldn't find the other youth.

Entering a classroom he expected to find empty, intending to commit suicide, the student discovered a class in progress - and instead fired several shots in to the air and decided to instigate a hostage situation, seizing the 25 students and their substitute teacher. 

Thirty minutes into the crisis, speaking by cellphone with a hostage negotiator, the student had agreed to release nearly all the hostages, except three students and the teacher.

After about an hour, the student surrendered and the situation ended peacefully. 

The student has been charged with attempted murder, forcible confinement and bringing a gun to school.

The situation occurred exactly one year and one day after another &lt;a href="w%3APlatte%20Canyon%20High%20School%20shooting"&gt;hostage situation in Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.

Hovind, who is now serving ten years in federal prison, turned CSE over to his younger son, Eric Hovind, in January 2007.

A suicide bomber blew himself up on a bus carrying more than 50 people in &lt;a href="Kabul%2C%20Afghanistan"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; killing at least 31 and critically injuring 17 of the people on board. 28 were Afghan soldiers, and so far at least two civilians have been killed.

"At this time I can tell you that 31, almost all of them military personnel, have been martyred," said Afghanistan's Public Health Minister, Sayed Mohammad Amin Fatemi.

Reports say that the suicide bomber, who was dressed in a military uniform, walked onto the bus and blew himself up, tearing it into two pieces. Several businesses were also damaged in the attack and military personnel were retrieving body parts from trees.

&lt;a href="Zabiullah%20Mujahid"&gt;Zabiullah Mujahid&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;, says they are responsible for the blast and stated that the bomber was 'Azizullah', a Kabul resident.

Bayern Munich beat Bayer Leverkusen to remain at the top of the German league table with a goal from Italy striker Luca Toni. Michael Rensing was a last minute replacement Oliver Kahn due to the injury Kahn picked up during the warm-up.

The 1 half saw a series of chances for both side which saw the eventual game winner from Bayern strker Luca Toni. The 2 half saw fewer scoring chances as Bayern completed the victory.
<h2>Quotes</h2>
♡❤♡Ottmar Hitzfeld:♡❤♡ "Leverkusen started very well, imposed a high pace on the game and showed some excellent moves. We had a few problems organising ourselves defensively. We changed the formation and let Miro Klose play a little more detached from the midfield. In the last 15 minutes of the first half we began to control the game. In the second half we were closer to a second goal, although in the closing stages the pressure was intense again. It was a hard-fought victory – we weren’t as strong as we had been recently and we didn’t play as well on the counter-attack. This has been our hardest test so far."

♡❤♡Miroslav Klose:♡❤♡ "We had a hard job of it today. Leverkusen played well and put us under a lot of pressure. I think we had some real problems in the first half."

♡❤♡Rudi Völler:♡❤♡ "We saw a splendid game from both team, and we played extremely well in the first 25 minutes. We had a few scoring chances and put Bayern under a bit of pressure. But against a team as good as Bayern you have to take advantage of this kind of domination by scoring if you want to have a chance over 90 minutes. Still, I wouldn’t say this is a setback for us."

♡❤♡Michael Skibbe:♡❤♡ "Bayern deserved the win because of their calmness. However, I am very satisfied with the performance of my team, they played really well."

DC United took &lt;a href="w%3AMagic%20number%20%28sports%29"&gt;magic number&lt;/a&gt; to clinch &lt;a href="w%3AMLS%20Supporters%27%20Shield"&gt;MLS Supporters' Shield&lt;/a&gt; was reduced to 12 after a 4-1 come-from-behind victory against Toronto FC. After the loss, Toronto FC will be eliminated from post-season contention if &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Fire"&gt;Chicago Fire&lt;/a&gt; win against &lt;a href="w%3AChivas%20USA"&gt;Chivas USA&lt;/a&gt; tonight.

Toronto for the second straight week took an early lead in the first half from a Carl Robinson free kick while DC United looked "passive" in the first half.

In the second half, DC United showed why they're the top team in the league by scoring four goals. Late in the half DC United went down to ten men when Fred went down with an injury after DC United's third and final substitution. The loss for Toronto FC makes it a 11 game winless streak. Toronto have now only scored two goals in their last 1,002 minutes played.

The announcement was made by &lt;a href="w%3ADoug%20Horner"&gt;Doug Horner&lt;/a&gt;, the Minister of Advanced Education &amp; Technology at a Press Conference at the University.

"It's all about more choices and accessibility to education," the Minister said.

"It allows us to serve our mission" said &lt;a href="w%3AJoy%20Romero"&gt;Joy Romero&lt;/a&gt;, the Chair of the Athabasca University Governing Council.

After the launch of "Halo 3" on Tuesday (September 25), Microsoft promoted a brand new Xbox360 racing game "Project Gotham Racing 4" (PGR4) with a friendship match as a "TOP on TOP" competition between Taiwanese World Cyber Games (WCG) PGR3 Delegate You-cheng Liu and "Drift Master of Taiwan" Po-hsiung Chou at YAMAHA MotorTown in Taipei City, Taiwan.

Before the friendship match, Cary Chen (Senior Product Marketing Manager of Entertainment and Device Division, Microsoft Taiwan) show the new features on PGR4 to the press, VIPs, and guests and praised the "PGR" game series with the "Kudos" skill points. He remarked that in the "PGR4", not only joined new car type and racing motorcycles, but also add Dynamic Weather System feature for the performance of new different type experiences on weathers, driving, and racing lane.

Chen also remarked that PGR series is surely respected because of the racing game competition factor on WCG from 2006. This "PGR" series can realize lots of dreams of players on making some special skills which can't be done on reality. With the Xbox Live linking, PGR series has successfully made a great achievement.

After the presentation and demos, Microsoft Taiwan held a friendship match. Before the match, Y. C. Liu welcomed P. H. Chou with Chou drove a BMW car to the main entrance. After the entrance, the match started. With the witnesses of VIPs, press, and players, Liu won the friendship match by the turning fault of Chou. Even though Chou wanted to invite Live as a racer in reality after the match, but Liu temporarily declined with his consideration.

Microsoft Taiwan announced that the Chinese Version of "PGR4" will be available on October 5, and welcomed players competing with "I want 'PGR4' Helmet!" photo competition. And also, "Yamaha PGR4 Cup - Taiwan Driving Master Championship" will be held and set qualification section in October and final section in December of Information Month in Taipei.

On May 31, 2007, C. Richard Newsome of the Newsome Law Firm, filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Antonio Hernandez against &lt;a href="w%3AIGE"&gt;IGE&lt;/a&gt; (Internet Gaming Entertainment). The main thrust of the lawsuit is that IGE made a "calculated decision to reap substantial profits by knowingly interfering with and substantially impairing the intended use and enjoyment associated with consumer agreements between &lt;a href="w%3ABlizzard%20Entertainment"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; and subscribers to its virtual world called &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20of%20Warcraft"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; (WoW)."

Specifically, the lawsuit references IGE's practice of selling WoW items or WoW gold, generated by "&lt;a href="w%3AFarmer%20%28gaming%29"&gt;farmers&lt;/a&gt;".

There is actually more than one IGE, both of whom are defendants in the lawsuit. IGE, LTD. is a "foreign corporation with its principal place of business in Hong Kong, China, with offices" "located at Euclid Avenue, Suite 222, Miami Beach, Florida, 33149" and "Beverly Hills, California." IGE U.S. LLC. is a "Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 105 N.W. 43rd Street, Boca Raton, Florida, 33431." IGE U.S. LLC. is "an affiliated company" of IGE, LTD.

The lawsuit alleges that the amount in controversy exceeds US$5 million exclusive of interest and costs.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonnell%20Douglas"&gt;McDonnell Douglas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMD-80"&gt;MD-80&lt;/a&gt; carrying 142 people was forced to return to &lt;a href="w%3ALambert-St.%20Louis%20International%20Airport"&gt;Lambert-St. Louis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; after an engine caught fire shortly after takeoff. &lt;a href="w%3AAircraft%20Rescue%20and%20Firefighting"&gt;Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting&lt;/a&gt; (ARFF) personnel doused down the number one engine upon landing with foam.

American Airlines Flight 140 had departed the airport at 1:03 p.m. on a scheduled domestic passenger flight to &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, but had developed the fire, coming back to land at 1:40 p.m. The aircraft was stopped on the runway, where it was met by ARFF crews, who extinguished the fire. None of the 137 passengers, three cabin crew and two pilots were injured, and they subsequently walked to the terminal.

American Airlines have stated that their maintenance department will investigate the accident in an attempt to determine what sparked the fire. Federal inspectors from the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; will also investigate the accident, with at least two investigators dispatched, including a specialist in jet engines.

In the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; secured qualification to the knockout stage of the tournament with victories over &lt;a href="w%3AWales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AItaly%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Elsewhere &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3ARomania%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Both New Zealand and Australia had already qualified for the following round.

&lt;span id="Fiji"/&gt;In &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20-%20Pool%20B"&gt;Pool B&lt;/a&gt;, defeated &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; 38-34 in a dramatic encounter. &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Jones%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Stephen Jones&lt;/a&gt; opened the scoring for Wales with a penalty, but Fiji raced to a 25-3 lead with tries from &lt;a href="w%3AAkapusi%20Qera"&gt;Akapusi Qera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVilimoni%20Delasau"&gt;Vilimoni Delasau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKele%20Leawere"&gt;Kele Leawere&lt;/a&gt; and two penalties from &lt;a href="w%3ANicky%20Little"&gt;Nicky Little&lt;/a&gt;. Wales fought back and took the lead after 51 minutes after &lt;a href="w%3AAlix%20Popham"&gt;Alix Popham&lt;/a&gt; ,&lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Williams"&gt;Shane Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGareth%20Thomas%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Gareth Thomas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Jones%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Mark Jones&lt;/a&gt; each scored.

Nicky Little regained the lead for Fiji with two penalties, but Wales appeared to be heading to victory when &lt;a href="w%3AMartyn%20Williams"&gt;Martyn Williams&lt;/a&gt; scored with seven minutes remaining. However Graham Dewes scored late on to snatch an extraordinary victory for Fiji to finish second in Pool B. Wales are knocked out of the tournament, but qualify automatically for the 2011 World Cup by finishing third in Pool B.

&lt;span id="Australia"/&gt;&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the winners of Pool B, beat &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; 37-6. An early penalty from &lt;a href="w%3AJulian%20Huxley"&gt;Julian Huxley&lt;/a&gt; and tries from &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Baxter"&gt;Al Baxter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Freier"&gt;Adam Freier&lt;/a&gt; gave Australia a 13-0 lead at half-time. &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Pritchard"&gt;James Pritchard&lt;/a&gt; scored two penalties for Canada, but &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Smith%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;George Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADrew%20Mitchell"&gt;Drew Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; (2) &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Latham"&gt;Chris Latham&lt;/a&gt; all scored tries to complete Australia's victory.

Fiji face South Africa in the quarter finals while Australia will play defending champions England in a repeat of the 2003 final.

&lt;span id="Scotland"/&gt;&lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; 18-16 to secure their place in the quarter finals. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Paterson"&gt;Chris Paterson&lt;/a&gt; scored all of Scotland's points by kicking six penalties. Italy were leading twenty minutes into the match after &lt;a href="w%3AAlessandro%20Troncon"&gt;Alessandro Troncon&lt;/a&gt; scored a try and &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Bortolussi"&gt;David Bortolussi&lt;/a&gt; added a penalty. Chris Paterson ensured Scotland's passage into the next round by kicking six penalties out of six. David Bortolussi closed the gap to two points with two penalties, but Scotland held on to finish second in &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20-%20Pool%20C"&gt;Pool C&lt;/a&gt;. Italy finish third and qualify for the next World Cup despite being eliminated from the tournament.

&lt;span id="New Zealand"/&gt;Pool C winners &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; scored thirteen tries as they comfortably defeated &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; 85-8. Marius Tincu scored Romania's only try of the match, while Florin Vlaicu added a penalty. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Rokocoko"&gt;Joe Rokocoko&lt;/a&gt; scored a hat-trick of tries for the All Blacks, and &lt;a href="w%3ASitiveni%20Sivivatu"&gt;Sitiveni Sivivatu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIsaia%20Toeava"&gt;Isaia Toeava&lt;/a&gt; scored two each.

An annual survey by &lt;a href="w%3ATransparency%20International"&gt;Transparency International&lt;/a&gt; (TI) of &lt;a href="Berlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; has shown &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; to be the world's least corrupt countries, while the most corrupt are &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;.

The annual &lt;a href="w%3ACorruption%20Perceptions%20Index"&gt;Corruption Perceptions Index&lt;/a&gt; listed 180 different countries. The findings were presented by TI chairman Hansjoerg Elshorst, who pointed out that the survey represented the "general perception of corruption and the fight against corruption". He also commented on the fact that five of the ten highest-ranking nations were Nordic - Denmark, Finland, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; all ranked highly. He said the main reason they did so well was that they all had highly transparent administrative systems. In addition to two Nordic countries, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; was also ranked joint first. All three received ratings of 9.4 out of ten. Myanmar and Somalia both received 1.4 ratings.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; all were commended for marked improvements in their anti-corruption efforts. Some other selected results are &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; at joint fourth with Sweden, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in 12th place, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; in 16th place, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; at 19th, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; at 20, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; at 72nd and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; at 143rd. The difference between Finland and Russia, which is rated at 2.4, is so abrupt that it is thought that the Finland-Russia border is the most sudden change of corruption levels in the world, worse than the infamous US-&lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; border.

Elshorst went on to demand higher levels of international efforts to combat corruption and for Germany's ratification of the UN Convention against Corruption.

&lt;a href="w%3AEvan%20Wolfson"&gt;Evan Wolfson&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the modern gay marriage movement, tells the waiter he would like an iced decaf and "the usual." Wolfson, one of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Magazine"&gt;Time Magazine's&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20100"&gt;Most Influential People in the World&lt;/a&gt;, is a man who unflinchingly knows what he wants and stays his course, whether it be in his choice of restaurant or in his choice of battle. And others always know when they see Evan coming what it is that he wants.

Since his time at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20School"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt; when he wrote a paper on the topic, what Wolfson wants is the right for gay people to marry. The issue gained national prominence in 1993 when the Hawaii Supreme Court held in ♡❤Baehr v. Lewin♡❤ that the government had to show a reason for the denial of the freedom to marry, not just deny marriage licenses to the plaintiff gay couples. Wolfson was co-counsel in the historic 1996 Hawaii trial in which he argued that the government does not have a sufficient reason for excluding same-sex couples from marriage. In 1999, Wolfson contributed to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABaker%20v.%20Vermont"&gt;Baker v. Vermont&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the case that led to the creation of civil unions; advised the lead attorneys in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGoodridge%20v.%20Department%20of%20Public%20Health"&gt;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the case that led to &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; in Massachusetts; and since 2003, when he founded the primary umbrella organization coordinating the efforts to win marriage for gay people, &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20to%20Marry"&gt;Freedom to Marry&lt;/a&gt;, Wolfson has played a role in every marriage equality case in the United States. He is the movement's founder and leader, and his focus remains square on winning that right. "For years," said &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Foreman"&gt;Matt Foreman&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Gay%20and%20Lesbian%20Task%20Force"&gt;National Gay and Lesbian Task Force&lt;/a&gt;, "many of us were saying to him, 'We're not ready. The country's not ready. And, by the way, you're crazy.'" 

When I make a statement to him about his devoting his life to gay marriage, he corrects me: "I’ve played a part in cases that span the entire spectrum of eliminating gay people’s exclusions and limitations on who gay people are, and I’ve also written on immigration and economic justice, and I have worked on cases involving race discrimination in jury selection and women’s inequality. I don’t think one has to pick one of these things; they work together."

Indeed, he has. Wolfson was lead counsel before the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABoy%20Scouts%20of%20America%20v.%20Dale"&gt;Boy Scouts of America v. Dale&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the case arguing against the expulsion of gay scoutmasters. As an intrepid young assistant district attorney in &lt;a href="w%3ABrooklyn%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, Wolfson worked on ♡❤People v. Liberta♡❤ to end the exemption that allowed &lt;a href="w%3Amarital%20rape"&gt;women to be raped by their husbands legally&lt;/a&gt;, a right in New York State as early as 1984. And he helped end the &lt;a href="w%3ABatson%20v.%20Kentucky"&gt;practice of choosing jurors based upon their race&lt;/a&gt;. 

Wolfson's entire career has been at the center of the most explosive legal and cultural issues of the last 30 years in the United States, and his influence has been profound. sat down with him to discuss some of the recent decisions affecting gay marriage, gender in marriage and reactions in the gay community to his fight for their rights.

<h2>Wolfson and gay marriage</h2>

♡❤♡DS: You are one of the leaders, arguably the founder, of the modern gay marriage movement—

♡❤♡DS: The argument is posed that it’s not the same given that marriage has &lt;a href="w%3ATraditional%20marriage%20movement"&gt;traditionally been a heterosexual institution&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡DS: How has marriage changed recently?

♡❤♡DS: That was here in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20State"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: How did you first become involved in the marriage issue and why was it something you decided to dedicate yourself to?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: But why marriage and not immigration, or adoption? There are many areas where gay people are excluded from participation. Why do you personally focus on marriage?

<h2>The gay community and marriage</h2>

♡❤♡DS: It does not appear many gay people are galvanized to fight for the marriage right.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Kramer"&gt;Larry Kramer&lt;/a&gt;, a very prominent gay critic of his own community, has taken it to task for its inaction and focusing on sex and having a good time instead of working to change their place in American society. But you are saying that there is no case of wider apathy amongst gays nor a relative disengagement with &lt;a href="w%3ALGBT%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;their issues&lt;/a&gt;? ♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Do you feel disappointment with the level of involvement of the gay community in the marriage issue?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: In July of 2006 there was a proclamation that went out called &lt;a href="http%3A//www.beyondmarriage.org/full_statement.html"&gt;Beyond Same-Sex Marriage&lt;/a&gt;. It was signed by a lot of well-known people: &lt;a href="w%3ACornel%20West"&gt;Cornel West&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AArmistead%20Maupin"&gt;Armistead Maupin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGloria%20Steinem"&gt;Gloria Steinem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATerrence%20McNally"&gt;Terrence McNally&lt;/a&gt;. All friends of the gay movement—♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: —That proclamation said too many resources are going toward gay marriage. In a similar vein, one Wikipedia editor asked, "Should we be fighting for the ultimate 'prize' of same-sex marriage when most states haven't even given the basic gay rights of non-discrimination in employment, non-discrimination in housing and non-discrimination in public places/accommodation?"♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Have any of the signatories rescinded their support of the Beyond Marriage statement?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What was the motivation behind the letter? People such as &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Kim"&gt;Richard Kim&lt;/a&gt;, associate editor of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Nation"&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and one of the organizers, said it supported the notion that too many resources were going toward marriage fights.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Why not?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Are too many resources going toward marriage fights?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Some argue that marriage fights are "too much, too soon" and that it hurts the other fights; that it causes a backlash.♡❤♡

<h2>The Iowa and Maryland decisions</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Was it a win in Iowa, or was it a brief respite?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Last week, Maryland's Court of Appeals became the latest high court, after New York, Washington and New Jersey, to &lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage%20in%20Maryland"&gt;refuse to grant marriage rights&lt;/a&gt; to gay couples. What’s your reaction to the decision? There haven’t been many gay marriage gains recently.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Why is momentum in your movement seemingly stalled?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: The decision was quite strong.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: But the court ruled against even domestic partnerships.♡❤♡

<h2>Freedom to Marry’s role</h2>

♡❤♡DS: What role does &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20to%20Marry"&gt;Freedom to Marry&lt;/a&gt; play in these cases?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Were you an adviser and consultant to the &lt;a href="w%3AEquality%20Maryland"&gt;plaintiffs&lt;/a&gt; in the Maryland case?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Does Freedom to Marry play more of a coordinating function?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: How do you handle losses such as the one in Maryland?♡❤♡

<h2>Domestic partnerships and civil unions</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Why are &lt;a href="w%3Adomestic%20partnership"&gt;domestic partnerships&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20unions"&gt;civil unions&lt;/a&gt; not adequate?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: People like &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Dershowitz"&gt;Alan Dershowitz&lt;/a&gt; have raised an argument that the word 'marriage' should be reserved for religious contexts, and in civil and legal contexts we should use a uniform concept of civil unions.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: He’s not arguing against marriage, but against marriage as a civil institution.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: People argue that system is already broke. Half of marriages end in divorce. If that system isn’t working for straights, why should we introduce it for gay people?♡❤♡

<h2>Transgender people and marriage</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Transgender people face specific issues in marriage since &lt;a href="w%3ALegal_aspects_of_transsexualism%23North_America"&gt;what constitutes a man or a woman is often legally defined&lt;/a&gt;. How does the marriage movement address this issue?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Do you see the issues interrelated, or does winning the freedom to marry itself usurp any problems faced by &lt;a href="w%3AIntersexuality"&gt;intersexed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ATransgender"&gt;transgender&lt;/a&gt; people?♡❤♡

&lt;a href="w%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; starting from &lt;a href="w%3Apole%20position"&gt;pole&lt;/a&gt; wins the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Japanese Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AFuji%20Speedway"&gt;Fuji Speedway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOyama%2C%20Shizuoka"&gt;Oyama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first race on this circuit since &lt;a href="w%3A1977%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;1977&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Hunt"&gt;James Hunt&lt;/a&gt; won the race for &lt;a href="w%3AMcLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ACosworth"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;.

A rainy and foggy weekend at Fuji appeared to be very hard for all drivers as the race ran longer then expected and the drivers have to concentrate more due to severe weather conditions. The race started behind the safety car which stayed on a track for an unusually long time, about 40 minutes.

Both &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Ferrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; drivers, who managed to get the second row on the starting grid in the Saturday qualifying session were out of the game on the first laps due to their tyre selection mistake - drivers were forced to change to extreme wet tyres after a few driving errors. When the pace car finally turned off the lights giving the drivers a clear road Hamilton quickly got away from his teammate, &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;, who had more fuel on board and thus had a heavier car. Alonso would be eliminated after 41 laps in a driving accident.

&lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; driving for &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; finally leads to a first podium finish for the team in this season, the Finn managed to get second place. On the final laps of the race he masterly defended his position from &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt;, who returned to the battle for podium after the Ferrari start failure.

&lt;a href="w%3ASebastian%20Vettel"&gt;Sebastian Vettel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Webber"&gt;Mark Webber&lt;/a&gt; both nearly finished on the podium, but a collision between their &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Toro%20Rosso"&gt;Toro Rosso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt; sponsored vehicles took them out of the race.

Renault-engined cars did well in the race with &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Coulthard"&gt;David Coulthard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt; finishing in 4th and 5th places.

&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; got a drive through the pit-lane penalty after some dangerous driving and a collision with Hamilton, causing the Polish driver to be rolled back to 7th place. &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; took 6th place for Ferrari in his hard battle with Kubica in the sprint to the finish line.

&lt;a href="w%3AVitantonio%20Liuzzi"&gt;Vitantonio Liuzzi&lt;/a&gt; rounded out the top eight for Toro Rosso.

&lt;a href="w%3AAdrian%20Sutil"&gt;Adrian Sutil&lt;/a&gt; did his best for &lt;a href="w%3ASpyker%20F1"&gt;Spyker&lt;/a&gt;, finishing ahead of both &lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Racing%20F1"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;s. It was confirmed that Spyker will change owners next season becoming the first Indian national Formula One team in history. 

In the Drivers' Championship Hamilton, with 107 points, has increased his lead over teammate Alonso to 12 points. Kimi narrowed the gap to the McLaren drivers, now only five points behind Alonso.

A &lt;a href="wales"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; woman has died in a &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; hospital from injuries sustained in the September 16 crash of &lt;a href="w%3AOne-Two-GO%20Airlines"&gt;One-Two-GO Airlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOne-Two-GO%20Airlines%20Flight%20269"&gt;Flight 269&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3APhuket%20International%20Airport"&gt;Phuket International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the death toll to 90.

Bethan Jones, 22, from &lt;a href="w%3APorth"&gt;Porth&lt;/a&gt;, had been one of 42 original survivors in the crash, which her boyfriend, Alex Collins, 22, did not survive. They were three days into a round-the-world trip when the crash occurred.

Jones, whose family flew to Thailand in order to be with her, never regained consciousness after the crash, which left her in critical condition with &lt;a href="w%3ABurn%20%28injury%29"&gt;burns&lt;/a&gt; across more than 50% of her body. Two days after the crash a military aircraft had flown her to a specialist unit at the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; General Hospital for treatment.

Her family released a statement in which they thanked family, friends and "the community of Porth and Rhondda and all Bethan's friends and work colleagues for their kindness and sympathy".

Bethan's body will be flown home this weekend. Alex's body is already in Wales, and his funeral is scheduled for Monday.

On Saturday, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMajlis%20of%20Iran"&gt;Majlis of Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s parliament, approved a non-binding resolution designating the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CIA) and the U.S. Army as "terrorist organizations", in what is seen as a largely symbolic move. The designation was backed on Sunday by Iran's Foreign Ministry. Earlier in the week, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had passed a resolution giving a similar designation to Iran's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArmy%20of%20the%20Guardians%20of%20the%20Islamic%20Revolution"&gt;Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"The aggressor U.S. Army and the Central Intelligence Agency are terrorists and also nurture terror," said Iranian lawmakers. 215 members of the 290 members signed the declaration.

"Terrorist" acts cited by Iran's parliament included the U.S. Army's use of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20weapon"&gt;atomic bombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="World%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, its use of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adepleted%20uranium"&gt;depleted uranium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; munitions in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABalkans"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and its use of torture against prisoners in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay detention camp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuant%C3%A1namo%20Bay"&gt;Guantánamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib Prison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Iraq. Iran's parliament also cited the CIA's role in training the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMujahideen"&gt;Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan"&gt;occupation of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

If ratified, the resolution would become law, but would likely have little political effect given that the U.S. and Iran do not have diplomatic relations.

A force of 1,000 rebels believed to be from the &lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20Liberation%20Movement"&gt;Sudan Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; attacked one of the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union's&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeping bases in the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, said AU officials Sunday. They added that more than 50 AU pacificators and military personnel are MIA since the attack on the base, although the figure could not be confirmed as the fighting had not stopped.

In what was called "...the heaviest loss of life and biggest attack on the African Mission," by AU spokesperson Noureddine Mezni, 30 vehicles raided the AU base in the town of Haskanita just after the sunset meal which ended the daytime fasting of &lt;a href="w%3ARamadan"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;. The base was completely destroyed.

Insurgents in Darfur have become increasingly disillusioned with the AU peacekeepers, and are convinced that they too often side with the Sudanese government. Several attacks on AU forces have been blamed on these insurgents.

The SLA did not comment on the latest raid of the AU base. However, a leader in the allied Justice and Equality Movement said that they were engaged in combat against government-aligned &lt;a href="w%3AJanjaweed"&gt;Janjaweed&lt;/a&gt; forces days before. Some sources have said that was orchestrated by JEM rebels in an attempt to gain supplies, recognition, and input in the peace talks scheduled for October 27 in &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;.

The Sudanese government did not comment on the attacks, although AU officials said that they witnessed multiple Sudanese helicopters and fighter jets leaving for Haskanita from the Sudanese base in southern Darfur.

The attack marks the first time an AU base has been overwhelmed since deployment in June, 2004. The peacekeeping force has failed to slow the fighting in the region, and do not have the ability to defend themselves from attack. They will soon be merged with the 26,000 strong &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; force, whose first units will arrive in October.

Quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Favre"&gt;Brett Favre&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Bay%20Packers"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; broke &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Marino"&gt;Dan Marino&lt;/a&gt;'s record for career touchdown passes on Sunday, throwing number 421 to receiver Greg Jennings with 4:56 left in the first quarter. The recordbreaking pass was a 16-yard slant route, and Favre had to throw a bullet to complete it. Though the game was being played at the &lt;a href="w%3AMetrodome"&gt;Metrodome&lt;/a&gt;, even the &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Vikings"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt; fans stood and applauded as Favre celebrated with his teammates.

After the announcement of the record was made, a taped message from Marino played on the &lt;a href="w%3AJumbotron"&gt;Jumbotron&lt;/a&gt;. 

"Hey Brett, it's Dan Marino. I'd like to take a minute to congratulate you on breaking one of the great records in sports. I loved holding the touchdown record for the past 13 years, but if someone was going to break it, I'm glad it was someone like you, who has always competed at the highest level and always played only to win," said Marino. "Over the past 17 years, you've been a credit to the Packers, and to the National Football League and to the sport that we all love so much. Brett, congratulations on touchdown 421!"

This historic event came just two weeks after Favre broke &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Elway%27s"&gt;John Elway's&lt;/a&gt; record for career wins by a quarterback, defeating the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Giants"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; for win number 149. The &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Bay%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Green Bay&lt;/a&gt; icon also holds the records for career completions and consecutive games started by a quarterback, which continued on Sunday at 241. Later in the second quarter of today's game, Favre threw the 8,359th pass of his career, eclipsing another of Marino's records. 

When asked about the record after the game, a subdued Favre said,"It's just a number. Am I proud? Absolutely. I'm more proud of the fact that we won this game...I'm pleased it's over, and I'm honored. To play this long, I think, is a special thing and to achieve this is, uh, very special,". He added that, in his mind, Dan Marino is still the best quarterback of all time. 
<h2>Quotes from Around the NFL</h2>
♡❤♡Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Goodell"&gt;Roger Goodell&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ 
"Brett Favre is one of the greatest players in NFL history. He's so much fun to watch not only because of his talent but also because of his competitive spirit. He is the only player to win three MVP awards and his consecutive games streak at quarterback is a tribute to his toughness and passion for the game. Brett has been a leader on the field and in the community and his long list of accomplishments is truly remarkable. We have been fortunate to be able to watch him play this long and we all look forward to seeing him set many more records." 

♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3ABart%20Starr"&gt;Bart Starr&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ 
"It's a remarkable accomplishment and richly deserved. Brett is a fabulous competitor and personifies leadership by example. I've never seen a more enthusiastic player and leader." 

♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Holmgren"&gt;Mike Holmgren&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ 
"As proud and amazed as I am of what Brett is and has accomplished on the playing field, the thing that impresses me the most is what kind of a man and leader he has become off the field. I have taken great joy in watching him develop as a person and father over his career." 

♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Montana"&gt;Joe Montana&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ 
"I honestly thought Danny's records might never be broken. What Brett has done is a tremendous accomplishment. Congratulations you old fart!!!" 

♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Bradshaw"&gt;Terry Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ 
"Brett Favre is the best I have ever seen. And I've never said that about anybody. He's simply the best. He's got the strongest arm, athleticism, field presence, leadership, poise and tenaciousness. He plays hurt, he's fun, he's infectious. He has everything I want to see, including the game-time decisions, the strengths, and all the intangibles." 

♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Young"&gt;Steve Young&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ 
"If you haven't played quarterback in the NFL you truly don't understand just how difficult it is, let alone to be great at it. Throwing one touchdown is hard but to do what Brett has done, come on. You can't give that record enough respect. Couple that with the consecutive games streak and what he has accomplished is beyond imagination. To have one of those records is astronomical and he's got them all. It was an honor to compete against him and an honor to be his friend."

Germany beat Brazil to win their 2 straight Women's World Cup.

Brazil controlled the majority of the possession throughout the game managing six shots on goal including a missed penalty from Marta. When asked about the saved penalty, ♡❤After the penalty save, I felt it was meant to be,♡❤ Germany coach Silvia Neid said.

For Germany, this culminated a tournament where they made history by became the 1 team to successfully defend their championship and didn't give up a single goal over the entire 540 minutes of play during the tournament. The last Goal that Germany gave up was in the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup"&gt;2003 FIFA Women's World Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final when Sweden's &lt;a href="w%3AHanna%20Ljungberg"&gt;Hanna Ljungberg&lt;/a&gt; scored in the 41 minute.
<h2>Quotes</h2>
♡❤♡Silvia Neid, Germany coach:♡❤♡ "It was an evenly-balanced match in terms of chances, Brazil might even have had more, but we worked as a team, came out strongly in the second half and scored at the right time. Once Nadine Angerer saved the penalty, I was always confident we wouldn't concede. We worked together well, we stood tight in defence, we were close to our opponents and there was a determination there not to concede any goals. Before the tournament, we asked all the players to work."
&lt;BR&gt;♡❤♡Jorge Barcellos, Brazil coach:♡❤♡ It was a very tough game for us and one in which we missed lot of very good chances. The Germans only had a few chances but they took theirs well. This was especially important in the second half when we were one down and Marta missed such a critical penalty. But it's clear my players tried their best and I can only say I'm very sad with the result. The players are eager to win and that will help them play better in future.
&lt;BR&gt;♡❤♡Nadine Angerer, Germany goalkeeper:♡❤♡ I watched Brazil's game against Australia and although that time Marta went for the right corner with her penalty, I had a feeling that this time she would go for the left. So I decided to wait as long as possible - and it was the right decision.
&lt;BR&gt;♡❤♡Cristiane, Brazil forward:♡❤♡ Today we didn't play very well, we couldn't take our chances and Germany did, so that was the difference. It was a sad day but this team has done a very good job, we have 21 very talented players and I think we have given a very good example to the girls in Brazil.

Three large &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; hit Sunday near &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGuam"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt; in remote parts of the South &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS). 

The first quake which happened at 2:08 (UTC) was a &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20Magnitude%20Scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 6.8 and located 345 kilometers (215 miles) south, southeast of &lt;a href="w%3AHag%C3%A5t%C3%B1a%2C%20Guam"&gt;Hagåtña, Guam&lt;/a&gt;. The second occurred at 5:23 (UTC) and was a magnitude 7.3 and located 200 k.m. (125 miles) northwest of Auckland Island, New Zealand. The third occurred at 9:47 (UTC), also a magnitude 6.8, was located 235 km (145 miles) west, northwest of Auckland Island, New Zealand. All three of the quake's epicenters were less than ten miles deep.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s (NOAA) &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu%2C%20Hawaii"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, none of the quakes caused a tsunami, though local advisories were issued.

There was no damage, injuries or deaths reported in any of the quakes.

&lt;span id="France"/&gt;&lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; eased to a 64-7 win over to finish second in Pool D. &lt;a href="w%3ACl%C3%A9ment%20Poitrenaud"&gt;Clément Poitrenaud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYannick%20Nyanga"&gt;Yannick Nyanga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALionel%20Beauxis"&gt;Lionel Beauxis&lt;/a&gt; each scored tries as France led 30-0 at half time. After the interval &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A9bastien%20Bruno"&gt;Sébastien Bruno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALionel%20Nallet"&gt;Lionel Nallet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AR%C3%A9my%20Martin"&gt;Rémy Martin&lt;/a&gt; scored tries while &lt;a href="w%3AChristophe%20Dominici"&gt;Christophe Dominici&lt;/a&gt; added two. Zviad Maisuradze scored a try to give Georgia their only points of the match. &lt;a href="w%3AJulien%20Bonnaire"&gt;Julien Bonnaire&lt;/a&gt; scored a late try to wrap up the win for France, who face New Zealand in the quarter finals.

&lt;span id="Argentina"/&gt;&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; were eliminated from the pool stages for the first time as they fell 15-30 to &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ALucas%20Borges"&gt;Lucas Borges&lt;/a&gt; was the first to score for Argentina before &lt;a href="w%3ARonan%20O%27Gara"&gt;Ronan O'Gara&lt;/a&gt; scored a penalty for Ireland. &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Mart%C3%ADn%20Hern%C3%A1ndez"&gt;Juan Martín Hernández&lt;/a&gt; kicked a drop goal soon afterwards as Argentina led 8-3. Ireland briefly took the lead when &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20O%27Driscoll"&gt;Brian O'Driscoll&lt;/a&gt; scored, but another drop goal from Hernández and a &lt;a href="w%3AHoracio%20Agulla"&gt;Horacio Agulla&lt;/a&gt; try meant that Argentina went into half time leading 18-10. &lt;a href="w%3AGeordan%20Murphy"&gt;Geordan Murphy&lt;/a&gt; scored a try for Ireland after the interval but Argentina were victorious after &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Contepomi"&gt;Felipe Contepomi&lt;/a&gt; kicked three penalties and Hernández scored his third drop goal of the match. Argentina will play Scotland in the quarter finals, while Ireland have automatically qualified for the 2011 World Cup by finishing third in Pool D.

&lt;span id="South Africa"/&gt;Pool A winners &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; comfortably defeated the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; 64-15. South Africa scored nine tries, with &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Habana"&gt;Bryan Habana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJaque%20Fourie"&gt;Jaque Fourie&lt;/a&gt; each scoring two. &lt;a href="w%3ATakudzwa%20Ngwenya"&gt;Takudzwa Ngwenya&lt;/a&gt; and Chris Wyles both added tries for the Americans. South Africa face Fiji in the quarter finals, while Australia and England complete the quarter finals lineup.

<h1>Vivien Goldman: An interview with the Punk Professor</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AVivien%20Goldman"&gt;Vivien Goldman&lt;/a&gt; recalls with a laugh the day in 1984 when she saw her death, but the laugh fades as she becomes lost in the memory. She was in Nigeria staying in &lt;a href="w%3AFela%20Kuti"&gt;Fela Kuti&lt;/a&gt;'s home; she had just arrived hours before and found people sleeping everywhere like house cats when &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammadu%20Buhari"&gt;Muhammadu Buhari&lt;/a&gt;'s army showed up to haul everyone to jail. Kuti was an opponent of the government who was in jail, and they came to arrest his coterie of supporters. They grabbed Goldman and were about to throw her in a truck until &lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Imbert"&gt;Pascal Imbert&lt;/a&gt;, Kuti's manager, yelled out, "♡❤Leave her alone. She just arrived from Paris! She's my wife! She knows nothing!♡❤ "

Goldman stops for a moment and then smiles plainly. "They thought I was just some stupid woman... That time sexism worked in my favor."

Vivien Goldman has become a living, teaching testimony of the golden era of punk and reggae. She is an &lt;a href="w%3AAdjunct%20professor"&gt;adjunct professor&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20University"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt; who has taught courses on the music scene she was thrust in the middle of as a young public relations representative for &lt;a href="w%3AIsland%20Records"&gt;Island Records&lt;/a&gt;. She writes a column for the BBC called "Ask the Punk Professor" where she extols the wisdom she gained as a confidant of Bob Marley; as the person who first put &lt;a href="w%3AFlava%20Flav"&gt;Flava Flav&lt;/a&gt; in video; as &lt;a href="w%3AChrissie%20Hynde"&gt;Chrissie Hynde&lt;/a&gt;'s former roommate; as the woman who worked with the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Clash"&gt;The Clash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sex%20Pistols"&gt;Sex Pistols&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Slits"&gt;The Slits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Raincoats"&gt;The Raincoats&lt;/a&gt;. 

As &lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; reporter found out, Goldman is one of those individuals that when you sit in her presence you realize she simply can not tell you everything she knows or has seen, either to protect the living or to respect the dead. 

♡❤♡DS: The first biography of &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Marley"&gt;Bob Marley&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤Soul Rebel, Natural Mystic♡❤, was written by you based upon your personal experiences with him, and you have recently written a book about Marley called ♡❤The Book of Exodus♡❤. How difficult is it to continue to mine his life? Is it difficult to come up with new angles?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: You were there with Marley through that time when he really caught on; was it obvious to you then that there was something amazing and unique happening?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Warhol’s Factory photographer, &lt;a href="w%3ABilly%20Name"&gt;Billy Name&lt;/a&gt;, once told me he knew that what was going on was amazing, but he never thought Warhol would become the entire ♡❤fabric♡❤ of the art world as he is now.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: But Marley has become a fabric of sorts...♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: How do you define punk?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What is the commodified version of punk selling?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: That aesthetic is everywhere, as though if one spikes his hair he is punk.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Your philosophy is that punk is not just musical, but also an aesthetic. That it can imbibe anything; that it stands for change and for changing a system. Let me give you a few names, and you to tell me how you think they are or are not punk. &lt;a href="w%3ABritney%20Spears"&gt;Britney Spears&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AKanye%20West"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Is the definition of punk relative, then? He's a &lt;a href="w%3AMadrasah"&gt;Madrasah&lt;/a&gt; punk but not a &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; punk?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3APete%20Doherty"&gt;Pete Doherty&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: If punk is about change, then why the maudlin sentimentality over the closing of &lt;a href="w%3ACBGB"&gt;CBGB&lt;/a&gt;'s, which at times turned into demonizing a homeless shelter?

♡❤♡DS: I felt it was what it was at a certain moment, but it wasn't that anymore. They were charging eight dollars for a beer. That's not very punk, and that wasn't attracting the punk crowds. It was like people who move to the Bowery because they think it's so edgy but it's really a boulevard of glittering condos. ♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Where do you think New York's culture is going? There are so few places on Earth with such a large concentration of creatives who meet and influence each other, but the city is becoming less affordable and cleansed of any grit. Is there a place for punk in the Manhattan of the future?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: You're friends with Flava Flav, right?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: At the time he wasn't known?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Do you think apathy is a problem today?

♡❤♡DS: What about &lt;a href="w%3AG.%20G.%20Allin"&gt;G. G. Allin&lt;/a&gt;? He used to defecate on the stage to make a point.

♡❤♡DS: Well, he's dead. Do you think people are afraid to speak out today?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Is violence for the cause of social change punk?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Bernhard"&gt;Sandra Bernhard&lt;/a&gt; once did an homage to what she called the ♡❤Big-Tittied Bitches of Rock n' Roll♡❤: Heart, Joan Jett, Stevie Nicks. She mourned that there were no big-tittied bitches left. Who are the big-tittied bitches of Rock n' Roll today?

♡❤♡DS: Do you have moments of extreme self-doubt where you wonder if anything you do matters to anyone?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: You have worked for two corporations that are seen by many as the least punk in their respective communities, the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20University"&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt;. How does one remain punk in such environments?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Have you ever been in a situation where you feared for your life, where you thought, this may be the way I go?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What happened to him in the secret jail?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: In Jamaica there was so much violence during the civil war.♡❤♡

Former &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Coast%20Eagles"&gt;West Coast Eagles&lt;/a&gt; champion and television presenter &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Mainwaring"&gt;Chris Mainwaring&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Mainy♡❤), 41, died in the early hours of October 1. The cause of death is believed to be a seizure. St John Ambulance was called to Mainwarings home just after midnight and found him unconscious. Mainwaring was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Charles%20Gairdner%20Hospital"&gt;Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. 

Earlier in the evening police had been called to a disturbance at the same address. When they arrived Mainwaring was calm and refused assistance. He was placed in the care of a neighbour and returned home.

Police are investigating his death and will report their findings to the Coroner, a standard procedure for unexplained deaths. The street has been closed off and police are interviewing neighbours. 

&lt;a href="w%3ATVW%23Seven%20News"&gt;Seven News&lt;/a&gt; released a statement just before midday about the tragic loss, managing director Chris Wharton said, "Mainy was part of the heart and soul of Channel Seven Perth, and we will all miss him very, very dearly..."

"Our thoughts must go to Chris' family, especially Rani and the children for their sad loss."

Chris Mainwaring played in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Fremantle%20Football%20Club"&gt;East Fremantle's&lt;/a&gt; premiership in 1985, and was selected in the first Eagles squad in 1986. He played in the Eagles first Grand final in &lt;a href="w%3A1991%20AFL%20season"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt; as well as in both their 1992 and '94 AFL premierships. Mainwaring was named &lt;a href="w%3AAll-Australian%20Team"&gt;All-Australian&lt;/a&gt; 1991 and '96 , retiring from &lt;a href="w%3AAFL"&gt;AFL&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 1999 season. 

Mainwaring played one more season for East Fremantle before hanging up his boots and becoming a journalist. He worked in sports reporting for local radio stations before becoming a successful sports presenter with Channel Seven Perth.

He is survived by his wife and two children.

Charlotte Harrison, from &lt;a href="w%3ABeverly%20Hills%2C%20California"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, fell to her death while taking pictures at the edge of a steep canyon after she stepped over a low rock wall at a pull out on the Grand Loop Road in &lt;a href="w%3AYellowstone%20National%20Park"&gt;Yellowstone National Park&lt;/a&gt;.

Rangers were called to the Calcite Springs area, just north of &lt;a href="w%3ATower%20Falls"&gt;Tower Falls&lt;/a&gt; at about 6:30 p.m. on Friday. They could see a woman lying immobile on the canyon floor near the &lt;a href="w%3AYellowstone%20River"&gt;Yellowstone River&lt;/a&gt;.

Yellowstone fire department and a technical rescue team responded. A ranger rappelled down the steep 500-foot embankment to reach the woman and confirmed that she was dead. Due to darkness, steep terrain, and the complex nature of this type of large scale operation, park staff had to wait until Saturday morning to remove the victim from the canyon floor. An autopsy conducted over the weekend shows the cause of death was massive trauma caused by the fall. 

32-year old Harrison and a 39-year-old male friend from &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; were traveling through the park, and had stopped to take pictures at a pullout in the Calcite Springs area just north of Tower Falls when the incident occurred.

This is the second fatal fall at this particular pullout in two years. Harrison slipped off the edge only about four meters from where a woman fell to her death in April 2006.

The incident remains under investigation. Anyone with information they think might help investigators is asked to call the Park Tip Line at 307-344-2132.

A man carrying a bag containing in what reports call hand &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Agrenade"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , nails and "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; literature" was arrested outside the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; embassy in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;.

The unnamed &lt;a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina"&gt;Bosnian&lt;/a&gt; man, who is reported to be 42 years-old, tried to enter the embassy, triggering metal detector alarms. As a result, he placed the bag in front of the embassy and began to run from authorities.

"There were a lot of nails in that bag. Had it exploded, it would have had an enormous shrapnel effect," said a counter terrorism spokeswoman for Austria's government.

Subway trains and buses have been rerouted while officials use bomb-sniffing dogs to search the areas surrounding the embassy.

There are no reports of any injuries and authorities have "secured" the bag.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Presidential candidate &lt;a href="Fred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; will report he raised just over US$8 million for his &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 White House bid&lt;/a&gt;. However, this falls short of expectations when compared to rival &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;’s $21.2 million or &lt;a href="Rudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;’s $16.6 million first quarter funds. Second tier candidate, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; Representative &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt;, raised $1 million online in the last week after initially setting a goal of $500,000.

In contrast, Democratic frontrunners &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;'s respective campaigns received $53 million and $59 million in the first half of the year. Both candidates are expected to have brought in "at least $17 million each in the third quarter."

<h1>Thousands of Monks in Burma to be imprisoned; Thousands more reported dead</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Thousands%20of%20Monks%20in%20Burma%20to%20be%20imprisoned%3B%20Thousands%20more%20reported%20dead&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Several reports coming out of &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; today suggest that thousands of &lt;a href="w%3AMonk"&gt;monks&lt;/a&gt; involved in protests against the Burmese government will "be sent away" to prisons outside of the capital city of &lt;a href="w%3ARangoon"&gt;Rangoon&lt;/a&gt;. Other reports are stating that the number of monks killed by Burmese troops are in the thousands.

According to reports by &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;, at least 4,000 or more monks have been arrested and questioned by government authorities in their recent crackdown on protests favoring &lt;a href="w%3Ademocracy"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt; for the nation. It is reported that they are being held at the Government Technological Institute, the Kyaikkasan racing track and in a prison called &lt;a href="w%3AInsein%20Prison"&gt;Insein Prison&lt;/a&gt;. From these locations, they will be transported to prisons located in the extreme northern part of Burma. The monks have not been allowed to wear their robes and are in shackles, and some of them have been beaten. Many have also initiated a hunger strike, refusing to eat. 

Although the Burmese government reports only 10 monks to have been killed, other reports from activists and media agencies say that the death toll is in the thousands.

Pictures have surfaced claiming that thousands of dead monks have been dumped inside the Burmese jungles. Many of the monks who managed to escape capture from troops have dressed in civilian clothing and have begun to hide inside their temples or have fled Rangoon.

"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand," said a deserter of the Burmese army and a former intelligence officer, Hla Win. He also states that he deserted the army when he was ordered to kill monks in what he called a "massacre of holy men."

"I decided to desert when I was ordered to raid two monasteries and force several hundred monks on to trucks. They were to be killed and their bodies dumped deep inside the jungle. I refused to participate in this," added Win.

An unnamed diplomatic official from &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; also claims that at least 40 monks were beaten to death, then their bodies were burned.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20Gambari"&gt;Ibrahim Gambari&lt;/a&gt;, an envoy for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; is in Burma attempting to resolve the issues there and meet with government officials, but he has been unsuccessful so far in arranging a meeting. New reports say that the government is making Gambari wait another day before there will be the possibility of a meeting.

"He [Gambari] will come back tomorrow and he will meet with the senior general tomorrow in &lt;a href="w%3ANaypyidaw"&gt;Naypyidaw&lt;/a&gt;," said an unnamed U.N. Information Ministry official. Gambari is waiting to meet with Senior General Than Shwe, the head of the &lt;a href="w%3Ajunta"&gt;junta&lt;/a&gt;, to urge a resolution to the violence. This is the second day the meeting has been postponed.

&lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;-based Nordic fashion chain &lt;a href="w%3ALindex"&gt;Lindex&lt;/a&gt; AB has been offered 7.9 billion kronor (€861 million; US$1.2 billion) in a takeover bid by &lt;a href="w%3AStockmann"&gt;Stockmann&lt;/a&gt; Oyj Abp, a Finnish department store chain based in &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;.

The board of Lindex is said to have recommended acceptance of the deal, which significantly outdid a 7 billion kronor (€763 million; US$1.08 billion) offer by rival &lt;a href="w%3AKappAhl%20Holding"&gt;KappAhl Holding&lt;/a&gt; AB, another clothing vendor, in August. The board had recommended shareholders reject that offer as too low.

Stockmann's increase to 116 Kroner from KappAhl's 102 Kroner per share was said by Lindex to be a reasonable price. KappAhl have withdrawn their offer as a result.

Lindex Chairman Conny Karlsson said "We believe that Stockmann actively can contribute with their experience and know-how in order to accelerate our expansion in Eastern and Central Europe.," The chain is one of Europe's biggest fashion chains, operating 350 stores in Sweden, &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, Finland, the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Estonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Lithuania"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Latvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Senegal threatens withdrawal of troops from Darfur</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Senegal%20threatens%20withdrawal%20of%20troops%20from%20Darfur&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ASenegalese"&gt;Senegalese&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AAbdoulaye%20Wade"&gt;Abdoulaye Wade&lt;/a&gt; pushed for an immediate investigation into the deaths of 12 &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt;(AU) troops who were killed in a raid on a peacekeeping base in the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. He stated that he would remove Senegalese troops from the AU force if the investigation found the pacificators were unequipped to defend themselves. 

In what was called "...the heaviest loss of life and biggest attack on the African Mission," by AU spokesperson Noureddine Mezni, 30 vehicles and a force of 1,000 armed rebels raided the AU base in the town of Haskanita just after sunset on Saturday. The base was completely destroyed. One of the soldiers killed in the attack was Senegalese, while the majority were &lt;a href="w%3ANigerian"&gt;Nigerian&lt;/a&gt;. One &lt;a href="w%3AMalian"&gt;Malian&lt;/a&gt; soldier, and one soldier from &lt;a href="w%3ABotswana"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt; were also killed in the raid, according to AU spokesman Assane Ba.

"If they died because they didn't have the arms to defend themselves, I will withdraw all the Senegalese ... I am not going to send people to be slaughtered," said President Wade. This would strike a heavy blow to the AU mission in Darfur, as Senegalese troops make up one of the largest sections of the peacekeeping force. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; also spoke out vehemently against the attack on Monday. UN Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; condemned the rebels in the "...strongest possible terms,", while simultaneously urging a renewed commitment to peace in preparation for the scheduled October peace talks in &lt;a href="w%3ALibya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;. 

The AU has been bemoaning their lack of sufficient funds in Darfur for years, citing a lack of &lt;a href="w%3Amilitary%20helicopters"&gt;military helicopters&lt;/a&gt;, rapid response vehicles, and an inadequate number of troops which hinder the force in their mission to improve the stability of the region.

"People did deployment on the premise that there was an (peace) agreement and they were coming to inspect and act as observers -- there was no planning for people to be able to defend themselves," AU force commander Martin Agwai said. In addition, he said that while the AU was in the process of creating new emergency security plans, not much more could be done without an increase to the funds and troop levels of the bases in Darfur. This will hopefully come with the deployment of the hybrid &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20African%20Union%20Mission%20in%20Darfur"&gt;United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur&lt;/a&gt; (UNAMID) force by the end of the year, which will raise the troop levels from 7,000 to 26,000 soldiers.

As for the interim time period, Agwai added that, "We peacekeepers are determined to continue,".

&lt;a href="w%3ANokia"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, the mobile phone manufacturer based in &lt;a href="w%3ANokia%2C%20Finland"&gt;Nokia, Finland&lt;/a&gt;, has negotiated the takeover of &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeographic%20Information%20Systems"&gt;Geographic Information Systems&lt;/a&gt; software development company &lt;a href="w%3ANavteq"&gt;Navteq&lt;/a&gt; for US$8.1 billion.

Nokia are paying $78 per share in Navteq, who employs 3,000 people and operates 168 offices spread across 20 countries. Nokia, meanwhile, is the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer.

The price comes in at only three cents a share more than current stock market prices, but these prices have recently risen steeply after rumours surfaced that the company may be subject to a takeover deal. However, share prices fell 1.7% after the deal was confirmed as fact.

“Location based services are one of the cornerstones of Nokia's Internet services strategy. By joining forces with Navteq, we will be able to bring context and geographical information to a number of our Internet services with accelerated time to market,” said a statement by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, Nokia's chief executive. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3AMarketWatch"&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/a&gt; had a slightly different take on events, using the headline “Nokia bets men will spend anything to avoid asking directions.”

&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Memphis"&gt;University of Memphis&lt;/a&gt; football player Taylor Bradford died after being the victim of what police are calling a targeted attack. The shooting occurred near a campus housing complex Sunday night at 9:45 p.m. (10:45 EST)

Bradford hailed from &lt;a href="w%3ANashville%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Nashville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and transferred to Memphis in 2006.

Following the shooting, Bradford got into his car and attempted to drive away before crashing a short distance away. Regional Medical Center Memphis spokeswoman Sandy Snell said Bradford was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead shortly after 10:15 p.m. University President Shirley Raines said the student body was notified at 3:44 a.m. via a mass text message. Raines also said, "This was an act directed specifically toward the victim and it was not a random act of violence."

No suspects have been named in the shooting.

The campus was locked down for a short time following the shooting of the 21-year-old junior defensive lineman. University spokesman Curt Gunther said classes were canceled as a precaution.

The University's football team, The Memphis Tigers, will play tomorrow night at home against &lt;a href="w%3AMarshall%20University"&gt;Marshall University&lt;/a&gt;, as scheduled. The team's head coach Tommy West said, "Our entire football team is deeply saddened by the loss of Taylor... He was well respected and a popular member of our team."

Classes are expected to resume on Tuesday, and police say that the investigation will continue.

&lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoh%20Moo-hyun"&gt;Roh Moo-hyun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; left &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeoul"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yesterday to meet with &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;'s leader &lt;a href="Kim%20Jong-il"&gt;Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the future of the divided peninsula. Although the 1950&amp;ndash;1953 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20War"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between the two sides has never formally ended, the meeting may prepare the ground for a permanent truce. The meeting is only the second summit between the two sides. The first summit took place in 2000, and led to former South Korean President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Dae-jung"&gt;Kim Dae-jung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; winning the &lt;a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; for his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASunshine%20Policy"&gt;Sunshine Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of reconciliation with the North.

"How to make peace take root on the &lt;a href="Korean%20Peninsula"&gt;Korean Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; will be the top-priority agenda item for the summit," Roh said in a speech on Monday. He added that "It will not be an uneventful course, but once discussions on a peace regime get under way in earnest, we can take up building military confidence and a peace treaty, and furthermore the issue of arms reduction." Roh said that the top item on his agenda was establishing greater peace along the border between the two countries.

South Korea has only limited ability to seek a peace treaty because it was not a signatory to the ceasefire that ended the Korean War, which was signed by U.S.-led forces. "I do not believe that the peace regime could be actually resolved through the two parties alone," South Korean Unification Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Jae-joung"&gt;Lee Jae-joung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said at a news conference in Seoul. &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has said that he would be willing to discuss a peace treaty if North Korea were to give up its atomic arms.

One issue that is not part of the summit's agenda is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;North Korea's nuclear program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which is the subject of ongoing talks between multiple nations. South Korean officials also do not intend to discuss North Korea's widely-criticized &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20rights%20in%20North%20Korea"&gt;human rights record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Australian Federal Health Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; today called for the establishment of independent boards to govern hospitals. The changes will be part of the next five-year Commonwealth-state health agreement Federal funding would be withdrawn from hospitals that did not agree to the boards. 

Abbott says the purpose of the independent boards is to reduce bureaucracy and make public hospitals more efficient and responsive. "The board and [the] CEO will have control over budgets and make decisions about what happens in hospitals," he said. 

Federal Opposition Leader &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; said that the plan would create more, not less bureaucracy. "Not only are we going to have thousands of federal bureaucrats, thousands of state health bureaucrats, but now a new layer of bureaucracy as well," he said.

Prime minister of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; announced during his trip to &lt;a href="Baghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, that his government will be withdrawing at least one thousand British troops from Iraq by the end of 2007. Brown also plans to gradually hand over control of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to Iraq security forces in accordance with the withdrawal.

"What we propose to do over these next few months is to move from a situation where we have a combat role to an over-watch role. Hopefully they will be home by Christmas," said Brown.

There are approximately 5,500 British troops in Iraq, with most of them located in and around Basra.

The reduction agreement was reached between Brown, Iraqi Prime Minister &lt;a href="Nouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;, Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq Barham Saleh and General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Petraeus"&gt;David Petraeus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the U.S. Army in Iraq with the troop withdraw expected to begin in Basra.

Brown is expected to travel to Basra later today. British troops recently withdrew from the city to a nearby base, leaving security in the hands of Iraqi forces.

Pop singer &lt;a href="w%3ABritney%20Spears"&gt;Britney Spears&lt;/a&gt; will have to give up custody of her children following a court's ruling today.

Spears' ex-husband, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Federline"&gt;Kevin Federline&lt;/a&gt;, is to have custody of their children by noon Wednesday.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/a&gt; Superior Court Judge Scott M. Gordon's ruling, Federline will retain custody of the children "until further order of the court."

The ruling came in part by the testimony of Spears' former body guard, Tony Barretto, who said that Spears had a substance abuse problem.

Barretto recalled this memory hours before a concert, "She appeared to be under the influence, she was kind of incoherent, she was looking for her cell phone ... she was biting her nails, her pupils were dilated, didn't conversate well, sweating, acting nervously."

Barretto said he knew Spears did drugs at least twice in Hollywood nightclubs.

25-year-old Spears and 29-year-old Federline were married in October of 2004 and have two children: Sean Preston, 2 and Jayden James, 1.

Starting September 18, 2007, Spears was ordered to submit random drug tests following her engagement in what the court called "habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol."

Spears has also been ordered to spend eight hours a week working with a parenting counselor.

Also, this ruling came ten days after Spears was charged in a hit and run and for driving without a license.

The jury in the &lt;a href="w%3AIsiah%20Thomas"&gt;Isiah Thomas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asexual%20harassment"&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Atrial"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; revealed a guilty verdict Tuesday, ruling that the current &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Knicks"&gt;New York Knicks&lt;/a&gt; coach subjected former &lt;a href="w%3AMadison%20Square%20Garden"&gt;Madison Square Garden&lt;/a&gt; executive&lt;a href="w%3A%20Anucha%20Browne%20Sanders"&gt;Anucha Browne Sanders&lt;/a&gt; to unwanted sexual advances and verbal insults.

In a minor victory for Thomas, the ruling also said that Thomas will not have to pay &lt;a href="w%3Apunitive%20damages"&gt;punitive damages&lt;/a&gt;. However, Thomas' employer, Madison Square Garden, was also found guilty of harassment and will have to pay millions dollars worth of punitive damages to Browne Sanders. 

The ugly three-week trial originated with a US$10 million &lt;a href="w%3Alawsuit"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by Browne Sanders, the former senior vice president of &lt;a href="w%3Amarketing"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Abusiness%20operations"&gt;business operations&lt;/a&gt; for the Knicks. She was fired by the team in &lt;a href="w%3ADecember"&gt;December&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, and following her dismissal she filed the explosive lawsuit alleging that Madison Square Garden fostered an environment of &lt;a href="w%3Asexism"&gt;sexism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Ainequality"&gt;inequality&lt;/a&gt;, personified by the conduct of Isiah Thomas. She stated that Thomas repeatedly called her a "bitch" and a "ho", and pressured her to kiss him and said that he loved her. She also stated that the firing was the result of her filing a complaint about Thomas. Madison Square Garden, and the coach known for his charismatic and emotional demeanor, denied the charges.

After the&lt;a href="w%3A%20guilty"&gt;guilty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Averdict"&gt;verdict&lt;/a&gt; was read, a relieved Browne Sanders hugged her family and friends who were present at the trial. Thomas met with his lawyers, and while leaving the &lt;a href="w%3Acourthouse"&gt;courthouse&lt;/a&gt; stated, "“I’m innocent, very innocent, and I did not do the things she has accused me in this courtroom of doing. I’m extremely disappointed that the jury did not see the facts in this case. I will &lt;a href="w%3Aappeal"&gt;appeal&lt;/a&gt; this, and I remain confident in the man that I am and what I stand for and the family that I have.”

Madison Square Garden is also expected to appeal the decision.

However, the several different investigations, including the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Survey%20Group"&gt;Iraq Survey Group&lt;/a&gt; headed by &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Duelfer"&gt;Charles Duelfer&lt;/a&gt; concluded, in part, that "The ISG has not found evidence that Saddam possessed WMD stocks in 2003..." Shortly after in October 2004 President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said, "Charles Duelfer has now issued a comprehensive report that confirms the earlier conclusion of &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Kay"&gt;David Kay&lt;/a&gt; that Iraq did not have the weapons that our intelligence believed were there."

&lt;a href="w%3ASuharto"&gt;Suharto&lt;/a&gt;, second president of &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, has died today in a &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; hospital at the age of 86. The cause of death was announced as multiple-organ failure. He had been in the hospital since January 4, when he was admitted with failing kidneys, heart and lungs. 

A week of national mourning was declared by President &lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt;. In a televised address, the current president described Suharto as "one of Indonesia's best sons and national leaders who has done very great service to his beloved nation" and called for all Indonesians to pay their respects.

The president is to oversee a state funeral after Suharto's body is taken to his family mausoleum in &lt;a href="w%3ASurakarta"&gt;Surakarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Java"&gt;Central Java&lt;/a&gt; by a fleet of seven &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; planes.

Suharto was born Raden Suharto on June 8, 1921 in Kemusu Argamulja, Java, Indonesia. He was president of Indonesia from 1967 - 1998.

Suharto is survived by two sons and one daughter. His eldest daughter, Tutut, said, "My father passed away peacefully. May God bless him and forgive all of his mistakes."

A fire has broken out at the Moscow State Institute of State and Corporate Management, a five-story university, claiming at least six lives. More than two dozen are said to be injured.

The fire started around 13:00 (09:00 GMT). Some students and teachers were trapped and had to climb out onto trees, jump four or five stories onto nets held by firefighters, or climb down drainpipes to escape.

Helicopters were called in to evacuate the injured and engage in &lt;a href="w%3Aaerial%20firefighting"&gt;aerial firefighting&lt;/a&gt; activities.

Spokesman for the Emergency Situations Ministry, Viktor Beltsov, said that six died and 30 were treated for smoke inhalation, burns and other injuries. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Herald%20Tribune"&gt;International Herald Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ says that seven were killed and 35 injured, although it also quotes its figures from Mr Beltsov.

Bayern Munich defeated Belenenses 2-0 (3-0 on Aggregate) to advance to the UEFA Cup Group Stage.

Bayern Munich, taking a 1-0 victory from the 1 leg, took a very defensive approach to the 2 leg. Luca Toni opened the scoring in the 59 minute, which at this point sealed the aggregate victory with Belenenses needing 3 goals to advance. Hamit Altintop sealed the 2 leg victory in the 77 minute.

Bayern Munich joins fellow Bundesliga clubs &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20N%C3%BCrnberg"&gt;Nürnberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABayer%20Leverkusen"&gt;Bayer Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHamburger%20SV"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; in the Group Stage of this season's UEFA Cup.

&lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Keating"&gt;Dan Keating&lt;/a&gt;, life-long &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Republicanism"&gt;Irish republican&lt;/a&gt; and patron of &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Sinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Republican Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt; has died today after a short illness. He was 105 years old.

Keating, born on &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary%202"&gt;January 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A1902"&gt;1902&lt;/a&gt; and raised in the townland of Ballygamboon, &lt;a href="w%3ACastlemaine%2C%20County%20Kerry"&gt;Castlemaine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Kerry"&gt;County Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, received his education in local schools, including the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Brothers"&gt;Christian Brothers&lt;/a&gt;' School in &lt;a href="w%3ATralee"&gt;Tralee&lt;/a&gt;. Tralee was also the place where Keating did his apprenticeship. During this time he became a skillful &lt;a href="w%3AGaelic%20football"&gt;Gaelic football&lt;/a&gt; player in his native Kerry.

Keating joined &lt;a href="w%3AFianna%20%C3%89ireann"&gt;Fianna Éireann&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1918"&gt;1918&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="w%3A1920"&gt;1920&lt;/a&gt;, during the Irish War of Independence, he joined the Boherbee B Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Kerry Brigade, &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt;. On 21 April 1921, &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Irish%20Constabulary"&gt;Royal Irish Constabulary&lt;/a&gt; Constable Denis O’ Loughlin was shot dead in Knightly public house in Tralee. Keating, Jimmy O’Connor and Percy Hanafin were suspected of the killing, and were forced to go on the run. On 1 June Keating was involved in an ambush between Castlemaine and &lt;a href="w%3AMilltown"&gt;Milltown&lt;/a&gt; which claimed the lives of 5 RIC men. On 10 July, a day before the truce between the IRA and British forces, Keating’s unit was involved in a gun battle with the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Army"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ACastleisland"&gt;Castleisland&lt;/a&gt;. This confrontation resulted in the deaths of four British soldiers and five IRA Volunteers.

Keating opposed the 1921 &lt;a href="w%3AAnglo-Irish%20Treaty"&gt;Anglo-Irish Treaty&lt;/a&gt; and fought on the Republican side in the &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Civil%20War"&gt;Irish Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. He was involved in operations in counties Kerry, &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Limerick"&gt;Limerick&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Tipperary"&gt;Tipperary&lt;/a&gt;, before his column was arrested by &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Defence%20Forces"&gt;Free State Forces&lt;/a&gt;. Keating spent seven months in &lt;a href="w%3APortlaoise%20Prison"&gt;Portlaoise Prison&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACurragh"&gt;Curragh&lt;/a&gt; Prison before being released in March 1923.

Keating remained an IRA member for a long time after the Civil War. He was arrested several times during the thirties on various charges. Keating was active in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="w%3AS-Plan"&gt;1939/1940 IRA bombing campaign&lt;/a&gt;.

Keating subsequently returned to &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; and worked as a barman in several public houses. He retired and returned to his native Ballygamboon, Kerry in 1978. To his death he refused to accept a state pension because he considered the 26-county &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; an illegitimate state which usurped the 1916 Irish Republic. In 2002 he refused the state's standard €2,500 award to centenarians from president &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20McAleese"&gt;Mary McAleese&lt;/a&gt;. After former IRA gun-runner &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Harrison%20%28Irish%20Republican%29"&gt;George Harrison&lt;/a&gt; died in November 2004, Keating became patron of Republican Sinn Féin.

<h1>U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter introduces bill to cut federal funding for Columbia University</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20Rep.%20Duncan%20Hunter%20introduces%20bill%20to%20cut%20federal%20funding%20for%20Columbia%20University&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On September 26, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Representative &lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Hunter"&gt;Duncan Hunter&lt;/a&gt; (R-Calif.) introduced a bill to prohibit federal grants to &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; in response to Columbia's decision to allow &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; to speak on campus. The legislative bill, titled "Restore Patriotism to University Campuses Act", states that "[t]hrough their invitation, Columbia University provided a public, prestigious platform on United States soil from which on September 24, 2007, President Ahmadinejad spoke and defended his wide-ranging support for terrorist activities." The bill arrived at the House of Representatives within two days after the speaking engagement. 

A portion of the bill requests a denial of funds to the University, "for permitting State terrorist access to campus." According to the Council of Foreign Relations in the United States, its country's State Department has called Iran, "[the] most active state sponsor of terrorism." 

Iran's parliament, in September this year, labelled the U.S. forces as terrorists.

Hunter, who is seeking the Republican Presidential nomination, argued in favor of the bill last week. "If the left-wing leaders of academia will not support our troops, they, in the very least, should not support our adversaries," he said. "By hosting President Ahmadinejad, Columbia University openly insulted the thousands of servicemen and women serving in Iraq, most of whom are direct targets of the munitions that he is sending across the Iraq-Iran border."

Prior to Ahmedinejad's speech, U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; expressed a different view, saying that Columbia's invitation "really speaks to the freedoms of the country." "I'm not so sure I'd offer the same invitation, but nevertheless, it speaks volumes about the greatness, really, of America. We're confident enough to let a person express his views," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Vitter"&gt;David Vitter&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senator&lt;/a&gt; from Louisiana, has earmarked US$100,000 for &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana%20Family%20Forum"&gt;Louisiana Family Forum&lt;/a&gt; (LFF), a conservative &lt;a href="w%3Acreationism"&gt;creationist&lt;/a&gt; organization. Vitter put the earmark into the labor, health and education financing bill for fiscal year 2008. The bill specifies the Louisiana Family Forum received the money "to develop a plan to promote better science education." 

Vitter has close ties to the LFF through &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Richey"&gt;Dan Richey&lt;/a&gt;, a former politician and the group's grass-roots coordinator, who received $17,250 as a consultant in Vitter's 2004 Senate race. Also Vitter's campaign paid Beryl Amedee who is the education resource council chairwoman for the Louisiana Family Forum. 

As part of the Louisiana Family Forum efforts to "combat" the teaching of evolution, the group included &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Hovind"&gt;Kent Hovind&lt;/a&gt;'s "Battle Plan" on its website. Hovind, whose education from the non-accredited &lt;a href="w%3APatriot%20Bible%20University"&gt;Patriot Bible University&lt;/a&gt; is widely considered to be a &lt;a href="w%3Adiploma%20mill"&gt;diploma mill&lt;/a&gt;, is currently serving a ten year prison sentence for tax evasion and obstructing federal agents.

In a written statement Vitter explained, "This program helps supplement and support educators and school systems that would like to offer all of the explanations in the study of controversial science topics such as &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; and the life sciences." However, reporter James Gill poked fun at Vitter's admission of using the services of ♡❤Pamela Martin and Associates♡❤, a prostitution service ran by &lt;a href="w%3ADeborah%20Jeane%20Palfrey"&gt;Deborah Jeane Palfrey&lt;/a&gt;, and his recent creationist earmark. "We were better off when Vitter, in between homilies on the sanctity of marriage, was blowing his own money on prostitutes. At least the kids were safe," Gill wrote. He continued, "They will not be if the Louisiana Family Forum gets its way."

The official &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; bushfire season for 2007 has been declared for only three days and already 46 fires burn across the state. It is believed that at least some of the fires have been deliberately lit.

Weather conditions are hampering firefighting efforts, with high temperatures and strong winds helping to fan the flames.

Major fires are currently burning at Little Pittwater Bay on &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney's&lt;/a&gt; West Head, &lt;a href="w%3ACowan%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Cowan&lt;/a&gt; North of Sydney, &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Stephens%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Port Stephens&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="w%3AEvans%20Head%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Evans Head&lt;/a&gt; on the NSW North coast. The fire at Cowan has caused transport chaos as it caused the closure of the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Highway%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Pacific Highway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20-%20Newcastle%20Freeway"&gt;F3 Freeway&lt;/a&gt; and the Northern railway line for several hours this afternoon.

Residents around the fires at Port Stephens and Evans Head have been advised by the NSW Rural Fire Service to prepare their properties for the onset of fire. 

With many of the fires thought to of been started by arsonists, NSW Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; warned that arsonists would face imprisonment. "It makes you sick. There are sadly too many people out there that don't get the message," Mr Iemma.

"They are sick minds who deliberately light these fires, or even to recklessly do it".

A police strike force with 10 officers and two support staff to investigate the fires had also been set up with Mr Iemma stating that if more resources were required, the strike force would be provided with them.

<h1>2007/08 UEFA Cup: Copenhagen vs. Lens</h1>
Thursday, &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="football"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; champions &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Copenhagen"&gt;FC Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; upset &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;'s 5th place finishers &lt;a href="w%3ARC%20Lens"&gt;RC Lens&lt;/a&gt;, beating them 2-1 on home turf after extra time. Lens started the scoring in the 14th minute, when &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Carri%C3%A8re"&gt;Eric Carrière&lt;/a&gt; put Lens one up. Marcus Allbäck struck back in the 76th minute, closing the gap. At 90 minutes, the game was tied at 1-1, and with an aggregate score of 2-2, with one away goal a piece, the game went to extra time. Five minutes into the first extra time-period, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Gravgaard"&gt;Michael Gravgaard&lt;/a&gt; was sent off following a professional free kick on &lt;a href="w%3AAruna%20Dindane"&gt;Aruna Dindane&lt;/a&gt;. But even one man down, Copenhagen fought their way to a &lt;a href="w%3Apenalty%20kick"&gt;penalty kick&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20national%20football%20team"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALibor%20Sionko"&gt;Libor Sionko&lt;/a&gt; was fouled in the penalty area with just 8 minutes to play. &lt;a href="w%3AJesper%20Gr%C3%B8nkj%C3%A6r"&gt;Jesper Grønkjær&lt;/a&gt; scored the match-winner, converting the 12-yarder.

The club of the &lt;a href="w%3ACopenhagen"&gt;Danish capital&lt;/a&gt; is through to the group phase of the &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Cup%202007-08"&gt;2007-08 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, clinching at least another five matches in the tournament.

Other Danish clubs in the draw: &lt;a href="w%3AAalborg%20Boldspilklub"&gt;AaB Aalborg&lt;/a&gt; held Italian &lt;a href="w%3AU.C.%20Sampdoria"&gt;U.C. Sampdoria&lt;/a&gt; to 0-0, qualifying for the group phase as well, after 2-2 in Italy, on the &lt;a href="w%3Aaway%20goals%20rule"&gt;away goals rule&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile &lt;a href="w%3AOdense%20Boldklub"&gt;OB Odense&lt;/a&gt; was beaten 4-3 on penalties by &lt;a href="w%3ASparta%20Prague"&gt;Sparta Prague&lt;/a&gt; after neither team being able to break the deadlock for the 210 minutes of the two ties including extra time in the second leg, and &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Midtjylland"&gt;FC Midtjylland&lt;/a&gt; failed to overturn their 1-3 deficit in Russia against &lt;a href="w%3ALokomotiv%20Moscow"&gt;Lokomotiv Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, losing 0-2, making it a 1-5 aggregate defeat.

<h1>Frank Messina: An interview with the 'Mets Poet'</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Frank%20Messina%3A%20An%20interview%20with%20the%20%27Mets%20Poet%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
In the early &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20games"&gt;Olympic games&lt;/a&gt;, athletes used to run a mile and then recite a poem. The first poet-in-residence of an &lt;a href="w%3ABarnsley%20F.C."&gt;English football team&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20McMillan%20%28poet%29"&gt;Ian McMillan&lt;/a&gt;, remarked that football chants are like huge tribal poems. Generally, though, sport and poetry have never seemed natural companions in human enterprise. Until the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mets"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; baseball team suffered in 2007 arguably the worst collapse in &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; history. To describe the anguish fans felt, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ turned to a poet, &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Messina"&gt;Frank Messina&lt;/a&gt;. "Nothing was really representing the fan's point of view," Messina told &lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Shankbone"&gt;David Shankbone&lt;/a&gt; in an interview. "There's a lot of hurting people out there who can't express what happened."

And to those who read the ♡❤Times♡❤ last Saturday, Messina wants you to know his father never apologized for raising him as a Mets fans. "I never asked for his apology, and he never apologized, nor did he owe us one. I was misquoted in the New York Times." 

Messina's parents taught him about opposite ends of the spectrum of life. "My mother was supportive even when I made mistakes. She taught me to never give up no matter what vocation you choose in your life." Whereas Messina's mother taught him to never give up, his father taught him how to die with grace. He passed away from cancer in 2005. "I got to see a man who accepted his fate. He was like the Captain of the Titanic. My mother was also calm. I was the one freaking out inside. I saw someone who had acknowledged his own demise, accepted it, and died at home. He was a tough old guy. It takes a lot to accept that; it takes a very strong person. Some of the special moments toward the end was sitting with him and watching baseball games."

It is baseball that has garnered Messina attention now. He has performed in 32 countries and 40 states, and in 1993 he founded the band Spoken Motion, a spoken word band. What is striking about Messina is that his work has branched two worlds that often don't interact: downtown coffeehouse denizens of poetry and the denizens of &lt;a href="w%3AShea%20Stadium"&gt;Shea Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. It is Frank Messina who has personalities as diverse as &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Benigno"&gt;Joe Benigno&lt;/a&gt;, the archetype of the New York sportscaster at WFAN, reflecting on love and poetry. "No one would question a poet writing about love for a woman," said Benigno, "but when you’re a fan of a team, the emotional attachment is even stronger..." Benigno sounded similar to avant-garde writer and musician &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Amram"&gt;David Amram&lt;/a&gt;, who said Messina's poems paint "the stark beauty of the streets, the pain of 9/11, the joy of everyday life, the mysteries of love all fill the pages of this book. It's a feast of images and sounds that stay with you." 

I spoke with the person &lt;a href="w%3ABowery%20Poetry%20Club"&gt;Bowery Poetry Club&lt;/a&gt; founder &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Holman"&gt;Bob Holman&lt;/a&gt; called the "Rock n' Roll Poet Laureate" recently in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Square%20Park"&gt;Washington Square Park&lt;/a&gt;:

♡❤♡DS: You have received a good deal of attention recently.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What goes through your head when that happens?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: You have a long career in poetry, but as of late the attention you have garnered is for the Mets-inspired work. How do you feel about having a lot of your work overshadowed by the Mets work?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Can you recite a stanza that expresses how you feel right now?♡❤♡
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤Do you know what it's like&lt;br&gt;
♡❤to be chased by the Ghost of Failure&lt;br&gt;
♡❤while staring through Victory's door?&lt;br&gt;
♡❤Of course you do, you're a Mets fan&lt;br&gt;
♡❤caught in a do-or-die moment&lt;br&gt;
♡❤in late September at Shea&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤As one that's battled hard&lt;br&gt;
♡❤through many a broken dream&lt;br&gt;
♡❤Let me say, "in order to rise to the occasion&lt;br&gt;
♡❤you must be willing&lt;br&gt;
♡❤to go down with the ship",&lt;br&gt;
♡❤Have no fear, no hesitation,&lt;br&gt;
♡❤for Winning shall be it's reward!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤Don't let them get in your head!&lt;br&gt;
♡❤you've kept it up this long&lt;br&gt;
♡❤You're a Mets fan in late September&lt;br&gt;
♡❤and you'll fight til the glorious end&lt;br&gt;
♡❤Cheer the team today;&lt;br&gt;
♡❤(your boys in orange and blue)&lt;br&gt;
♡❤Let them hear you shout&lt;br&gt;
♡❤as they fight for what's mightily due&lt;br&gt;♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

♡❤♡DS: Sports fans aren't known as patrons of poetry. Have you had interaction with 'new readers' through your Mets work?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Moments like that must make you realize you have touched people who aren't normally touched by poetry.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Nicholson"&gt;Jack Nicholson&lt;/a&gt; once said, "The fuel for the sports fan is the ability to have private theories." What are some of your private theories?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: The second-class citizen in a first rate city idea that is found in one of your poems.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: You and poet Ron Whitehead embarked on a "War Poets" tour of Europe. You as a pro-war poet, and Whitehead as a pro-peace poet. Forgive the crude terminology; I realize there is probably nuance in there. In the over four years since that tour has your outlook evolved at all?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What is your feeling toward the Iraq War now?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Do you still feel the Iraq War is protecting us, and that the original reasons you supported it are still valid?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: When you look at the state of the world, what five descriptors come to mind?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: And are you hopeful?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Where do you get that hope from?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Benigno"&gt;Joe Benigno&lt;/a&gt; said, "No one would question a poet writing about love for a woman, but when you’re a fan of a team, the emotional attachment is even stronger, because women come and go, but your team never changes." Do you think that analogy really holds, because you are attracted to the Mets, and you are attracted to women, and the players on both of those teams in your life change. ♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: The difference is that you know what to expect from the players on the Mets. They have defined roles and there is some certitude. With women, as the players change you don't know what they are going to do; whereas in baseball the players have roles and you know what to expect of them.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: You were the recipient of the 1993 &lt;a href="w%3AAllen%20Ginsberg"&gt;Allen Ginsberg&lt;/a&gt; Poetry Award. In 1996 I met Ginsberg at the &lt;a href="w%3ANaropa%20Institute"&gt;Naropa Institute&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABoulder%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Boulder&lt;/a&gt;. I asked him about NAMBLA, the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Man/Boy%20Love%20Association"&gt;North American Man/Boy Love Association&lt;/a&gt;. He told me to follow him into the bathroom. As I stood there he peed and told me he wasn't for having sex with children, but that he thought that age-of-consent laws were outdated, that he knew what he wanted when he was fifteen and that he thought everyone does at that age. He said he wasn't for sex with children, but that it should not be illegal to have sex at that age. When you accepted the Ginsberg award, did you have an issue with some of his political stances?

♡❤♡DS: All evidence is that he was not a predator, but that he was a voice for change of age-of-consent laws.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What's a lesson your mother taught you?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: How would you choose your death?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Have you ever had a moment where you saw your death?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Did you have any realizations?♡❤♡

Prior to the October 8 global launch of the political documentary film ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3AWhy%20Democracy%3F"&gt;Why Democracy?&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Television%20Service"&gt;Public Television Service Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; (PTS Taiwan) held a preview seminar and invited some professionals at Eslite Bookstore Tung-nan Branch, Taipei City today.

"Because we noticed on the importance of the democratic process in Taiwan, PTS Taiwan imported this series film from Netherlands. I hope that citizens, governmental level, and academic professionals in Taiwan can learn some experiences from the series movie." Yuan-huei Hu said. "Without democracy, Teng-hui Lee and Shui-bian Chen won't be the elected President of the Republic of China." Ron Chen remarked at opening.

At the Executive Panel, Thomas Peng pointed out problems of politics and democratic process in Taiwan, and mentioned the disadvantage such as bribery at voting and process of a election on the movie "Please Vote For Me" ever happened in Taiwan. "Democracy has its advantage or not." Peng said. "A leader should play a suitable role after elected by supporters with their anticipation and understand what they need." Chi-chang Hung said.

Even though the documentary film "Please Vote For Me" is directed by Wei-jun Chen (Producer of Wuhan Television), but due to the political problem, this film is available world-wide except China. "If we review this film without political factor, this series film exposed some experiences and problems in some of democratic countries." Wen-tang Cheng (Film Director in Taiwan) mentioned after the highlights played at the seminar.

"This series film will be suitable for persons who has a great expect on politics and democracies in Taiwan. Governments in Taiwan should learn some valuable experiences from this series film whether those experiences are good or not. If governmental person can understand those meanings in this film, politics and democracy in Taiwan will have a good process." Chien-jen Tsai (Chief Editor of Taiwan Lihpao) said at Executive Panel.

After the seminar, PTS Taiwan predicted that more than 300 million people in 200 countries will watch this series film and attract some discussions and topics on politics and democracy. The two sponsors of this series film are Taiwan Competitiveness Forum and New Taiwanese Cultural Foundation.

<h1>Thousands of trapped miners rescued in South Africa</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Thousands%20of%20trapped%20miners%20rescued%20in%20South%20Africa&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

As many as 3,200 mine workers became trapped in the in Elandsrand mine, a gold mine in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; about 50 miles (80 km) west of &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACarletonville%2C%20Gauteng"&gt;Carletonville, Gauteng&lt;/a&gt;, after an incident on October 3. All miners have been rescued, and none of them were injured. The mine is owned by Harmony Gold Mining Corporation.

The mining company says that a lift electrical cable broke on a basket that was carrying miners, trapping thousands at least 2,200 meters (1.3 miles) below the earth's surface. Reports from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGuardian%20Unlimited"&gt;Guardian Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ say that the shaft may have collapsed when a water or air pipe burst. The rescue operation went well with no complications, with the rescue taking just under 24 hours to complete.

"They were underground when the accident happened and they were not able to surface because an electric feeder cable that is connected to the mine lift was severed," said a spokeswoman for the mining company, Amelia Soares. The snap was caused by a "fatigued" air pipe which burst and fell down the shaft damaging the "steelwork and electrical feeder cords," added Soares. "They are all in good condition."

"They are all safe. There have been no injuries or deaths," said CEO of Harmony mining, Graham Briggs who also said that the miners were previously contacted and were given "food and water."

Earlier reports had stated that Lesiba Seshoka, a spokesman with the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Union%20of%20Mineworkers"&gt;National Union of Mineworkers&lt;/a&gt;, said that the miners have not been heard from for hours and that they could have been enduring temperatures as high as 105 degrees &lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit"&gt;Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt; (40 degrees &lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;Celsius&lt;/a&gt;).

"This is a terrible situation. The only exit is blocked, probably by a fall of ground," said Seshoka.

Rescue workers used a mine shaft that is next to the damaged one in an attempt to reach the trapped miners, and lifted them out, 75 at a time. There was no emergency exit in the shaft which is reported to have "not been maintained for ages," added Seshoka.

"An escape route is the most important thing and they have failed miserably. They need to ensure that the shaft is maintained. This is why we have this disaster. Our main worry is for more than 3,000 people who are underground," said &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Union%20of%20Mineworkers%20%28South%20Africa%29"&gt;National Union of Mineworkers for S. Africa&lt;/a&gt; chairman, Deon Boqwana.

Current reports say that "negligence" was the initial cause for the pipe burst and that there has been a history of negligence from the mine. "We suspect negligence. Because of continuous operations there is no time to make adequate checks," said the President of the Miners union, Senzeni Zokwana to reporters during a news conference.

The Elsrand mine is currently under development and has been since February 2001 when Harmony bought the mine. Officials state that the mine will remain closed for a minimum of six weeks, while an investigation is performed, and the mine is deemed safe for miners to continue working in it.

The mine is located in the &lt;a href="w%3AWitwatersrand%20Basin"&gt;Witwatersrand Basin&lt;/a&gt; of South Africa, which is said to be the location of the largest area of raw gold on the planet.

According to court papers, the attorney and partner of now deceased &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Nicole%20Smith"&gt;Anna Nicole Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20K.%20Stern"&gt;Howard K. Stern&lt;/a&gt; has filed a lawsuit against a former &lt;a href="w%3AFOX%20News%20Channel"&gt;FOX News Channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; news anchor &lt;a href="w%3ARita%20Cosby"&gt;Rita Cosby&lt;/a&gt; for "assault, &lt;a href="w%3Alibel"&gt;libel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aslander"&gt;slander&lt;/a&gt;." Cosby's publisher Grand Central Publishing, also known as &lt;a href="w%3AHachette%20Book%20Group%20USA"&gt;Hachette Book Group USA&lt;/a&gt; is also named in the suit.

The papers say that Stern accuses Cosby of publishing "false and defamatory" accusations and information against him in Cosby's new book ♡❤Blonde Ambition: The Untold Story Behind Anna Nicole Smith's Death.♡❤

"The book is an attempt to capitalize financially on the life and tragic death of Anna Nicole Smith. The defendants have exploited Smith's life and death by publishing false and defamatory factual accusations against Stern," said the papers filed in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; District court for the southern district of &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; State.

Papers go on to say that Cosby also falsely accused Stern of "lewd criminal acts, &lt;a href="w%3Ahomosexuality"&gt;homosexual&lt;/a&gt; acts, possessing and using &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;, conspiring to commit murder, &lt;a href="w%3Apimp"&gt;pimping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aprostitute"&gt;prostitution&lt;/a&gt;." There are 14 other additional charges listed in the suit including one that Cosby claimed Stern was having a homosexual love affair with &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Birkhead"&gt;Larry Birkhead&lt;/a&gt;, the father of Smith's youngest child.

Stern is seeking at least &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollars"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$60 million in damages and the suit states that a jury is requested if the case goes to trial.

Cosby's publishing company refuses to comment to the press on the suit.

&lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to disable its main nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and to give complete details of its nuclear program by December 31, 2007, and "not to transfer nuclear materials, technology or know-how," according to a statement issued in Beijing. The agreement was reached as a result of negotiations involving six nations: &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the United States said that it would work with North Korea to remove it from the U.S. list of terrorism sponsors.

U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the announcement. Bush spokesman Gordon Johndroe called North Korea's pledge "a major step towards the goal of achieving the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." 

Nevertheless, the announcement left some important questions unanswered. "The biggest question is about their uranium enrichment," said Gary Samore, an analyst with the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. "They have agreed to provide a declaration by the end of the year, but there is no process for verifying it. The danger is that North Korea will make the declaration, the U.S. will question it, and they will say take it or leave it," Samore said.

North Korea's announcement came amid an historic summit between &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="w%3ARoh%20Moo-hyun"&gt;Roh Moo-hyun&lt;/a&gt; and North Korean leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Jong-il"&gt;Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt;, only the second such meeting since the end of the &lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20War"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;.

Linking the North Korean and Iranian nuclear crises, U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W.

"We are willing to sit down with him so long as he suspends his program, his nuclear weapons program," he said.

In a historic turn of events, &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Jong-il"&gt;Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARoh%20Moo-hyun"&gt;Roh Moo-hyun&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, have signed the ♡❤Declaration on the Advancement of South-North Relations, Peace and Prosperity,♡❤ an 8-item declaration of "permanent peace," just two days after the two leaders met for a rare &lt;a href="w%3AInter-Korean%20Summit"&gt;Inter-Korean Summit&lt;/a&gt; which began on October 2.

Though not a formal peace treaty, the pact stated that, "The South and North share the view that they should end the current armistice system and build up a permanent peace system," and that they "agreed to closely co-operate to end military hostility and ensure peace and easing of tension on the Korean peninsula."

"We agreed to make a firm commitment to achieving peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula. We shared the need to map out our measures for Korean peace for the future," said Roh.

The pact includes restarting cross-border freight transportation, which had been banned for over 50 years, creates a joint operation for disputed areas of the ocean and also calls for a new &lt;a href="w%3Aarmistice"&gt;armistice&lt;/a&gt;.

The deal invites all "concerned" nations, particularly the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, to the Korean Peninsula to observe the end to the war of 1950-1953, otherwise known as the &lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20War"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders also agreed on the two nations meeting regularly for summits.

Both the leaders signed the pact and then shook hands. They then proposed a toast and drank to the deal in a celebration. This is only the second time in history that leaders of the two nations have met face to face.

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n government has announced that the Gunns &lt;a href="w%3Apulp%20mill"&gt;pulp mill&lt;/a&gt; will go ahead. Minister for the Environment and Water Resources &lt;a href="Malcolm%20Turnbull"&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/a&gt; made the announcement, claiming that the mill would be subject to stringent restrictions. “I have accepted the independent, scientific advice of the Chief Scientist and his panel of scientific experts and have released his report, together with my decision today,” Mr Turnbull said in a media release. 

In a media release issued by &lt;a href="Peter%20Garrett"&gt;Peter Garrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Kerry%20O%27Brien"&gt;Kerry O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;, Labor stated that they supported the decision. "Federal Labor has always supported a world class mill for &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; that achieves best practice environmental outcomes and reduces woodchip exports in favour of economically beneficial downstream value adding processing," the statement said. However, Labor criticised &lt;a href="Malcolm%20Turnbull"&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/a&gt;'s handling of the decision process. "The original assessment process put in place by Mr Turnbull was completely inadequate – a fact he was forced to concede when he belatedly sought advice from the Chief Scientist."

Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; stood by Turnbull. "I think Mr Turnbull has handled this splendidly. He's consulted the Chief Scientist, he's announced a decision which reflects the advice of the Chief Scientist, and the Opposition has got to say where it really stands," he said in an interview. 

The Greens criticised the decision. “Today’s pulp mill decision is yet another approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act for a proposal which will damage the environment,” said environmental lawyer and Greens Senate candidate for &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; Larissa Waters.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATreasurer%20of%20Australia"&gt;Treasurer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; said today that he was "a lot of fun" while he was outlining his plans for Australia as a possible future &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;.

During an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC Radio&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Costello was asked to say something about himself that the public didn't know. Mr Costello's replied "That I'm a lot of fun - a lot of fun and good company."

Costello, who is considered current Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard's&lt;/a&gt; likely successor when he retires, said he was not expecting an easy rise to the Prime Ministership, admitting that the forthcoming &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;federal election&lt;/a&gt; would be difficult.

The treasurer said "If you read polls, then (Kevin) &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Rudd&lt;/a&gt; is in front and he's already carrying on as if he's got the election in the bag,"

"I would say an election is not over until all of the votes have been counted on the polling day, and I think it will be a hard-fought election." 

Mr Costello also outlined his vision for Australia should he become Prime Minister in the future centering his platform upon education and water.

"I think we need first, a first-class technical school system in this country, training people for trades," Mr Costello said. 

"I think we need improved standards of literacy in our primary and secondary schools and I think we need better facilities at the tertiary level." 

The treasurer admitted that education was one of his key priorities as he had been a university tutor and had a father who was a teacher. Speaking of his father, Costello said "I watched him influence generations of students,"

"I know the difference that a good school teacher makes in a person's life and I believe in the importance of education." 

Mr Costello also said that Australia would need to carefully manage its water resources for the future.

"We have to manage our water better, we have to invest in water better, we have to harness water better, we have to price water better," he said. 

"I think we really do have a water crisis in this country and it's something that we're going to have to deal with in order to keep our country growing and our lifestyle up in the decades which lie ahead." 
Mr Costello criticised state governments for failing to invest in water infrastructure and predicted desalination plants would have a major role to play in securing the nation's water supply. 

"There has not been enough investment in dams, there has not been enough investment in pipes, in irrigation canals and I think we're going to have to look very, very carefully at desalination plants for our major capital cities," said the Australian Treasurer.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeelong%20Football%20Club"&gt;Geelong&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Ablett%2C%20Jr."&gt;Gary Ablett&lt;/a&gt; tonight took out the 2007 &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Football%20League"&gt;AFL&lt;/a&gt; premiers' best and fairest award, the &lt;a href="w%3ACarji%20Greeves%20Medal"&gt;Carji Greeves Medal&lt;/a&gt;, well clear of runner-up - &lt;a href="w%3ABrownlow%20Medal"&gt;Brownlow medallist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Bartel"&gt;Jimmy Bartel&lt;/a&gt;.

Ablett polled 691 votes, 178 more than runner-up Bartel, with &lt;a href="w%3ACameron%20Ling"&gt;Cameron Ling&lt;/a&gt; 11 votes back, for 167 in third place. 

Ablett's win capped a stellar year in which he also won the &lt;a href="w%3AAFL%20Players%20Association"&gt;AFL Players Association's&lt;/a&gt; Most Valuable Player award, and was named the Coaches' Association's player of the year. He polled votes in every one of his 22 home-and-away matches, and was voted best-on-ground in seven games.

He joins his father &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Ablett%20Sr"&gt;Gary Ablett Sr.&lt;/a&gt; as a best and fairest winner, with Ablett Sr having earned the award in 1984. 

The award remains elusive for &lt;a href="w%3ABrownlow%20Medal"&gt;Brownlow medallist&lt;/a&gt; Bartel. It was the second straight year in which he was runner-up, having trailed &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Chapman"&gt;Paul Chapman&lt;/a&gt; last season. 

In other awards handed out by the club tonight:
<ul>

You may not know &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Merlino%20%28doctor%29"&gt;Joseph Merlino&lt;/a&gt;, but he knows about you and what makes you function. He knows what turns you on and he knows whether it is a problem for you. Merlino, who is the psychiatry adviser to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Daily%20News"&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, is one of the more accomplished psychiatrists in his field and he is the Senior Editor of the forthcoming book, ♡❤Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius♡❤. The battle over interpreting Freud's legacy still rages, a testament to the father of psychoanalysis and his continuing impact today. 

On the eve of the book's publication, ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter went to the &lt;a href="w%3AUpper%20East%20Side"&gt;Upper East Side&lt;/a&gt; of Manhattan to discuss the past and future of &lt;a href="w%3ASigmund%20Freud"&gt;Freud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Apsychoanalysis"&gt;psychoanalysis&lt;/a&gt; with Dr. Merlino, one of the preeminent modern psychoanalysts. Shankbone took the opportunity to ask about what &lt;a href="w%3AInsanity"&gt;insanity&lt;/a&gt; is, discuss &lt;a href="w%3Aparaphilias"&gt;aberrant urges&lt;/a&gt;, reflect upon &lt;a href="w%3Asadomasochism"&gt;sadomasochism&lt;/a&gt; ("I'm not considered an expert in that field," laughed Dr. Merlino), and the &lt;a href="w%3Aheteronormativity"&gt;hegemony of heterosexuality&lt;/a&gt;. 

Dr. Merlino posits that absent structural, biochemical or physiological defects, insanity and pathology are relative and in flux with the changing culture of which you are a part. So it is possible to be sane and insane all in one day if, for instance, you are gay and fly from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>What is normal and what is insane?</h2>

♡❤♡DS: How do we know what is normal and what is insane?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: And that would be considered insanity?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: So insanity is always relative to a society?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: So &lt;a href="w%3Aeccentricity"&gt;eccentricity&lt;/a&gt; would be a form of insanity in principle, relative to whatever society found it eccentric, since it is a violation of social norms and &lt;a href="w%3Amores"&gt;mores&lt;/a&gt;?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: —is '&lt;a href="w%3APsychopathology"&gt;pathological&lt;/a&gt;' better than '&lt;a href="w%3Ainsane"&gt;insane&lt;/a&gt;' as a term?

♡❤♡DS: So a woman who goes walking down the street naked in the middle of Manhattan, but fully cognizant of it and doing it to elicit a reaction, she has a pathology?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: How often are people who are considered to have a mental disorder or pathology aware that their behavior is thought of as problematic by other people?

♡❤♡DS: Such as a person who has an &lt;a href="w%3AAnger%20management"&gt;anger management&lt;/a&gt; problem? The problem isn't that they are brought to anger, it's the external influences. Even though that they know anger is not a preferable state to be in, they don't see themselves as the problem, even though they know that people get them there is a problem. In other words, my anger is not good, but the real problem is that you made me angry.♡❤♡

<h2>&lt;a href="w%3AHomosexuality%20and%20psychology"&gt;Homosexuality and psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
♡❤♡DS: The declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder was a controversial debate in the psychiatric community, and it is still presented 30 years later as if it is this raging debate, and that it is just activism that was the impetus for change as opposed to any real hard science.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: If the issue was presented today, would it be 58% still, or would it be a greater number that do not believe homosexuality is a mental illness?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: But it still has credence?♡❤♡

<h2>Sigmund Freud</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Did Judeo-Christian outlook infuse any of Freud's thinking, like it did &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Foucault"&gt;Michel Foucalt&lt;/a&gt; in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20History%20of%20Sexuality"&gt;The History of Sexuality&lt;/a&gt;♡❤? 

♡❤♡DS: —but treated?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: How did he discern whether a person's homosexuality was a problem with the person internally, or whether it was an external problem brought about by societal reaction to the individual?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Is his model of &lt;a href="w%3Apsychosexual%20development"&gt;psychosexual development&lt;/a&gt; model outdated as to be useless, or is it still functioning?

♡❤♡DS: How would psychoanalysis handle something like &lt;a href="w%3AObsessive-compulsive%20disorder"&gt;Obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;? It seems like the treatments that have been most successful are &lt;a href="w%3Abehavioral-cognitive"&gt;behavioral-cognitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASSRI"&gt;SSRI&lt;/a&gt; therapy.♡❤♡

<h2>Gender identity and &lt;a href="w%3AHeteronormativity"&gt;Heteronormativity&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
♡❤♡DS: How do you explain the exaggerated &lt;a href="w%3AEffeminacy"&gt;femininity&lt;/a&gt; of some gay men?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Crocker%20%28Internet%20celebrity%29"&gt;Chris Crocker&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; celebrity known for his in-your-face femininity, perhaps falls in that category. 

♡❤♡DS: What is the process by which a person develops a gender?

<h2>&lt;a href="w%3ASadomasochism"&gt;Sadomasochism&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Do you think there are psychological distinctions between sadism and masochism in men?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Freud assumed sadism in men resulted from a distortion of an aggressive component of male sexual instinct, whereas masochism in men was seen as an aberration, completely contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Is that still a function of psychoanalysis?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What is the motivation behind S&amp;M? Pain for sexual pleasure? Gratification from cruelty? Pleasure from power and the absence thereof?

♡❤♡DS: —the &lt;a href="w%3AMissionary%20position"&gt;missionary&lt;/a&gt; gets boring after awhile—

[♡❤A follow-up note from Dr. Merlino:♡❤ The above discussion assumes S&amp;M is a consensual sexual relationship. The gamut of behavior can run from healthy and normal to disturbed and pathological. Clearly sadism in the context of the detached inflicting of pain on others based on the belief one has the right to do so and that others are there to be abused (e.g. rapists, batterers, etc) is pathological. Similarly, masochistic behavior rooted in depression or a self-defeating personality make-up is pathological.]

<h2>Paraphilias, urges and fetishes</h2>

♡❤♡DS: What constitutes a &lt;a href="w%3Aparaphiliac"&gt;paraphiliac&lt;/a&gt;?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Can a person be a paraphiliac and not have it be a problem?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: When would &lt;a href="w%3Across-dressing"&gt;cross-dressing&lt;/a&gt; become a disorder? 

♡❤♡DS: So pathology is almost always defined in relation to your interaction with the outside world? If I lived on an island I could just do anything I wanted and nothing would be a pathology because I am a person unto myself and it doesn't affect anyone else?

♡❤♡DS: What about &lt;a href="w%3AAutoerotic%20asphyxiation"&gt;autoerotic asphyxiation&lt;/a&gt; where a person engages in that activity that can be highly dangerous—fatal—yet they don't believe it? Is it a 'smoker's denial'? ♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: With obsessions such as paraphilias, a person presents things to themselves in a series of questions. What if I'm really gay? What if I really want to seduce my patient? What if I really was aroused by a picture of that child? If someone comes to you and says, 'I just can't get out of my head the thought that I want to kill my baby', how do you handle such a challenging problem?

♡❤♡DS: The difference is between having a thought occur, and actually acting it out in one's head? It's "I thought about wanting to kill my baby," versus, "I'm picturing drowning my baby in the bathtub almost every night I wash her."

♡❤♡DS: I have a personal example that makes me laugh. There is a 60-year-old woman at work named Barbara who I have never met, but to whom I have spoken on the phone. I don't know many Barbaras, but I remember the opening scene of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANight%20of%20the%20Living%20Dead"&gt;Night of the Living Dead&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ where the brother and sister are in the cemetery and to give the sister, Barbara, a scare, the brother starts going, "Baahbarah, Baaahbarah, they are coming to get you, Barbara." It makes me laugh to imagine a scenario of calling this 60-year-old Barbara at work and saying that into the phone. I have acted this out many, many times with my office mates, and it makes us laugh. It's making me laugh now, the thought of doing something that bizarre— 

♡❤♡DS: Behind it is the idea...I would never...

♡❤♡DS: No, she's just another co-worker, who I've never even met. We've just spoken on the phone once. She has a kind voice. But I have acted this out in my head often, as a way to give myself a chuckle. To actually do it would be mortifying. It might scare her and I wouldn't want to do that.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Laughs♡❤] But would that be a pathology, that I've acted this harassing phone call out in my head? And if it's not a problem, is it because the act is relatively harmless, as opposed to wanting to drown my baby?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Such as, why do I find violating a social norm or more amusing?

♡❤♡DS: Is there always a connection? For instance, just that opening of the movie sticks in my head and I don't meet many Barbaras. It was just something that popped into my head, synapses fired. And that movie ♡❤did♡❤ play a role in my life, trust me. But would it always signify something deeper than that?

<h2>Cultural psychology in the United States today</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Have you noticed any affect that the current political culture has had on your patients, in terms of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;? Either in pathologies where the war is manifesting itself, or in just a general discomfort with the state of the culture and society as it is?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What do you mean when you say 'doing anything about it'?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: We have been in this war for four years. Is it important to discuss it?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Do you think people are putting their heads in the sand, or do you think it is too much for people to process what is happening?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: But we respond to it.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: How do you think that affects personality development, that our interactions today are so two-dimensional?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: It seems a lot of pathology comes from people being isolated, living in their own heads and coming up with their own theories absent the interaction of other people. They develop entire systems of beliefs and what they think motivates other people.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: But it's not going to go back. It's here to stay.♡❤♡

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; scientists have stated that an "earth-like" planet is currently forming in a star system's 'habitable zone' just over 400 light-years from &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;. The new discovery was made by NASA's &lt;a href="w%3ASpitzer%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Spitzer Space telescope&lt;/a&gt;.

According to scientists, dust and rock orbiting a ten million year old &lt;a href="w%3Astar"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; in the system HD 113766 contains "enough [material] to build a Mars-size planet or larger."

"The timing for this system to be building an Earth is very good. If the system was too young, its planet-forming disk would be full of gas, and it would be making gas-giant planets like Jupiter instead. If the system was too old, then dust aggregation or clumping would have already occurred and all the system's rocky planets would have already formed," said NASA scientist Carey Lisse from the &lt;a href="w%3AApplied%20Physics%20Laboratory"&gt;Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.
Lisse states that the dust and rock, which was examined by the telescopes infrared spectrometer instrument, is more processed than the snowball-like stuff that makes up infant solar systems and comets, which are considered cosmic "refrigerators" because they contain pristine ingredients from the early solar system, but he also says that the material is not quite ready to form an actual planet, meaning that the material is currently in a "transitional phase" or in a phase just before a planet begins to form.

The dusty material Lisse says, does not contain "any water ice, carbonates, or fragile organic materials," making the star system a fairly young celestial body.

"The material mix in this belt is most reminiscent of the stuff found in lava flows on Earth. I thought of &lt;a href="w%3AMauna%20Kea"&gt;Mauna Kea&lt;/a&gt; material when I first saw the dust composition in this system - it contains raw rock and is abundant in iron sulfides, which are similar to fool's gold," said Lisse. Mauna Kea is a well-known volcano in &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.

Scientists remain excited knowing that they have the chance to observe a planet forming right before their eyes. "It is fantastic to think we are able to detect the process of terrestrial planet formation. Stay tuned - I expect lots more fireworks as the planet in HD113766 grows," added Lisse.

The FPTP system - now used in Ontario- is intrinsically unfair, as the results of an election are heavily influenced by the polls, trends, personalities of the leaders, which affect the delicate balance identifying, in public opinion, the perceived winner.

&lt;a href="Jean%20Chr%C3%A9tien"&gt;Jean Chrétien&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s former prime ministers, received &lt;a href="w%3Aquadruple%20heart%20bypass%20surgery"&gt;quadruple heart bypass surgery&lt;/a&gt; yesterday at &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%20Heart%20Institute"&gt;Montreal's Heart Institute&lt;/a&gt;.

"I just talked to him a few minutes ago. He's well and he's recuperating very well at the moment. His outcome is excellent," said Chief of surgery, Dr. Michel Pellerin.

He could have risked his life as he was diagnosed with &lt;a href="w%3Aangina"&gt;unstable angina&lt;/a&gt;. It is caused by obstructed &lt;a href="w%3Aarteries"&gt;arteries&lt;/a&gt;, which causes &lt;a href="w%3Aheart%20pain"&gt;heart pain&lt;/a&gt; in a person's body.

Pellerin performed the surgery on Chrétien, 73, early Wednesday morning. It took 73-minutes to 90-minutes.

However, hospital doctors say Chrétien is expected to stay in the hospital for up to seven days, and it could take up to three months for a full recovery.

Chrétien was at the recent ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APresidents%20Cup"&gt;Presidents Cup&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ at the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Montreal%20Golf%20Club"&gt;Royal Montreal Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;, when he asked another golfer with whom he was golfing with at the time, luckily a cardiologist, for help.

The golfer told him to see a doctor as soon as possible.

"He was very lucky. He had a bit of discomfort and mentioned it because there was a doctor there," said a friend of Chrétien, Eddie Goldenberg. "The doctor asked him a couple of questions and said, 'You better come and see me.' "

Chrétien's mother, who had heart disease, means that it could have been a genetic link, doctors say.

He had to postpone his speech at the &lt;a href="w%3AAsia-Pacific%20mining%20conference"&gt;Asia-Pacific mining conference&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Vancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="British%20Columbia"&gt;B.C.&lt;/a&gt;.

Police in Britain have recovered a stolen &lt;a href="w%3ALeonardo%20da%20Vinci"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt; painting worth, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (FBI), £65 million (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$133 million).

"Through careful investigations and intelligence-led police work we were able to locate the painting and make four arrests. We are extremely pleased to recover the ’Madonna of the Yarnwinder’ painting," said Mickey Dalgleish, the chief Inspector for &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt;.
The famous painting, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMadonna%20of%20the%20Yarnwinder"&gt;Madonna of the Yarnwinder&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, painted by da Vinci in 1501, had been stolen from &lt;a href="w%3ADrumlanrig%20Castle"&gt;Drumlanrig Castle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, in August 2003, by two thieves who aimed to sell the painting in the future.

Police raided a house in &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland and seized the painting, making four arrests. The FBI listed the theft of the painting as of one of the world's top ten art crimes in recent years.

Midfielder Daniel Cross and defender Tom Williams hauled the woman out of the water and into safe hands.

The woman was believed to have been attempting suicide, and when Cross and Williams threw a life ring out to her, she refused to grab onto it. Initially, the pair were not aware that the woman was suicidal, and only intervened after hearing calls for help from bystanders.

Chief executive of the team Campbell Rose said that "The boys are in good spirit," and that he was extremely proud of the pair.

Toronto FC ended their 12 game winless streak with a 2-1 victory over Red Bull New York in a tense affair that saw both sides go down to 10 men in the 2 half.

After Maurice Edu's goal in the 18 minute put Toronto ahead for the 3 straight game, the Reds scored on an own goal by New York defender Chris Leitch that proved to be the winner in the game for Toronto. Dane Richards pulled a goal back with 15 minutes to play. Both New York's Joe Vide and Toronto's Andrew Boyens were sent off 3 minute.

&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Fire"&gt;Chicago Fire&lt;/a&gt; has clinched a tie with Toronto FC after their draw with &lt;a href="w%3AChivas%20USA"&gt;Chivas USA&lt;/a&gt; last weekend.

Toronto go on the road to face &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%20Rapids"&gt;Colorado Rapids&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday and &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Galaxy"&gt;Los Angeles Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; on October 13 and will finish off the regular season against &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Revolution"&gt;New England Revolution&lt;/a&gt; on October 20.

The widow and five children of former Chilean dictator &lt;a href="w%3AAugusto%20Pinochet"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt; have been arrested in &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; on embezzlement charges. They are accused of illegally transferring &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;27 million to foreign bank accounts during Pinochet's rule from 1973 to 1990. Seventeen of Pinochet's former associates, including his former personal secretary and three retired army generals, were also arrested. 

Pinochet had been charged with tax evasion, fraud, and embezzlement following a 2004 &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; investigation. In December 2006, he died without having been brought to trial. However, Chilean Judge Carlos Cerda said there were "solid indications" that Pinochet's family and associates had also "participated in the misuse of fiscal funds".

Jose Miguel Vivanco of &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; called the decision "an extremely important development for Chile's democracy and the rule of law. Going after the relatives of the powerful and the fortunes they amassed used to be considered off limits," he said.

Pinochet family lawyer Pablo Rodriguez said he was "astonished by this illegal and abusive decision by the judge", and that he was "sure that it will be reversed by the Court of Appeals."

<h1>Construction on massive radio telescope array to begin in 2012</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Construction%20on%20massive%20radio%20telescope%20array%20to%20begin%20in%202012&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Scientists have announced that the largest &lt;a href="w%3Aradio%20telescope"&gt;radio telescope&lt;/a&gt; array in the world, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASquare%20Kilometer%20Array"&gt;Square Kilometer Array&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (SKA) is to be built in either &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and will be composed of thousands of antenna arrays that will be capable of detecting the first &lt;a href="w%3Agalaxy"&gt;galaxies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Astar"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt;s formed in our universe. The control center for the array is announced to be located in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester, England&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AJodrell%20Bank%20Centre%20for%20Astrophysics"&gt;Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;.

"The next generation radio telescope - the Square Kilometer Array – will carry on this tradition of innovation. The goal is to construct a network of antennas working at centimeter to meter wavelengths with 100 times the sensitivity of the largest existing arrays. This telescope will play a major role in the following decades, alongside other next generation facilities in the millimeter, optical/IR, X-ray and so on, in further exploring the content and evolution of the universe," said a press released on SKA's website.

Construction will begin in 2012 and cost over &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$2 billion (£1 billion, €1.4 billion) to build. The array will reportedly begin operation by the year 2020. SKA decided to release the details of the array plans on the 50th anniversary of the launch of &lt;a href="w%3ASputnik"&gt;Sputnik&lt;/a&gt;. At least 17 different countries and 55 schools, universities, engineers and &lt;a href="w%3Aastronomy"&gt;astronomers&lt;/a&gt; are expected to take involvement in the project.

The array will be built in one of two locations. The first option is in Mileura, Australia. According to SKA's website, the location is ideal because "only 100,000 people inhabit the five million square kilometers of the interior" area of western Australia, making it one of "the most radio-quiet locations on &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;."

The second option is in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in Northern &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Province"&gt;Cape Province&lt;/a&gt; because of the "dry climate, a good existing infrastructure of roads and power reticulation, a low Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI), low land prices and low operating costs" and "has a appropriately skilled workforce and a well-established telecommunications infrastructure," says SKA's website.

The array is going to be more than 50 times as powerful as the &lt;a href="w%3AArecibo%20Observatory"&gt;Arecibo Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently the largest radio telescope on the planet.

<h1>New Zealand police to charge sitting MP</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%20police%20to%20charge%20sitting%20MP&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Judge Justice Tony Randerson said in his ruling that it was within the public interest to see the "extremely serious" charges laid against the independent MP. Justice Randerson said that the allegations made, "strike at the heart of the administration of government and the integrity of members of Parliament."

Work, worth around &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;10,000, was undertaken on seven houses the MP owns in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASamoa"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thais&lt;/a&gt;. In return, Field helped them with immigration applications into New Zealand. Justice Randerson said, "There is no question that the respondent undertook immigration work for the named individuals and that they carried out painting, plastering and tiling work for the respondent on the various properties."

The trial will focus around two aspects. Firstly, whether the work carried out was undervalued and secondly, if work was being done in return for immigration assistance via a corrupt arrangement and was treated as such.

If convicted, Field will face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail under Section 103 of the Crimes Act 1961.

This ruling sets a precedent in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; as Field is the first MP to face these types of charges. In June, there was a court hearing to argue if charges were to be laid against the former Labour MP by the Crown. In June, Crown Prosecutor Simon Moore said, "The rational for a High Court judge being involved in the exercise appears to be based on the need to avoid the appearance of a ministerial or political interference in making a prosecutorial decision."

At the same June court hearing, Field said he was innocent of all allegations. "I have nothing to hide. I am innocent and it is best that I front up."

When the allegations first surfaced, Phillip Field was a sitting &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; MP. He resigned from the party in February and returned to Parliament as an independent.

The ruling will be appealed by Field's lawyers.

Promoting her new book ♡❤If Democrats Had Any Brains They'd Be Republicans♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3AAnn%20Coulter"&gt;Ann Coulter&lt;/a&gt; told a New York City paper:

She continued, saying that she doesn't think it will happen, and says that she places the blame on single women.

The comment, part of an interview published October 2 in the ♡❤New York Observer♡❤, has gained headlines from numerous media outlets.

Megan McArdle of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Atlantic%20Monthly"&gt;The Atlantic Monthly&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ criticized Coulter's statements. McArdle comments: "Coulter isn't getting away with this because she's a Republican; she's getting away with it because she's a woman. If a conservative male had called for taking away the vote from women, Republicans wouldn't be able to get to the microphone fast enough to denounce him. They know where their political interests lie."

Coulter went on in the interview to blame former Presidents &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; and criticized women for "voting stupidly".

Bayern Munich remained at the top of the table after a 3-0 victory over Bavarian rivals FC Nürnberg.

The win takes the undefeated streak to 9 games (7 wins and 2 draws) and takes Bayern Munich to 23 points leaving them 5 ahead of Karlsruhe. The Reds also boast a league leading goal difference of +22 by scoring at least three times in every home match this term except for 1 (1-1 draw with Schalke).

Bayern made 1 change to the team which won on Thursday's last Thursday UEFA Cup 2 leg match. &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Ottl"&gt;Andreas Ottl&lt;/a&gt; making a start in place of Mark van Bommel.

Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld opted not to Lukas Podolski and Jan Schlaudraff in the absence of Miroslav Klose. Hitzeld placed Franck Ribery up front with Toni.

Michael Rensing was spectator in a the 1 half with an exception from a fumble from a Zvjezdan Misimovic shot. Toni scored his 7 goal with an angled shot after Blazek spilled Hamit Altintop’s 31 minute free kick. Bayern doubled their tally when Schweinsteiger flick released Ze Roberto for a run at Blazek 5 minutes before half-time. Toni completed the victory with a goal from Ze Roberto corner in the 81 minute.

&lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; police have arrested the entire leadership of the &lt;a href="w%3ABasque"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; separatist party, &lt;a href="w%3ABatasuna"&gt;Batasuna&lt;/a&gt;, detaining 22 people in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ASegura%20%28Guip%C3%BAzcoa%29"&gt;Segura&lt;/a&gt;.

Police seized the town and raided a building where 22 members of Batasuna's leadership were meeting, following orders issued by judge &lt;a href="w%3ABaltasar%20Garzon"&gt;Baltasar Garzon&lt;/a&gt;. Among the arrested are senior members of Batasuna as Joseba Permach, Juan Joxe Petrikorena, Juan Kruz Aldasoro and Rufi Etxeberria. Some of them met this week with members of the Irish &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South African&lt;/a&gt; peace experts in order to explore new ways to solve the Basque conflict. The independentist movement has consider this operation a "declaration of war" and said that the Spanish government wants to "end with any expectations of dialogue". The other Basque political parties has declared this action a "political and juridical barbarity".

The operation is the latest in four months of operations against Basque independentist, including the arrest of Batasuna's leader Arnaldo Otegi some months ago and two independentist leaders this week accused of joining a demonstration reclaiming the rights of the Basque prisoners. Lately the Spanish media were rumoring about a major operation against the Basque independenstist, a personal initiative of the Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Rodriguez%20Zapatero"&gt;Jose Rodriguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;.

Batasuna was outlawed by Spain's Supreme Court in March 2003 alleging that it was the political wing of &lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>German trains halted by strike</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=German%20trains%20halted%20by%20strike&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Friday morning, commuters and travelers in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; were forced to find alternative methods of transportation as train drivers walked off the job. Between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. Friday morning, a German court gave the authorization for a strike. The strike was permitted only for drivers of local and regional trains. Drivers of long-distance and intercity trains, &lt;a href="w%3AInterCityExpress"&gt;ICE high-speed rail networks&lt;/a&gt; and freight transports were forbidden from participating due to possible impact on the German economy.

Germany's public workers' union is demanding a 31 percent wage increase that would put the German train drivers' wages equal with their counterparts in other &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; countries. Currently, starting drivers earn €1,970 per month. The union is pushing for a pay increase of €2,500 per month for starting drivers.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADeutsche%20Bahn"&gt;Deutsche Bahn&lt;/a&gt;, Germany's government-owned train system, has so far refused to increase the drivers' wages. They have, however, offered to give train drivers a five percent pay increase if the drivers are willing to work two extra hours every week. The offer also stated that if the train drivers are willing to work even more hours per week, they could be eligible for a pay increase of up to 9.5 percent.

The union has also demanded equal pay for drivers in former &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Germany"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AGeorg%20Milbradt"&gt;Georg Milbradt&lt;/a&gt;, chief negotiator for Germany's state governments, said that giving equal wages to the drivers in former East Germany would be extremely difficult.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=An%20interview%20with%20gossip%20columnist%20Michael%20Musto%20on%20the%20art%20of%20celebrity%20journalism&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

There are two things one can expect on a trip to see &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Musto"&gt;Michael Musto&lt;/a&gt; at the offices of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVillage%20Voice"&gt;Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;♡❤: a 20-minute round-trip wait for the elevator and rapid fire answers from one of the most recognizable gossip columnists in the United States. Musto, in addition to his appearances on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACountdown%20with%20Keith%20Olbermann"&gt;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and the &lt;a href="w%3AE%21"&gt;E!&lt;/a&gt; network, has been writing his column for the ♡❤Voice♡❤ since 1984. He has recently compiled the best of them in a book released this year titled, ♡❤La Dolce Musto: Writings by the World's Most Outrageous Columnist♡❤. He was &lt;a href="w%3ACarrie%20Bradshaw"&gt;Carrie Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt;, replete with a prodigious use of puns, before ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASex%20in%20the%20City"&gt;Sex in the City&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was a thought. His column is a romp through his life, spats and opinions on socio-political issues. As David Thigpen of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Tribune"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ wrote, Musto is "a funny and caustic &lt;a href="w%3Asatirist"&gt;satirist&lt;/a&gt; who masquerades as a gossip and nightlife columnist."

Musto, a &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; graduate, is a rarity in today's celebrity world: he is accessible. He often corresponds with his readers and his public functions are a mix of parties, nightclubs, academic lectures, university panels and film premieres. 

He is friendly and frank, and he welcomes people to join him in his world ("I just got a message that &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Lucas%20%28porn%20star%29"&gt;Michael Lucas&lt;/a&gt; died!" he says staring wide-eyed at his phone; the message turned out to be false). ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter spoke with Musto about his life and his relationship to the world of celebrity journalism. And he did not hold back.

<h2>On writing a gossip column</h2>

♡❤♡DS: What do you prefer: gossip columnist, journalist or celebrity reporter?

♡❤♡DS: Do you have a favorite gossip columnist?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Was it difficult to write a gossip column after &lt;a href="w%3A9/11"&gt;September 11&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: Was there a reaction to that business-as-usual reporting of the column?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: How does that feel when someone acknowledges you achieved an affect you wanted?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: I photographed at the Tribeca Film Festival for Wikipedia, and a lot of the paparazzi photographer would talk in a derogatory way about the celebrities they were photographing, and they gave themselves a lot of credit for making their images. Recently, &lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Adams"&gt;Cindy Adams&lt;/a&gt; wrote in her column a blurb about something &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Greenspan"&gt;Alan Greenspan&lt;/a&gt; said, and then she said something to the effect of, 'and I'd mention the name of his book if he had told me that to me first,' as if Greenspan is going to go run to Cindy Adams just to get a book mention in her column. Is the celebrity press lacking humility because they report on the famous?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: How so?♡❤♡

<h2>On celebrities</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Do you have celebrities who simply will not talk to you no matter what you do or say, because you pissed them off so royally?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Do you ever punish people for an infraction against you?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Can you give an example?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What did you say?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Do you have a sense that celebrities are paying much attention to the war, that there's a consciousness they have, as a community or individually, outside of the glitz centers of New York and Los Angeles?♡❤♡
<h2>On the gay community</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you think you play a certain role in the gay community?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: You are a sharp critic of the gay community, almost in the mold of &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Kramer"&gt;Larry Kramer&lt;/a&gt;—♡❤♡
♡❤♡DS: —not completely, but in terms of criticizing apathy and the party lifestyle of the gay community where they do not focus on meaningful issues.

♡❤♡DS: Do you think that conformity is gone?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: You inhabit that partying, gym-fetish world, the one you criticize. How do you criticize, yet live off of that world?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Were you ever part of that world?♡❤♡
♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Laughs♡❤] —you look a little hung today—

♡❤♡DS: You recently did a column that opened talking about how gays don't want to bottom anymore; later you talk about Michael Moore's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASicko"&gt;Sicko&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and the problem of hospitals over-medicating their patients. Do you think that style of mixing glitz and substance reaches people, or do you think they tend to gloss the substantive parts?
♡❤♡DS: It seems to be because it's a reaction of a community to a health related topic, since you were saying it was a health consciousness that is causing a dearth of bottoms. Bare-backing is still the rage.♡❤♡

<h2>On outing gay celebrities</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What stands out as a story that you did where you were bowled over by the reaction to it.♡❤♡
♡❤♡DS: —You outed &lt;a href="w%3ARosie%20O%27Donnell"&gt;Rosie O'Donnell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEllen%20Degeneres"&gt;Ellen Degeneres&lt;/a&gt;—

♡❤♡DS: Do you have a theory or philosophy you follow about outing?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What about the argument that it is more appropriate for people who are working against the gay community, a &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Craig"&gt;Larry Craig&lt;/a&gt;, if you will?

♡❤♡DS: There are a lot of gay people who aren't talked about in Hollywood now. &lt;a href="w%3AMerv%20Griffin"&gt;Merv Griffin&lt;/a&gt; was an example. Do you not feel the need to spell it out for some people who lead very openly gay lives but that nobody talks about?
♡❤♡DS: But why not write something before he died?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Did you ever come under editorial pressure over those?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: You are pretty accessible to your readers as well, right?

<h2>On New York City</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Where do you see Manhattan's culture going?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Do you miss the old New York?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: A friend of mine said that if you transplanted someone from 1983 New York into 2007 New York they would be ♡❤shocked♡❤ by how many people there are walking around; they would be like, 'Where did all these people come from?!' People don't realize that there were a lot of empty streets back then.

♡❤♡DS: How do you define freaky?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Do you think drugs makes for a fun party scene?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS:' So the people you are hanging out with who are swinging from the chandeliers, they are just naturally that way?♡❤♡
<h2>Musto on Musto</h2>
♡❤♡DS: How would you choose your own death?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: What's a lesson your father taught you?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: It's so true, isn't it?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Has the Iraq War affected your writing at all?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Has if affected your world view?

♡❤♡DS: Hillary or Barack?

♡❤♡DS: Who would be your dream candidate?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: By magic microphone you have to talk to Osama bin Laden, but you can't apprehend him. What do you say?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: How would you describe your style of dress?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: A nuclear bomb goes off, and the planet is wiped clean of everyone else but you and the animals. What do you do now that you are king of the world?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Which animal would you choose first?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Sounds scratchy.♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Would you build a little animal kingdom, or would you set out on your own?♡❤♡

According to recent investigations by the Associated Press and Congressional investigations, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; federal government is not properly handling serious biohazards such as &lt;a href="w%3AEbola"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; in labs. Since the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; the United States has increased by a factor of over 40 the funding for research related to potential biological weapons as well as other virulent infectious diseases, such as &lt;a href="w%3AAnthrax"&gt;Anthrax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEbola"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASmallpox"&gt;Smallpox&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2003, there have been at least 100 incidents involving United States laboratories. These incidents have ranged from missing shipments of deadly viruses and bacteria to accidents in which lab workers have become infected. According to the Congressional panel even where research is going on is not precisely known. 

The recent investigations were prompted in part by the suspension of research at &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University"&gt;Texas A&amp;M University&lt;/a&gt; after repeated laboratory accidents and failure to report serious breaches to the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Disease%20Control"&gt;Center for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; including an incident in which someone was infected with &lt;a href="w%3Abrucellosis"&gt;brucellosis&lt;/a&gt;, a disease which can infect humans and a variety of domesticated animals and is generally not fatal in humans. Concern about safety and security procedures focus primarily on two risks: terrorists obtaining biological agents from laboratories or labs accidentally releasing infectious agents into the general population.

Critics have questioned the influx of new research as being unnecessary, unguided and dangerous both to workers and to the people around them and have pointed to the case of &lt;a href="w%3AJanet%20Parker"&gt;Janet Parker&lt;/a&gt; who was the last recorded case of someone dying from smallpox and had contracted the disease by working in a building with poor containment systems.

A new survey into the world's greenest and most livable countries has concluded that out of 141 countries reviewed, &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; is the greenest.

Some of the top 20, in order, were Finland, &lt;a href="Iceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Uruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. The poorest results went to &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n countries, which dominated the bottom of the table, with &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; coming in last place.

"Finland wins high marks for air and water quality, a low incidence of infant disease and how well it protects citizens from water pollution and natural disasters," commented the study. Other factors taken into account when ranking the countries included quality of education and income level.

Some other results were the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; at 25th, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; at 23rd and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; at 84.

The study also looked at individual cities. Of the 72 examined, &lt;a href="Stockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; came out on top, followed in order by &lt;a href="Oslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMunich"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. A total of four &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; cities were ranked in the top ten &amp;mdash; Munich, &lt;a href="Frankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStuttgart"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADusseldorf"&gt;Dusseldorf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; and French cities &lt;a href="Lyon"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANantes"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; joined Paris in the top ten as well. &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; came in at 15th and &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; at 27th. At the bottom end were mainly &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n cities, with &lt;a href="Beijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aair%20pollution"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; problems earning it the lowest spot in the table. &lt;a href="Guangzhou"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Shanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; were also near the bottom.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Burial%20Ground%20National%20Monument"&gt;African Burial Ground National Monument&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; was dedicated today. It was designated a &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Historic%20Landmark"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, after being rediscovered in 1991. The ceremony opens a monument that cost &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$5 million and features a sunken courtyard.

In February of 2006, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; issued a proclamation that established the burial ground as a national monument.

"The African Burial Ground National Monument will promote understanding of related resources, encourage continuing research, and present interpretive opportunities and programs for visitors to better understand and honor the culture and vital contributions of generations of Africans and Americans of African descent to our Nation," said Bush in the proclamation, vowing to make sure the site is protected.

Many may be unaware of slavery in New York, but it was present, and this monument makes it impossible to forget. The National Park Service estimated that 15,000-20,000 freed and still-enslaved slaves were buried within a six block area. So far only 400 remains of bodies have been found.

It is only the 123rd &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Monuments"&gt;National Monument&lt;/a&gt; in the nation, while there are 110 National Historic Landmarks in New York City alone.

Few artists ever penetrate the subconscious level of American culture the way &lt;a href="w%3ARuPaul"&gt;RuPaul Andre Charles&lt;/a&gt; did with the 1993 album ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASupermodel%20of%20the%20World"&gt;Supermodel of the World&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. It was groundbreaking not only because in the midst of the &lt;a href="w%3AGrunge"&gt;Grunge&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon did Charles have a dance hit on &lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;, but because he did it as RuPaul, formerly known as &lt;a href="w%3AStarbooty"&gt;Starbooty&lt;/a&gt;, a supermodel drag queen with a message: love everyone. A duet with &lt;a href="w%3AElton%20John"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt;, an endorsement deal with &lt;a href="w%3AMAC"&gt;MAC cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;, an eponymous talk show on &lt;a href="w%3AVH-1"&gt;VH-1&lt;/a&gt; and roles in film propelled RuPaul into the new millennium. 

In July, RuPaul's movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStarrbooty"&gt;Starrbooty&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ began playing at film festivals and it is set to be released on DVD October 31st. ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter recently spoke with RuPaul by telephone in Los Angeles, where she is to appear on stage for ♡❤DIVAS Simply Singing!♡❤, a benefit for HIV-AIDS. 

♡❤♡DS: How are you doing?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: How do you like Los Angeles?

♡❤♡DS: Me? I’m from all over. I have lived in 17 cities, six states and three countries.

♡❤♡DS: Georgia, in a small town at the bottom of &lt;a href="w%3AFulton%20County%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Fulton County&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="w%3APalmetto%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Palmetto&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡DS: Do you miss &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: What did that signify to you?

♡❤♡DS: In 2004 when you released your third album, ♡❤Red Hot♡❤, it received a good deal of play in the clubs and on dance radio, but very little press coverage. On your blog you discussed how you felt betrayed by the entertainment industry and, in particular, the &lt;a href="w%3Agay%20press"&gt;gay press&lt;/a&gt;. What happened?

♡❤♡DS: Do you mean as &lt;a href="w%3Acourt%20jester"&gt;court jesters&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: Everything you are?

♡❤♡DS: It seems like years ago, and my recollection might be fuzzy, but it seems like I read a mainstream media piece that talked about how you wanted to break out of the RuPaul 'character' and be seen as more than just ♡❤RuPaul♡❤.

♡❤♡DS: That you wanted to be seen as more than just RuPaul the drag queen, but also for the man and versatile artist that you are.

♡❤♡DS: What keeps people from knowing the difference between what is real and important, and what is not?

♡❤♡DS: of the band Bat for Lashes, and she is considered by many to be one of the real up-and-coming artists in music today. Her band was up for the &lt;a href="w%3AMercury%20Prize"&gt;Mercury Prize&lt;/a&gt; in England. When I asked her where she drew inspiration from, she mentioned what really got her recently was the 1960’s and 70's psychedelic drag queen performance art, such as seen in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Smith%20and%20the%20Destruction%20of%20Atlantis"&gt;Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Cockettes"&gt;The Cockettes&lt;/a&gt; and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AParis%20Is%20Burning%20%28film%29"&gt;Paris Is Burning&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. What do you think when you hear an artist in her twenties looking to that era of drag performance art for inspiration?

♡❤♡DS: You think her answer was contrived?

♡❤♡DS: Has the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; affected you at all?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think there is a lot of &lt;a href="w%3Aapathy"&gt;apathy&lt;/a&gt; in the culture?

♡❤♡DS: Do you ever work the current political culture into your art?

♡❤♡DS: What do you think of young performance artists working in drag today?

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="An%20interview%20with%20gossip%20columnist%20Michael%20Musto%20on%20the%20art%20of%20celebrity%20journalism"&gt;Michael Musto told me&lt;/a&gt; something that was opposite of what you said. He said he felt that the younger gays, the ones who are up-and-coming, are over the body fascism and more willing to embrace their feminine sides.

Manchester United have moved to the top of the table after beating Wigan Athletic 4–0 today. The goals came from Carlos Tévez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney in the second half.

United lost Nemanja Vidić to a concussion and John O'Shea to a dead leg in first half. &lt;a href="w%3ALouis%20Saha"&gt;Louis Saha&lt;/a&gt; injured himself in the warm-up. A patched-up Reds defence saw Gerard Piqué and Danny Simpson included alongside Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra.

An 89 minute goal by substitute &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdin%20Dzeko"&gt;Edin Dzeko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gave &lt;a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg"&gt;Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt; a 1-0 victory over &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHansa%20Rostock"&gt;Hansa Rostock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today.

Wolfsburg Coach &lt;a href="Felix%20Magath"&gt;Felix Magath&lt;/a&gt; made a solitary change to his team which took an away point off Hamburg. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarcel%20Sch%C3%A4fer"&gt;Schäfer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; took the place of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFacundo%20Hern%C3%A1n%20Quiroga"&gt;Quiroga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at left back. The Hansa Rostock coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Pagelsdorf"&gt;Frank Pagelsdorf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; saw no reason to change his team which took nine points from their last three games. Their last victory was against the defending champions &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVfB%20Stuttgart"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The game began in a cautious manner, with Hansa Rostock defending in their own half, hoping to hit Wolfsburg on a counter attack. Wolfsburg tried to take the game to visitors from the former DDR, but they didn't create any goalscoring chances during the opening minutes.

When a 0-0 draw looked inevitable, Wolfsburg secured all three points in the 89 minute.

After the &lt;a href="Bundesliga"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; break, Wolfsburg will travel to and play Hannover in the Niedersachsen derby.

Hertha striker Marko Pantelic missed from the penalty spot when his 90 minute penalty hit the crossbar as Hertha drew 0-0 at home to winless Energie Cottbus. The draw gave Cottbus their first away point of the season.

Gilberto moved to the left of midfield in the place of Lucio. Pal Dardai returned, while Sofian Chahed was preferred Tobias Grahn in right of midfield.

The game began in a cautious manner and it was the Energie Cottbus who created the first chance in the 20 minute, as Dimitar Rangelov tested Hertha keeper Jaroslav Drobny with a free kick from just outside the penalty area. Hertha Berlin got it's 1 chance in the 35 minute. However, Pantelic was ruled offside. Hertha dominated most of the game.

In the final minute, match referee Schmidt pointed to the penalty spot. Marko Pantelic struck his spot kick against the crossbar and out of danger! that was it. Bundesliga takes a two week break because of international fixtures. On October 20, Hertha travel to Werder Bremen for round 10.

Round 6 of the Hyundai A-League produced an interesting first for the competition in its short existence, and something which has been totally against the grain so far this season. In the 20 games so far this season, only three home wins had been recorded, but for the first time ever in the league, all four home teams won their respective matches in a single round. 

The Mariners stay four points clear at the top despite losing its first game of the season against Adelaide, while Wellington had their first taste of victory at home, with the Phoenix smashing Perth 4-1. Melbourne and Sydney are set for a blockbuster in Sydney next week, after both had hard fought wins.

More than 50 people have been killed after a plane crashed in the , causing president &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Kabila"&gt;Joseph Kabila&lt;/a&gt; to fire his transport minister.

The &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n-built &lt;a href="w%3AAntonov"&gt;Antonov&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAntonov%20An-26"&gt;An-26&lt;/a&gt; twin-&lt;a href="w%3Aturboprop"&gt;turboprop&lt;/a&gt; cargo plane went down into a market in the &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n nation's capital, &lt;a href="w%3AKinshasa"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt;, killing 51 and injuring at least 25, mostly on the ground. Of the plane's crew, only the Congolese &lt;a href="w%3Aflight%20engineer"&gt;flight engineer&lt;/a&gt; survived the accident.

The Congolese air safety record is one of the worst in the world, and this is the latest and deadliest in a string of recent &lt;a href="w%3Aaviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents"&gt;aviation accidents and incidents&lt;/a&gt;. According to presidential spokesman Kudura Kasongo, the reason behind the sacking of transport minister &lt;a href="w%3ARemy%20Henri%20Kuseyo%20Gatanga"&gt;Remy Henri Kuseyo Gatanga&lt;/a&gt; is "for being incapable of organising the aviation sector".

Transport Minister Rémy Kuseyo had previously said the aircraft should never have taken off due to a ban imposed three weeks ago on the use of Antonov aircraft in the country due to safety concerns. He feels his dismissal is unjust, saying "Measures had been taken... "I had taken measures, but I am not the one who was to have put the measures in place on the ground."

Saleh Kinyongo of the Humanitarian Affairs Ministry revised previous information that the entire flight crew had been killed, saying to reporters "We now know there is a survivor in hospital. He's the mechanic (of the plane)... He's alive and well. He's talking and he's even been on TV." His name was given as Dede Ngama and he is receiving treatment at the Roi Baudouin hospital in Kinshasa. Previously, Russia's foreign ministry had reported that all three of the flight crew were Russian nationals and were killed in the crash. This has, however, been confirmed as accurate for the pilot and co-pilot.

It is known that shortly after takeoff, the plane experienced technical difficulties and initiated fuel dumping, then contacted &lt;a href="w%3Aair%20traffic%20control"&gt;air traffic control&lt;/a&gt; to request an emergency landing. Aircraft often dump fuel prior to emergency landings shortly after takeoff, as the aircraft are too heavy to land safely with full fuel loads. However, after about ten minutes, the plane suddenly plunged down into a market and houses in a residential area. The Russian Foreign ministry reported that upon takeoff the plane lost a propeller, and that a wing sheared off when the plane impacted a bank of trees.

An emergency meeting of Congo's cabinet was held yesterday to investigate how existing air safety regulations could be improved, including possibilities of better inspections and tougher penalties for non-conformers.

The crash site has proved difficult to secure from onlookers and petty criminals. Local police have already arrested several people attempting to steal scrap metal, engine parts and any other valuables from the fire-scorched wreckage.

The crash has provoked national outrage, with local newspapers using headlines such as "Another flying coffin kills again," and "Congo's killer skies,". The government had promised to improve poor safety standards.

The plane belonged to &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica%20One"&gt;Africa One&lt;/a&gt;, but had been leased to &lt;a href="w%3AManilla%20Airlift"&gt;Manilla Airlift&lt;/a&gt;. The aircraft had undergone a safety inspection prior to it's departure from nearby &lt;a href="w%3ANdjili%20international%20airport"&gt;Ndjili international airport&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Air%20Transport%20Association"&gt;International Air Transport Association&lt;/a&gt; has described Congo's aviation safety record as 'an embarrassment', while all Congolese airlines except &lt;a href="w%3AHewa%20Bora%20Airways"&gt;Hewa Bora Airways&lt;/a&gt; are on the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;List of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have defeated &lt;a href="w%3AIndia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; by 84 runs in the second &lt;a href="w%3AOne%20Day%20International"&gt;ODI&lt;/a&gt; match of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20cricket%20team%20in%20India%20in%202007-08"&gt;Australia's current tour of India&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ANehru%20Stadium"&gt;Nehru Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kochi"&gt;Kochi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.

Australia lead the 7-match ODI series 1-0, after the first match was abandoned due to rain.

After the first &lt;a href="w%3Aover%20%28cricket%29"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, Australia were already one wicket down after Adam Gilchrist was dismissed for a &lt;a href="w%3Aduck%20%28cricket%29"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;. And shortly into the third over, things were not looking good for Australia, after Brad Hodge was caught behind for only 3 &lt;a href="w%3Arun%20%28cricket%29"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt;, and the figures were 2 wickets for eight runs. But things started improving with Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke sharing a 54 run &lt;a href="w%3Apartnership%20%28cricket%29"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; before Clarke was &lt;a href="w%3AStump%20%28cricket%29%23Manner%20of%20dismissing%20a%20batsman"&gt;stumped&lt;/a&gt; for 27. Hayden then, along with Andrew Symonds, blasted a 94 run partnership before being &lt;a href="w%3Abowled"&gt;bowled&lt;/a&gt; by Irfan Pathan, making a total of 75 runs. Symonds was &lt;a href="w%3Acaught"&gt;caught&lt;/a&gt; and bowled by fast-bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth in the 46th over after making 87 runs, and a 108-run parnership with Brad Haddin. Three overs later James Hopes was the third and final victim of Sreesanth after being caught by Rahul Dravid. Haddin survived the innings with 87 not-out, along with Brett Lee who achieved 2 runs.

India lost its first wicket shortly into the third over with Mitch Johnson bowling Gautam Gambhir for 7 runs. India didn't lose another wicket until Symonds caught a Stuart Clark bowled ball off Sachin Tendulkar. Clark then claimed a &lt;a href="w%3ALeg%20before%20wicket"&gt;LBW&lt;/a&gt; on Robin Uthappa for 41 runs. Dravid (31) then fell in the 25th over, and one over later - Pathan (1) who was &lt;a href="w%3ARun%20out"&gt;run out&lt;/a&gt; by Clarke. Harbhajan Singh was then stumped for 4, while Ramesh Powar (17) was bowled by Clark. Zaheer Khan (3) was then caught, and India was all out when captain Mahendra Dhoni was also caught during the 47th over after making the highest score of the innings - 58. Sreesanth remained with not out for 7 runs.

When a fan connects with a band, it's often during moments like a drive down a highway at night reflecting on some aspect of his or her life; sitting at home after a fight with a girlfriend; singing in the shower; or celebrating at a party with her friends. Music becomes a soundtrack to an individual's life, and a connection with the musician forms when the listener is able to peg a perfect moment or feeling to a song. &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;-based mega-member rock group &lt;a href="w%3ABang%20Camaro"&gt;Bang Camaro&lt;/a&gt;'s fan base claims a different level of interaction: they often have ♡❤learned♡❤ to play their music before they ever had a moment associated with it. Bang Camaro found fame on the video game ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGuitar%20Hero%20II"&gt;Guitar Hero II&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, where an aspiring rock god uses a guitar-shaped peripheral to play rock music as notes scroll towards him on the screen.

♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter journeyed to the &lt;a href="w%3ABowery%20Ballroom"&gt;Bowery Ballroom&lt;/a&gt; to talk to the two founding members of Bang Camaro, Alex Necochea and Bryn Bennett. But when &lt;a href="w%3AMTV.com"&gt;♡❤MTV.com♡❤&lt;/a&gt; shows up at the same time as ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ to do an interview, the band must split up. Below is our conversation with Necochea about touring, influence, politics, throwing his corpse out of a plane and flatulent women.

♡❤♡David Shankbone: How's the tour going?

♡❤♡DS: Poughkeepsie, huh?

♡❤♡DS: What kind of crowd is there?

♡❤♡DS: What's that like to have a fan base that comes from primarily video games? Have you noticed a difference between being known as a local band playing in your city and being known through video games? How would you compare the audience?

♡❤♡DS: How does it feel to be looked-up to by the kids, by America's future?

♡❤♡DS: Do you see parents at the show?

♡❤♡DS: That must reduce the crotch grabbing.

♡❤♡DS: Which is a ♡❤lot♡❤ different for audiences of many bands. 

♡❤♡DS: Your fans are so engaged with your music, far more than most bands have. Most bands they have fans who feel their music speaks to them, but your fans can say, 'I learned to play guitar on ♡❤your♡❤ shit and not on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEleanor%20Rigby"&gt;Eleanor Rigby&lt;/a&gt;♡❤!'

♡❤♡DS: At this point of your career, you're not playing stadiums, but you're also not playing Otto's Tiki Lounge on a Tuesday night. When you reflect upon it, what do you think about?

♡❤♡DS: Do you have other areas of your life where you've been able to apply that?

♡❤♡DS: What are some dream projects you'd like to work on?

♡❤♡DS: In the creative process it's so difficult to be original today. Everything has been done. Do you ever let that trip you up, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASimpsons%20Already%20Did%20It"&gt;Simpsons Did It&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ problem?

♡❤♡DS: If you could choose your own death, how would you die?

♡❤♡DS: You guys have been described as &lt;a href="w%3AMetal%20rock"&gt;Metal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGlam%20rock"&gt;Glam rock&lt;/a&gt;. What would you describe your sound as?

♡❤♡DS: Would you say anthem rock more in the &lt;a href="w%3AM%C3%B6tley%20Cr%C3%BCe"&gt;Mötley Crüe&lt;/a&gt; vane or more in the &lt;a href="w%3AT.Rex%20%28band%29"&gt;T. Rex&lt;/a&gt; vane?

♡❤♡DS: Does the war in Iraq affect you artistically at all?

♡❤♡DS: If you had to fight in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, where would you fight?

♡❤♡DS: Are you more inspired by things in nature or things that are man made?

♡❤♡DS: Did you answer any of them?

♡❤♡DS: That's important for a lot of people - you see your audience. You're giving a lot of inspiration to a lot of people. You don't know who you might be inspiring to pursue music. 

♡❤♡DS: What's your favorite curse word?

♡❤♡DS: What's your favorite euphemism for breasts?

♡❤♡DS: Have you used that recently?

♡❤♡DS: I read that you named the band after fast women and fast cars. 

♡❤♡DS: What sort of qualities do you look for in a woman?

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: What would be the greatest of misfortunes to befall you?

♡❤♡DS: Do you have any special things you do to make sure you don't injure or lose an appendage?

♡❤♡DS: That's a conscious choice?

♡❤♡DS: What if you are just walking down stairs?

♡❤♡DS: What possession do you treasure most?

♡❤♡DS: What's your cat's name?

♡❤♡DS: Like ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASexy%20Sadie"&gt;Sexy Sadie&lt;/a&gt;♡❤?

♡❤♡DS: What trait do you deplore most in other people?

♡❤♡DS: What do you think are the greatest threats to humanity?

♡❤♡DS: Who would you get in trouble with?

♡❤♡DS: What would be a bigger turn-off in bed: a woman who spoke in a baby voice, or someone who was overly flatulent?

♡❤♡DS: You'd prefer the baby talk?

♡❤♡DS: Have you ever been faced with either scenario?

♡❤♡DS: At all? Not even if she lets out a little giggle afterwards?

♡❤♡DS: What if she was ♡❤really♡❤ flatulent?

♡❤♡DS: And you've never had a baby talker?

♡❤♡DS: In high school?

♡❤♡DS: What if she was Dutch oven flatulent?

♡❤♡DS: You can always go gay. It's the new millennium.

Police in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; are searching for three teenagers accused of setting a homeless man in New York City on fire yesterday. 

Felix Najera was bedded down outside the Iglesia Christiana Betania on East 103rd Street in the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Harlem"&gt;East Harlem&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;.

Reports indicate that the teenagers threw a gasoline-soaked towel on the man, and set him on fire.

Homeless advocates are calling this incident one of the most senseless and severe acts in recent memory. Mary Brosnahan, the executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless said, "I haven't heard of an incident like this in many years in New York." 

Najera is an alcoholic and often asks passers-by for cigarettes, but many residents consider him to be harmless. 

"It's a shame. He doesn't bother anybody," said Gary Williams. Another resident said, "They don't have no respect for life itself." Pastor Ariel Soto said "it's an act of evil."

Officials say that Najera suffered second and third degree burns to nearly 75 percent of his body.

Najera is 49-years-old and is in critical condition at &lt;a href="w%3AWeill%20Cornell%20Medical%20College%20of%20Cornell%20University"&gt;Cornell Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;.

Police say no arrests have been made thus far.

&lt;a href="w%3ASam%27s%20Club"&gt;Sam's Club&lt;/a&gt; warehouse stores across the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; are recalling a brand of ground beef patties made by &lt;a href="w%3ACargill"&gt;Cargill Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, following reports that four children who ate the patties became sick with &lt;a href="w%3AE.%20coli"&gt;♡❤E. coli♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

Consumers who bought the patties after August 26, 2007 are asked to either return them to the store they bought them from or destroy them.

The four children who became ill sometime between September 10 and September 20 were reportedly sickened by frozen &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Chef%27s%20Selection%20Angus%20Beef%20Patties"&gt;American Chef's Selection Angus Beef Patties&lt;/a&gt; bought at three different Sam's Club stores in &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;.
Heidi Kassenborg, the director of the dairy and food inspection division of the &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Department%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;Minnesota Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; said, "We can't be certain that meat from other stores is not involved, since the brand ... was likely sold at other Sam's Club locations."

Therefore, Sam's Club has voluntarily issued the recall across stores nationwide.

A statement released by Sam's Club said that the recalled patties have expiration date of February 12, 2008 listed on the packages, and were coded UPC 0002874907056 Item 700141.

Cargill Inc. is expected to release a statement on Monday.

&lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; advanced to the semi-final stage of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; with a 12-10 victory over &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in the first quarter-final of the tournament at &lt;a href="w%3AStade%20V%C3%A9lodrome"&gt;Stade Vélodrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMarseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AJonny%20Wilkinson"&gt;Jonny Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt; kicked the defending champions to victory with four penalties, in a repeat of the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20final"&gt;2003 final&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20Mortlock"&gt;Stirling Mortlock&lt;/a&gt; opened the scoring for Australia with a penalty, but missed two other chances to extend their lead early on. England went ahead after two penalties from Jonny Wilkinson, however Australia regained their lead as &lt;a href="w%3ALote%20Tuqiri"&gt;Lote Tuqiri&lt;/a&gt; scored a try in the 33rd minute. Australia led 10-6 at half time as Wilkinson missed two opportunities to reduce the deficit. 

Australia failed to score in the second half, with &lt;a href="w%3ABerrick%20Barnes"&gt;Berrick Barnes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Latham"&gt;Chris Latham&lt;/a&gt; both missing drop goal attempts. Jonny Wilkinson kicked two penalties to give England a two point lead despite missing two more opportunities with the boot. Stirling Mortlock missed a late penalty that would have won the match for Australia. 

England, who have improved after faltering early in their campaign, hung on to reach the semi-finals. They will play France, who New Zealand 18-20, in a repeat of the 2003 semi-final.

A &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMarilyn%20Manson"&gt;Marilyn Manson&lt;/a&gt; gig was evacuated after a fire scare. Four songs into the performance by the &lt;a href="w%3Ashock%20rock"&gt;shock rock&lt;/a&gt; act at Auckland Town Hall, a fire scare caused an evacuation of the venue. On-site security stopped the performer from continuing and asked the audience to leave immediately.

Fire and ambulance crews responded, but discovered that the alarms had been caused by &lt;a href="w%3Adry%20ice"&gt;dry ice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asmoke%20machine"&gt;smoke machine&lt;/a&gt;s.

Manson was able to continue his performance after a delay of ten minutes.

On Friday morning, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; defended interrogation tactics used by the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;, stating that "This government does not torture people." Bush's comments were a response to an article in Thursday's New York Times describing a classified 2005 &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20Department"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; legal opinion that endorsed the use of painful physical and psychological tactics against terror suspects. Bush also claimed that "the techniques that we used have been fully disclosed to appropriate members of the US Congress."

According to anonymous sources cited in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; article, the classified 2005 legal opinion contained "an expansive endorsement of the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the Central Intelligence Agency," and explicitly authorized the use of tactics including head-slapping, frigid temperatures, and the simulated drowning technique known as &lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt; against terror suspects. 

White House spokeswoman &lt;a href="w%3ADana_Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the existence of the 2005 document but did not say whether techniques such as head slapping and waterboarding constitute "torture" under U.S. law. "I'm not going to get into specific tactics," Perino said. She added that disclosing specific interrogation methods could reduce the effectiveness of those methods by allowing terrorists to train to resist them.

Democrats expressed frustration with the Bush administration's secrecy on the issue of interrogation tactics. "The administration can’t have it both ways," said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Intelligence%20Committee"&gt;Senate Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt;. "I’m tired of these games. They can’t say that Congress has been fully briefed while refusing to turn over key documents used to justify the legality of the program."

Stuttgart suffered another setback in their defence of their championship after losing to Hannover 2-0 at home. Two goals from Szabolcs Huszti secured Hannover a 2-0 win against Stuttgart, who were reduced to 10 men in the 7 minute. Fernando Meira was sent off for deliberate handball in the penalty area and Huszti powered home the spot-kick.

Stuttgart struggled to recover from the red card and failed to create a chance until the 28 minute when Mario Gomez headed a corner straight at Hannover goalkeeper Robert Enke.

Hannover would have been two up after 36 minutes had Raphael Schafer not been alert. Schafer rushed out to get the ball at the feet of Hanno Balitsch.

Steve Cherundolo crossed and Huszti was well positioned to score his second goal of the game.

Defeat leaves Stuttgart in 12 place, 10 points behind leaders Bayern Munich who play tomorrow. Hannover, meanwhile, climbed into the top 6 with the victory.

<h1>Oral Roberts University president accused of illegal political donations and financial misappropriation</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Oral%20Roberts%20University%20president%20accused%20of%20illegal%20political%20donations%20and%20financial%20misappropriation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Roberts%20%28evangelist%29"&gt;Richard Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, the President of &lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts%20University"&gt;Oral Roberts University&lt;/a&gt;, and his wife, Lindsay Roberts, are accused of illegal political contributions, financial wrong-doing, and wrongful firings in a lawsuit filed Tuesday. 

The lawsuit was filed by three former professors who claim "they were wrongfully dismissed after reporting the school's involvement in a &lt;a href="w%3APolitical%20campaign"&gt;local political race&lt;/a&gt;." According to &lt;a href="w%3AKTEN"&gt;KTEN television news&lt;/a&gt;, "Roberts' statement says personal expenses are charged to him and he personally pays them on a monthly basis." On October 3, Roberts "told students and faculty during his weekly chapel Wednesday that the lawsuit is about intimidation, blackmail and extortion." 

Richard has been president of ORU since his father, &lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts"&gt;Oral Roberts&lt;/a&gt; university founder and former &lt;a href="w%3Afaith%20healer"&gt;faith healer&lt;/a&gt;, "semi-retired" in 1993.

<h2>Political accusations</h2>
Tim Brooker, one the former professors suing ORU, was employed by ORU starting 2001 when he was recruited by the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Committee"&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/a&gt; (RNC) "in an effort to further Republican efforts." According to reports, over the next six years the program had success in political races outside of Oklahoma, and was financed either by the RNC or individual campaign committees. 

Specifically, Roberts is accused making of illegal donations to current &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20commission"&gt;Tulsa County Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; Randi Miller, a Republican candidate, in her race for &lt;a href="w%3ATulsa%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Tulsa mayor&lt;/a&gt;. The university staff worried that "Roberts risked the &lt;a href="w%3ANon-profit%20organization"&gt;non-profit status&lt;/a&gt; of the university by insisting" students work as volunteers for Miller's mayoral campaign. In May 2006, after the IRS contacted ORU about its involvement Miller's campaign, Brooker said he told to "fall on the sword" while taking "full and total blame." This would have required covering up the directives made by Roberts. Days after the three professors brought this to the attention of the school, they were fired by Stephanie Cantese, Richard Robert's sister-in-law. Cantese also said Brooker's "son would not graduate from ORU."

<h2>Other allegations</h2>
The allegations against misusing ORU assets include Roberts using the university jet and billing expenses for several vacations, using the jet to ferry people for his daughter's trip to &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantis%20Paradise%20Island"&gt;Atlantis Paradise Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bahamas"&gt;the Bahamas&lt;/a&gt; on ORU credit cards, maintaining a stable of horses at the university for exclusive use by the Roberts’ children, having university and ministry employees summoned to the Roberts home to do the daughters’ homework, having ORU staff and security do family chores, remodeling the Roberts home 11 times in the past 14 years, using several ORU vehicles for personal use, and purchasing a red Mercedes convertible and a &lt;a href="w%3ALexus%20LX"&gt;Lexus SUV&lt;/a&gt; for Lindsay with ORU money. 

Lindsay is also accused of spending tens of thousands of dollars on clothes billed to the university, awarding thirteen &lt;a href="w%3AScholarship"&gt;nonacademic scholarships&lt;/a&gt; to friends' children despite poor scores, sending late-night text messages on university-issued cell phones to "underage males," and firing a "longtime maintenance employee" at ORU her "underage male friend" could have the job.

In addition one Roberts' children was video-taped vandalizing and removing athletic department equipment from ORU property. The items, which were beneficial to the Roberts family was not recovered and though Richard was confronted he took no action.

The lawsuit also claims Paulita Brooker, Tim's wife, "was fired partly because Swails had reported that Vice Provost [Jeff Ogle] sexually harassed another professor" and took no action regarding the sexual harassment.

<h2>Responses</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hagee"&gt;John Hagee&lt;/a&gt;, a ORU Board of Regents member, said the university's executive board "is conducting a full and thorough investigation." The lawsuit alleges "members of the Board of Regents are painfully aware- have omitted from this Petition to preserve, as much as possible, the remaining image of the University." Furthermore, the court filing quoted Roberts as saying "if a Regent appears to give me trouble, I remove him. I stack the deck. . ."

On Wednesday Roberts said, "This suit has been filed by an attorney who has over the years filed many suits against Oral Roberts University . . . And he has lost every suit that he has filed against the university." In response Gary Richardson, representing the plaintiffs, noted he was involved in only one lawsuit involving ORU, involving its hospital building, and it was settled before trial. Richardson replied, "I hate to call him a liar, but he's a liar."

<h1>Darfur rebels threaten to pull out of peace talks</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Darfur%20rebels%20threaten%20to%20pull%20out%20of%20peace%20talks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The leader of an important rebel group in the &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; has threatened to withdraw from scheduled peace talks if more than two other rebel groups are invited to the talks.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKhalil%20Ibrahim"&gt;Khalil Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , leader of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20and%20Equality%20Movement"&gt;Justice and Equality Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (JEM), said that only the JEM, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASudanese%20Liberation%20Movement"&gt;Sudanese Liberation Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (SLM), and the Sudanese government should be involved in the procedures. He expressed displeasure with the way the peace talks are being handled, and said that the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="African%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; leadership is currently unprepared for the talks scheduled for October 27th in &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;.

"The AU and &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; mediation until now have failed to detail very precisely who will be invited to the peace talks," &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news agency quotes him as saying. "If the mediation fails to take this decision by 27 October, then JEM is not attending the peace talks. We don't want to start with chaos." Ibrahim also said the SLM had to "reform itself and make one delegation and one position".

When the conflict in Darfur began in 2003, there were only two rebel groups opposing the Sudanese military. In the past four years, the rebel movement has splintered into more than 15 disparate groups, some of which are nothing more than armed outlaws. 

SLM leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbdel%20Wahed%20Mohammed%20el-Nur"&gt;Abdel Wahed Mohammed el-Nur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has refused to take part in the negotiations until a UN force is deployed in Darfur, and the pro-government militias are disarmed.

He has also chastised the choice of location of the peace talks, saying his group was not consulted and that a more neutral site should have been chosen. 

"Even if we were to attend the negotiations it will not be &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATripoli"&gt;Tripoli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ," he said. "We think that any negotiation is supposed to happen in a place which is not related to the conflict." Libya has been an important influence in the Darfur conflict. They are believed to have first armed militias with weapons and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APan-Arab"&gt;Pan-Arab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ideology in the 1980's, militias which became the current &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJanjaweed"&gt;Janjaweed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Meanwhile, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Natsios"&gt;Andrew Natsios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the US &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Envoy"&gt;Special Envoy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to Sudan, has said that the relationship between the governments of north and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asouth%20Sudan"&gt;south Sudan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is growing increasingly toxic. He added that the two-year-old &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AComprehensive%20Peace%20Agreement"&gt;Comprehensive Peace Agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; would have to be discussed at the peace talks before the situation grew more dire. The agreement, signed in 2005, was aimed at bringing the two governments together as allies and partners in peace. 

Mr. Natsios said that this has not happened, and that the north and south Sudanese governments are still opponents unable to find common ground.

"We are deeply concerned with the health of the CPA. The important deadlines have been missed... and trust is slowly being lost," said Mr. Natsios.

Speculation on the peace talks also includes questions about the deployment of the 26,000 strong force of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20United%20Nations%20African%20Union%20Mission%20in%20Darfur"&gt;The United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (UNAMID). The deployment of the force has been delayed because &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the AU have rejected non-African troops, and not enough African nations with well-trained and well-equipped soldiers have pledged to help.

According to reports, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Abiology"&gt;biologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Venter"&gt;Craig Venter&lt;/a&gt; is going to announce that he has created the first ever "artificial life form" on Earth at the &lt;a href="w%3AJ.%20Craig%20Venter%20Institute"&gt;J. Craig Venter Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S. &lt;a href="w%3Alaboratory"&gt;laboratory&lt;/a&gt; and research center, using synthetic &lt;a href="w%3Achromosome"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt; made from chemicals.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGuardian%20Unlimited"&gt;Guardian Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that Venter may announce the discovery on Monday, but could publish the report within a few weeks.

"[This is] a very important philosophical step in the history of our species. We are going from reading our genetic code to the ability to write it. That gives us the hypothetical ability to do things never contemplated before," said Venter.

The discovery was made by 20 scientists on a team that was led by &lt;a href="w%3Amicrobiology"&gt;microbiologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%20O.%20Smith"&gt;Hamilton O. Smith&lt;/a&gt; which created the synthetic chromosome. The chromosome is filled with 580,000 'base pairs' of a genetic code, and is 381 genes in length. Using ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMycoplasma%20genitalium"&gt;Mycoplasma genitalium&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3Abacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists broke down the genetic coding of the bacterium and removed a fifth of it, making sure that only the essential genetic products exist to support life. They then inject the bacterium into a living bacterial cell, where the new life form takes over, creating an entirely new species of life.

At least one test has been reported to be successful when scientists used a &lt;a href="w%3Agenome"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt; of a natural bacterium and implanted it into another cell. That bacterium took over that cell, creating a new form of life, and Venter says that he is "100% confident" that the scientists will be able to get the same results when using the synthetic chromosome.

Despite the reports, a spokeswoman for the offices where Venter works states that the ♡❤Guardian Unlimited♡❤ "jumped the gun" in reporting the event.

"The Guardian is ahead of themselves on this. We have not achieved what some have speculated we have in synthetic life. When we do so there will be a scientific publication and we are likely months away from that," said Heather Kowalski, the office's spokeswoman.

&lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; have defeated &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; 18-20 in the quarter-final of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Stadium"&gt;Millennium Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACardiff"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. 

New Zealand led 13-3 at half time, after &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carter%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Dan Carter&lt;/a&gt; kicked two penalties and &lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20McAlister"&gt;Luke McAlister&lt;/a&gt; scored a try. France missed chances to score with &lt;a href="w%3ALionel%20Beauxis"&gt;Lionel Beauxis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Baptiste%20%C3%89lissalde"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Élissalde&lt;/a&gt; both missing penalties and &lt;a href="w%3ADamien%20Traille"&gt;Damien Traille&lt;/a&gt; missing a drop goal attempt. Lionel Beauxis scored France's first points with a penalty just before half time. 

However, New Zealand centre Luke McAlister was harshly &lt;a href="w%3APenalty%20box%23Rugby%20football"&gt;sin-binned&lt;/a&gt; early in the second half for illegally blocking a French player and preventing a try scoring opportunity. France took advantage of having the extra man, and levelled to 13-13 by the time the 10 minute suspension had elapsed with Lionel Beauxis adding a penalty and &lt;a href="w%3AThierry%20Dusautoir"&gt;Thierry Dusautoir&lt;/a&gt; scoring a try. New Zealand then scored through &lt;a href="w%3ARodney%20So%27oialo"&gt;Rodney So'oialo&lt;/a&gt; to regain the lead, but after &lt;a href="w%3AFr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Michalak"&gt;Frédéric Michalak&lt;/a&gt; made a run, before passing to &lt;a href="w%3AYannick%20Jauzion"&gt;Yannick Jauzion&lt;/a&gt; who scored the try which was then converted, France led 20-18. The teams slogged it out for 15 minutes, but New Zealand could not make a breakthrough. Luke McAlister missed a last minute drop goal attempt as France held on to win.

Some New Zealand fans blamed the loss on English referee &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Barnes"&gt;Wayne Barnes&lt;/a&gt; due to alleged bias towards the French team. Controversial decisions included Luke McAlister's sin binning and an apparent forward pass that led to France's second try, allowing them to take the lead. However, most neutrals also noted an apparent forward pass in the build up to an earlier New Zealand try and consider Barnes to have done a reasonable job in such a high profile game. 

France advance to the semi-final stage of the tournament and will play England, who Australia 12-10 earlier today, in a repeat of the 2003 semi-final.

&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; police arrested William Joe Mitchell today. Authorities allege the registered sex offender lured 15-year-old Alyssa Frank over the social networking website, &lt;a href="w%3AMyspace"&gt;myspace.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Virginia State Police said Mitchell was arrested outside of Winchester without incident at a gas station named "The Flying J Truck Stop."

Frank was found earlier this week at a &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADeFuniak%20Springs%2C%20Florida"&gt;DeFuniak Springs, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, after allegedly being abandoned by a suspected abductor.

Grady Judd, the Polk County Sheriff, said that Frank left her house in &lt;a href="w%3ABartow%2C%20Florida"&gt;Bartow, Florida&lt;/a&gt; in the early hours Monday morning to meet Mitchell. The two went to &lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; before returning to &lt;a href="w%3ADe_Funiak_Springs%252C_Florida"&gt;DeFuniak Springs&lt;/a&gt; on the Florida Panhandle.

Sheriff Judd told &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; that Mitchell said he was 24, not 46.

Frank's father, Rodger, told CNN that he had no idea his daughter was communicating with Mitchell over the internet and he urged all parents to talk to their children about their online activity. "We have to watch [our children] harder. We don't know everything," he said. Sheriff Judd warned others who might be trying to take advantage of children, "We'll hunt you down like the felon and criminal you are. You keep your hands off our children."

Authorities say Mitchell has had 14 other arrests, ranging from burglary to lewd and lascivious conduct.

It was an evenly contested match with many scoring opportunities. &lt;a href="Bastian%20Schweinsteiger"&gt;Bastian Schweinsteiger&lt;/a&gt; went off with a head injury in the 1 half.

Both teams had their chances until the final whistle was blown. But Germany ended up celebrating as they join co-hosts &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; for Euro 2008.

Ferrari driver &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AF%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Chinese%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASinopec"&gt;Sinopec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Chinese Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai%20International%20Circuit"&gt;Shanghai International Circuit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. This became the 200th GP win for &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Ferrari"&gt;Scuderia Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; and 600th podium for this Formula One team.

This mistake became an unexpected opportunity for his rivals Kimi Räikkönen and &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; in the Drivers' Championship. Alonso is four points behind and Räikkönen is seven points behind Hamilton.

While Alonso and Ferrari driver &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; were battling side by side right after the start of the race, Hamilton chased by the Finn managed to make a comfort gap to them. After Alonso finally passed Massa and strengthen his position he get into pursuit for Räikkönen's red car. Alonso was about ten seconds behind Räikkönen up on the finish line.

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Coulthard"&gt;David Coulthard&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; closed the top eight, three other Renault-engined cars right after him.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20General%20David%20Petraeus%20accuses%20Iran%20of%20fueling%20war%20in%20Iraq&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

General &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Petraeus"&gt;David Petraeus&lt;/a&gt;, the top &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military commander in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, said on Saturday that &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; continues to arm militias in Iraq. Petraeus also accused Iran's ambassador Hassan Kazemi-Qomi of being a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AQuds%20Force"&gt;Quds Force&lt;/a&gt;, an elite unit of Iran's Republican Guard which the U.S. believes backs foreign Islamic revolutionary movements.

Speaking to journalists at a U.S. military base near the Iran-Iraq border, Petraeus said "There should be no question about the malign, lethal involvement and activities of the Quds Force in this country." He added that Iran was "responsible for providing the weapons, the training, the funding and in some cases the direction for operations that have indeed killed US soldiers".

Regarding specific weaponry, Petraeus said "There's no question, absolutely no question that Iran is providing advanced RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades]." "It has provided some shoulder-fired, Stinger-like air-defense missiles. It has provided the explosively formed projectiles and it has provided 244 mm rockets, in addition to mortars, mortar rounds and other small-arms ammunition."

General Petraeus also said that Iran's ambassador Hassan Kazemi-Qomi was a "Quds Force member". The &lt;a href="w%3AQuds%20Force"&gt;Quds Force&lt;/a&gt; is an elite unit of Iran's Republican Guard which the U.S. believes backs foreign Islamic revolutionary movements, including groups such as &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;. Iran acknowledges the existence of the Quds Force, but does not disclose the details of its activities. "[Qomi] has diplomatic immunity and therefore he is obviously not subject [to scrutiny]," Petraeus added.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad-Ali Hosseini dismissed the charges on Sunday. Paraphrasing Hosseini's comments, the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Republic%20News%20Agency"&gt;Islamic Republic News Agency&lt;/a&gt; said the charges "were nothing new and that they were in continuation of the past baseless accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran."

According to BBC News, "Some analysts believe the U.S. is deliberately ramping up the rhetoric against the Iranian authorities to prepare public opinion for possible military strikes against Revolutionary Guard facilities within Iran."

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Job &amp; Economic Justice – to reverse the de-industrialization of Ontario, secure more well-paid, unionized jobs, and raise the minimum wage to $15/hour.
BULLET::::2. A future for youth – We need to make education a right, not a privilege. Student debt is out of control and Ontario has the second highest tuition fees in the country. First year student are entering Ontario universities with never-before-seen tuition levels. Ultimately, a comprehensive funding formula needs to be put in place to make higher education free, and public schools need the necessary resources to prepare students for higher education, regardless of whether or not they live in a wealthy neighbourhood.
BULLET::::3. Peace &amp; Disarmament – I think this really is a provincial issue… we need a legislature at Queen’s Park that’s willing to tell Ottawa to “Get out of Afghanistan Now!”; to cut military spending by 50%; and to ban military recruitment from our schools and campuses.

Researchers at &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20University"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADurham%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Durham, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; believe that they have found the purpose of the &lt;a href="w%3Avermiform%20appendix"&gt;vermiform appendix&lt;/a&gt;, long thought to be useless. The &lt;a href="w%3Atheory"&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;a href="w%3AJournal%20of%20Theoretical%20Biology"&gt;Journal of Theoretical Biology&lt;/a&gt; this week, is that the appendix creates and protects helpful &lt;a href="w%3Amicroorganisms"&gt;microorganisms&lt;/a&gt; for a person's &lt;a href="w%3Adigestive%20system"&gt;digestive system&lt;/a&gt;.

For years, &lt;a href="w%3Ascientists"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; believed that the appendix served no purpose, and wondered why it was even present in the &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20body"&gt;human body&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ASurgeons"&gt;Surgeons&lt;/a&gt; removed them regularly, and it seemed to have no ill effects on the health of patients.

In addition, when &lt;a href="w%3Ainfected"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; the appendix became harmful and even deadly. &lt;a href="w%3AInflammation"&gt;Inflammation&lt;/a&gt; occurs quickly and can cause death if the infected organ is not removed in time. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), in 2005 321,000 Americans were stricken with &lt;a href="w%3Aappendicitis"&gt;appendicitis&lt;/a&gt;. On average, 300 to 400 Americans die of appendicitis each year.

The new theory, proposed by surgeons and &lt;a href="w%3Aimmunologists"&gt;immunologists&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20University%20School%20of%20Medicine"&gt;Duke University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, says that people throughout most of human history lived in small, spread out groups. As a result, their contact with other people was far more limited than it is today in modern &lt;a href="w%3Aindustrialized"&gt;industrialized&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asocieties"&gt;societies&lt;/a&gt;. Today, if a person's &lt;a href="w%3Adigestive%20tract"&gt;digestive tract&lt;/a&gt; lacks helpful &lt;a href="w%3Abacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, they can regain the needed germs from contact with large numbers of other people. In times when populations were less dense, and &lt;a href="w%3Acholera"&gt;cholera&lt;/a&gt; epidemics purged large numbers of people's useful digestive bacteria, the appendix was able to restore the digestive system's supply of helpful germs.

"[The appendix] acts as a good safe house for bacteria," said Duke surgery professor Bill Parker, a co-author in the study. He said the appendix's location--below the one-way passage of food and germs through the &lt;a href="w%3Alarge%20intestine"&gt;large intestine&lt;/a&gt; in a digestive cul-de-sac--helps validate the theory. The worm-shaped &lt;a href="w%3Aappendage"&gt;appendage&lt;/a&gt; also acts to manufacture these helpful germs, Parker said.

Parker added that in less developed societies with lower &lt;a href="w%3Apopulation%20densities"&gt;population densities&lt;/a&gt;, the appendix may still be useful and rates of appendicitis are lower. However, regardless of the appendix's apparent function, Parker confirmed that those suffering from appendicitis should still have it removed.

Scientists not affiliated with the study have come out in favor of the theory. &lt;a href="w%3ABrandeis%20University"&gt;Brandeis University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Abiochemistry"&gt;biochemistry&lt;/a&gt; professor Douglas Theobald said the idea was the most likely purpose of the appendix. "It makes &lt;a href="w%3Aevolutionary"&gt;evolutionary&lt;/a&gt; sense."

The &lt;a href="w%3ACrandon%2C%20Wisconsin%20shooting"&gt;Crandon, Wisconsin shooting&lt;/a&gt; occurred earlier today inside a home in northeastern &lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; and has left at least seven dead, including the gunman. Forest County Supervisor Tom Vollmar said, "It's a pretty tragic situation here... There are five or six people dead." &lt;a href="w%3AWTMJ_%2528AM%2529"&gt;WTMJ Newsradio&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; that at least two of the dead are high school students.

Ten youths were reportedly inside the house when the gunfire began.

The shooter, Tyler Peterson, was killed by a police sniper after a manhunt.

&lt;a href="w%3AWITI-TV"&gt;WITI-TV&lt;/a&gt; reports that one of the victims was a student at the &lt;a href="w%3AMilwaukee%20Area%20Technical%20College"&gt;Milwaukee Area Technical College&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ACrandon%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Crandon, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, where the shooting occurred, has a population of nearly 2,000.

The entire area was locked down, until recently, when police said they are no longer searching for any suspects. Crandon Police Chief John Dennee said, "We're not looking for anybody anymore." Crandon' Mayor, Gary Bradley, did not want to comment on the investigation, only saying, "We are going to get together and be strong...We are a strong community. We always have been. This is agonizing, but we will prevail."

A mother of one of those fatally shot said, "I'm waiting for somebody to wake me up right now. This is a bad, bad dream...All I heard it was a jealous boyfriend and he went berserk. He took them all out." A neighbor who lives by the crime scene said, "I heard probably five or six shots, a short pause and then five or six more...I wasn't sure if it was gunfire initially. I thought some kids were messing around and hitting a nearby metal building."

&lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; reached their first ever World Cup semi-final with a 19-13 victory over &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in the quarter-final stage of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AStade%20de%20France"&gt;Stade de France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaint-Denis"&gt;Saint-Denis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

Scotland took the lead with a penalty from &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Parks"&gt;Dan Parks&lt;/a&gt;. However &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Contepomi"&gt;Felipe Contepomi&lt;/a&gt; kicked two penalties as Argentina moved ahead, before &lt;a href="w%3AGonzalo%20Longo"&gt;Gonzalo Longo Elía&lt;/a&gt; added a try to extend their lead. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Paterson"&gt;Chris Paterson&lt;/a&gt; responded with a penalty just before half time, but Argentina went into the interval leading 13-6.

Argentina extended their lead further after the break with a third penalty from Felipe Contepomi and a drop goal frim &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Mart%C3%ADn%20Hern%C3%A1ndez"&gt;Juan Martín Hernández&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Cusiter"&gt;Chris Cusiter&lt;/a&gt; scored a try for Scotland with seventeen minutes remaining, but they could not make a breakthrough as Argentina held on to win.

South Africa, who Fiji earlier today, await Argentina in the semi-finals. England face France in the second semi-final.

The 29-year-old father of a 5-year-old &lt;a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Phoenix, Arizona&lt;/a&gt; girl is being accused of regularly beating his daughter over the past few months.

&lt;a href="w%3AKPHO-TV"&gt;KPHO-TV&lt;/a&gt; reported that Ezra Hazell abused the girl because she did not do her homework.

Hazell was charged on Tuesday on five counts of child abuse.

The girl's 25-year-old stepmother, Kristie Hazell, was also charged with two accounts of child abuse.

Police report that wounds across the girl's back, buttocks, legs, arms and chest total 100.

Police said that Hazell would order the girl to go into a push-up position, before beating her with a nylon military belt or a computer cord. 

Also, police said that one time, Hazell placed a book in front of the girl's head and if she got the answer to a question from the book wrong, he would beat her.

The victim is now in the care of &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20Protective%20Services"&gt;Child Protective Services&lt;/a&gt;.

A school nurse reported the incident to police.

State TV reports that a bus collided with a train in &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; Saturday killing at least 28 people. Another 73 people were injured in the accident, including 15 in critical condition.

A statement read on state television said the collision occurred in the province of &lt;a href="w%3AGranma_Province"&gt;Granma&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJuventud_Rebelde_%2528newspaper%2529"&gt;Juventud Rebelde newspaper&lt;/a&gt; reports that the accident occurred at a railroad crossing in the very small town of Veguita in the &lt;a href="w%3ABayamo"&gt;Bayamo&lt;/a&gt; municipality.

The train was traveling from &lt;a href="w%3ASantiago_de_Cuba_Province"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AManzanillo%252C_Cuba"&gt;Manzanillo&lt;/a&gt;, when it collided with a bus that was traveling from &lt;a href="w%3ABayamo"&gt;Bayamo&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ACampechuela"&gt;Campechuela&lt;/a&gt;.

The train hit the bus, dragged it across the tracks, and pushed it off a nearby bridge. The cause remains under investigation.

1.4 million people have been evacuated on the mainland of &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; because of a deadly storm. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AXinhua%20News%20Agency"&gt;♡❤Xinhua News Agency♡❤&lt;/a&gt; reported &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season%23Typhoon%20Krosa%20%28Ineng%29"&gt;Typhoon Krosa&lt;/a&gt; struck China's &lt;a href="w%3AZhejiang"&gt;Zhejiang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFujian"&gt;Fujian&lt;/a&gt; provinces, before weakening to a &lt;a href="w%3Atropical%20storm"&gt;tropical storm&lt;/a&gt;. The storm made landfall around 0730 GMT, with winds of up to 126 km/hour.

Severe structural damage and power outages have been reported in the port city of &lt;a href="w%3AWenzhou"&gt;Wenzhou&lt;/a&gt;. 

Among the evacuated were 500,000 tourists who were at coastal resorts for the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Day"&gt;National Day&lt;/a&gt; holiday. Xinhua also said that 75,000 fishing vessels have been ordered to return to their ports.

Taiwan's Disaster Relief Center reported that Krosa killed at least 5 people and knocked out power to another 2 million when it made landfall as a Category 4 typhoon.

5,580 &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; citizens participated in a umbrella unfurling campaign, which was organized by the pan-democrats in order to support having full &lt;a href="w%3Auniversal%20suffrage"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. The participants gathered in &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Park%20%28Hong%20Kong%29"&gt;Victoria Park&lt;/a&gt; and unfurled yellow umbrellas forming the numbers 2012 against a background of blue umbrellas. 

The organizers had prepared 10,080 umbrellas, 3,144 in yellow and 6,936 in blue. However, since the event was not as popular as expected, about four thousand blue ones were left undistributed. Nevertheless, &lt;a href="w%3ARonny%20Tong"&gt;Ronny Tong&lt;/a&gt;, an organizer from &lt;a href="w%3ACivic%20Party"&gt;Civic Party&lt;/a&gt;, said he was satisfied with the turnout.

&lt;a href="w%3AAnson%20Chan"&gt;Anson Chan&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Secretary%20for%20Administration"&gt;Chief Secretary&lt;/a&gt; and one of the candidates of the upcoming by-election in the &lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Council%20%28Hong%20Kong%29"&gt;Legislative Council&lt;/a&gt;, also participated in this event.

Currently, the &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Executive%20of%20Hong%20Kong"&gt;Chief Executive of Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; is elected by a &lt;a href="w%3Aelection%20committee"&gt;election committee&lt;/a&gt; of 800 people, and most of them heavily favour &lt;a href="w%3APRC"&gt;PRC&lt;/a&gt; government. Also, only half of the seats in &lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Council%20%28Hong%20Kong%29"&gt;Legislative Council&lt;/a&gt; is directly elected, and another half is elected by less than 5% of citizens. Therefore, the pan-democrats in Hong Kong demand to have universal suffrage in the next elections in 2012.

A small desk calendar, which started as a voluntary school project, has risen to unexpected heights of fame.

His Excellency Dr. Suvit Yodmani, &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; Minister for Tourism and Sports paid tribute to the young creators of the "Chiang Mai Charity Calendar" by travelling up from Bangkok to preside at the official launch of this initiative, which is designed to increase visitor arrivals to the Northern Thai city, and raise funds through calendar sales for childrens' charities in the region. The event was held on October 5th 2007 at the recently opened Sofitel Riverside Hotel Chiang Mai, and attended by over 100 senior travel trade, airline media, consular and city hall representatives. 

In an evening which included a presentation of how the calendar was conceived and created plus solo violin and classical guitar performances by students, Dr Suvit gave a talk about the future of the tourism industry in Chiang Mai, highlighting the importance of environmental issues, and close co-operation between the government and private sectors. He cited the Charity Calendar as an example of what could be achieved even by schoolchildren in terms of tourism promotion, and gave it his wholehearted support.

The evening concluded with the Minister presenting certificates of appreciation to the artists who painted the colourful images of the city which were chosen to be included in the non-profit calendar and representing why "Chiang Mai is a Wonderful Place to Live"

Offered as an unusual gift, the desk calendar is likely to carry its promotional message — in text and childrens' paintings — into homes and offices in countries around the world.

At least four people have died after one of three military escort helicopters accompanying 
&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; crashed in &lt;a href="w%3AKashmir"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;.

The medium-lift &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Puma"&gt;Super Puma&lt;/a&gt; helicopter was shadowing one carrying the president when the rear of the rotorcraft burst into flame, forcing an emergency crash landing. An army brigadier, two soldiers and a PTV cameraman were killed, and four more were injured, including presidential spokesman Major General Rashid Qureshi. The injured are being treated at a hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AMuzaffarabad"&gt;Muzaffarabad&lt;/a&gt;. The pilot walked away unharmed.

It is thought to be an accident caused by a technical fault.

The helicopters were visiting the scene of a devastating 2005 earthquake to mark the anniversary of the disaster. The president ultimately reached his destination.

&lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; 3-0 to advance to &lt;a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008"&gt;UEFA Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; today with goals from Libor Sionko, Marek Matějovský and Jaroslav Plašil. This was Germany's first defeat in 24 UEFA European Championship qualifiers which dates back nine years when &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; beat Germany 1-0 on October 10, 1998.

Germany's first opportunity came three minutes after the opening goal but Bastian Schweinsteiger's long-distance shot went wide. Then afterwards Kevin Kuranyi missed two headers. Schweinsteiger continued his influence in the German attack which brought two saves out of Petr Čech before the Czech Republic sealed the points and their qualification with a break-away goal during the 63 minute. Plašil collected a cross from Daniel Pudil and beat Hildebrand, who replaced the suspended Lehmann, to inflict Joachim Löw's 1 competitive defeat as Germany coach.

With Germany already qualifying after their 0-0 draw against &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, they look to finish on a high note when they play &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; next month.

<h1>Dida and Milan face UEFA charges over Celtic fan incident</h1>

The &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA"&gt;Union of European Football Associations&lt;/a&gt; (UEFA) has investigated &lt;a href="w%3AA.C.%20Milan"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; and their goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AN%C3%A9lson%20de%20Jesus%20Silva"&gt;Dida&lt;/a&gt; over the incident with the &lt;a href="w%3ACeltic%20F.C."&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; fan that led to his substitution against Celtic. A fan ran on to the field immediately after Celtic striker &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McDonald"&gt;Scott McDonald&lt;/a&gt; scored the eventual winning goal and appeared to have slightly touched Dida. Dida ran after the fan for a few steps before falling to the ground. UEFA have already investigated Celtic for lack of security for the same incident.

The charges were based on Article 5 Paragraph 1 of UEFA's disciplinary regulations, which states that "member associations, clubs, as well as their players, officials and members, shall conduct themselves according to the principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship". 

The case were heard on October 11 by UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body. The outcome of these cases were as follows: Celtic FC were fined £25000, 50% of which is kept in a reserve tank and if Celtic have any further problems in two years UEFA will keep it, but if they don't they will get it back. A.C Milan goalkeeper Nelson de Jesus Silva "Dida" was banned for two games but is appealing. If found guilty he could find himself with a four-game champions league ban.

&lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt; said on Sunday that he supports a U.S. Senate plan to divide Iraq into three separate regions for &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20Islam"&gt;Shiite Muslims&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Islam"&gt;Sunni Muslims&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AKurdish%20people"&gt;Kurds&lt;/a&gt;. The plan includes a limited central government in Baghdad which would protect Iraq's borders and distribute oil revenues among the three regions. The Bush administration and Iraqi Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt; both oppose the plan, which was put forth in a non-binding Senate resolution adopted last month.

"I think the resolution passed by the Senate is a very good one," said Talabani in an interview with CNN on Sunday. "It is insisting on the unity of Iraq, of the security of Iraq, of the prosperity of Iraq, of national reconciliation and asking our neighbors not to interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq."

On September 26, the U.S. Senate voted 75-23 in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the plan. The legislation was written by Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; (D-Del.) and was co-sponsored by Senators &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Brownback"&gt;Sam Brownback&lt;/a&gt; (R-Kansas), &lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Boxer"&gt;Barbara Boxer&lt;/a&gt; (D-Calif.), &lt;a href="w%3AArlen%20Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt; (R-Penn.), and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; (D-Mass.). 

According to &lt;a href="w%3ARadio%20Free%20Europe"&gt;RFE/RL&lt;/a&gt;, the resolution "sparked a massive outcry both inside Iraq and across the Arab world, with critics suggesting the United States has overstepped its role in Iraq."

The &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i army says that at least 150 to 200 &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; militants, along with 50 Pakistani troops have been killed in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Mir%20Ali"&gt;recent battles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, Taliban fighters and Pakistani troops along the border region of Pakistan and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; in an area known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Waziristan"&gt;North Waziristan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . At least 20 other troops were injured and at least 15 are reported to be missing. 12 civilians are also reported to have been killed.

"We have told them to surrender and give up their weapons," said Major General of the Pakistani army, Waheed Arshad. Militants say that they are going to attempt to overthrow the government and take the newly elected Pakistani President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; out of power.

The battles began on Saturday October 6 in the town of Mir Ali and have lasted three days so far. Army officials say that they will "continue punitive action until complete peace is restored." The battles were triggered after several Pakistani officials were targeted and peace talks with officials in &lt;a href="Islamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt; failed to go forward.

In September, &lt;a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; issued a new audio tape in which he told militants to resist Pakistani troops and rebel against the army. He also asked militants to seek revenge for the assault on the Red Mosque when almost 100 were killed by militants and troops.

Round 7 of the A-League 2007-08 has produced some interesting moments throughout the country. Accusations have been made that the A-League's 'thug-like' onfield play has decreased its good name, but all teams enjoyed a close-to satisfying game, whatever the result.

WA team &lt;a href="w%3APerth%20Glory"&gt;Perth Glory&lt;/a&gt; is still stalling in its win drought, sparking calls for coach &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Smith"&gt;Ron Smith&lt;/a&gt;'s dismissal, however this was met with limited concern. The low attendance numbers were partly due to the Perth Glory vs Adelaide United match with one of the lowest crowds in Perth's history, 6252.

♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUli%20Hoene%C3%9F"&gt;Uli Hoeneß&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :♡❤♡ "It was a real fight out there tonight, especially on the unbelievably difficult pitch. Even the referee said he had trouble staying on his feet, so it was very tough and definitely a lottery. It was good to see the team coming from behind twice, but obviously it was a little bit lucky at the end. We’d have been happy enough with a draw, but now we’re obviously delighted. We’ve put ourselves in a great position. We need to win our home games, and then we’re home and dry."

♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOttmar%20Hitzfeld"&gt;Ottmar Hitzfeld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :♡❤♡ "You could see we were having huge problems with the turf. We did consider lodging an appeal after we trained on the pitch yesterday. I’m just pleased we’ve basically come out of it in good shape. Today was all about desire. It wasn’t a day for the pretty stuff, all that mattered was battling away. By the end, I’d have been happy enough with a point."

♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiroslav%20Klose"&gt;Miroslav Klose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :♡❤♡ "I want to praise the team for the way we kept coming back at them. We had to go to the limit, especially when you consider the conditions here. The turf wasn’t exactly perfect, and you feel it in your legs. We need to keep believing in ourselves."

♡❤♡&lt;a href="Toni%20Kroos"&gt;Toni Kroos&lt;/a&gt;:♡❤♡ "It was vital to start the group with a win. It was hard work, the pitch was a catastrophe, but I think we made the best of the situation and coped well. We fought hard and put up stiff resistance, and I think we deserved to win at the end."

Bolton Wanderers opened the scoring after only eight minutes when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Gardner"&gt;Ricardo Gardner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored on a deflected shot. After taking 15 minutes to settle in, Bayern Munich started to attack more frequently and it paid dividends after 30 minutes when &lt;a href="Lukas%20Podolski"&gt;Lukas Podolski&lt;/a&gt; equalized. Early in the 2 half Bayern Munich took the lead when Podolski got his 2 goal of the game. However, with 8 minutes left, Bolton equalized which earned Bolton's 2 point in the group stage while Bayern lead Group F with 4 points. If Bayern Munich wins their next &lt;a href="UEFA%20Cup"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; match, they are all but assured their place in the next round.

<h2>Post-match Quotes</h2>
♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOttmar%20Hitzfeld"&gt;Ottmar Hitzfeld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :♡❤♡ “The crowd’s basically been treated to a good and exciting game with plenty of chances from our team. We were unlucky to go a goal behind so early, that was exactly what Bolton wanted, because it let them sit back and defend. But we recovered well and piled on the pressure, thanks to the outstanding Ribery. After we went 2-1 up we seemed poised to get a third, we basically had the match totally under control – apparently so much under control that some of my players thought we could relax. Then we went and conceded a totally unnecessary equaliser after a throw-in. That goes down as two points dropped, but I’m still confident we can win the group.“

♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20Kahn"&gt;Oliver Kahn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :♡❤♡ “We became very careless in the last 20 minutes. We kept on attacking, but we forgot that teams in Europe are capable of scoring at any time. It was carelessness pure and simple, and a lack of total concentration. You can’t afford that in Europe, you have to concentrate right to the end.“

♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Lell"&gt;Christian Lell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :♡❤♡ “Overall, we lacked a cutting edge today. We had plenty of chances before and after the break, but we simply didn’t make the most of them. Then we went to sleep for a moment. But we’ve got to turn our attention to the future, we’re in action again the day after next. We need to come away with something from Stuttgart.“

♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Megson"&gt;Gary Megson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Bolton):♡❤♡ “We were missing twelve players tonight, but we still showed Bayern very little respect. But I have to say they’ve got world-class players all over the field, and they’re a really strong side. We didn’t have as many chances as our opponents, but we had a couple of good ones, and our application at the end was terrific. I especially want to single out our captain Kevin Nolan, he kept on driving us forward.“

Sporting Braga of Portugal held Bayern Munich to a 1-1 draw today. The draw along with Bolton's draw with Aris keeps Bayern at the top of Group F.

<h2>Post-Match Quotes</h2>
♡❤♡Uli Hoeneß:♡❤♡ “As we’ve already seen against Belenenses, you have to be prepared for an unbelievably hard physical encounter when you come to Portugal. We were the victims of a few bad fouls, but the referee let a little bit too much go for my taste. It’s important we go on and win the group, because our first match would be away to one of the third-placed teams, and that’s a huge advantage. But we still hold all the trump cards. If we beat Aris Salonika at home, we definitely finish top.“

♡❤♡Ottmar Hitzfeld:♡❤♡ “We came here to win today, and we went out and controlled the play accordingly. Braga had a couple of decent chances before half-time, but otherwise we had much more possession. I felt we lacked the absolute will to win, however. We should have tackled more aggressively in the first half, and we never found a way through up front. We were in the driving seat at 1-0 up, then Demichelis slipped and we conceded the equaliser. We can’t be entirely satisfied, because we came here intending to win.“

♡❤♡Miroslav Klose:♡❤♡ “We never really got going today. We were basically in control, but we didn’t dominate enough to create many chances. We’re at home in our last game, and that’s a must-win match.“

♡❤♡Mark van Bommel:♡❤♡ “You can’t be happy with the draw after taking the lead here. We were totally in control and scored straight after half-time. In normal circumstances we’d have gone on and taken the points, but Braga aren’t a bad side. People think we’ll win all our matches, but it’s just not as simple as that.“

♡❤♡Roland Linz (Braga goalscorer):♡❤♡ “Scoring against Bayern is always special. The draw was very, very important for us. It was pretty evenly-matched over the 90 minutes, although we had one or two very good chances. I reckon the draw was the right result. It rates as a success for us, but it was definitely less than Bayern were hoping for.“

&lt;a href="w%3AVfL%20Wolfsburg"&gt;Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href="w%3AAshkan%20Dejagah"&gt;Ashkan Dejagah&lt;/a&gt; drew criticism today for planning to not participate in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany%20national%20under-21%20football%20team"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3A2009%20UEFA%20European%20Under-21%20Football%20Championship"&gt;2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship&lt;/a&gt; qualification match against &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20national%20under-21%20football%20team"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, which is scheduled to be played on October 12 in &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt;.
The issue stems from the fact that Dejagah is an &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iranian-born&lt;/a&gt; citizen. Dejagah was quoted as saying, "I have more Iranian than German blood in my veins" and "That should be respected, and besides I'm doing this out of respect. My parents are Iranian." &lt;a href="w%3AIran-Israel%20relations"&gt;Iran-Israel relations&lt;/a&gt; are currently tense and Iranian citizens are forbidden from traveling to Israel since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, while at the same time, Iran began to refuse to recognize &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s right to exist. Several German politicians and media members have called for Dejagah to be expelled from the German national team.

This is not the first time that the Iran-Israel conflict has entered German football. Current &lt;a href="w%3AHanover%2096"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIran%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Iran national team&lt;/a&gt; striker Vahid Hashemian, when he was with &lt;a href="w%3ABayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;, was pulled from the squad scheduled to face Israeli team &lt;a href="w%3AMaccabi%20Tel%20Aviv"&gt;Maccabi Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; in a Champions League game in 2004. Although Bayern cited a back injury as the reason for the Iranian's withdrawal, the potential visit proved controversial, with opposition to Hashemian's involvement coming from Iran's national sporting body.

Spanish media say the injured man is a bodyguard for a town councillor from Spain's ruling &lt;a href="w%3APSOE"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;, who was taken to hospital with burns to his face, right hand, and shoulder. While there was no immediate claim of responsibility, Basque regional government sources said the attack bore the hallmarks of an attack by the armed separatist group ETA.

It comes days after suspected leaders of the separatist party Batasuna were arrested, an action the party described as a "declaration of war".

<h1>Obesity and the Fat Acceptance Movement: Kira Nerusskaya speaks</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Obesity%20and%20the%20Fat%20Acceptance%20Movement%3A%20Kira%20Nerusskaya%20speaks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Opinions rooted in &lt;a href="w%3ARacism"&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Asexism"&gt;sexism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Ahomophobia"&gt;homophobia&lt;/a&gt; are commonly unacceptable to express in public or in polite company. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Richards"&gt;Michael Richards&lt;/a&gt; shouted down a &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; heckler by yelling, "Shut up!" followed by "He's a &lt;a href="w%3Anigger"&gt;nigger&lt;/a&gt;!" and gave his already dormant career less of a chance of ever reviving. When &lt;a href="w%3AIsiah%20Washington"&gt;Isiah Washington&lt;/a&gt; called a co-star on &lt;a href="w%3AGrey%27s%20Anatomy"&gt;Grey's Anatomy&lt;/a&gt; a "&lt;a href="w%3AFaggot%20%28epithet%29"&gt;fag&lt;/a&gt;," his contract was not renewed. 

None of this would have happened to either actor if instead of racist or homophobic terminology they had said, "Shut up, fattie!" or "Fat ass!" It's not an easy time to be fat in America. A fat person is seen as weak-willed, as suffering from an addiction to food, as unhealthy and deserving of ridicule. It goes without saying that people who are overweight are, indeed, people with a full range of emotions and feelings that are as easily hurt as a thin person's. 

♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter met Kira Nerusskaya, a documentary filmmaker, at this year's &lt;a href="w%3ATribeca%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Tribeca Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Her film ♡❤The BBW World: Under the FAT!♡❤ is in production and post-production. She is a self-described &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Beautiful%20Woman"&gt;Big Beautiful Woman&lt;/a&gt; (BBW) and she hosts the website TheBBWWorld.com; she is also one of the leading voices that has recently emerged for fat acceptance. In researching her film she has traveled to &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and all over the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to interview fat women about their obesity and their place in their respective societies. 

Below is an interview with Nerusskaya about the health, issues, public reactions to and sexuality of a BBW.

<h2>Fat Acceptance</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone: What is "BBW"?

♡❤♡DS: What is your website about?

♡❤♡DS: What is the movement?

♡❤♡DS: What exactly does the movement want?

♡❤♡DS: How much do you weigh?

♡❤♡DS: Do you have any desire to lose weight?

♡❤♡DS: Her recent performance was widely criticized because she was seen as out-of-shape.

♡❤♡DS: How are they different?

♡❤♡DS: What do you think the Britney Spears &lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt; performance and comments about her physique sent out as a message?

♡❤♡DS: What is beautiful about being fat?

<h2>Fat and health</h2>
♡❤♡DS: How do you respond to the argument that &lt;a href="w%3Aobesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; is unhealthy?

♡❤♡DS: What do you say to people who say you’re a &lt;a href="w%3Agluttony"&gt;glutton&lt;/a&gt;? You’re &lt;a href="w%3ACompulsive%20overeating"&gt;addicted to food&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: A bagel with &lt;a href="w%3Abacon"&gt;bacon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Acheddar%20cheese"&gt;cheddar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aice%20cream"&gt;ice cream&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡DS: How do you keep your weight up then?

♡❤♡DS: It’s possible but...

♡❤♡DS: Sure. 

<h2>Public reaction to a fat woman</h2>

♡❤♡DS: What sorts of things are said to you on the street?

♡❤♡DS: People will actually yell out to you, “Hey, fat ass!”

♡❤♡DS: How do you feel if people stare at you?

♡❤♡DS: I think people reading that would think that people are looking at you because they’re disgusted that you’re fat.

♡❤♡DS: But that’s not your experience? That’s not what you’re getting from it?

♡❤♡DS: Do you ever confront people?

♡❤♡DS: When you confront them what happens?

♡❤♡DS: Do they apologize?

<h2>On America's obesity epidemic</h2>
♡❤♡DS: When you read stories about an &lt;a href="w%3AObesity%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;obesity epidemic in the United States&lt;/a&gt; what is your reaction to that?

♡❤♡DS: What do you think should be done about the obesity epidemic?

♡❤♡DS: How would you respond to somebody who said, “You’re a &lt;a href="w%3AHypocrisy"&gt;hypocrite&lt;/a&gt;?” How could you have a problem with obesity...

♡❤♡DS: That you’re just there shoveling fries down your face.

♡❤♡DS: So your problem with the obesity epidemic and why it corresponds with what you’re saying is that there are large people who are just naturally large for a variety of reasons but the American lifestyle right now is creating obesity based upon reasons that are not particularly related to living slovenly? 

♡❤♡DS: It’s the only thing that has been proven to be linked with weight gain that you can consume. 

♡❤♡DS: Yes.

♡❤♡DS: A glass of orange juice every morning is said to put on about four pounds a year.

♡❤♡DS: Are there any heroes of the Fat Acceptance/BBW movement? Like &lt;a href="w%3ACamryn%20Manheim"&gt;Camryn Manheim&lt;/a&gt;? Who are some of the people out there that larger people -- fat people -- look to as people who’ve been ground breakers, if you will?

♡❤♡DS: Like a &lt;a href="w%3AMo%27Nique"&gt;Mo'Nique&lt;/a&gt;?

<h2>Fat women and sexuality</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Is there a typical kind of person that is attracted to an overweight woman? 

♡❤♡DS: Saviors?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: It's not, 'I'm going to help her be normal' but 'I want to have control over her and see a result of that'? 

♡❤♡DS: But doesn't objectify it...♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Is there something someone has asked you to do in bed that you find offensive?

♡❤♡DS: What's your reaction?♡❤♡

♡❤♡DS: Is it accepted when men &lt;a href="w%3AFetish"&gt;fetishize&lt;/a&gt; fat women or is that seen as a negative?

♡❤♡DS: When you get messages on your MySpace or when you receive e-mails at TheBBWWorld.com that say, “I just love those big &lt;a href="w%3ABreast"&gt;titties&lt;/a&gt;,” or “I just want to be all over that big ass,” you know, how do you feel when you read things like that?

♡❤♡DS: Do you ask?

♡❤♡DS: Why do you feel the need to know why they come back?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think it’s good to sometimes question motivations and not just let things happen?

♡❤♡DS: Is it more challenging for a larger woman to &lt;a href="w%3Aorgasm"&gt;orgasm&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: Why is that?

<h2>What do fat people want to be called?</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What do fat people prefer to be called? In Spain if you’re fat you’re ♡❤gordo♡❤ or ♡❤gorda♡❤. It’s not 'pleasantly plump'. It’s not 'carrying a few extra pounds'. We have so many euphemisms in this culture—

♡❤♡DS: —to get around saying that somebody is fat. Do you think that trying to come up with so many euphemisms in the end stigmatizes the actual natural state to be able to just say someone is fat much like someone -- gay people went through this, too -- oh, he’s “light in the loafers,” or, “he’s funny,” as opposed to being like, “He’s gay.”

♡❤♡DS: It’s not speaking a taboo, basically. To be fat is taboo and to say someone is fat...

♡❤♡DS: Are you against these euphemisms?

♡❤♡DS: People think it’s polite.

♡❤♡DS: What do fat people prefer to be called generally?

♡❤♡DS: Generally?

♡❤♡DS: Is there a terminology that is definitely taboo? That you hear and it’s not okay. Aside from the obvious, like you know, ‘fatty’ or something...

♡❤♡DS: Let me rephrase the question. For a person trying to be real but not wanting to be offensive, what advice would you give them when they’re trying to use a descriptor or trying to talk about a person who might be large?

♡❤♡DS: Yeah.

<h2>The film ♡❤The BBW World: Under the FAT!♡❤</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What’s going on with your film?

♡❤♡DS: What is the idea behind the film?

♡❤♡DS: You’re in production now?

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iraqi%20authorities%20demand%20that%20U.S.%20sever%20all%20contracts%20with%20Blackwater&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In an official report issued on Monday, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; authorities demanded that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; sever all contracts with &lt;a href="w%3ABlackwater%20USA"&gt;Blackwater USA&lt;/a&gt;, the private military security firm hired by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt; to protect its diplomats in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. The report accuses Blackwater employees of deliberately killing 17 civilians in an &lt;a href="w%3ABlackwater%20Baghdad%20shootings"&gt;incident&lt;/a&gt; that took place on September 16 in Nisoor square in Baghdad, and demands that Blackwater pay US$8 million in compensation to the families of each of the 17 victims.

Iraq's demands were outlined in an official report issued on Monday in Arabic and then translated by news agencies worldwide. The report says that on September 16, four Blackwater vehicles and two helicopters opened fire without provocation in Nisoor square, following a car bombing near a meeting involving a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt; official under Blackwater protection. The report says that at least 14 Iraqi civilians were killed in Nisoor square, and that two or three more were killed at a nearby intersection. 

The U.S. normally makes compensation payments to the families of civilians killed in battle, but at amounts far lower than the $8 million per family demanded in the report. The report said the compensation was high "because Blackwater uses employees who disrespect the rights of Iraqi citizens even though they are guests in this country."

The report asks for the Blackwater employees involved in the incident to be handed over for possible trial in Iraqi courts. Under a law introduced in 2004, private security employees are immune from prosecution in Iraq. However, the report argues that Blackwater's license to operate in Iraq expired in 2006, and thus it is no longer immune from prosecution under the 2004 law.

Although Blackwater has not yet responded to the Iraqi report, it has previously stated that its employees were acting in self-defense in the Nisoor square incident. At a congressional hearing last week, Blackwater USA founder &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Prince"&gt;Erik Prince&lt;/a&gt; told a congressional hearing that his men had come under fire and "returned fire at threatening targets."

&lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; professional sports club &lt;a href="w%3ASS%20Lazio"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; and their coach &lt;a href="w%3ADelio%20Rossi"&gt;Delio Rossi&lt;/a&gt; have been accused and charged with trying to influence the performance of &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Lecce"&gt;Lecce&lt;/a&gt; in April 2006.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALega%20Nazionale%20Professionisti"&gt;Italian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; said that Rossi attempted to ask Lazio president Claudio Lotito to contact Lecce officials and discuss their tactics ahead of the match and how their attempt was unsuccessful. Lazio won the match 1-0. Media reports say that the case started because of phone tap evidence.

According to an official mailing list post from &lt;a href="Wikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt; Volunteer Coordinator , &lt;a href="Wikimania"&gt;Wikimania&lt;/a&gt; 2008 will be held in &lt;a href="Alexandria"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.

The location was chosen because it is "particularly strong in the areas of reflecting the Wikimedia Foundation's roots in geo-diversity and multi-lingualism". According to the final tally, Alexandria placed first in the Funding, Location, Organizing Team, Rotation, Cost, and Venue. Alexandria had 3026 points total.

In second place with 2419 points was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28US%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. They placed first in Accommodation, Internet Access, Local Laws, Press, and Social Areas.

Finally, &lt;a href="Cape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; had 2003 points, placing first in Visas only.

The motto selected for Alexandria's bid is "Let The Knowledge Be Free Everywhere", Atlanta's was "A new day for the New South", and Cape Town's was "Wikimania 2008. The International Wikimania Conference."

According to the post, the used 12 different categories including Accommodation, Funding, Internet Access, Press, Organizing Team, and Visas. Each member of the jury had 60 points to assign to the three proposed venues.

The decision has provoked some debate on the selection process; complaints have been raised about &lt;a href="honour%20killings"&gt;honour killings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="LGBT"&gt;gay rights&lt;/a&gt; within Egypt, with some asserting that the &lt;a href="human%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; record of the country should have factored more into the decision process. In reaction to this criticism &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; has decided his talk at the conference will be entitled "♡❤Free knowledge and human rights♡❤".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKarlsruhe"&gt;Karlsruhe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Toronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; submitted official bids, but later withdrew at various points throughout the process.

Jiao Dan, a 22-year-old &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; student from &lt;a href="w%3AChangsha"&gt;Changsha&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AHunan"&gt;Hunan&lt;/a&gt; province, was found dead at about 6:00 a.m. on October 9 in the &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; suburb &lt;a href="w%3AInnaloo%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Innaloo&lt;/a&gt; by passers-by. 

The cause-of-death has not yet been confirmed. The woman is believed to have been returning home from her cleaning job in the city on Monday. She was found naked below the waist and with 'facial injuries'. 

Miss Dan was recorded alighting from a train at &lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20train%20station"&gt;Stirling train station&lt;/a&gt; at approximately 11 p.m., even though close friend Min Ding said she had warned the &lt;a href="w%3AEdith%20Cowan%20University"&gt;Edith Cowan University&lt;/a&gt; student to not use the train at night, as it was 'not safe'. Police have not yet charged anyone over the incident.

<h2>Quotes</h2>
♡❤♡Karl-Heinz Rummenigge:♡❤♡ “It’s a shame we didn’t win today. We deserved to win, we had 38 shots to their five. If Toni had scored right at the start, Frankfurt’s defensive tactics would have failed straight away. They defended well, but we certainly deserved to win. Everyone comes here and defends, but we mustn’t be knocked out of our stride by that.“

♡❤♡Ottmar Hitzfeld:♡❤♡ “There’ll come a home game once in a while where we don’t score. We were extremely profligate with our chances, we could have been in the lead after just a few seconds. We missed three or four good openings in the first half, but we were too imprecise today. It got more and more difficult as the match went on, because Frankfurt pulled nine men back and didn’t even go looking for a goal. We applied a lot of pressure, but today we were a little unlucky too, although I still thought we’d score if we remained patient. But Frankfurt did very well, and having Nikolov in goal hardly worked against them today.“

♡❤♡Friedhelm Funkel (Frankfurt coach):♡❤♡ “Obviously I’m happy with a point, because normally we’re not in the same league as Bayern. As everyone knows, we were missing a few key players today. We were extremely good tactically and we deserved the point, although obviously it was all down to defending. You don’t have many options when you’re forced to pick players who haven’t featured for a long time. My players defended to the bets of their abilities today. All that mattered was coming away with a point. Nikolov had a tremendous match, and we rode our luck in certain situations.“

♡❤♡Oka Nikolov (Frankfurt keeper):♡❤♡ “We defended with eleven men at times, but that’s hardly surprising given Bayern’s class. We got lucky too, but the only thing that counts is that we’ve earned a point.“

<h2>Post-Match Quotes</h2>
♡❤♡Ottmar Hitzfeld:♡❤♡ “I’m very satisfied, we played well for long periods. Collecting three points was the important thing today. We had more of the possession and made the most of our opponents’ mistakes. The opening goal eased us mentally, but our opponents were boosted when they pulled one back. Our counter-attacks weren’t accurate enough, we wasted three or four chances. We’re still not as stable as we were at the start of the season. It was obvious we suffered an attack of nerves at the end. Ribéry was sensational again today, I took him aside for a one-hour motivational talk yesterday.“

♡❤♡Oliver Kahn:♡❤♡ “Especially in the first half, we were a lot better than we have been in recent matches and we were a lot more passionate again. The way the breaks for internationals work always causes us problems. You have players appearing for their national teams, on Saturday and again on Wednesday, for Italy, France and Argentina, and that obviously takes its toll. There needs to be a discussion about overhauling the match calendar. It affects the battle for the German championship.“

♡❤♡Felix Magath:♡❤♡ “It was good to be back at the Allianz Arena. I had the feeling we were holding out well in the first half-hour, but their opening goal indicated we’re not quite solid enough yet. We lost our shape for a while after that. We only pulled ourselves together after they went 2-0 up. We played with a lot of heart, but not a great deal of intelligence. We never found the right solutions. Bayern were well worth the win.“

&lt;a href="w%3AEverton%20FC"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Nuremberg"&gt;Nürnberg&lt;/a&gt; 2-0 to move top of &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Cup%202007-08%20group%20stage%23Group%20A"&gt;Group A&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Cup%202007-08"&gt;2007-08 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

The first chance for the visiting team came just over 20 seconds into the match when Mikel Arteta saw his shot saved by Nürnberg goalkeeper Jaromír Blažek, before Tim Cahill's followup shot was tipped onto the goalposts. Nürnberg had chances from Peer Kluge and Dominik Reinhardt, but Kluge's attempt went just wide of the posts while Tim Howard saved Reinhardt's shot. 

Everton opened the scoring late in the match when Berti Gláuber brought down Victor Anichebe, giving the visitors a penalty which Arteta converted. Five minutes later Anichebe scored to extend Everton's lead.

In the other Group A match of the evening, &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg"&gt;Zenit Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AAEL%201964"&gt;Larissa&lt;/a&gt; 3-2. Everton lead Group A with two wins from two matches and look likely to qualify for the knockout stage. Saint Petersburg are second with four points while Dutch side &lt;a href="w%3AAZ%20Alkmaar"&gt;AZ Alkmaar&lt;/a&gt; have one point with a game in hand. Nürnberg, defeated in their only match so far, are fourth in the group and Larissa are bottom with two defeats from two matches.

A 14-year-old student opened fire in a &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; high school today, wounding four people. The gunman then fatally shot himself.

Police were called to the scene at 1:15 p.m. EST, with reports of a gunman in the school. The gunman, 14-year-old Asa H. Coon, entered the school with a gun in each hand. Students were evacuated, with the gunman reportedly still in the building for some time afterward.

According to Cleveland mayor &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20G.%20Jackson"&gt;Frank Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, two adult males, ages 57 and 42, and two teenage males, ages 18 and 14, were wounded, and taken to local hospitals. A third teenager, a 14-year-old female, hurt her knee while running from the school.

A spokesperson for the hospital would not give details of the students' names or conditions, but Jackson said in an afternoon press conference that all three teenagers were in stable condition.

According to one student, 14-year-old student Michael Peek was the first person shot, after reportedly punching Coon in the face. The student indicated that Peek did not know that Coon was armed at the time. 18-year-old student Darnell Rodgers told the media that he was the other student shot, a graze wound for which he was treated and subsequently released.

The 57-year-old teacher, David Kachadourian, was listed in good condition. 42-year-old teacher Michael Grassie was in surgery and his condition was unavailable.

The gunman was reportedly upset about a recent suspension arising from a fight that happened Monday near the school.

According to one student interviewed by &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;♡❤CNN♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, the gunman said he "worshiped the devil" and had mentioned committing a shooting at the school. Another student noted that the gunman often wore a trench coat and an empty pistol belt to class.

A security guard was present on the first floor of the building, but the position of a guard on the third floor was eliminated. While metal detectors were present in the building, they were not always in use; it is unclear whether they were in use at the time of the shooting.

The school, &lt;a href="w%3ASuccessTech%20Academy"&gt;SuccessTech Academy&lt;/a&gt;, is a non-traditional school within the &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Metropolitan%20School%20District"&gt;Cleveland Metropolitan School District&lt;/a&gt;, described on their web site as a "small, nontraditional high school that provides a learning environment in which all student believe in their ability to succeed." It opened five years ago.

SuccessTech is located on the third, fourth and fifth floors of a building in downtown Cleveland that also houses some administrative offices.

The school owes its existence in part to a grant from the &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20and%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation"&gt;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which helped to fund the creation of the school.

Wednesday morning, the &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt%20Book%20Fair"&gt;Frankfurt Book Fair&lt;/a&gt; opened its gates to the first of an estimated 280,000 visitors this year in &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt am Main&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Frankfurt Book Fair is the biggest book fair in the world. It also organises the participation of German publishers at more than 25 international book fairs and is the co-founder of the Cape Town Book Fair in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It maintains the most visited website worldwide for the publishing industry.

The German Publishers &amp; Booksellers Association, which runs the Frankfurt Book Fair, says that the book market is thriving. It declared on Tuesday that the high number of exhibitors and the record numbers of 7,448 exhibitors from over 100 countries, showing 391,652 books, including 121,267 new books of this year, proves that the book market is thriving.

&lt;a href="w%3APublishing"&gt;Publishing houses&lt;/a&gt; have long since expanded into non-traditional markets. &lt;a href="w%3ATelevision"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMerchandising"&gt;merchandising rights&lt;/a&gt; have long played a role, but have become more and more important for larger projects. Two other media forms have also become more standard elements of the &lt;a href="w%3Avalue%20chain"&gt;value chain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AE-books"&gt;E-books&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aaudiobook"&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt;s are both big topics of this year's Book Fair.

<h4>Awards for Julia Franck, Michelle de Kretser, Saul Friedländer and Nintendo</h4>

The £16 billion &lt;a href="w%3ACrossrail"&gt;Crossrail Scheme&lt;/a&gt;, that will run through &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABerkshire"&gt;Berkshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEssex"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt; was given the go ahead; construction will begin by 2010 and it is expected to be finished by 2017. The line, that will provide 24-hour trains to the centre of London from the east and the west, will provide a better rail link to the West End.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; said "It was a great day for London, Crossrail and the economy" with the project expected to add £20 billion a year to the UK economy.

The government is providing a third of the money with the rest made up from borrowing against future fares and a levy on London business rates.

The news was also welcomed from the railway union &lt;a href="w%3ARMT"&gt;RMT&lt;/a&gt;, who had been protesting to the government to go further for a new north to south high speed rail link.

Crossrail is also hoped to reduce the overcrowding to airports such as &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20airport"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/a&gt; and many others.

After the success of &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; Photovoltaic Forum 2006, the organizer Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) held PV Taiwan 2007 Forum and Exhibition at Taipei International Convention Center on October 11 and 12. This forum and exhibitions attracted 74 companies participating with 110 exhibition booths at TICC 1F and 2F, and is mainly focused on photovoltaic materials/modules/products, electrical system transformation products, system appliances.

According to TAITRA, with the environment topic on global warming, increasing of oil prices, environment awareness, and greenhouse effect, solar energy is a very important energy source from now. The production value is currently increasing world-wide, with the help of semiconductor industry, the photovoltaic industry will play a suitable role at energy and environment industry in Taiwan.

In the exhibition, lots of exhibitors showed their solutions and products on solar energy modules and photovoltaic products with lots of unique functions such as waterproof, long-time usage, and industry integration. One of the exhibitors - Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) also held a seminar and "Jinyi Award" for nominated participants and college students on photovoltaic industry.

After lots of speculations and speculative &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; betting on the outcome it has been announced that &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; author &lt;a href="w%3ADoris%20Lessing"&gt;Doris Lessing&lt;/a&gt; ("The Golden Notebook", 1962) is the winner of the 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ANobel_Prize_in_Literature"&gt;Nobel Prize for Literature&lt;/a&gt;. 

At the International Book Fair at &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently underway, this decision has met with general approval, as a decision awarding the literary work of an author well established beyond her native country, rather than a political statement. The reason given for giving the prestigious award to Doris Lessing was to honour "that epicist of the female experience, who with skepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny". 

Lessing herself, who will turn 88 on October 22, has been named a potential candidate over the last 30 years - so long in fact, that she herself once exclaimed: "I'll never get it". Finally, on December 10, 2007, the Nobel Prize including 10 million &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish_kronor"&gt;Swedish Kronor&lt;/a&gt; (€1.1 million) will be awarded to her in &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AParliamentary%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20Europe"&gt;The Council of Europe Parliamentary assembly&lt;/a&gt; (CoE) urged its member states to only teach &lt;a href="w%3Acreationism"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; as nothing more than belief. The CoE stressed the potential threat to human rights that may result from creationist doctrines.

The adopted resolution targeting creationism is a reaction to growing fear in the CoE member states that progressive scientific thought is threatened by the advancement of fundamentalism and its perceived dangers. The &lt;a href="%26quot%3BCreationism%20and%20intelligent%20design%20have%20no%20place%20in%20the%20UK%20science%20curriculum%26quot%3B%20says%20UK%20Government"&gt;British government marginalized intelligent design into 'religious' belief&lt;/a&gt; even before the adoption of the CoE resolution.

Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) showed their solutions of excellence not only at TAITRONICS Autumn and TaiwanRFID exhibitions, but also held "The 4th Jinyi Award Ceremony" and "Photovoltaic Applications on Construction Seminar" accompanied with PV &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; Forum and Exhibition this year.

For the "Jinyi Award", ITRI set a special pavilion at their booth to show the nominated products and current solutions with solar energy. According to ITRI, "Jinyi Award" encouraged individual or group participants can applied the creations on solar energy and photovoltaics to life of the human beings. ITRI also hoped those solutions can transform with valued products. This year, ITRI cooperated with Taiwan Design Center supervised by Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) with judgments of the 4th Jinyi Award.

This competition has three groups (Product Design, Professional Design, Design Competition) with different natures, competition places, and fields of participants. Winners of "Professional Design Group" and the 1st and 2nd place of "Design Competition Group" were named at the Ceremony.

After the Ceremony, ITRI held "Photovoltaic Applications on Construction Seminar" for participants with semiconductor, photovoltaic, environment, and constriction industries. "Governments and companies in Taiwan should learn some successful cases in Europe and USA. ITRI started constructions of photovoltaic and solar energy system at South Taiwan. Photovoltaic and solar energy are the valuable and important energy source from now, and its industry will be taken effect on some environment issues such as increasing of oil prices, greenhouse effect, trendy changes of environment awareness." Dr. Joeng-shein Chen (Deputy Manager of Photovoltaics Technology Center of Industrial Technology Research Institute) taught to the participants at this seminar.

<h3>US Crude Oil reaches new high</h3>

Oil prices in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; briefly hit a new all-time high at &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$84.05, but later fell to just under that to $83.69. &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Crude"&gt;Brent Crude&lt;/a&gt; also rose to $80.55, up 40 cents in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

The high prices are amid fears that &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; is planning to attack &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKurdish%20people"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; militants that killed 13 Turkish soldiers last Sunday. 60,000 Turkish troops are stationed at the Iraq-Turkey border.

I had an unofficial phone call from &lt;a href="w%3AGay%20Talese"&gt;Gay Talese&lt;/a&gt; last Tuesday. He had just flown back from &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and he was cranky. "I'm happy to do an interview with you," he said, "but &lt;a href="Gay%20Talese%20on%20the%20state%20of%20journalism%2C%20Iraq%20and%20his%20life"&gt;what the hell could you ask me&lt;/a&gt; that's not already out there? Have you even bothered to look?!” 

"Jeez, Mr. Talese, lots of things," was my response. I lied. The truth is that when I call people to interview them, I do not have a set of preconceived questions. My agenda is to talk to them and gain a sense of who they are; to flesh them out as humans. To find out what they think about the world around them at that moment. With Gay Talese I had little interest in talking about ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Sinatra%20Has%20a%20Cold"&gt;Frank Sinatra Has a Cold&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and with &lt;a href="w%3AAugusten%20Burroughs"&gt;Augusten Burroughs&lt;/a&gt; I had little interest in discussing ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARunning%20with%20Scissors"&gt;Running with Scissors&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. I want to know what they think about things outside of the boxes people have placed them in.

With a memoirist like Burroughs, even this is a challenge. What parts of his life he has not written about himself, other interviewers have strip-mined. When we met for dinner at Lavagna in the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Village%2C%20Manhattan"&gt;East Village&lt;/a&gt;, I explained to Augusten this issue. I suggested we make the interview more of a conversation to see if that would be more interesting. "Instead of you in the catbird seat," I said, "let's just talk." 

We struck an instant rapport. What set out to be an hour and half interview over dinner had turned into four hours of discussion about our lives similarly lived. I removed half of the interview: the half that focused on me.

Below is ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter ’s conversation with writer Augusten Burroughs.

♡❤♡DS: Which is what one tends to do.

♡❤♡DS: As happens.

♡❤♡DS: I know that feeling.

♡❤♡DS: You saw all this, but how long did it take before you started saying, 'I need to stop'?

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3ARosacea"&gt;Gin blossoms&lt;/a&gt; kind of stuff.

[food arrives]

♡❤♡DS: You were proud of it.

♡❤♡DS: That accomplishment is so difficult.

♡❤♡DS: That gives you some amount of respect for people who write a book of crap, but yet write a book.

♡❤♡DS: It’s like, you can have the talent, but if you don't have that discipline to actually carry it through, the talent's wasted.

♡❤♡DS: How did you get the discipline?

♡❤♡DS: You were sober at the time?

♡❤♡DS: And you couldn't have probably done all this without being sober.

<h2>On the Turcottes and his mother</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Did you read the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ interview with the Turcottes?

♡❤♡DS: You just don't have an interest?

♡❤♡DS: A debate that is not a debate.

♡❤♡DS: It's like &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust%20denial"&gt;Holocaust denial&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡DS: Do you think the memoirist has a responsibility to inform people that they're writing about that they're writing about them?

♡❤♡DS: Although you could with this.

♡❤♡DS: Did you listen to the &lt;a href="w%3ANPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; interview with your mom?

♡❤♡DS: She's still in that ‘I’m &lt;a href="w%3AAnne%20Sexton"&gt;Anne Sexton&lt;/a&gt;’ thinking?

♡❤♡DS: It’s ironic that the notoriety she's received has been via you; do you think that in some ways she likes it?

♡❤♡DS: There's no such thing as bad publicity.

♡❤♡DS: Make that time.

♡❤♡DS: Intellectually, that’s nice, but I mean, in the end --

♡❤♡DS: -- it's still your experience too, and what you went through. It's almost like someone who pleads the insanity defense. You can't really blame them. But they still killed your mom, raped your sister or whatever.

♡❤♡DS: She takes credit for your writing career.

♡❤♡DS: Does that bother you at all?

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20Berg%20%28author%29"&gt;Elizabeth Berg&lt;/a&gt; writes a lot about parental and domestic relationships. Do you think that you're dealing with latent issues with your mom through your love of Berg?

♡❤♡DS: In the ♡❤Vanity Fair♡❤ article Teresa said that she had come down to New York to visit you with her kids--

♡❤♡DS: And that you were saying that you want to marry her, how great she is, what a kind person she is…

♡❤♡DS: She's really going to be there with you.

♡❤♡DS: Do you think that's what it was, the motivation?

♡❤♡DS: They got what they wanted apparently from settling with Sony?

♡❤♡DS: Setting the record straight?

♡❤♡DS: Yeah.

<h2>On his work</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Do you read reviews of your work, and commentary on it?

♡❤♡DS: Did it ever bother you if you came across somebody using the &lt;a href="w%3ATwelve%20Steps"&gt;Twelve Steps&lt;/a&gt; in a review of your work?

♡❤♡DS: I mean comparing the things you did with your writing and comparing them to how they conform to the principles in the Twelve Steps. It happened with Frey too, where all of a sudden you had these alcoholics coming out and saying, "Oh, this is such a typical alcoholic, doing this or doing that. It’s not very Step Eight,” or whatever… You never came across that?

♡❤♡DS: Do you still feel that way? 

♡❤♡DS: That's the ‘nothing’s original’ thing, isn't it?

♡❤♡DS: Do you know anyone who is?

<h2>On the response to his work from addicts</h2>

♡❤♡DS: How does it feel to be a hero to addicts?

♡❤♡DS: You replaced it with writing?

♡❤♡DS: Have you ever had an alcoholic write you and ask you to be their sponsor?

♡❤♡DS: When people write to you, and they say they relate to your work, what element do they say they responded to--your upbringing, your relationship with your mother, your contending with alcoholism? You write on such a variety of topics--

♡❤♡DS: Is there a theme that seems to resonate most with people in your life?

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;?

<h2>On belief in a higher power</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you believe in a &lt;a href="w%3AHigher%20power"&gt;higher power&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: Did you ever come close to believing?

♡❤♡DS: Through a program?

♡❤♡DS: Did it feel false to you?

[♡❤dishes are removed from table♡❤]

♡❤♡DS: Which I think a lot of people do.

♡❤♡DS: 'Fake it 'til you make it.'

♡❤♡DS: What was your higher power, then?

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤chuckles♡❤]

♡❤♡DS: Sounds like something--that it would be great if one of your fans drew for you.

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤chuckles♡❤]

♡❤♡DS: A swarm of cows and cartoon Jesuses. You’ll have to start a collection.

♡❤♡DS: When did you lose it, though? When did you lose the belief in the higher power?

♡❤♡DS: I meant more so in recovery, when you said to yourself, ‘I'm just not getting the higher power thing’, or, ‘I just have to give up on the cartoon Jesus.’

♡❤♡DS: Once you were stronger.

♡❤♡DS: It's a very small thought.

<h2>On the gay community</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What are your feelings about the &lt;a href="w%3Agay%20community"&gt;gay community&lt;/a&gt;? Do you feel part of it?

[♡❤Waiter stops by♡❤]

♡❤♡DS: You had bigger issues to--

♡❤♡DS: I always found the idea of &lt;a href="w%3AGay%20pride"&gt;pride&lt;/a&gt;--I mean, I understand the genesis of it.

♡❤♡DS: I do understand where it came from. But now when I hear it, it sounds like such an anachronism. It's like--

♡❤♡DS: "I proudly serve &lt;a href="w%3AStarbucks"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; coffee." The word "pride" is so bandied about in so many venues, and it's like, what do you mean, you “proudly” serve Starbucks coffee? What do you mean that you're “proud” about being gay, or --

♡❤♡DS: You accepted yourself--

♡❤♡DS: Yeah. I can understand that.

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Laughs♡❤] That's great…

<h2>On his new book, ♡❤A Wolf at the Table♡❤, a memoir about his father</h2>

♡❤♡DS: How did you teach yourself to write about difficult things in your life with such humor?

♡❤♡DS: But originally you didn't, right? I heard an interview where you said you started writing something and you were like, 'Oh, God, this is just so depressing'--

♡❤♡DS: And then you put it away, and decided that you were going to write something funny, which I think was ♡❤Sellevision♡❤?

♡❤♡DS: Did you make a choice--

♡❤♡DS: Why was the choice made?

♡❤♡DS: Did you try to write it funny at first?

♡❤♡DS: 'Oh, another Burroughs!'

♡❤♡DS: No.

♡❤♡DS: But also, too, your fans should realize that you're not one-dimensional.

♡❤♡DS: With your writing, that you don't have a--

♡❤♡DS: It's like, "Oh, we wanna see Data from 'Star Trek' be Data; we don't want to see him in his full range of emotions," you know--

♡❤♡DS: Versatile.

♡❤♡DS: Why do you think you are so serious in person?

♡❤♡DS: Is it like a purpose-ness? That you're very purpose-driven now, or--?

♡❤♡DS: Do you and Dennis yuk it up at home?

♡❤♡DS: How can anyone--

<h2>On women's breasts and tattoos</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What's your favorite curse word?

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Chuckles♡❤] That's always the one that--

♡❤♡DS: It ♡❤does.♡❤

♡❤♡DS: It’s a cutting word. Do you have a favorite euphemism for women's breasts?

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Chuckles♡❤] What would you name your breasts?

♡❤♡DS: Would Claire be the bigger one? 

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Laughs♡❤] Really?

♡❤♡DS: You're not like most gay men who have a fascination with breasts?

♡❤♡DS: Do you like them on other people?

♡❤♡DS: Do you have a breast fetish?

♡❤♡DS: My sister has stretch marks on her stomach that she's really self-conscious about--

♡❤♡DS: We've been talking about that!

♡❤♡DS: I had suggested to her tattooing a band of stars across it, that--

♡❤♡DS: Yeah, like where it starts out small, and goes like bigger over the marks?

♡❤♡DS: And she was all for it. We were going to take her to my tattoo guy, over here on First Avenue--

♡❤♡DS: And she all of a sudden has been like, "Mmmmm, I don't really know." And she's like, "Maybe I'm going to get a belly button ring." But that's going to ♡❤highlight♡❤ it! 

♡❤♡DS: No! So--

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Laughs♡❤] I should--it would only take one drink with her.

<h2>On losing his hair</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Was it difficult losing your hair?

♡❤♡DS: It's really hard.

♡❤♡DS: I freaked out on my mom one time because she made a joke about it. I went overboard, I just freaked out. This was years ago, when it was just first starting to go a little bit. But I also always had a high peak, always.

♡❤♡DS: As a matter of fact, people made fun of me about it in my Georgia high school.

♡❤♡DS: Yeah. [♡❤In a southern accent♡❤] "Sportin' a pretty big forehead, there, Day-vid."

♡❤♡DS: I freaked out. "You don't know what it's like! You don't have any idea!” It was Christmas. But a person has to get to a point where he accepts it.

♡❤♡DS: Like when you see guys who try all these creative styles to--

♡❤♡DS: You know, pushing all their hair forward, when it's really--

♡❤♡DS: You know, and you think--

♡❤♡DS: Let it go. It makes it seem like they have trouble dealing with things.

♡❤♡DS: There's wider implications.

♡❤♡DS: Or reflection of psychological issues.

♡❤♡DS: Yeah. You look very nice, without…

♡❤♡DS: Yeah, yeah.

♡❤♡DS: Like a hat.

♡❤♡DS: Wouldn't it be great if you were Jewish, and you could have a yarmulke with a hairpiece underneath it?

♡❤♡DS: Or, or you wore a hairpiece as a yarmulke.

♡❤♡DS: But you have one of those really great heads that are conducive to having a shaved head. Like sometimes you see guys, and you're like, "Oh, you don't really have the head for having a shaved head," you know?

♡❤♡DS: Misshapen heads…

♡❤♡DS: Thank you, thank God. I was told that by my sister, and I was like, "Oh, thank God," And she’s very honest with me.

♡❤♡DS: And I said, "Thank God," because I don't really have a choice?

♡❤♡DS: Well, this is why I also do the scruff here, because I'm losing my hair. It's completely like…

♡❤♡DS: I used to think that beards were a form of male self-mutilation. Now, if I don’t do it I feel like I look like &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%20Mailer"&gt;Norman Mailer&lt;/a&gt; or something. 

♡❤♡DS: Do you have nightmares?

An aging &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonnell%20Douglas%20MD-80/MD-90"&gt;McDonnell Douglas MD-83&lt;/a&gt; passenger jet (registration: SU-BOY) of &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AAMC%20Airlines"&gt;AMC Airlines&lt;/a&gt; with 156 passengers and seven crew on a charter flight made an emergency &lt;a href="w%3Abelly%20landing"&gt;belly landing&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AAtat%C3%BCrk%20International%20Airport"&gt;Atatürk International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; after requesting permission to perform an emergency landing for technical reasons. 

The plane was returning vacationers to &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AHurghada"&gt;Hurghada&lt;/a&gt; and was bound for &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw%20Frederic%20Chopin%20Airport"&gt;Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport&lt;/a&gt;. 

The plane caught fire while belly landing and overshot the runway. One person was hurt. There were no fatalities. The plane is likely a total loss. 

The &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; pilot said that the landing, which was made in darkness, was possible because of speckless sky at the time.

<h1>Turkey outraged over U.S. Armenian genocide resolution</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Turkey%20outraged%20over%20U.S.%20Armenian%20genocide%20resolution&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; officials have expressed outrage over a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; congressional &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20Resolution%20106"&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; labeling the &lt;a href="w%3AOttoman%20Empire"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s World War I era killings of up to 1.5 million Armenians as "genocide". The Turkish government has warned that the resolution threatens its strategic partnership with the U.S.

The resolution, passed 27-21 by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs"&gt;U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, states that "[t]he Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, resulting in the deportation of nearly 2,000,000 Armenians, of whom 1,500,000 men, women, and children were killed". The resolution calls on the President " to ensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the United States record relating to the Armenian Genocide." 

The World War I era killings, commonly referred to as the &lt;a href="w%3AArmenian%20Genocide"&gt;Armenian Genocide&lt;/a&gt;, have been &lt;a href="w%3ARecognition%20of%20the%20Armenian%20Genocide"&gt;recognized as genocide&lt;/a&gt; by 22 countries, including &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. The killings have also been officially labeled as "genocide" by 40 of the 50 U.S. states. Turkey acknowledges that Armenians were killed, but calls it a massacre rather than an organized campaign of genocide.

On Thursday the Turkish government released a statement saying that "It is unacceptable that the Turkish nation should be accused of a crime that it never committed in its history." "We still hope that the House of Representatives will have enough good sense not to take this resolution further," the statement added. A statement on the Turkish Foreign Ministry web site said that the resolution "will not only endanger relations with a friendly and allied nation but will also jeopardize a strategic partnership that has been cultivated for generations." 

On Thursday, Turkey recalled its U.S. ambassador Nabi Sensoy, and warned of further repercussions. "Yesterday some in Congress wanted to play hardball," said Turkish foreign policy adviser Egemen Bagis. "I can assure you Turkey knows how to play hardball."

White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said he was "disappointed" by the vote. While acknowledging that "[w]e understand the feelings that people have about the tragic suffering of the Armenian people," Stanzel warned that "Turkey is playing a critical role in the war on terror and this action is problematic for everything we're trying to do in the Middle East and would cause great harm to our efforts." U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; had lobbied against the resolution, saying that it would damage relations between the U.S. and Turkey.

House of Representatives speaker &lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; said the resolution will go forward for a vote in the House despite Turkish opposition. "As long as there is genocide, there is a need to speak out against it," Pelosi said.

&lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEnvoy"&gt;Envoy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Eliasson"&gt;Jan Eliasson&lt;/a&gt; said Thursday that negotiating a ceasefire in the conflict occurring in the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; will be the main goal of the peace talks scheduled for later this month. 

"The first very concrete step ... is that we will go for and hopefully achieve a credible cessation of hostilities," Eliasson said in &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;.

"I find the situation on the ground ... deeply alarming. The military escalation is a great source of concern...Haven't we seen enough violence and hopelessness? Don't we see what is happening to the social fabric of Darfur ... torn apart completely -- is this what we want to perpetuate?"

Eliasson also warned that any delay in the negotiations would be detrimental in stopping the violence in the region. Despite protests from rebel leaders, he pleaded for affiliates from all of the numerous rebel groups to attend the peace talks, currently scheduled for October 27th in &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Malloch%20Brown"&gt;Mark Malloch Brown&lt;/a&gt;, Britain's Minister for Africa, said Wednesday that rebel groups who do not participate in the peace talks will not benefit from any possible ceasefire deals. 

"Anybody who wants to be a legitimate representative of the Darfuri people needs to go," Lord Malloch Brown said. 

"If they opt out, they should understand the consequences of doing that - probably their role in the peace negotiations may be finished." 

These comments came on the same day that forces believed to be from the Sudanese government and &lt;a href="w%3Ajanjaweed"&gt;janjaweed&lt;/a&gt; militias attacked a fortification in Muhajiriya of the &lt;a href="w%3ASudanese%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;Sudanese Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; (SLA), the only rebel group to co-sign a 2006 peace agreement with the Sudanese government. At least 40 people were killed in the attack. 

"Until now the number of dead civilians are at least 40, with 80 missing and a large number of injured," the SLA said in a statement sent to &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. They believe that Sudan's army was responsible for the attack, although the government has refuted this accusation.

"There has to be an international investigation immediately," said &lt;a href="w%3AMinni%20Arcua%20Minnawi"&gt;Minni Arcua Minnawi&lt;/a&gt;, an SLA leader who became a presidential advisor in Khartoum. Speculation is rampant about the motivations for the attack, although analysts in &lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt; claim that the rebel movement and the government were barely allies even after the signing of the peace pact.

Another crisis in the peace process occurred Thursday when the main southern political party pulled out of the government due to Khartoum's inability to share power. Former rebels from the &lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20People%27s%20Liberation%20Movement"&gt;Sudan People's Liberation Movement&lt;/a&gt; (SPLM) withdrew from the national government after the escalation of violence against rebels.

Adding even more to the uncertainty leading up to the peace talks, UN Secretary General &lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; said in a report that Khartoum was delaying the deployment of the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt;-UN hybrid peacekeeping force.

"The implementation timeline for &lt;a href="w%3AUNAMID"&gt;UNAMID&lt;/a&gt; is being delayed owing to ... delays in obtaining feedback regarding the list of troop-contributing countries submitted to the government of Sudan," said the Secretary General's report.

"I remain extremely concerned about the continuing violence in Darfur. The ongoing loss of life and displacement of civilians is unacceptable and is not contributing to an atmosphere conducive to peace talks." 

Though these events have put the peace talks at risk, all involved know that the success of the talks is critical for the well-being of the region. As Eliasson said, "To miss this opportunity is a tragedy -- this is the moment of truth,".

<h1>Sam Brownback on running for President, gay rights, the Middle East and religion</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sam%20Brownback%20on%20running%20for%20President%2C%20gay%20rights%2C%20the%20Middle%20East%20and%20religion&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Brownback"&gt;Sam Brownback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is perplexed. The &lt;a href="U.S.%20Senator"&gt;U.S. Senator&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; and Presidential candidate is a Republican whose politics—he is against &lt;a href="same-sex%20marriage"&gt;marriage for gay people&lt;/a&gt;, he is against abortion, and he has a clean image in a party tainted by scandal—should speak favorably to the party's base. But it has not. "I'm baffled by that myself," Senator Brownback told ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter . "We haven't been able to raise money." 

A recent poll in Iowa has put him in eighth place, with 2% supporting his campaign. "If we don't finish fourth or better in Iowa...we'll pull out." 

Senator Brownback's relationship with God infuses almost every answer you find below. Although he doesn't feel "competent" to explain why God would dislike gays, he does feel strongly that allowing two men or two women to enter into the union of marriage will destroy it for heterosexuals. Pointing to the research of Stanley Kurtz at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHoover%20Institution"&gt;Hoover Institution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Brownback asserts that Northern Europeans have "taken the sacredness out of the institution." 

In the interview, Senator Brownback discusses the tug-and-pull that befalls him when his constituents show up at his office and say, "Look, I'm a conservative, but we need this bridge, we need this subsidy, we need this hospital.” Brownback feels this spending system needs to be changed; however, when it comes to energy policy, Brownback is there for his constituents. David Shankbone asked the Kansas Senator, a supporter of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acellulosic%20ethanol"&gt;cellulosic ethanol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , why he doesn't support the lowering of tariffs on sugar since &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asugar%20ethanol"&gt;sugar ethanol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; delivers 8 times the energy output of cellulosic ethanol. Brazil, in particular, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEthanol%20fuel%20in%20Brazil"&gt;has become energy independent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; because of its sugar ethanol program. It's cheaper to produce, and there is vastly more bang for the buck in sugar fuel than in corn fuel; an entire country no longer needs to import oil because of it. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASucrose%23Trade%20and%20economics"&gt;Federal tariffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; currently make sugar ethanol too expensive in the United States. "You're going to kill the ethanol industry here just as it gets going," was Senator Brownback's response. However, there is a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEthanol%20fuel%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;debate over whether the process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to make corn ethanol uses more energy than the ethanol itself produces. 

Below is David Shankbone's interview with Senator Sam Brownback.

<h2>On running in and possibly leaving the Presidential race</h2>

♡❤♡David Shankbone: Senator Brownback, how are you?

♡❤♡DS: I read that.

♡❤♡DS: Is it pretty gratifying for you to work with people on the other side of the aisle to try and find solutions?

♡❤♡DS: I remember sort of the old days where you'd hear about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; being best friends with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrrin%20Hatch"&gt;Orrin Hatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; do you think that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; period ushered in an era where people were too opposed to each other on the sides of the aisle?

♡❤♡DS: Running for President has to be a grueling experience, and there must be a million things that you see out there when you're on the road that either you had not thought about before or you didn't know existed. Could you tell me about one?

♡❤♡DS: That's great. Throughout my life, my father, who is an avid lifelong Republican, he used to tell me--this is a question that &lt;a href="Interview%20with%20U.S.%20Republican%20Presidential%20candidate%20Tom%20Tancredo"&gt;I'd asked Tom Tancredo&lt;/a&gt; as well, but I think it really comes down to one of the central issues in this race--he had said, "All we need is a Republican Congress, a Republican Senate, and a Republican White House to get the country on the right track." And last year, he expressed to me that he was very disappointed with where things have gone with the Republicans running things. He feels let down; he feels like he was lied to by the Party, either through the rationale for the Iraq war, the sex and bribery scandals, the pork barrel projects, and, as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Greenspan"&gt;Alan Greenspan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said, the fiscal irresponsibility. He feels like there have been many broken promises. Why should someone like my father vote Republican today? And I can assure you he will. But why do you think he should?

♡❤♡DS: When you think about dropping out of the race, what emotions do you feel?

♡❤♡DS: You've discussed it, and I'm just wondering when it's a thought that occurs to you-- not an inevitability---just when you think about it as a possibility, how do you feel when you reflect upon it?

♡❤♡DS: Do you feel sad when you think about possibly leaving?

<h2>On the role of religion in the Presidential race</h2>

♡❤♡DS: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEvangelical"&gt;Evangelical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; candidates haven't fared particularly well in this primary season. What do you think is the reason for that?

♡❤♡DS: The Democrats often have concerns about the electability of their candidates; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , for example. Do you think that it might scare some people that in this point in time that Evangelicals aren't particularly electable?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMormon"&gt;Mormonism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is an issue that people should take into consideration?

♡❤♡DS: What if someone was a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZoroastrian"&gt;Zoroastrian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?

♡❤♡DS: Or a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASatanism"&gt;Satanist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

♡❤♡DS: Really?

♡❤♡DS: Even though religious beliefs are so fundamental to a person? It's more of a policy issue than it is a faith issue?

♡❤♡DS: If someone told you that they were scared to vote for someone who doesn't believe in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aevolution"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , what would you say to that person?

♡❤♡DS: You don’t think that evolution is incompatible with an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aintelligent%20design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; theory? That we could have evolved based upon the evolution idea, but that it could have still been the work of God?

♡❤♡DS: What's your personal belief on that?

♡❤♡DS: It works.

<h2>On the culture of life</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity?

♡❤♡DS: What is the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aculture%20of%20life"&gt;culture of life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ? How would you describe that phrase?

♡❤♡DS: Bobby Schindler, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Schiavo"&gt;Terry Schiavo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's brother, endorsed your candidacy by saying that "Sam Brownback is the pro-life conservative we can trust to stand for all life, regardless of political calculations." Do you think the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20penalty"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; detracts from the culture of life?

<h2>On the Iraq War and the Middle East</h2>

♡❤♡DS: A common question I've asked in my interviews is about the Iraq War and how it has affected someone as a person. People often proffer their opinion on the war, but they don't really talk much about how it has affected them personally, perhaps in their world view. The writer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGay%20Talese"&gt;Gay Talese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; insisted the war has not affected him at all. "I wish it had," he said. Talese thinks there's a problem with Americans not sacrificing enough, and he argued that we need &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aconscription"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Do you think we need conscription, if not to support the manpower of the war, to make Americans more involved with the wars that we are fighting?

♡❤♡DS: What you think the proper role of Congress is in a time of war?

♡❤♡DS: Do you feel the American people were misled with the war in Iraq?

♡❤♡DS: What do you think is going to happen to &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Mubarak&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think it's a bad idea to have elections in countries if it's possible that an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20fundamentalism"&gt;Islamic extremist group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will win, such as happened in Palestine with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think that things like the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGravina%20Island%20Bridge"&gt;Bridge to Nowhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are projects that shouldn't be funded? And I'm using that popular phrase--I realize it's a little emotionally charged--but things such as that.

♡❤♡DS: You support the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElon%20Peace%20Plan"&gt;Elon plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that would essentially allow Israel to keep the entire West Bank while taking little responsibility for its Arab residents. The plan is against U.S., Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian policies. Why do you think that would advance peace in the Middle East?

<h2>On gay rights</h2>
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="Augusten%20Burroughs%20on%20addiction%2C%20writing%2C%20his%20family%20and%20his%20new%20book"&gt;I interviewed the writer Augusten Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;. I would like you to answer a question that he posed. He said that "God does not care that the person I watch TV with also has hairy arms, that the idea that a God would not like homosexuals is patently absurd, that it doesn't even begin to become logical in any way, that the idea that the architect of gravity, the being that created the ability for elemental particles that are absolutely nothing to come together and create living organisms and bricks and buildings and cars and jets, that the architect of absolutely everything would care about the sex of the person that this little human loves seems ridiculous." Why is that not ridiculous?

♡❤♡DS: Why do you think it would bother God that somebody is gay?

♡❤♡DS: In what country that has passed same-sex marriage has traditional marriage declined?

♡❤♡DS: Got you.

♡❤♡DS: Why did you vote against the Federal expansion of hate crimes to include sexual orientation?

♡❤♡DS: Ministers speaking out against homosexuality would come under the province of a hate crime?

</ul>
<h2>Brownback on Brownback</h2>
♡❤♡DS: If you could choose your manner of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adeath"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , how would you die?

♡❤♡DS: It's a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarcel%20Proust"&gt;Marcel Proust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; question.

♡❤♡DS: But you've never thought about how--if you could choose how you'd prefer to die?

♡❤♡DS: It seems like such a basic human thing to contemplate, one's mortality. I mean, I believe you, but--

♡❤♡DS: What weren't you happy with?

♡❤♡DS: That was your--

♡❤♡DS: Was that your impetus to run for the Senate?

♡❤♡DS: What trait do you deplore in other people?

♡❤♡DS: Oh...

<h2>On environmentalism and energy</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you believe that a good Christian should also be a good environmentalist?

♡❤♡DS: How so?

♡❤♡DS: And you don’t think that Arctic drilling contradicts that notion?

♡❤♡DS: What about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEthanol%20fuel"&gt;sugar ethanol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think we should lower tariffs on sugar in order to be able to import more Brazilian sugar ethanol?

♡❤♡DS: But it would reduce our dependency on foreign oil, thus increasing our national security, wouldn't it? Or is the ethanol industry here more important?

♡❤♡DS: But the energy that you derive from that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEthanol%20fuel%20energy%20balance"&gt;is so much less than it is in sugar ethanol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h2>On Wikipedia</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Senator, do you think that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is important?

♡❤♡DS: Definitely. What do you find important about it?

♡❤♡DS: I tried to get an interview with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miscavige"&gt;David Miscavige&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and I spoke to their Director of Public Relations; I had about a twenty-minute phone call with him, and he was very hostile to it. One of the things that I'd said to him--because he was saying that a lot of information is incorrect--I made the point to him that, "You know, it may be incorrect, but the idea is that you can have Scientologists go on there to correct it." It's not a one-sided place for information; if you feel that there's inaccuracies, the idea is that you can also have people who know the truth go on there and correct it and debate about it, if that is what is necessary to get an accurate view. Whereas if you say something to Newsweek, and they print something that's incorrect, you're stuck.

♡❤♡DS: Very good to talk to you. Best of luck, Senator Brownback.

The 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; was awarded today to former U.S. Vice President &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Gore"&gt;Albert Arnold Gore Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC).
The Nobel committee cited "for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change" as the reasons for awarding the prize. 

<h2>The Nobel Peace Prize</h2>
The Nobel Peace Prize (Swedish and Norwegian: Nobels fredspris) is the name of one of five Nobel Prizes bequeathed by the Swedish industrialist and inventor &lt;a href="w%3Aalfred%20nobel"&gt;Alfred Nobel&lt;/a&gt;.
The other prizes are given out in &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, in different categories, but the Peace prize is given out by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo, Norway. Last Year Muhammad Yunus and The Grameen Bank won the Nobel Peace Prize.

The Peace Prize is awarded annually in &lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. The actual prize always is presented on the 10th of December, the anniversary of the death of Nobel. The Norwegian king is in attendance. For the past decade, the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony at the Oslo City Hall has been followed the next day by the &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize%20Concert"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize Concert&lt;/a&gt;, which is broadcast to over 150 countries and more than 450 million households around the world. The Concert has received worldwide fame and the participation of top celebrity hosts and performers.

By the provisions of Nobel's will, the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded "♡❤to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses♡❤."

<h3>Norwegian Nobel Committee</h3>

The Committee's five members are entrusted with researching and adjudicating the Prize as well as awarding it. Although appointed by the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget), they are independent and answer to no legislative authority. Members of the Norwegian government are not permitted to sit on the Committee. 
Nominations for the Prize may be made by a broad array of qualified individuals, including former recipients, members of national assemblies and congresses, university professors (in certain disciplines), international judges, and special advisors to the &lt;a href="w%3Anorwegian%20nobel%20committee"&gt;Prize Committee&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Astate-owned%20enterprise"&gt;state-owned enterprise&lt;/a&gt; (SOE), &lt;a href="w%3AKordia"&gt;Kordia&lt;/a&gt; published its annual report a few days ago for the financial year ending June 30, 2007.

Formerly known as Broadcast Communications Ltd (BCL) prior to the name change in November 2006, the Crown-owned company offers contracting, consulting, and networking services. They operate a national communication network and provides network feeds and broadcast services for the major television and radio networks in New Zealand.

The annual report shows Kordia Group Limited's net profit, after tax, at NZ$11.9 million, the 2006 result was $9.8 million. Revenue was up from $201 million in the 2006 financial year to $264 million this year; a 31% increase. Chairman of Kordia, Wayne Brown, described this financial year as "solid achievement" while being "on track to record further growth in the exciting fields in which it operates."

These increases is despite the major acquisition of &lt;a href="w%3AOrcon%20Internet%20Limited"&gt;Orcon Internet Limited&lt;/a&gt;, an ISP (Internet service provider). Kordia will use Orcon, acquired on 2 July, 2007, to invest and deliver the possibilities of the current progress of &lt;a href="w%3ALocal_loop_unbundling%23New_Zealand"&gt;local loop unbundling&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;a href="w%3AWi-Fi"&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; zones, and &lt;a href="w%3AWiMAX"&gt;WiMAX&lt;/a&gt; technology. CEO of Kordia, Geoff Hunt, said, "Orcon will soon offer a complete range of Voice over IP products". Orcon is being operated at arms-length to the rest of the company.

Other areas where Kordia is advancing itself is mobile television transmission where they are already prepared to start services once content providers have been secured. Hunt said, "Spectrum is available, so all we need are the content providers and some good consumer demand. Then we'll be ready to roll."

Kordia is also immersing itself further in the television sector as well as its mobile television service. Other advances includes New Zealand's new digital television service, Freeview with it set to start terrestrial transmission next year.

&lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20TV"&gt;Parliament TV&lt;/a&gt; also began this year in July. All House proceedings are available via the Parliament website and a broadcast quality feed is provided to all broadcasters, with full coverage being televised by Freeview and Sky Network Television. The manager of Kordia's Transmission Control Centre, Merv Brooks, said, "This is another example of people and technology coming together to deliver a truly unique product to New Zealanders."

Being a SOE, Kordia is required to give the Government a dividend. The Government will receive a total dividend of $8.4 million; $6.8 million in 2006. A $3 million dividend had already been received by the Government so a payment of only $5.4 million was made.

At the 4th day of 2007 The 1st Taiwan International RFID Applications Show (TaiwanRFID 2007), in conjunction with TAITRONICS 2007, the organizer TAITRA held an international seminar with RFID solutions at the entrance of the seminar. This seminar is mainly focused on some topics (RFID applications and solutions world-wide) continued from the exhibition at TWTC Hall 3.

According to a survey by Institute for Information Industry (III), the top 3 productive value of RFID industry in Taiwan are sensor tags (39%), readers (31% approximately), and services (21%). This market trend can be observed at this exhibition with the industry nature of participated exhibitors such as chips producer, antennas, tags, and readers. Some of prominent manufacturers like IBM, Cheng Loong Co., Ltd., and ChungHua Telecom were participated at this exhibition.

Not only the performance of RFID applications, some of companies simulated the process of RFID smart tags in the factory to buyers. NXP semiconductor and National Instruments (NI) also provided RFID solutions to ensure the quality of RFID tags such as RFID test system by NI.

This RFID exhibition and TAITRONICS will open to 3 p.m. tomorrow.

The Internet is very much present at the &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt%20Book%20Fair"&gt;Frankfurt Book Fair&lt;/a&gt; 2007, not just, like in previous years, as a means for the journalists who have 80 workplaces for their own notebooks to report on the fair, but like before as a chance - and as a threat for rights-owners of digital media.
<h3>Bloggers in the Living Room 2.0 at the Fair</h3>

After a marginal existence in the previous year, bloggers have got their own "living room 2.0" at the fair, furnished with everything a blogger needs, including media attention. Every day from Wednesday October 10 to Sunday October 14 they will write and podcast about the big names to meet, the events not to be missed and their very personal experiences and thoughts. Three of the bloggers write in English, two English language podcasts are done, to widen the reach of the Book Fair 2.0. The blog entries and podcasts will be available until after the book fair at http://www.book-fair.com/en/wordpress/ and the bloggers themselves can be visited on the weekend at hall 4.2, Q411, though until now it is more the media and less the visitors of the fair, the bloggers come in contact with.
<h3>EBooks and Digitalization</h3>
Digitalization and digital media, especially books and magazines offered digitally, are a hot topic at this year's Frankfurt Book Fair, as more and more publishers want to see the digital counterparts of their traditional media not just as a field to be present in, but as a possible profit center. With scientific books, this move already was quite successful: Publishing house &lt;a href="w%3ASpringer%20Science%2BBusiness%20Media"&gt;Springer&lt;/a&gt; for example, offering over 40,000 &lt;a href="w%3AE-book"&gt;ebooks&lt;/a&gt; and over 1700 electronic magazines, of which over 1200 are still actively continued with Springer, nowadays does an ebook-variant of every traditional scientific book they print - and already has the largest part of their cash-flow from digital media. 

This is harder for fiction publishing houses as the Pabel Möwig group (VPM), which has become active early. They do offer the digitized new adventures of – say, the outer-space-hero &lt;a href="w%3APerry%20Rhodan"&gt;Perry Rhodan&lt;/a&gt; -, but the turnover is still only a small addition to the print and other media versions. Readers become readier to read on a screen, but their readiness is still growing slowly. Since a new generation of readers is growing up using the internet as a reference work – especially Google and &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; – it will become more and more natural in the future.

A growing number of service companies in the publishing sector therefore offers re-digitalization apart from increasingly effective content management systems, with which new forms of media can easily be compiled from the contents of a data base. Older works, of which the publishing house owns the rights, but for which a reprint might not be profitable, are scanned, divided into content sections and tagged. When the original type face isn’t good enough, books are typewritten in third world countries two or three times which are corrected and merged into a final version. Once in the system, digitalized books can be at disposal as &lt;a href="w%3AMobipocket"&gt;MobiPocket&lt;/a&gt; ebooks or Print On Demand (POD) and with aid of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon.com"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; BookSurge program remain available, possibly even within 24 hours. 

Digital content can also be used as a marketing-tool with the "Search Inside" from Amazon.com, where the full text of a book is visible but only small parts of the book are shown at a time. 

Right after Amazon, Google also presented their own projects for the digitalization of books, where publishers have the option of just sending a box or container full of their books in printed form and leave the job of digitalization to Google, where afterwards their content will be findable with Google Book Search. The difference between those two internet services was obvious, though: Amazon wants to earn money with books, while Google's business is advertising, their revenue model is AdSense and AdWords, targeted as perfect as possible with full text search. Both services had to answer questions as to how they will protect the content from unpaid exploitation, as probably fewer and fewer users will be willing to pay for a digital eBook when they can read the content for free, up to twenty pages at a time. The freeloader mentality of many Internet users was seen as a threat by many of the publishers. 
<h2>Pirates threatening the audiobooks</h2>

One product seen as endangered more than other media by the widespread internet piratery is the audiobooks. One of the more ambitious audiobook productions on five CDs would cost about 80,000 Euros and needs about 30,000 copies sold to sell at a profit. Once only 10,000 copies are sold and 20,000 downloaded via illegal filesharing on the internet, the model isn't profitable anymore, and the audiobook market, now thriving, might wither away again, explained Johannes Stricker of 'Der Hörverlag' publishing. Sideprofits possible in the music business are not possible for audiobooks: concerts are not the same as the public readings, which are often a deficit affair, and no one wants to pay for audiobook ringtones. On top of that, one complete work is much more costly than an album full of music, often 29, 49, 79 or even 99 Euros have to be paid for a full length reading. These prices in mind, especially young listeners rather take the free filesharing, especially as a bad conscience or the thought that this is illegal is absent from the young minds, as Oliver Rohrbeck, a famous speaker of one of &lt;a href="w%3AAlfred%20Hitchcock"&gt;Alfred Hitchcock&lt;/a&gt;'s 'Three Investigators' detectives in Germany, complained. He admitted that he had compiled a tape for a friend as a gesture of love from time to time. Anyone using illegal downloads for such a gesture of love nowadays would face harsh fines, if only it were easier to get a little criminal to court.

&lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; took a step closer to qualifying for &lt;a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008"&gt;Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; as a 3-1 win against &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; kept them top of Group B in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying. The loss for Ukraine takes their tragic number down to 5 and could be officially be eliminated by the end of play at the end of the day.

Scotland took a 2-goal lead in the 1 10 minutes of the match with goals from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKenny%20Miller"&gt;Kenny Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALee%20McCulloch"&gt;Lee McCulloch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

At least two people have died and at least eight to ten were injured after two semi trucks collided in a truck tunnel on &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%205"&gt;Interstate 5&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANewhall%20Pass"&gt;Newhall Pass&lt;/a&gt;) between &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clarita%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Clarita&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, causing the tunnel to be completely shut down on both north and southbound lanes.

At approximately 11:00 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;pacific time&lt;/a&gt;), two semi trucks collided and at least 13 other trucks smashed into the wreckage causing a massive fire. Firefighters are using foam to control the flames, which could take several hours to put out.

Officials say that the debris could take a day or more to remove and that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because officials say that the structure of the tunnel has been compromised.

"It has impacted the structural stability of the tunnel," said John Tripp the Fire Chief for &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/a&gt; who also said that there may be more people trapped in the wreckage.

"We're going to have to do a very methodical search. There could be unfortunately more people that were not able to escape," added Tripp.

The tunnel is 200 feet long.

Defending champions &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; have defeated hosts &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; 14 - 9 in the first semi-final of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AStade%20de%20France"&gt;Stade de France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaint-Denis"&gt;Saint-Denis&lt;/a&gt;.

France had been favourites to win the match on home soil, having beaten England comfortably in two World Cup warm-up matches and in the quarter-finals. However England, having improved after stumbling early in their campaign to reach the semi-finals after , won a tense match to reach their second consecutive final in a repeat of the &lt;a href="w%3A2003_Rugby_World_Cup"&gt;2003 semi-final&lt;/a&gt;.

England took an early lead when &lt;a href="w%3AJosh%20Lewsey"&gt;Josh Lewsey&lt;/a&gt; scored a wide try in the second minute, but &lt;a href="w%3AJonny%20Wilkinson"&gt;Jonny Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt; missed the conversion. &lt;a href="w%3ALionel%20Beauxis"&gt;Lionel Beauxis&lt;/a&gt; scored two penalties for France to give them a one point lead in the 18th minute. Both Beauxis and Wilkinson missed chances to score with the boot later in the first half, and France went into the interval leading 6 - 5.

Lionel Beauxis extended France's lead with a penalty early in the second half, but Jonny Wilkinson scored soon after to reduce the deficit back to one point. Neither side could make a breakthrough until Jonny Wilkinson kicked a penalty with five minutes remaining to give England a two point lead. Three minutes later Wilkinson secured England's victory after kicking a drop goal.

England will play the winners of tomorrow's second semi-final between South Africa and Argentina in next week's final, while France will play the losers in the third place match.

The 14th &lt;a href="w%3ADalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATenzin%20Gyatso"&gt;Tenzin Gyatso&lt;/a&gt; will arrive in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday and will meet with U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. On Wednesday he will attend a ceremony in his honor where he will be awarded the highest honor in the U.S. for a civilian, the &lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Gold%20Medal"&gt;Congressional Gold Medal&lt;/a&gt;.

This also marks an historical moment as it is the first time ever that a sitting U.S. President will appear with the Dalai Lama at a public event.

The honor has not gone without protest. &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; objected, accusing the Dalai Lama of "separatist activities." China also condemned a meeting with &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; calling the meeting a mistake and that relations between the two nations were damaged.

"We would hope that the Chinese leader would get to know the Dalai Lama as the president sees him, as a spiritual leader and someone who wants peace," said &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokeswoman, Dana Perino. 

The U.S. decided to award the Dalai Lama with the medal due to "his many enduring and outstanding contributions to peace, nonviolence, human rights and religious understanding."

The Dalai Lama has been living in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; since fleeing &lt;a href="w%3ATibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; in 1959 during a failed revolt against Chinese rule.

<h1>Burma's military rulers arrest leaders of pro-democracy protests</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Burma%27s%20military%20rulers%20arrest%20leaders%20of%20pro-democracy%20protests&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Three of the last remaining leaders of the 88 Generation Students Group, which led the recent pro-democracy rallies in &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;, have been arrested by Burma's military junta. 

The wave of &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Burmese%20anti-government%20protests"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt;, which began on August 15, 2007, was triggered by the Burmese government's decision to remove fuel subsidies, leading to dramatic increases in the price of diesel and petrol. The Burmese government's subsequent violent crackdown on the protests was condemned by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, among other nations. On October 12, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N. Security Council&lt;/a&gt; released a statement saying that it "strongly deplores" Burma's response to the protests.

The three leaders, named Htay Kywe, Mie Mie, and Aung Thu, were arrested on Saturday morning in Rangoon, according to dissident sources. Human rights group &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; expressed extreme concern for the well being of the three activists, saying that they "risk torture and ill treatment."

On Saturday, thousands attended a pro-government rally in Rangoon in which participants denounced Western countries and media. The participants in the rally had allegedly been paid to join the demonstration and were transported to the area by bus. One of the participants in the rally told AFP news agency that each factory in the city's industrial zone had been obliged to send 50 participants to the rally.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20Prime%20Minister%20calls%20federal%20election&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20federal%20election%2C%202007"&gt;Australian federal election&lt;/a&gt; will be held on November 24, 2007. Howard visited the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20General%20of%20Australia"&gt;Governor General of Australia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jeffrey"&gt;Michael Jeffries&lt;/a&gt; earlier today and then announced the news.

Mr Howard, the Prime Minister of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; for over ten years now, said that the country's "best years lie ahead", but only if the "right leadership" team is in power. 

"Is it a Government that has a proven track record in those areas? Or is it an inexperienced group of men and women, 70 per cent of whom are former trade union officials?", Mr Howard said. "The right leadership has the experience to further expand the prosperity of the Australian economy."

"I believe very passionately that this country's best years can lie ahead of us in the years immediately ahead," he said. "In order for that to happen this country does not need new leadership, it does not need old leadership, it needs the right leadership."

Mr Howard also stated that if his party, the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; is elected into government yet again, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; will hold the place of &lt;a href="w%3ATreasurer%20of%20Australia"&gt;Treasurer of Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; will take the seat of the &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs"&gt;Minister for Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.

The Prime Minister announced that the &lt;a href="w%3AWrit%20of%20election"&gt;writs&lt;/a&gt; will be issued on October 17. Consequently, following recent changes to the electoral act, Australians have until that date to ensure that they are on the electoral rolls and are able to have their vote. Voting is compulsory in Australian Federal elections.

"Normal" in the 2007 &lt;a href="w%3AIronman%20Triathlon"&gt;Ironman Triathlon&lt;/a&gt; World Championship was only the fact the sun rose in the east, as shortly past the swim start the day brought forth a hot and cloudless &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt; sky; injuries and illnesses to many; DNFs for two years worth of defending champions; and a first-time winner.

Australian &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20McCormack%20%28triathlete%29"&gt;Chris McCormack&lt;/a&gt;, placing 2nd in 2006, passed Aussie Craig Alexander in the marathon and further scorched the Queen &lt;a href="w%3AKaahumanu%20Ka%CA%BBahumanu"&gt;Kaahumanu Kaʻahumanu&lt;/a&gt; Highway with a 2:42:02 run to claim the world title in 8:15:34.

In even more excitement, rookie (her first Ironman length race was seven weeks ago in Korea) &lt;a href="w%3AChrissie%20Wellington"&gt;Chrissie Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, from Great Britain, claimed the women's title finished in 9:08:45.

The 6:45 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii%20Standard%20Time"&gt;Hawaii Standard Time&lt;/a&gt; start to the 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20trial"&gt;time-trial&lt;/a&gt;, and a 26.2 mile marathon saw a cascade of unfortunates to favorites. Defending 2006 champions &lt;a href="w%3ANormann%20Stadler"&gt;Normann Stadler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMichellie%20Jones"&gt;Michellie Jones&lt;/a&gt; and 2005 champion &lt;a href="w%3AFaris%20Al-Sultan"&gt;Faris Al-Sultan&lt;/a&gt; were struck down with stomach ailments; six-time winner and 2005 champion &lt;a href="w%3ANatascha%20Badmann"&gt;Natascha Badmann&lt;/a&gt; totaled her bike after crashing into road cone; and &lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20Bell"&gt;Luke Bell&lt;/a&gt; was sidelined with a leg injury.

But a sense of "normal" returned later in the day as the temperature and winds rose and as many of the 1,788 starters completed before the October 14, 2007 12:00am deadline.

The time is 5:40 UTC and this Audio Wikinews Brief for Sunday, October 14, 2007. 

<h2>At least 2 die in 15 truck pileup in California</h2>
In the U.S., at least two people have died and at least eight to ten were injured after two semi trucks collided in a truck tunnel on Interstate 5 between Los Angeles and Santa Clarita California, causing the tunnel to be completely shut down on both north and southbound lanes. The incident occurred last Friday and firefighters are continuing to use foam to control the flames, which could take several hours to put out.

Officials say that the debris could take a day or more to remove and that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because officials say that the structure of the tunnel has been compromised.

<h2>Dalai Lama to Receive US Congressional Gold Medal</h2>
The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso will arrive in the United States on Tuesday and will meet with U.S. President George W. Bush. On Wednesday he will attend a ceremony in his honor where he will be awarded the highest honor in the U.S. for a civilian, the Congressional Gold Medal.

This marks a historical moment as it is the first time ever that a sitting U.S. President will appear with the Dalai Lama at a public event.

The honor has not gone without protest. China has objected, accusing the Dalai Lama of "separatist activities." China also condemned a meeting with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel calling the meeting a mistake and that relations between the two nations were damaged.

<h2>Burma's military rulers arrest leaders of pro-democracy protests</h2>

Three of the last remaining leaders of the 8-8 Generation Students Group, which led the recent pro-democracy rallies in Burma, have been arrested by Burma's military junta.

The wave of protests, which began on August 15, 2007, were triggered by the Burmese government's decision to remove fuel subsidies, leading to a dramatic increase in the price of diesel and petrol. The Burmese government's subsequent violent crackdown on the protests was condemned by the United States, Britain, and France, among other nations. On October 12, the U.N. Security Council released a statement saying that it "strongly deplores" Burma's response to the protests.

<h2>Turkey outraged over U.S. Armenian genocide resolution</h2>
Turkish officials have expressed outrage over a United States congressional resolution labeling the Ottoman Empire's World War I era killings of up to 1.5 million Armenians as "genocide". The Turkish government has warned that the resolution threatens its strategic partnership with the U.S. 

House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi said the resolution will go forward for a vote in the House despite Turkish opposition.

&lt;a href="w%3ACasey%20Stoner"&gt;Casey Stoner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s new MotoGP world champion, won the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Australian%20motorcycle%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Australian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3APhillip%20Island"&gt;Phillip Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, in the afternoon of October 14. 

Stoner, 21, started the race in third position behind &lt;a href="w%3ADani%20Pedrosa"&gt;Dani Pedrosa&lt;/a&gt; and five-time world champion &lt;a href="w%3AValentino%20Rossi"&gt;Valentino Rossi&lt;/a&gt;, but picked up speed quickly and regained first position, finishing the race in 41 minutes, 12.244 seconds. 

"It's unbelievable to win in front of my home crowd," Stoner said. "I didn't think the season could get any better but it just has. I really wanted to win this one and it just puts the icing on the cake."

The win at the Prix in front of more than 50,000 fans was Stoner's ninth victory, after claiming the world title last month in Japan.

With the success of the Samsung Running Festival from 2005 in Taipei, and continued with the image of charity, Samsung Electronics donated 100 PDA phones to Chinese National Association of the Deaf, R.O.C., Taiwan. (CNAD) and CNAD elected "Taiwan Top 10 Outstanding Deaf Occupational Excellence" delegates to receive this donation in the 3rd Taipei Samsung Running Festival.

"Earlier in 2006, Samsung donated lots of funds to help the process of 2009 Summer Deaflympics in Taipei. In this meaningful activity, I'm appreciated with the donation from Samsung who helped lots of deaf people in Taiwan with a good enterprise image. I hope Samsung can still promote the charity in Taiwan." Jiong-huang Yang (Chairman of CNAD) said at the Donation Ceremony.

"Based on a concern with an enterprise of 'What's taken from the people is used for the people', Samsung imported this running activity and donated with charity activity in Taiwan. I hope this event will close on people in Taiwan." Kuen-Hee Park (Greater China Area Chairman of Samsung Eletronics) remarked at Opening Ceremony.

Nearly the start at 7:00 a.m. (Taipei Time), more than 30,000 runners were ready to start. To prevent the starting and route problem, the organizer Chinese Taipei Road Running Association set up the controlling line at the start line and it took a good effect with the start controlling.

After the running activity, Samsung Electronics held lots of performances such as kids' street dancing, taekwondo skills by Taipei Physical Education College, CTITV Live Contest of "Ape Show" Program, and a small concert of CTV "One Million Star" entertainers. And National Palace Museum also invited runners visiting the NPM with dressing official "Taipei Samsung Running Festival" T-shirt after all the programs ended.
