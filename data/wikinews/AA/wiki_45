Copies of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Profit"&gt;The Profit&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20in%20film"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="film"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt; blocked from distribution in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; due to a court injunction won by the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;, appeared on the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; Friday on &lt;a href="w%3APeer-to-peer"&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;/a&gt; file-sharing websites and on the video sharing site &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. 

Directed by former film executive Peter N. Alexander, the movie has been characterized by critics as a &lt;a href="w%3AParody"&gt;parody&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Scientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; and of its founder &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;. Alexander was a Scientologist for twenty years, and left the organization in 1997. The film was funded by &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Minton"&gt;Bob Minton&lt;/a&gt;, a former critic of Scientology who later signed an agreement with the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; and has attempted to stop distribution of the film. Alexander has stated that the movie is based on his research into &lt;a href="w%3ACult"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt;s, and when asked by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg%20Times"&gt;St. Petersburg Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ about parallels to Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard said: "I'll let you draw that conclusion ... I say it's entirely fictional."

The film was released in August 2001, and was shown at a movie theatre in &lt;a href="w%3AClearwater%2C%20Florida"&gt;Clearwater, Florida&lt;/a&gt; and at a premiere at the &lt;a href="w%3ACannes%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. A Scientology spokesman gave a statement at the time saying "the movie is fiction and has nothing to do with Scientology". The Church of Scientology later took legal action in an attempt to stop further distribution of the film. The Church of Scientology claimed that the film was intended to influence the jury pool in the wrongful death case of Scientologist &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20McPherson"&gt;Lisa McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, who died under Scientology care in Clearwater, Florida. 

In April 2002, a &lt;a href="w%3APinellas%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Pinellas County, Florida&lt;/a&gt; judge issued a court order enjoining ♡❤The Profit♡❤ from worldwide distribution for an indefinite period. According to the original court injunction received by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the movie was originally banned because the court found that it could be seen as a parody of Scientology. In his April 20, 2002 ruling on the injunction, Judge Robert E. Beach of the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court in &lt;a href="w%3APinellas%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Pinellas County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; wrote: "...an average person viewing the film entitled ♡❤The Profit♡❤ could perceive that it is a parody of the Church of Scientology". 

"To the extent that any person considered as a potential juror in evaluating any issues involving the Church of Scientology, the process of voir dire provides a fair and complete remedy to eliminate any potential juror that may possibly have been influenced to be less than fair and impartial," added Beach.

Luke Lirot, the attorney for the film's production company, announced on the film's website on April 7, 2007 that "We have absolutely no exposure for any repercussions from the court order," but that the film was still blocked from distribution due to an ongoing legal battle. Lirot wrote: "all that's stopping the release of the movie is the legal battle with the partner who was compromised by Scientology (Robert Minton) and is currently using his power as partner to stop the release of the film."

In an October 2007 article, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ described the film as "banned in the US because of a lawsuit taken out against it by The Church of Scientology," and Russ Kick's ♡❤The Disinformation Book of Lists♡❤ included the film in his "List of 16 Movies Banned in the U.S.". An 8-minute teaser segment from ♡❤The Profit♡❤ appeared on the film's website and on the video sharing site YouTube in February 2008, and an attorney representing Bob Minton sent a letter to Luke Lirot requesting that the film clip be taken down. In a response letter, Lirot wrote that "Rather than damage any asset of the LLC, the short clip merely keeps the film in the public eye, and in a positive way."

On Friday, copies of the film began to circulate on peer-to-peer file-sharing websites and on YouTube. A link related to the film's appearance on the Internet on the community-based link aggregator website &lt;a href="w%3ADigg.com"&gt;Digg.com&lt;/a&gt; had 3,638 "Diggs" - and hit the front page of the site's Entertainment section on Saturday. 
On Saturday, Scientology critic and &lt;a href="w%3AEmmy%20award"&gt;Emmy award&lt;/a&gt;-winning journalist &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Bunker"&gt;Mark Bunker&lt;/a&gt; put a streaming version of the film on his website, www.xenutv.com, and encouraged others to watch and discuss the film on a real-time chat channel. In a video posting to YouTube Saturday, Bunker said "I did not do it. I had nothing to do with it ... I had nothing to do with this release at all. But I'm happy it's out there ... people are finally having a chance to see it. A lot of people have been curious over the years and there's been a lot of interest in seeing the film, so finally you can."
On the newsgroup &lt;a href="w%3Aalt.religion.scientology"&gt;alt.religion.scientology&lt;/a&gt;, a poster by the username "Alexia Death" commented on the film's appearance on the Internet in the context of &lt;a href="w%3Acensorship"&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt;: "It is out! And so it is a WIN if many people review it even if they say it SUCKS! ... Being bad is no cause to allow censorship ... And being censored is no cause to assume its good". A post to the blog ♡❤Blogsreel♡❤ commented: "We have all wanted to see this movie that scientology kept hidden away from us. We have all wondered just how damning could this story be that we were banned from watching it." 

In a post on Sunday to the message board attached to the official website for the film, attorney Luke Lirot asked that individuals stop distributing copies of ♡❤The Profit♡❤ over the Internet. Lirot wrote: "It has been brought to my attention that several unauthorized transmissions and downloads of this protected work have taken place over the last 72 hours. Such actions are copyright violations and are unlawful. I request that any further distribution and/or dissemination of this important work cease immediately and any copies of the work that have been downloaded please be deleted." In his statement, Lirot recognized the rights of individuals under the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;First Amendment to the United States Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, but also said that unauthorized distribution of the film "will only serve to harm the goal of vast distribution".

Blog postings have attributed the film's appearance on the Internet as part of the anti-Scientology movement &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Chanology"&gt;Project Chanology&lt;/a&gt; organized by the Internet-based group &lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;, but this has not been confirmed. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ previously reported on international protests against Scientology which took place as part of Project Chanology on and &lt;a href="Scientology%20protest%20group%20celebrates%20founder%27s%20birthday%20worldwide"&gt;March 15&lt;/a&gt;. A third international protest by Anonymous is scheduled for April 12. Titled "Operation Reconnect", the third international protest will focus on highlighting Scientology's practice of &lt;a href="w%3ADisconnection"&gt;disconnection&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt; placed second, trailing Räikkönen by a considerable margin.

&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; drivers took the second row in qualification, but &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; were penalized five places yesterday for impeding &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt; (BMW Sauber) and &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;).

Kovalainen regained his lost places and finished on the last step of the podium, third. &lt;a href="w%3AToyota%20F1"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AJarno%20Trulli"&gt;Jarno Trulli&lt;/a&gt; did his best to hold Hamilton behind and finished fourth.

Heidfeld comfortably finished six.

<h2>Random drive-by shooting kills 7, injures 16 in Baghdad</h2>

At least seven people have died and sixteen more are injured after gunman in three cars attacked pedestrians at a market in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, apparently at random. An anonymous official told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AXinhua"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that the attack in Baghdad's religiously diverse Zaafariniya neighbourhood left several seriously enough wounded that the death toll may rise.

Drive-by shootings have become rare in the capital since recent crackdowns on militants. However, attacks do still continue. Other recent attacks include a bombing on a Mogul army base that left ten dead and a series of rocket attacks on Baghdad residences and the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Zone"&gt;Green Zone&lt;/a&gt;, leaving no known caualties as yet but striking several sensitive foreign targets.

<h2>India tests nuclear capable Agni-I surface-to-air missile</h2>

&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; has conducted a successful test of its &lt;a href="w%3AAgni%20missile%20system"&gt;Agni-I&lt;/a&gt; surface-to-air missile, a 700km (435 mile) range misile capable of carrying conventional and nuclear warheads up to a weight of 1,000kg. It was fired across the &lt;a href="w%3ABay%20of%20Bengal"&gt;Bay of Bengal&lt;/a&gt; from a mobile launcher on a range on a nearby island at 10:15 am.

India and neighbour &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; have regularly tested missiles since 2002, and both have nuclear technology. The Agni-I has been tested previously. "The missile had a textbook performance in terms of range, accuracy and lethality," said a statement by the military.

United States Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Sunday. Cheney met with Israeli President &lt;a href="Shimon%20Peres"&gt;Shimon Peres&lt;/a&gt; and Primer Minister &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; and their Palestinian counterparts, the moderate President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; and Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASalam%20Fayyad"&gt;Salam Fayyad&lt;/a&gt; as part of a tour of the Middle East.

Cheney told Palestinians that continuing violence against ill damage efforts for a Palestinian state. Cheney noted "Terror and rockets do not merely kill innocent civilians, they also kill the legitimate hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people."

The Vice President remarked he is committed towards a Palestinian state, quoting President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, "The establishment of the state of Palestine is long overdue. The Palestinian people deserve it." Cheney also noted that "Achieving that vision will require tremendous effort at the negotiating table and painful concessions on both sides."

Cheney met earlier in the day with Shimon Peres, the Israeli president. Both men spoke of Iran, with Peres noting upfront that Iran and their leader &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; wants to "build their two satellites -- the &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; in Lebanon, and the &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; in Gaza ... Nobody can console us and say that the declarations of Ahmadinejad are less serious than they are; we have to take it seriously, out of experience." 

Cheney noted that the Bush administration is pledged to the peace process and also referenced Iran but not directly, "We're obviously dedicated to doing all we can as an administration to try to move the peace process forward, and also obviously actively involved in dealing with the threats that we see emerging in the region -- not only threats to Israel, but threats to the United States, as well."

Cheney met with Prime Minister Olmert on Saturday and told Olmert that, "The United States will never pressure Israel to take steps that threaten its security." He also told Olmert that the United States backs Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks but that America was also working for a peace deal between Israel and the moderate Fatah-controlled Palestinian government in the West Bank.

Abbas lost control of the Gaza Strip to the rival Hamas party last year. Abbas, who is the leader of the more moderate Fatah party currently runs the Palestinian government located in the West Bank, the other Palestinian territory.

The 13th Taipei International Express Marathon, sponsored mainly by &lt;a href="w%3ACarrefour"&gt;Carrefour&lt;/a&gt; for the second time since 2007, raced on &lt;a href="w%3AHsichih%20City"&gt;Hsichih&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AWugu%2C%20Taipei"&gt;Wugu&lt;/a&gt; Elevated Viaduct of &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Highway%20No.%201%20%28Taiwan%29"&gt;Taiwan National Highway No. 1&lt;/a&gt; this Sunday (March 23). Although it rained until the start of the marathon and half-marathon classes, the race finished properly. Despite the improved weather, the gradient near the Hsichih stop of Hsichih-Wugu Elevated Viaduct provided a major challenge to the runners' physical strength.

The race's organizer, the Chinese Taipei Road Running Association, invited several world-class marathon runners based on their prior performances in several international marathons. However, because of political instability in Africa, there were only four African runners participating in this race.

Finally, Disdery Hombo from Kenya and Tatyana Perepelkina (in &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;: Татьяна Перепёлкина) from Russia were, respectively, the men's and women's champions of the marathon (42K) class with 2H21m27s and 2H49m15s.

After this race, when ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Journalist briefly interviewed Hombo, Hombo expressed his satisfaction with this race and Taiwan's image, as well as his eagerness to try out for future marathon races, especially the ING Taipei Marathon this December.

The President of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, and his wife &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALaura%20Bush"&gt;Laura Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have introduced the 2008 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEgg%20rolling"&gt;egg roll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Mrs. Bush introduced the attendees to the event by saying "welcome, everybody, to the White House Easter Egg Roll, the 2008 Easter Egg Roll. This event is one of the happiest traditions on the White House lawn. It's always fun to see the South Lawn filled with children. Thank you for coming. And I'd especially like to thank our entertainers, our readers, our volunteers, and our special guests."

M. Bush dedicated the event to cleaning oceans. "We [the Bush family] want to remind you that we're dedicating today's Easter Egg Roll to our clean oceans. And there's a booth here where you can find out how you can contribute to make sure that we're environmentally sound stewards of our oceans. Ocean conservation is a important aspect of good public service, and it's certainly something that Laura has on her mind, as she comes up to address you," he said.

7,500 eggs are being provided for 2008 egg roll, with the White House estimating before the event that 22,000 people will attend this year.

&lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;'s second in command, &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt; has released a new audiotape calling for &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;s to attack &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; targets in revenge for Israel's recent offensive in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;.

The tape was posted on the internet and on it, Zawahiri urges strikes against &lt;a href="w%3AJudaism"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; and Americans interests, along with all those who participate in aggression against Muslims.

"Muslims, today is your day. Strike the interests of the Jews, the Americans, and all those who participated in the attack on Muslims. Monitor the targets, collect money, prepare the equipment, plan with precision, and then—while relying on God—assault, seeking martyrdom and paradise," said Zawahiri.

He also added that any attacks on these interests should not be confined to &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;, Israel or the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.

"Today there is no room for he who says that we should only fight the Jews in Palestine. Let us strike their interests everywhere, just like they gathered against us from everywhere," added Zawahiri.

U.S. intelligence is currently reviewing the tape, but so far the authenticity cannot be independently confirmed.

In a separate recording released last week, al-Qaeda leader &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; called on Palestinians to reject negotiations and use "iron and fire" against Israel. A voice described as bin Laden's also urged Muslims to support the insurgency in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; as a way to liberate Palestine.

On Monday, the &lt;a href="Olympics"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics%20torch%20relay"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2008 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; was lit in &lt;a href="w%3AOlympia%2C%20Greece"&gt;Olympia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; as per tradition. The ♡❤Games of the XXIX Olympiad♡❤ are scheduled to be held in and around &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; from August 8, 2008, to August 24, 2008.

Members of &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; (RSF), and others, were able to break through the police cordon. "We cannot let the Chinese government seize the Olympic flame, a symbol of peace, without denouncing the dramatic human rights situation in the country," RSF said in a statement.

While &lt;a href="w%3ALiu%20Qi%20%28Chinese%20politician%29"&gt;Liu Qi&lt;/a&gt;, president of the &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing%20Organizing%20Committee"&gt;Beijing Organizing Committee&lt;/a&gt; and a former mayor of Beijing, delivered a speech, at least one protester was able to run up behind him and display a flag that resembled the &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20symbols"&gt;Olympic flag&lt;/a&gt;, except it was black and the rings were &lt;a href="w%3Ahandcuffs"&gt;handcuffs&lt;/a&gt;.

The protester was quickly apprehended and Liu Qi continued his speech relatively uninterrupted. "The Olympic flame will radiate light and happiness, peace and friendship, and hope and dreams to the people of China and the whole world," he told the crowd.
"Shame on China. Don't send China's blood-tainted torch to &lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;. Free Tibet. Tibet is an independent country," shouted Tenzin Dorjee, a leader for &lt;a href="w%3AStudents%20for%20a%20Free%20Tibet"&gt;Students for a Free Tibet&lt;/a&gt;, while he was taken by police.

"All we wanted to do was break into the torch relay and shout that this is a torch of shame as the Chinese government continues to kill hundreds of our people," Dorjee said later. "They were stalking me from the moment I touched down to Greece," he added.
The torch is still scheduled to be carried around the world in a relay that will go through twenty countries before arriving in Beijing for the start of the Games.

&lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Rogge"&gt;Jacques Rogge&lt;/a&gt;, president of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IOC) has defended having the Games in China, saying, "The major political leaders don't want a boycott." 

In his speech Monday, he said, "The torch is the link between all athletes and citizens of this world; between all of us who believe in Olympism and the virtue of sport. It has the force to unite humanity and to stand for harmony." 

&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s Olympic Committee rejected a boycott of the games aimed at events in Tibet. Noting that the &lt;a href="w%3A1980%20Summer%20Olympics%20boycott"&gt;1980 Summer Olympics boycott&lt;/a&gt; did not avert the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan"&gt;Soviet war in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the committee said they concluded that the role of sports is to start dialog and promote understanding — and not to exert political pressure.

A final report released today by the &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transport%20Safety%20Committee"&gt;National Transport Safety Committee&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;a href="Adam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;Flight 574&lt;/a&gt; crashed because the pilots were distracted by an instrument failure. The loss of the budget carrier's &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABeoing%20737"&gt;737&lt;/a&gt; into the sea near &lt;a href="w%3ASulawesi"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt; on New Year's Day 2007 left all 102 on board missing and presumed dead.

The report found that the 737, registered PK-KKW, suffered a &lt;a href="w%3AInertial%20Reference%20System"&gt;Inertial Reference System&lt;/a&gt; (IRS) failure. While pilots were troubleshooting for this navigational system they first unintentionally disconnected the &lt;a href="w%3Aautopilot"&gt;autopilot&lt;/a&gt;, then failed to monitor other instruments informing them they were approaching the sea, crashing into it and destroying the aircraft.

The flight had been a scheduled domestic passenger service between &lt;a href="w%3ADjuanda%20Airport"&gt;Djuanda Airport&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ASurabaya"&gt;Surabaya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Ratulangi%20Airport"&gt;Sam Ratulangi Airport&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AManado"&gt;Manado&lt;/a&gt;, and disappeared from radar screens at 35,000 feet.

National Transportation Safety Committee head Tatang Kurniadi told a press conference "This accident resulted from a combination of factors including the failure of the pilots to adequately monitor the flight instruments, especially in the last two minutes of the flight. Preoccupation with a malfunction of the Inertial Reference System diverted both pilot's attention from the flight instruments and allowed the increasing descent and bank angle to unnoticed...

"The Cockpit Voice recorder revealed that both pilots were concerned about navigation problems and subsequently become engrossed with trouble shooting Inertial Reference System (IRS) anomalies for at least the last 13 minutes of the flight, with minimal regard to other flight requirements. This included identification and attempts at corrective actions."

He also supplied a number of statistics concerning the final moments of the flight. Whilst in a right bank with sustained elevator input pushing up the nose the aircraft reached Mach 0.926 and 3.5g. The airspeed had reached 490 &lt;a href="w%3Aknots%20%28speed%29"&gt;KCAS&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the recording. Investigator Santoso Sayogo said that the high speed impact caused the plane to disintegrate.

Adam Air had suffered previous navigational problems. In 2006 another B737 suffered a navigational problem and flew into a radar blackspot, leaving it lost for several hours before performing an emergency landing hundreds of miles from the intended destination. Sayogo said today that in the three months preceding the accident the airline had registered 154 defects in PK-KKW's navigational equipment.

The accident has had wide-ranging effects. The crash, coupled with &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20172"&gt;Adam Air Flight 172&lt;/a&gt;, which snapped in half during a hard landing, and &lt;a href="Garuda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFlight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt;, which overshot the runway in &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;, killing 21, prompted the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; to add all Indonesia's airlines to the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;list of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this month another Adam Air flight departed the end of a runway during landing, injuring five and damaging the plane. This prompted the authorities to ground Adam Air for three months after a regular evaluation, after which they may be permanently shut down. The airline is also in financial difficulty. All the accidents involved Boeing 737s.

Across &lt;a href="w%3AEaster"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt; weekend &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; was host to &lt;a href="w%3ARock2Wgtn"&gt;Rock2Wgtn&lt;/a&gt;, an international two-day &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; festival. Large crowds showed up at &lt;a href="w%3AWestpac%20Stadium"&gt;Westpac Stadium&lt;/a&gt; to see the various acts. The world has never seen an event of this kind before.

Day one featured three theatrical acts. &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt;, known for their monster costumes, opened the night. They were followed by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ashock%20rock"&gt;shock rock&lt;/a&gt;er &lt;a href="w%3AAlice%20Cooper"&gt;Alice Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, whose themed set included the horror theatrics regularly associated with him and a hanging stunt he recently restarted after a gallows collapse nearly killed him two decades ago. The night was headlined by the distinctively costumed band &lt;a href="w%3AKiss%20%28band%29"&gt;KISS&lt;/a&gt;, complete with their famed black-and-white makeup.

The first major act on the stage on day two was the American hard rock/&lt;a href="w%3Aglam%20metal"&gt;glam metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3APoison%20%28band%29"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;. After Poison, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; act &lt;a href="w%3AWhitesnake"&gt;Whitesnake&lt;/a&gt; took to the stage and performed their set to the crowd. British-born American rocker &lt;a href="w%3AOzzy%20Osbourne"&gt;Ozzy Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;, who, as well as a solo career, fronts the world-famous &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sabbath"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt;, was the second night's headline act.

The festival's entertainment did not stop at the six main acts. There was also support performances from three New Zealand bands - The Symphony of Screams, The Valves and &lt;a href="w%3ASonic%20Altar"&gt;Sonic Altar&lt;/a&gt;. Their sets were accompanied by a special effects package from award-winning studio &lt;a href="w%3AWeta%20Workshops"&gt;Weta Workshops&lt;/a&gt;, who are known for their work on movies such as &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20film%20trilogy"&gt;The Lord of the Rings film trilogy&lt;/a&gt;. This came in the form of 'Drusila the Dragon', which rose up to a height of six foot and wigspan and moved for the audience, shining lasers from its eyes and breathing red smoke. Flame Fire Productions were hired to put on a fire show featuring several dancers alongside the performers. Also performing were six local guitarists and a group of '&lt;a href="w%3Azombie"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;' cheerleaders.

Despite the crowds that flocked to the event, however, it has recently become apparent that financial trouble has hit the festival. Although figures remain to be confirmed, an estimated &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;750,000 has been lost.

Wikinews secured an exclusive interview with Phil Sprey of Capital C Concerts, who organised the festival. The entire interview is now available below.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡What initially gave you the idea to stage New Zealand's first rock festival?♡❤♡

♡❤♡How did you select the acts that would be performing and the other entertainment on offer? What are your personal opinions on the artists present?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Is it true that Ozzy demanded the set be repainted from KISS colours to his own?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What kind of reaction has there been from fans and the media to the festival?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Three-quarters of a million dollars is a huge loss. Why is the quantity so large if ticket sales were still relatively high, even if they were below anticipated levels? How much did it cost to hire each of the acts present, anyway?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Who is going to pay the price now?♡❤♡

♡❤♡You believe Easter trading restrictions are responsible for low sales. Might we then see a future Rock2Wgtn at a different time of the year? If so, what can we expect from it?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Why were Easter restrictions not factored into plans before the festival?♡❤♡

♡❤♡There were also 20 related arrests for minor offences. What are your comments on this? Do you feel negative media attention from this may be an issue for Capital C Concerts?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What other events are you planning for the future?♡❤♡

♡❤♡What would you like to say to any fans reading this now?♡❤♡

According to an announcement on Monday by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AOnline%20auction%20business%20model"&gt;on-line auction&lt;/a&gt; website &lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;, the option to accept payments via &lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; service will be mandatory for &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; sellers beginning in April 2008, with the exception of auctions relating directly to the sale of motor vehicles.

The announcement claims that the move will help improve confidence as well as further reducing the limited amounts of fraud which occur on some types of transaction. Sellers with low feedback, or who list specific items, such as computer software are already required to accept payment via PayPal.

Under the new policy, sellers will however still be able to accept payments via other services, provided they are on eBay's approved list. &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Checkout"&gt;Google Checkout&lt;/a&gt;, a competitor to PayPal in the field of retail payment services, is notably absent from the list of accepted payment methods.

The popular &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asoap%20opera"&gt;soap opera&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Young%20and%20the%20Restless"&gt;The Young and the Restless&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, currently the reigning &lt;a href="w%3ADaytime%20Emmy%20Awards"&gt;Emmy Award-winner&lt;/a&gt; for best daytime drama, celebrated 35 years on the air Wednesday. 

The 35th anniversary also comes after the series, known colloquially as ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤, marked its 1,000th straight week as the highest-rated soap opera in a daytime slot. In addition to keeping the #1 spot every week since December 1988, ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤ has also been the top-rated soap in the African-American demographic since 1991. 

A trend-setter since the beginning, ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤ relied on character-driven storytelling, accentuated with understated sexuality from its cast, which at that time was mostly young, in order to bring in teenage and twentysomething viewers who were ignored by soap producers and networks up to that time. These traits immediately set ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤ apart from other soap operas, and other soaps have since mimicked ♡❤&lt;nowiki&gt;Y&amp;R&lt;/nowiki&gt;♡❤♡s formulaic approach to offering something for everyone, especially younger viewers. 

Since premiering on March 26, 1973, ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤ has become a worldwide cultural institution in its own right, racking up an impressive 100 Emmy Awards between the writers, producers, cast and crew since 1974. The show has aired in over 100 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Italy, and Turkey, and reaches a worldwide audience of ten million daily. So far-reaching was ♡❤&lt;nowiki&gt;Y&amp;R&lt;/nowiki&gt;♡❤♡s appeal that Romanian gymnast &lt;a href="w%3ANadia%20Comaneci"&gt;Nadia Comaneci&lt;/a&gt; chose the serial's &lt;a href="w%3ANadia%27s%20Theme"&gt;theme song&lt;/a&gt; as accompanying music to her floor exercises at the &lt;a href="w%3A1976%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;1976 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. In Australia, where ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤ has aired since 1974, the show was canceled by the original network that aired it in 2007, prompting a widespread fan backlash in that country. It was quickly moved to a pay channel.

Over the past 35 years, countless characters, marriages, divorces, births, deaths, and every joy and trauma in between have visited the residents of Genoa City, where ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤ is set. To commemorate the milestone, from ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ interviewed three actresses who have played long-running characters on ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤, and asked them to share their memories. All three responded to questions about what being on ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤ means to them, what their favorite storylines were, what they perhaps would have wanted to do all over again, and what they'd love to tell their fans directly.

Below are portions of all three interviews. 

<h2>Wikinews interviews ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤ cast members</h2>

Throughout March, Mike Halterman spoke to three ♡❤Y&amp;R♡❤ actresses: &lt;a href="w%3AMelody%20Thomas%20Scott"&gt;Melody Thomas Scott&lt;/a&gt;, who has portrayed &lt;a href="w%3ANikki%20Newman"&gt;Nikki Newman&lt;/a&gt; since 1979; &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Stafford"&gt;Michelle Stafford&lt;/a&gt;, who has portrayed &lt;a href="w%3APhyllis%20Summers%20Newman"&gt;Phyllis Summers Newman&lt;/a&gt; since 1994; and &lt;a href="w%3ATricia%20Cast"&gt;Tricia Cast&lt;/a&gt;, who portrayed &lt;a href="w%3ANina%20Webster"&gt;Nina Webster&lt;/a&gt; from 1986 to 2001.

<h3>Questions asked to all three</h3>

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: How do you feel about the way the show has evolved from the day you started the show, to what it is now?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: What does being associated with Y&amp;R mean to you? What's the one thing you feel has impacted your life for the better from your association with the show?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: In terms of writing and depth of character, do you think your character is stronger now than she was, say, a decade ago?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Out of all the storylines you've been involved in, which one was your favorite?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: ...which one was your least favorite?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: If you had the power to bring one past character back to the show, who would you bring back and why?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: How do you feel about the rise of unscripted shows which indirectly breed dramatic situations, like ♡❤Big Brother♡❤ and ♡❤Starting Over♡❤? Do you think the rise of reality programming is "bad for business" as far as the daytime dramas go?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: What do you feel is the one major reason for the show staying at the top of the ratings for 19 years? Do you feel you contributed to the show's ratings strength in some fashion?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Do you feel Y&amp;R, through its longevity and popularity, has influenced other shows? 

<h3>Questions asked to Melody Thomas Scott</h3>

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Twenty-nine years in any job is a long time. What made you stick with it as long as you have?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: You remarked in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASoap%20Opera%20Digest"&gt;Soap Opera Digest&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ last year that you get disappointed when your character doesn't get featured regularly in her own story. With that said, did you ever want to just end your involvement with Y&amp;R and do other things?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Nikki and Victor have spent many happy years together, but 2008 has seen the couple divorce for a fourth time. Why so much volatility? 

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Do you feel there should be a happy ending for Nikki and Victor?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Your character went from stripper to socialite. How do you feel this change deepened the facets of your character's personality?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: How do you feel about being recognized not only in the U.S., but abroad as well?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Some of your fans are new to the show, and others have watched since you first appeared in 1979. What would you like to say as an end note to all of your fans?

<h3>Questions asked to Michelle Stafford</h3>

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: You've been working at Y&amp;R eleven years across two separate stints. That kind of tenure in any job is a long time. What made you stick with it as long as you have?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Do you think Phyllis and Nicholas have a fighting chance, or will Phyllis be doomed to losing the men she loves, like with Danny and Jack?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Phyllis had a lot of foils and enemies in the series, like Christine, Drucilla, and Diane. Which one of those women do you think is Phyllis's epic foil? 

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: You've won two Emmy Awards, both from separate and distinct parts in your story. Out of the work which got you both Emmy Awards, which do you feel was your strongest body of work, the one you received on your first stint, or the one you got for your current stint?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Do you think Y&amp;R should make more use of umbrella storylines, like the recent "Out of the Ashes" event?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Some of your fans are new to the show, and others have watched since you first appeared in 1994, and others have watched since the show first started. What would you like to say as an end note to all of your fans?

<h3>Questions asked to Tricia Cast</h3>

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: In terms of writing and depth of character, where do you think Nina was at her strongest throughout her time in Genoa City? And what was her weakest point?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Nina's best friend on the show was Christine, and in many respects, Christine's personality served as a contrast to Nina's. Why do you think those two kept a strong friendship as long as they did?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Over the last couple of years, history was rewritten so that Philip, Nina's first husband, wasn't really Jill's son at all. What does that say to you as far as Nina ever coming back to the show? Do you find it disheartening that the show's history was rewritten to that degree?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: You won one Emmy Award, for the bulk of your storyline involving David Kimble. What were some pros and cons in acting that emotional story?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Many fans would deem the character of Nina as the "beleaguered heroine." Do you think that assessment is on the mark, or were there other facets to her character that you feel were integral to your portrayal of her that deserve note?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: For a time while you were on the show, you (and Nina) gained some weight. In the storyline, Ryan had left Nina for Tricia [Dennison, played by Sabryn Genet], and she became convinced she was unattractive and unloved. Was that a difficult storyline to act out? Also, what kind of fan reaction did you receive while playing that sort of storyline, as it related to female viewers and their own self-image concerns?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: With the advent of the Internet, soap fans have mobilized and fought to make their voices heard like never before. Do you feel fans may be more rigid to change and evolution in their soap operas more so network and company heads, who are sometimes accused of being out of touch?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Out of all of your former colleagues, who do you still keep in touch with?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: If you were asked tomorrow to reprise your role on Y&amp;R, would you do it? 

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Now that you're no longer with Y&amp;R, many of your fans don't know what you've been up to. Can you bring us up to speed as to what you've been doing since leaving the show?

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: Is there any special message you'd like to say as an end note to all of your fans?

<h1>Church of Scientology's 'Operating Thetan' documents leaked online</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Church%20of%20Scientology%27s%20%27Operating%20Thetan%27%20documents%20leaked%20online&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The file is a 612-page compilation of material written for Scientologists by &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;, and contains instructions for the eight different Operating Thetan levels including 'clear' and OT8. Most of the documents have been retyped from their original sources. The file does, however, contain some scanned in Hubbard's own handwriting, which also bear his signature. The collection also contains bulletins by Hubbard written for individuals who have passed the according levels.
"A great many phenomena (strange things) can happen while doing these drills, if they are done honestly," Hubbard writes in regards to 'OT1.' Hubbard then goes on to explain in hand written notes, the 'drills' one must do in order to become 'OT1':

"One: Walk around and counts bodies until you have a cognition. Make a report saying how many you counted and your cognition. Two: Note several large and small female bodies until you have a cognition. Note it down. Three: Note several large and several small male bodies until you have a cognition. Note it down. Four: Final a tight packed crowd of people. Write it as a crowd and then as individuals until you have a cognition. Note it down. Do step over until you do."

Hubbard then goes on to explain OT2, but before he does so, he tells the Churches how to keep Scientology working. One way is to not divulge information on their "technology." Doing so, says Hubbard, would result in "the complete destruction of all our work."

"On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not supported me in many ways, I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its formative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future," states Hubbard in a confidential letter dated February 7, 1965.

Hubbard also goes on to say that "man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve—psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc., ad infinitum." Hubbard also says that "war, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man" and that Man "has been what has made &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="w%3AHell"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;—and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve."

Hubbard calls those 'men' "SP Body Thetans" or those who "are out of valance" and who are "stuck to
another thetan or body but is not in control" with Scientology. Some he says are even "psychotic, serve faces and have fixed ideas" which "inhibits recovery." Thetan is derived from the &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; word "Theta" which means "thought or life."

"An individual being such as a man is a thetan, he is not a body and he does not think because he has no brain," states Hubbard.

It is not until 'OT3' when you learn the true beginning of Scientology. In Hubbard's own hand written notes, he begins to describe a series of "76 planets [orbiting] around larger stars founded 95,000,000 years ago" which he says "are visible from here [Earth]."
From those planets, which were over-populated by "about 250 million per planet," came a "head of the Galactic Federation" named '&lt;a href="w%3AXenu"&gt;Xenu&lt;/a&gt;' who solved the overpopulation by sending vast numbers of his people to Earth somewhere between "75,000,000 and 4 qadrillion ♡❤[Sic]♡❤ years ago." Hubbard says that he brought them to Earth and dropped them off inside volcanoes on an island he describes as &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Xenu then captured the ones who escaped after 36 days and exploded the remaining individuals with a &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrogen%20bomb"&gt;hydrogen bomb&lt;/a&gt;. Xenu was later "captured after six years of battle" and Earth had since become a "desert."

It is also said at this level, an implant, in what Hubbard calls an "engram" will be given in which the individual can "see pictures." However these pictures are not to be "stuck" or permanent.

At 'OT4' individuals are allegedly rid of illegal and legal drugs. Documents state that addicts are not treated with drugs, but simply not given anything.

"As drugs and drug incidents have been so common on the whole track, to simply generally ask for drugs or drug incidents when dealing with BTs and clusters, could cause a total restim," states the document which then says that individuals are made to wait out the effects of the drugs. Another process used to try and stop drug use is to "take any previously given Drug somatic items, or newly list any additional items connected with reading drugs, medicines, etc., and assess for reading somatic item." Hubbard insists that these methods are proven effective.

'OT5' is when individuals learn about the "physical universe, not the laws of physical scientists, but the basic considerations about Matter, Energy, Space and Time," states Hubbard.

At 'OT6' a Scientologist is alleged to develop skills of &lt;a href="w%3ATelepathy"&gt;telepathy&lt;/a&gt; and skills attained at 'OT7' are claimed to include the "rehabilitation of ability to project intention." The final level of the series, 'OT8', is intended to produce "have full certainty and, therefore, perception on all" of your issues.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive interview with &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; author and filmmaker Peter John Ross. The head of &lt;a href="w%3ASonnyboo%20Productions"&gt;Sonnyboo Productions&lt;/a&gt;, an independent film studio based in &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, he has made numerous short films as well as co-directed a feature, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AB-movie"&gt;B-movie&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤Horrors of War♡❤. 

He has also written a book on filmmaking, ♡❤Tales from the Front Line of Indie Filmmaking♡❤. He says that it "combines helpful articles for beginning filmmakers with narrative tales based on my experiences raising money for features and the crazy personalities that invade the world of microbudget filmmaking."

When asked why he makes movies, Ross replied, "There is no greater thrill than sitting in a room full of strangers watching the stories unfold with flickering pictures and sound. I live for the moments when I can sit there and watch the movies with people I don't know and really feel how they react to what I wrote or directed or edited."

A large pile-up on an &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n motorway has left one woman dead and at least thirty - up to thirty-seven - people injured, five seriously. 

Ongoing storms depositing snow and ice across western &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; are believed to have contributed to the extent of today's accident which occurred between &lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASalzburg"&gt;Salzburg&lt;/a&gt;. The pileup involved at least 60 vehicles, and some reports say up to 70. It is thought the direct cause was a &lt;a href="w%3ACoach%20%28vehicle%29"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple trucks were also involved.

Numerous people required cut free from their mangled vehicles at the site on the A1 autobahn westbound, which is now closed in both directions. The crash was between &lt;a href="w%3ASeewalchen"&gt;Seewalchen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Georgen"&gt;St. Georgen&lt;/a&gt;, to the north-east of Salzburg. The weather is making it difficult for ambulances and &lt;a href="w%3Asearch%20and%20rescue"&gt;search and rescue&lt;/a&gt; helicopters to approach the scene. The deceased was a &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; woman living in &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.

The same storm has also caused a large number of road accidents in neighbouring Switzerland, which saw 70 centimetres (28 inches) of snow on Sunday with four metre (13ft) drifts. Hundreds of tourists are trapped in the &lt;a href="w%3AAeolian%20Islands"&gt;Aeolian Islands&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AScicily"&gt;Scicily&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; after five metre waves prompted a two-day suspension of ferry services and destroyed roofs. In the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; traffic jams reached a total of 836 kilometers (519 miles) long and &lt;a href="Amsterdam"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASchipol%20Airport"&gt;Schipol Airport&lt;/a&gt; saw delays while snow was shoveled off runways. &lt;a href="Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; saw one fatality in the storms and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; has also seen much snowfall.

<h1>'Big Brother' contestant Parker Somerville sounds off about the show and his aspirations</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27Big%20Brother%27%20contestant%20Parker%20Somerville%20sounds%20off%20about%20the%20show%20and%20his%20aspirations&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In the past two months, Parker Somerville, a videographer for the website TMZ.com, transitioned from an average guy leading an ordinary life, to living in an extraordinary voyeuristic existence, and back again to the beginning. Simply put, it was a transition from reality to reality, with a two-week detour in reality television. Somerville was a former contestant on the CBS &lt;a href="w%3Areality%20television"&gt;reality TV&lt;/a&gt; staple ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Brother%209%20%28U.S.%29"&gt;Big Brother&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, currently in its ninth installment. 

Evicted on Day 14, Somerville hoped to have another chance to play the game, but came in second in the special "America's Choice" poll to bring back a former HouseGuest (the poll results were eventually not used at all and nobody was brought back). Now freed from a three-week sequester, Somerville was interviewed by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ reporter and he discussed his thoughts on ♡❤Big Brother♡❤, how he and his fellow HouseGuests were portrayed and received, and what he plans to do now that his experience is, for the most part, over.

Somerville will return to ♡❤Big Brother♡❤ on finale night in five weeks. Please check your local listings for time and channel. ♡❤Big Brother♡❤ airs on &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cbs.com/primetime/big_brother_9/"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.canada.com/globaltv/globalshows/bigbrother/index.html"&gt;Global&lt;/a&gt; in Canada, and E4 in the United Kingdom.

<h2>Starting in reality</h2>

♡❤♡Mike Halterman♡❤♡: So, you've been billed on the show as a paparazzi for TMZ.com. Tell us exactly what you do at your job. What was your most exciting work-related celebrity sighting?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: How much exposure did you have to Big Brother before you were selected to go on the show?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: Who influenced you to audition?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: In a previous interview I conducted with ♡❤Canada's Next Top Model♡❤ winner &lt;a href="Andrea%20Muizelaar%20on%20fashion%2C%20anorexia%2C%20and%20life%20after%20%27Top%20Model%27"&gt;Andrea Muizelaar&lt;/a&gt;, she said that she believed reality shows cast people who are perhaps unstable, to make for better television. Do you feel that's true? 

<h2>"The detour"</h2>

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: You were really not that thrilled when Jen, the "soulmate" the show picked for you, was in a previous outside relationship with fellow HouseGuest Ryan. What were you thinking when Jen revealed the news to you? 

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: Also, Allison, Ryan's partner, was shown on the television broadcasts as being probably more angry than you were. Who do you think was more angry about the developments, you or Allison?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: You were involved in some of the most dramatic moments we've seen this season, including, but not limited to, you waking up the entire house to find the person who had talked behind your back. Do you think being that direct was a good strategy for your game play? Also, viewers of the show gathered that you were unhappy with the way Jen played the game, but do you believe some of your actions cost you the game as well?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: How do you feel about Jen telling other HouseGuests that her real-life boyfriend Ryan was racist to ensure that she stayed in the game? Did you think that behavior crossed a line?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: You had said after leaving the house that you felt Matt didn't keep his word to you as far as vetoing your nomination. Now that you've watched past footage, do you still believe Matt wronged you?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: What did you really want to say to Jen after you both got evicted so early in the game? You were very quiet when Julie Chen interviewed both of you...

<h2>Coming full circle back to reality</h2>

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: This season, ♡❤Big Brother♡❤ made the press rather negatively compared to past seasons, specifically with incidents like HouseGuest Adam being fired from his job for a comment about "retards," Amanda being taunted that she should hang herself with a noose "just like her father," and James performing in multiple gay pornography videos. What are your thoughts about all of these these events? When do you think the other HouseGuests will find out about James' past in pornography, if they find out at all? How do you think Chelsia will react?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: You were kept in sequester for a few weeks, and only recently allowed to return to your normal life. How does it feel being recognized as "that guy from the Big Brother show"?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: What options, do you feel, are open to you now that your stint on reality TV is over? Are you going to continue your job at TMZ, or do you hope to break into acting like previous HouseGuests have?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: You were in the ♡❤Big Brother♡❤ house for all of 14 days. With that TV experience behind you, would you ever consider doing another reality TV show again?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: Who would you hang out with after the show ends, and who would you rather not see again? 

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: There are eight contestants left from the original sixteen. Who are you rooting for to win, and why?

♡❤♡MH♡❤♡: And finally, do you believe the ♡❤Big Brother♡❤ "twist" this season (both the "soulmate" pairings and Jen and Ryan's outside relationship) "robbed" you of winning the game?

, backed by &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; forces, has invaded the island of &lt;a href="w%3AAnjouan"&gt;Anjouan&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to topple the rebel leadership of &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Bacar"&gt;Mohamed Bacar&lt;/a&gt;, who has been seeking independence from Comoros.

Around 450 troops disembarked on Monday, landing in the capital of &lt;a href="w%3AMutsamudu"&gt;Mutsamudu&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday at dawn, where a jubilant crowd cheered for them. They joined the nearly 1,500 African Union forces from &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Tanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; providing &lt;a href="w%3ALogistics"&gt;logistical support&lt;/a&gt; for the operation.

The Comoros government says they have already captured most of the island. "The operation started in the early morning hours and it is going smoothly and according to plan," said Abdourahim Said Bakar, a government spokesman. "The military has taken control over most of the island - the airport and Anjouan's capital, Mutsamudu." 

There have been no official reports of casualties, but two African Union soldiers appear to have suffered minor injuries, and one reporter saw an elderly man being carried away after apparently being hit by a stray bullet. Sounds of machine guns and heavy artillery could be heard throughout the island.

Mohamed Bacar seized control of Anjouan in a 2001 military coup. After his term expired in 2007, he held his own elections in which he declared himself the winner. This election was viewed as illegal by Comoros and the African Union.

"We hope that by the end of the day we will have the problem resolved," the government spokesman said. "A special group has been selected to capture Bacar, arrest him and bring him to court. He has to pay for his crimes." 

The spokesman also outlined his priorities for Anjouan once the island is stabilized, which included holding elections within three months, disarming Bacar's miltias, and putting Bacar on trial for corruption and human rights abuses once he is found.

The troops met some resistance from supporters of Mohamed Bacar, armed with assault rifles and rocket launchers and numbering around 400. Some loyalists gathered near Bacar's residence in &lt;a href="w%3ABarakani"&gt;Barakani&lt;/a&gt;, but the military soon took control of the area. The residence was searched, but Bacar was nowhere to be found.

The Bacar loyalists have reportedly begun using &lt;a href="w%3Aguerrilla%20tactics"&gt;guerrilla tactics&lt;/a&gt; against the invading forces. "I have over a hundred men and we will fight until we die," said Lieutenant Ibrahim Moussa of the loyalists. "It's God's will that will decide who is to win and who is to die. The invaders won't make it through."
Though one Comoros soldier reports that three of Bacar's highest-ranking supporters have been arrested, Bacar himself remains at large. The government spokesman says he has been seen fleeing to the island of &lt;a href="w%3AMayotte"&gt;Mayotte&lt;/a&gt; by canoe. 

"Colonel Mohamed Bacar has been spotted in the village of Sadanpoini where he is heading without doubt for a place to flee on board a kwassa (small canoe) towards Mayotte Island," Abdourahim Said Bacar said. "It seems, according to various sources, that he is dressed as a woman," he added.

However, this information has not been confirmed. "The Comoran command will not confirm any information regarding the arrest of Colonel Bacar," said reporter Franck Berruyer.
In a nationally televised address, Comoros president &lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Abdallah%20Mohamed%20Sambi"&gt;Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi&lt;/a&gt; said he had approved of the military operation. "I have ordered the Comoran army and the forces of our country's friends to bring Anjouan back under the rule of law and free her citizens," he said.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n president &lt;a href="w%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt; denounced the operation. "It takes Comoros back to the use of force to solve a problem that could have been resolved with negotiations," he said in a televised statement. "There was no need to deploy troops."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires%2C%20Argentina"&gt;Buenos Aires, Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 

The National Institute against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (&lt;a href="w%3Aes%3AINADI"&gt;INADI&lt;/a&gt;) and the non-profit association Wikimedia Argentina signed an agreement of cooperation and technical assistance.

The signature took place in the INADI's auditorium, located in 750 Moreno Street, in Buenos Aires, the capital of the country. There were present &lt;a href="w%3Aes%3AMar%C3%ADa%20Jos%C3%A9%20Lubertino"&gt;María José Lubertino&lt;/a&gt;, chairwoman of the INADI, and Patricio Lorente, chairman of Wikimedia Argentina, who signed an agreement that includes the accomplishment of joint activities that help to promote and guarantee the free access to knowledge; the promotion and diffusion of economic, social, cultural, linguistic and environmental rights and the establishment of strategies for the prevention of discriminatory practices.

The non-profit association Wikimedia Argentina is a local chapter of &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, organization presided by &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, inventor of the famous virtual encyclopedia Wikipedia, which is today one of the more used resources in the world.

A local chapter is a &lt;a href="w%3ANGO"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt; that shares the aims and the mission of the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimedia Argentina is the first chapter whose principal language is &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, though it foments the creation and development of projects in original languages as the &lt;a href="w%3AGuarani%20language"&gt;Guarani&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AQuechua%20language"&gt;Quechua&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAymara%20language"&gt;Aymara&lt;/a&gt;. In this respect, one of the principal aims that will work with the INADI will be the development of encyclopedias in indigenous languages, an indispensable tool for the collectivities whose culture is threatened.

Former First Lady &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Reagan"&gt;Nancy Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, widow of the late President &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, endorsed Senator &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20President"&gt;Presidency of the United States&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday at her home in &lt;a href="w%3ABel%20Air%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Bel Air, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

The 86-year-old former &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Lady"&gt;First Lady&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement which read, "John McCain has been a good friend for over thirty years. My husband and I first came to know him as a returning &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrisoner%20of%20War"&gt;POW&lt;/a&gt;, and were impressed by the courage he had shown through his terrible ordeal. I believe John’s record and experience have prepared him well to be our next president."

Senator McCain said of the endorsement, "This is an important, most important kind of expression of confidence in my ability to lead the party that I could have."

Reagan's endorsement comes as McCain continues to face critical &lt;a href="w%3AConservative"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; voters. It is possible that it could help McCain earn the support of conservatives who have not always viewed him as aligning with the party on certain issues. At the same time, it could help to align McCain with former President Ronald Reagan, who attracted &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; voters.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ter%C3%A4sbetoni%20frontman%20J.%20Ahola%20on%20representing%20Finland%20at%20Eurovision%202008%20%26amp%3B%20more&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ATer%C3%A4sbetoni"&gt;Teräsbetoni&lt;/a&gt; means "steel-reinforced concrete", and is also the name of a &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aheavy%20metal"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; band formed in 2002. Their music, which centres on an honourable warrior lifestyle or on &lt;a href="w%3Ametal%20music"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt; itself, quickly became popular in 2003 on the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a petition by fans being sent to several record labels demanding a recording deal. In late 2004 the band signed to Warner Music Finland, and the following year debut single ♡❤Taivas lyö tulta♡❤ rose to number one in the Finnish charts, and debut album ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMetallitotuus"&gt;Metallitotuus&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ hit number two and went &lt;a href="w%3Aplatinum%20%28Music%20sales%29"&gt;platinum&lt;/a&gt;, and has now sold about 47,000 copies.

The band, who sing exclusively in &lt;a href="w%3AFinnish%20language"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt;, have just released their third album, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMyrskyntuoja"&gt;Myrskyntuoja&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The lead single on this album is ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMiss%C3%A4%20miehet%20ratsastaa"&gt;Missä miehet ratsastaa&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which Teräsbetoni decided to enter in the Finnish selections for the &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202008"&gt;2008 edition&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest"&gt;Eurovision Song Contest&lt;/a&gt;, where it was selected to go on to the semi-final in &lt;a href="w%3ABelgrade"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; as Finland's representative this year. Although Finland has seen limited success in the contest, their only victory was with a comparable group. In 2006 &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt; - whose monster costumes and pyrotechnic displays are famed - achieved a record 292 points in the final with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHard%20Rock%20Hallelujah"&gt;Hard Rock Hallelujah&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Teräsbetoni's frontman, vocalist and &lt;a href="w%3Abass%20guitar"&gt;bass guitar&lt;/a&gt;ist Jarkko Ahola's fame extends beyond the band he heads. He also features in Finnish &lt;a href="w%3Asymphonic%20power%20metal"&gt;symphonic power metal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acover%20band"&gt;cover&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asupergroup"&gt;supergroup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Kings"&gt;Northern Kings&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Hietala"&gt;Marco Hietala&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Nightwish"&gt;Nightwish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATarot%20%28band%29"&gt;Tarot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Kakko"&gt;Tony Kakko&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASonata%20Arctica"&gt;Sonata Arctica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJuha-Pekka%20Lepp%C3%A4luoto"&gt;Juha-Pekka Leppäluoto&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ACharon%20%28band%29"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;. 

Wikinews was able to conduct an exclusive interview with Jarkko Ahola to discuss these various achievements. This interview is now published below for the first time.

<h2>Interview</h2>

<h3>On the early days</h3>

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Desite the fact that you focus on a lifestyle set in historic times, your band's name means "steel-reinforced concrete". Why did you choose that name?♡❤♡

We got together and had a little conversation about the name of our band. Pretty soon V. Rantanen suggested the name “Teräsbetoni”. We all thought it sounded great and it described our music well in a way that made people think “what the hell is this?…” (And here you have to understand that word “Teräsbetoni” sounds and IS much cooler than “steel-reinforced concrete”.) I guess the name was okay, ‘cause we didn’t have a tendency or need to write songs about historic times, those kind of songs just came out. There are also songs that aren’t set in the past, more into this day or this moment.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡How did you come up with the concept for the band?♡❤♡

Mostly it just happened. We all must have had some kind of vision about the music and the looks for sure and we all agreed about the leather and skin. That’s how it all began. We wrote songs we thought were good and metallish. We played them as metal should be played: loud’n’proud. There must have been something special about our music and live performances, ‘cause the fan crowds just kept growing and growing. And while the band evolved, the concept evolved on its own.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Which artists would you say inspired you?♡❤♡

We all have our inspiration. I can’t tell who have inspired other band members, but I’ve always been inspired by the hard rock bands of the seventies: &lt;a href="w%3ADeep%20Purple"&gt;Deep Purple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARainbow%20%28band%29"&gt;Rainbow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUriah%20Heep"&gt;Uriah Heep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sabbath"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt;… you know, all the 70’s classics. From the eighties bands like &lt;a href="w%3ADio"&gt;Dio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AManowar"&gt;Manowar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHelloween"&gt;Helloween&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAccept"&gt;Accept&lt;/a&gt; have been on my CD- player. Nowadays I’m inspired just by good music. No matter what kind of music it is, if it sounds great.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Did the early reaction on the Internet surprise you?♡❤♡

It sure did. We knew we had something special on our hands, but there’s always something special somewhere all the time, you know. We had this “not-so-pro”-looking site with a picture of us and three demo songs…and that was enough! All the basic pieces were so fit, that nothing else was needed. And of course there was also this “Are these guys serious?”-thing going on. It still is.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡When you made your debut releases you became an instant hit in Finland. What was that like for you at the time, and how is it now, still being a big success there?♡❤♡

Well, you always tend to think that when you hit big, your life changes and everything is cool and crazy. But to us it really didn’t change. After our first hit song “Taivas Lyö Tulta” reigned the air, we were still playing in the small clubs with low prices. I guess many facets believed that we were just a fucking joke. It took some time for the gig organizers to realize that people wanted to see and hear us live. Anyway, it was all clear when we visited summer festivals and got huge audiences. Since then it has been pretty steady. 

Now with all this Eurovision stuff and publicity it’s much more bigger than it was with our first hit and first album. Of course we aren’t newbies to success and publicity now, so we take it causually. None of us really love being some kind of small celebs, but what we like is playing our music to our fans that never seem to let us down. It’s great to meet them after gig and have few beers. So, if publicity is required for that, we’ll accept it happily. 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Some people have described your music as "corny" or "camp". How do you respond to that? Would you agree with the view by some people that much of what you do is in fact a parody?♡❤♡

Let’s put it this way. If we would sing in English, that kind of thinking would be much less common. The problem seems to be the fact, that most of the people actually seem to understand our lyrics and they think that we can’t be serious with this stuff. Hell, thousands of bands do the same thing in other language and nobody’s laughing. Of course we have fun when play live or give interviews, but when we write new songs and record them, it’s all real and true.

<h3>On Eurovision</h3>

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡What does it feel like to be selected to go to Eurovision, especially considering it is mostly an &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English language&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APop%20music"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; contest? Is that daunting at all?♡❤♡

Daunting? No way. I’m proud of being the representative of Finland. Finland has never done too well in Eurovision Song Contest, but Lordi gave the whole show a nice slap in the face. You know, it doesn’t have to be pop to win the number one slot - you can actually play rock music there. We might seem a bit odd to European viewers, ‘cause we have our leatherish looks, metallish music and we sing in Finnish. But in the end, I wish that people will like it.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡What is the song about?♡❤♡

The song is set in the Teräsbetoni-world with certain lyrical style. So, there are horses, heroes and battlefields. But in the end the song is about harshness of life, the call of duty and responsibilty.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡How do you expect Europe to react to a metal song in Finnish?♡❤♡

Well, you can only guess. I believe they react like Finnish people do – they hate it or love it. Hopely most of them will love it.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Of course, Finland has a history of similar Eurovision entries. &lt;a href="Nightwish"&gt;Nightwish&lt;/a&gt; were second choice to represent Finland once with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASleepwalker%20%28song%29"&gt;Sleepwalker&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and of course Lordi won the whole contest in 2006. What do you think of those entries?♡❤♡

Both of the bands have strong image and style. I’m not too fond of their music, but you can’t really deny their achievements.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Of the entries so far, excluding yourself, who to win?♡❤♡

I haven’t heard any other entries yet. We’ll check them out when we go to Serbia, ‘cause we’ll be there for two weeks. That’s enough of full time Eurovision song focus.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Do you reckon you have a chance of victory yourself?♡❤♡

You’ll have to believe in your self if you go to a fight. This is also one of the themes of our ESC-song Missä Miehet Ratsastaa. 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡A video for the Eurovision campaign planned to be shown to the press was deemed "too burly" for the contest. Was that anoying?♡❤♡

You mean our music video? I think the first version of the video was a bit heavy stuff for the people who don’t us. But the new version doesn’t really differ too much from the original, so in that perspective it was a bit annoying… or maybe better word is pointless. 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Many people reading this will be thinking about who to vote for at the contest. Why should they vote for you?♡❤♡

Because what we do is true and pure. We come as we are and play from our hearts. 
That seems to be pretty rare in nowadays music, especially in pop genre where glamour and glitter seems to be essential. …And our song is good, too!

<h3>The new album</h3>

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡How has the reaction to your latest album been?♡❤♡

Well, it reached the position number 1 in Finland’s album chart. Most of our fans have thanked us for the best album so far. I’ve seen few reviews and they weren’t too flattering. On the other hand, they’ve never been ‘cause most of the reviews tend to discuss our looks, image and the lyrics. But it’s all right, that kind of criticism have never affected to our listeners.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡What sort of things are the songs on this album about?♡❤♡

We are still fighting for metal music, so there are traditional songs about playing this music and calling all our brothers and sisters to get together. The other subjects vary from nightmares to galley slavery, from possession to burden of believing in your cause etc.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Talk us through the writing process for the album.♡❤♡

This time we had much more time to write new songs than we did with our second album “Vaadimme Metallia”. On the other hand the recording process’ schedule was more shattered than it was with V.M. 

The cycle of writing must be a bit different with each writer, but for example I might come up with an idea of a title of the song or just a guitar riff . From there I start to develop the song. Mostly it comes out pretty easy. Sometimes there’s just a special mood that evolve to a song. When the rough version of song is in my mind, I record a demo of it. While recording I start hearing how the song should be sang and played. I also arrange the song in the demo phase. I make the demos ready &amp; polished and send them to band members, A&amp;R and producer. I believe A. Järvinen and V. Rantanen, song writers as well, work pretty much the same way.

At this point we give each other comments and critcism about the songs we’ve written. With the help of the producer and A &amp; R we choose the songs that should be recorded on the album. Of course the whole process is more complex but basically the it goes like that.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Did all the recording, production etc go smoothly?♡❤♡

Yeah it did. &lt;a href="w%3AHiili%20Hiilesmaa"&gt;Hiili Hiilesmaa&lt;/a&gt;, our producer, and the band knew each other already and we had discussions about the sound and direction of the new album. The working habits were familiar to us from the Vaadimme Metallia-sessions, so from that point of view things went smoothly. Our guitarists actually did some solos and backing vocals at home! I think that’s a great example of relaxed way of producing.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Do you plan a tour this year to support the album?♡❤♡

We’re already gigging around Finland and summer tour is in the making . Visiting countries abroad would be great, too.

<h3>Northern Kings</h3>

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡How did you come to be involved with Northern Kings?♡❤♡

The whole thing began with Raskasta Joulua –tour that I was in. We also did an album called “Raskaampaa Joulua”. Anyway, there was some talk about doing something else together. You know, not just Christmas carrols in metal mode. Nobody really had the time to start writing new songs, so a cover album seemed to be a nice way of proceeding. 

Everybody agreed that the album should sound massive and orchestrated. At first we had no other direction than covering the music we liked. I did a demo of &lt;a href="w%3AProcol%20Harum"&gt;Procol Harum&lt;/a&gt;’s “&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Salty%20Dog"&gt;Salty Dog&lt;/a&gt;” with Erkka Korhonen. It was a good example of what we should sound like, but our record label’s A &amp; R Osku Ketola thought that we should do something more defined. After few thoughts we decided to concentrate on pop hits of the 80’s. That’s how it all began. I had a chance to arrange my own atcs which was lots of fun. 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡What's it like working with the other three established rockers?♡❤♡

Unfortunately we didn’t see each other while making the record. That may sound crazy, but that’s how it goes nowadays. It’s so easy to record your parts and send them to the studio for mixing. Happily, we saw each other while the photo &amp; video shoot. Marco Hietala, Tony Kakko and J-P Leppäluoto are all great musicians and great persons. If we ever get to do any shows together, I’m sure it would be wonderful in music and in brotherhood.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Is it hard to divide your time between the projects?♡❤♡

It all depends on what you have going on already. While making Northern Kings album “&lt;a href="w%3AReborn%20%28Northern%20Kings%20album%29"&gt;Reborn&lt;/a&gt;” Teräsbetoni was having a break. I try to do things smoothly and avoid booking too much stuff on my calendar. You shouldn’t be too greedy and accept all the stuff offered. 

Of course there are exceptions. For example while we were recording Myrskyntuoja, I had to leave studio early or not go there at all ‘cause of promotional actions agreed by our record label. I can understand the meaning of promotion, but nothing sucks more than bothering an intensive studio session with another project. It screws up your focus. But fortunately that kind of shit is rare enough, so I don’t care complaining about it. And the bottom line is that projects like Northern Kings bring great variety to your life as an artist. 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Is co-ordinating things with the other members hard when they've all got their projects, too?♡❤♡

Well, luckily I didn’t have to do that. That’s producer’s and A&amp;R’s business. But what I’ve seen from aside, it does seem a bit hard to fix up meetings, promo sessions etc. Somebody is always going somewhere!

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡What do you think personally of the covers you've produced?♡❤♡

I’m very satisfied with the results. We all got to do arrangements and songs that looked like us. I’ve heard few cover albums and they’ve rarely been interesting. I think we managed to reach that point.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡What about the work of the others in their bands? Do you like their music as well?♡❤♡

I give all the guys my sincere respect for their work. I think Marco Hietala’s &lt;a href="w%3ATarot%20%28band%29"&gt;Tarot&lt;/a&gt; is one of the Finnish heavy metal legends and it still rocks. I’m not so much into Nightwish, anyway. There’s something that doesn’t quite please my ears. Maybe I should listen to it more. Charon is good on its field and so is Sonata Arctica, while its style is not the style I prefer to listen in metal music. 

<h3>The future and final words</h3>

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Except for an apearance at &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWacken%20Open%20Air"&gt;Wacken Open Air&lt;/a&gt;, you haven't done much international stuff prior to now. Might we see some gigs abroad in 2008, and if not when?♡❤♡

All I can say is I WISH! There might be few gigs in the summer, but we’ll see. 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡You said ♡❤Missä miehet ratsastaa♡❤ wouldn't be translated into English simply because it was designed to work in Finnish. Does that mean we could see some songs written specially in English in the future?♡❤♡

With Teräsbetoni I doubt it. We are pretty much focused on our own language. It would be pretty hard to see us singing in English and still be Teräsbetoni, you know.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡What do you expect Eurovision to do for you? Have you seen any changes already?♡❤♡

I hope we can get our music out as widely as possible. Even though it’s just one song, I believe that it evokes interest in watchers and listeners. The local media has been interested in us since we won the finale, but nothing special hasn’t yet happened.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Loads of people in the music industry have been complaining that downloading illegaly is killing the industry. Do you agree?♡❤♡

I believe it affects the industry and its sales. Still, it’s hard to believe that it’s killing the industry. Of course I also have rights that the illegal downloaders violate. So, even though it’s not killing the industry, it’s totally wrong. The whole system has to change somehow, that’s for sure. 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡What does it mean to you to be in these bands?♡❤♡

It means I can be who I am, a musician, a songwriter and an artist. I’ve done other stuff in my life and I can tell you there were times when I thought that life just sucked. I am grateful for being in this position.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikinews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Any final words for any of your fans reading this?♡❤♡

All that ever comes to my mind is THANK YOU. You really are the air I breathe. Please, keep on giving it to me. I’ll keep on giving you music.

On the first day of his &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AState%20visit"&gt;state visit&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; gave a speech praising the British nation and called for an "entente amicale" between Great Britain and France, in place of the existing, more formal ♡❤&lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3Aentente%20cordiale"&gt;entente cordiale&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ agreement. Speaking, unusually, to both &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Houses of Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, Sarkozy went on to praise the help Britain gave to France during both &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20war"&gt;World Wars&lt;/a&gt; and said that "France would never forget" and that it owed Britain a debt of gratitude.

Speaking in the &lt;a href="w%3APalace%20of%20Westminster"&gt;Royal Gallery&lt;/a&gt; in the Houses of Parliament, the French president went on to say that Britain was a "bulwark against tyranny" and, addressing the issue of the long history of Anglo-French conflict, that Britain and France had been in conflict with each other, not because they were too different, but because they were "too alike".

As well as praising Great Britain, Sarkozy also promised to propose sending more French troops to &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3A2008%20Bucharest%20summit"&gt;Bucharest Summit&lt;/a&gt;, to be held later this year, although he did not specify the number of troops he was planning to send.

During his two-day state visit, Sarkozy will meet with British Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; and they are expected to discuss many different issues, from global finance to Afghanistan.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;The Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; made a public statement on Tuesday saying that four &lt;a href="w%3AICBM"&gt;ICBM&lt;/a&gt; detonation fuses were accidentally delivered to &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military back in 2006.

According to the Pentagon's official statement, the Taiwanese government had purchased helicopter batteries from the U.S, but instead received four nose cone fuses by accident in the autumn of 2006. The U.S. government was notified of the mistake by Taiwanese officials earlier in 2008, and the full extent of the mistake was finally realized last week.

On Tuesday, the fuses were returned to the United States, and an investigation was launched to determine the cause of the accidental shipment. A U.S. government official cited an error in labeling as a possible cause of the incident.

Taiwan has disputed parts of the Pentagon's claim. While the Pentagon stated that Taiwan only alerted the U.S. of the error recently, a spokesperson for the Taiwanese military argued that the United States military was notified by Taiwanese officials immediately after the delivery of the fuses. The U.S. responded by saying it was informed of the mistake, but was not told that Taiwan received the nose cone fuses and was therefore not aware of the full extent of the situation.

&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has issued a statement in response to the incident, criticizing the U.S. for its negligence and demanding for the cessation of arms sales to Taiwan.

The accidentally-delivered nose cone fuses are designed to be employed in the &lt;a href="w%3ALGM-30%20Minuteman"&gt;LGM-30 Minuteman&lt;/a&gt;, an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear &lt;a href="w%3AWarhead"&gt;warhead&lt;/a&gt;.

Endeavour had travelled 6,758,000 miles, and orbited the Earth 250 times.

During the mission the &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20Experiment%20Module"&gt;JEM ELM-PS&lt;/a&gt; module was installed, and the &lt;a href="w%3ADextre"&gt;Dextre&lt;/a&gt; robotic arm component was assembled during a series of spacewalks. Dextre was delivered to the Station aboard a &lt;a href="w%3ASpacelab"&gt;Spacelab&lt;/a&gt; pallet. This &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British-built&lt;/a&gt; component, which was first flown aboard the Space Shuttle in the early-mid 1980s as part of the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an Spacelab programme, was making its final flight. It was returned to Earth by ♡❤Endeavour♡❤.

Landing aboard Endeavour were astronauts &lt;a href="w%3ADominic%20Gorie"&gt;Dominic Gorie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGregory%20H.%20Johnson"&gt;Gregory H. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20L.%20Behnken"&gt;Robert L.

The landing was waved off on the first attempt due to overcast skies at the landing site. This resulted in a 90 minute delay to landing.

Main gear touchdown occurred at 00:39:08 GMT, followed nine seconds later by nose gear touchdown. Wheels-stop occurred at 00:40:41.

This mission was the 21 for ♡❤Endeavour♡❤, the 122 Space Shuttle mission, and the 25 and longest Shuttle mission to the ISS. The next Shuttle mission is &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-124"&gt;STS-124&lt;/a&gt;, which will be flown by &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;♡❤Discovery♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. This is currently scheduled to launch in late May. Before this, &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20TMA-12"&gt;Soyuz TMA-12&lt;/a&gt; will be launched, in early April, with the Space Station's &lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2017"&gt;Expedition 17&lt;/a&gt; crew, and &lt;a href="w%3AYi%20So-yeon"&gt;Yi So-yeon&lt;/a&gt;, who will become the first &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n in space. Endeavour's next mission, &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-126"&gt;STS-126&lt;/a&gt;, is planned for October.

<h1>South Park episodes available free online</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=South%20Park%20episodes%20available%20free%20online&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Episodes of the &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;-based cartoon comedy television series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Park"&gt;South Park&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ have been made available for free via &lt;a href="w%3AStreaming%20media"&gt;streaming video&lt;/a&gt; on the website SouthParkStudios.com. Full-length episodes from the past 12 seasons of ♡❤South Park♡❤ can be seen on the site, as well as behind-the-scenes clips and information on upcoming episodes. 

After new episodes of the program air on &lt;a href="w%3AComedy%20Central"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/a&gt; they will be added to the site for one week, but will then be unavailable for the next 30 days before being added to the site's archives, due to contractual obligations. SouthParkStudios.com was relaunched with free streaming episodes on March 19, and as of Comedy Central's announcement Tuesday the site had three million hits, two million video plays and one million full-episode streams. 168 of the series' 169 episodes are currently available on the site. 

The site is currently in a beta format and is ad supported, but visitors can watch an unlimited number of episodes. Streaming episodes are uncensored, and each episode will have between three and four advertisements. The website also has news, games, blogs and a feature where users can create ♡❤South Park♡❤ avatar characters in their likeness. Fans can also choose from 3,000 episode clips from the show to embed on their blogs or websites. The website was created by WPP agency Schematic, with &lt;a href="w%3AToyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Media"&gt;Virgin&lt;/a&gt; as launch sponsors. 
SouthParkStudios.com launched this past summer with games and other media content, in a deal between ♡❤South Park♡❤ creators &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Stone"&gt;Matt Stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATrey%20Parker"&gt;Trey Parker&lt;/a&gt; where their contract with Comedy Central was extended for three years and the &lt;a href="w%3ACable%20television"&gt;cable television&lt;/a&gt; channel agreed to split online ad revenue 50-50. Matt Stone commented on the three-year contract to produce more episodes of the series: "Three more years of South Park will give us the opportunity to offend that many more people ... And since Trey and I are in charge of the digital side of South Park, we can offend people on their cellphones, game consoles, and computers too. It's all very exciting for us."
Parker and Stone released a statement about the website: "We got really sick of having to download our own show illegally all the time, so we gave ourselves a legal alternative." Parker and Stone don't think that the move will affect DVD sales of past seasons, because fans will still want to own episodes in a "hard copy" format.

The website is managed by South Park Digital Studios LLC, a joint venture of Parker and Stone and Comedy Central. Anne Garefino, general manager of South Park Digital Studios stated: "One goal in moving forward is to make every episode of South Park available worldwide ... Currently, full episodes are not available in the U.K., Australia and a few other foreign territories, but we're not far off from making that happen. We have some contractual issues to sift through but we're getting there."

On the move to make the episodes available for free, Sam Thielman of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVariety%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ wrote: "It's a good time for Parker and Stone to distance themselves from the YouTube community given Comedy Central parent Viacom's protracted lawsuit against the Web-based video distrib, which features clips from the show." &lt;a href="w%3AViacom"&gt;Viacom&lt;/a&gt; is suing &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1 billion in damages relating to video clips displayed on the video-sharing website. Richard Menta of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMP3%20Newswire"&gt;MP3 Newswire&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ wrote: "With all their content already out there Stone, Parker and Viacom realized offering South Park episodes online directly is a low risk proposition. They might as well draw some ad revenue from it."

<h1>2008 TaiSPO: Interview with Ideal Bike Corporation and Gary Silva</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2008%20TaiSPO%3A%20Interview%20with%20Ideal%20Bike%20Corporation%20and%20Gary%20Silva&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
2008 Taipei International Cycle Show (Taipei Cycle) &amp; Taipei International Sporting Goods Show (TaiSPO) not only did a best reunion with conjunctions of the launch of Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition and the concurrent cycling race of 2008 Tour de Taiwan but also provide opportunities and benefits for sporting goods, bicycle, and athlete sports industries to establish the basis of the sourcing center in Asia and notabilities on the international cycling race.

Although the Taipei cycle was split from the TaiSPO since 1988, but the trends of sporting good industry in Taiwan changed rapidly and multiply because of modern people's lifestyles and habits. After the "TaiSPO Innovation Award" was established since 2005, the fitness and leisure industries became popular stars as several international buyers respected on lifestyle and health.

For example, some participants participated Taipei Cycle and TaiSPO with different product lines to do several marketing on bicycle and fitness equipments, this also echoed the "Three New Movements" proposed by Giant Co., Ltd. to make a simple bicycle with multiple applications and functions. As of those facts above, ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Journalist interviewed Ideal Bike Corporation and Gary Silva, designer of "3G Steeper" to find out the possibilities on the optimizations between two elements, fitness and bicycle.
<h2>Part 1: Why winning? Why doing optimization?</h2>

What are the conceptions on the design of 3G Stepper?

♡❤♡Ideal♡❤♡: (As Gary Silva in demonstrations) We merged some basis on a elliptic and a simple fitness stepper, all designed for indoor fitness sporting. After this, the 3G Stepper became a functional bicycle with fitness and transportation. As its steppers were originally designed with &lt;a href="w%3Alever"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; theory and without bicycle seat, not only its speed was determined by its frequency when stepping, but also a user should use one's physical strengths and torques (turnings) to balance the 3G Stepper and make a high intensive works on sporting.

Although the show schedule is concurrent for TaiSPO and Taipei Cycle, but why did you participate the innovation award for the 3G Stepper at TaiSPO?

♡❤♡Ideal♡❤♡: As of mentioned functions before, it can't be fully thought as a bicycle because of fitness functionality.

So you [Ideal Bike] consider to participate at TaiSPO with fitness factor?

♡❤♡Ideal♡❤♡: Traditionally, a bicycle often worked on a person's lower-body, but we promoted "3G Stepper" by considering its fitness factor to hope everyone do a great full-body work with its coordination because a rider should use strengths on one's upper-body to step on the stepper.

Not only fitness, but also &lt;a href="w%3Aartificial%20intelligence"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;? And the other features?

♡❤♡Ideal♡❤♡: Originally, we [Ideal Bike] promoted the 3G Stepper mainly to the bicycle and sporting goods market in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; for leisure and fitness because of a DAMN bad lifestyle especially not sporting and bad beverage culture, which will cause several cardiovascular diseases. By the way, we also designer a smaller version for kids because we hope 3G Stepper is not just a "simple scooter" but a great invention. With this conception, we hope kids can be interested in this stepper and do several trainings on balance. In the past, several people were afraid of a bicycle because its dynamic balance should be done when riding. Last but not least, the 3G Stepper has no limitations on a rider's heights and clothes.

<h2>Part 2: A 3-in-1 combination on cycling race, exhibition, and new venue.</h2>

What do you think about the concurrent schedule on TaiSPO and Taipei Cycle showcased in different venues?

♡❤♡Gary Silva♡❤♡: As you know, even though the bicycle (industry) is important, but we [Ideal Bike] chose the TaiSPO because of its nature on fitness. I hope that "a bicycle is not just a simple bicycle".

More than 20 years ago, the Taipei Cycle was ever included in TaiSPO, but after the maturity of export market on bicycle industry, the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;Taiwan External Trade Development Council&lt;/a&gt; (TAITRA) finally split the bicycle (industry) from sporting goods (industry), and currently, it became the current condition as two trade shows showcased each other...

♡❤♡Gary♡❤♡: It sounds like a good idea and a proper split even though the industry natures of bicycle and sporting good are similar, and some buyers also want to gain some sourcing resources from those two (bicycle and sporting good) industries.

What do you think about a combination on TaiSPO, Taipei Cycle, and Tour de Taiwan?

♡❤♡Gary♡❤♡: Tour de Taiwan?

A cycling race.

♡❤♡Gary♡❤♡: Very nice, this combination will bring visitors on those two shows.

Will this combination provide benefits on sporting good, bicycle, and athlete sports industries?

♡❤♡Gary♡❤♡: Yes, surely. Because buyers and visitors from those three main activity can understand their each own backgrounds, and this optimization will improve notabilities on two shows and the cycling race.

<h1>Governor of Puerto Rico indicted in campaign finance probe</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Governor%20of%20Puerto%20Rico%20indicted%20in%20campaign%20finance%20probe&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today, &lt;a href="w%3AAn%C3%ADbal%20Acevedo%20Vil%C3%A1"&gt;Aníbal Acevedo Vilá&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rico"&gt;Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, was indicted with 19 counts related to irregularities found in the financing of his campaigns for public offices on and off the island. Puerto Rico is a semi-autonomous territory of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Indicted along with Acevedo Vilá are 12 other people associated with his &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Popular Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, all living in &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. In total, there were 27 charges.

The U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodríguez of the District of Puerto Rico said that, because of the nature of the crimes he is charged with, the Governor himself will not be arrested immediately and will be given a chance to "give himself up to the police." Some of the other people charged, however, have already been arrested and await trial.

The 13 defendants are charged with conspiracy, false statements, wire fraud, federal program fraud and tax crimes related to the financing for the Governor's 1999-2002 campaigns for Resident Commissioner, the sole representative of the island in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt;, and for his subsequent 2004 gubernatorial run.

This indictment comes after a two-year investigation by a Grand Jury of donations made to the Governor's past campaigns. 

The defendants face three to ten years in federal prison, as well as several $100,000 to $250,000 fines.

Acevedo Vilá's lawyer Thomas Green says he will defend the Governor "vigorously", and that he finds it troubling that these accusations come only months before the General Elections in Puerto Rico, in which the Governor will run for a second term.

Governor Acevedo Vilá made a televised statement at 5:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;local time&lt;/a&gt; (22:30 &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Coordinated%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) in which he defended himself from the accusations and indicated he will continue in his post. 

Governor Acevedo Vilá is the chairman of the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico, which supports the island's current Commonwealth status with the United States, instead of full &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20state"&gt;statehood&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rican%20independence%20movement"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt;.

In the speech Mr. Bush discussed the surge in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. He said, "Over the past year, we [the US government] have seen significant security gains result from the surge."

Bush also claimed that the United States had achieved many things in Iraq. He stated that "the military achievements in Iraq have been accompanied by a political transformation. It can feel like distant history, but it was only five years ago that Iraq was one of the most brutal dictatorships on Earth - a totalitarian nightmare where any election was a sham, and dissenters often found themselves buried in mass graves. In a matter of 15 months, the Iraqi people reclaimed their sovereignty. They went on to choose an interim government, and to ratify the most democratic constitution in the Arab world. And in December 2005, 12 million Iraqis elected a government under that constitution - a display of courage that defied the terrorists, disproved the critics, and should always inspire the world."

He continued, saying that, "Tragically, the [democratic] progress [in Iraq] threatened to unravel in 2006. The new government Iraqis elected took months to form. In the meantime, a terrorist attack on a Shia shrine in Samarra drove sectarian tensions past the breaking point. Sunni extremists, including al Qaeda terrorists, and Shia extremists, some backed by Iran, slaughtered innocent Iraqis in brutal attacks and reprisal killings. And across the country, political and economic activity was set back."

President Bush did, however, say that the US coped well with the situation in Iraq. "We took a hard look at the situation, and responded with the surge. This dramatic shift in policy had two primary goals. The first was to improve security conditions. So I ordered 30,000 additional soldiers and Marines into Iraq, and gave them a new mission, to focus on protecting the Iraqi people, and to hold the gains that had been made," he said.

<h1>Ryanair executives pay frozen over increased fuel prices</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ryanair%20executives%20pay%20frozen%20over%20increased%20fuel%20prices&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Thirty-eight members of the senior management of &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aairline"&gt;airline&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Ryanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt;, including chief executive &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20O%27Leary%20%28Ryanair%29"&gt;Michael O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, have seen their pay frozen in light of the increasing price of fuel, driven by rising oil prices.

O'Leary, who owns 4.2% of the airline and earned &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;992,000 (&lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;780,000) last year including €565,000 basic pay, said "I think it's inappropriate for managers to be awarding themselves pay increases if profits are falling," and that pay would only be unfrozen if oil significantly decreased in price and "we can see some prospect of profits being increased."

Ryanair has currently hedged oil prices at &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;68 per barrel, but this is set to expire, leaving the no-frills airline paying full market prices. "Our hedging finishes next week and we go from about $70 to about $100. Next year's fuel bill is going up by €400m. We only have around 10% hedged in the high $70s for next year and I wouldn't be hedging now. We'll take our chances in the markets," explained O'Leary.

&lt;a href="w%3AUBS%20AG"&gt;UBS&lt;/a&gt; analyst Tim Marshall estimates Ryanair's fuel bill is set to increase €732m this financial year to €1.01bn. UBS predicts a profit of €485m for this year, but O'Leary says profits could be down to €235m between now and March 2009, dependent on "oil prices and average fares". In light of the news, shares in Ryanair fell 2¾ cents to €2.96½ each.

Ryanair is trying hard to reduce costs, O'Leary saying they were "renegotiating airport contracts, handling contracts, maintenance contracts. We [Ryanair] want to reduce costs in every area of our operation." He said prices for passengers are set to go up, as "bag charges will keep going up until we can persuade half of our passengers to travel without checked-in luggage so we can get our handling charges down". At present, around 40% do this.

He said that to fill an extra 30% of seats the airline will keep fares relatively low. "We won't have to cut the fares like hell but they are not going to go up... More will fly with Ryanair than &lt;a href="British%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20France"&gt;Air France&lt;/a&gt; and all the other high-priced airlines."

<h3>Argentina farmers strike enters third week</h3>

The farmers strike in &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; has entered its third week. The strike is protesting against higher taxes on &lt;a href="w%3Asoybean"&gt;soybean&lt;/a&gt;s and various other exports. As a result, grain exports from Argentina, an agricultural powerhouse, is affecting importers in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. It has become a major crisis for President &lt;a href="w%3ACristina%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Kirchner"&gt;Cristina Fernández&lt;/a&gt;.

AirTanker Ltd., an EADS-led consortium, have signed a 27-year contract with the Defense Ministry to supply 14 new &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A330"&gt;Airbus A330-200&lt;/a&gt; passenger airliner converted for the task.

Wilson also scored his first NHL career assist, when he helped on Lindstrom's goal in the second.
<h3>Edmonton Oilers @ Minnesota Wild</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ABranko%20Radivojevic"&gt;Branko Radivojevic&lt;/a&gt; scored first for the Wild 3:01 into the game. &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Hill"&gt;Sean Hill&lt;/a&gt; scored his second of the season, and his second in consecutive games, on a Minnesota power play a few minutes later. Over halfway through the second period, &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Rolston"&gt;Brian Rolston&lt;/a&gt; scored a short handed goal. &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Pisani"&gt;Fernando Pisani&lt;/a&gt; put the Oilers on the board 4:40 into the third. &lt;a href="w%3ANiklas%20Backstrom"&gt;Niklas Backstrom&lt;/a&gt; made 32 saves on 33 shots, earning his thirtieth win of the season. &lt;a href="w%3AMikko%20Koivu"&gt;Mikko Koivu&lt;/a&gt; assisted on all three Minnesota goals.
<h3>Vancouver Canucks @ Colorado Avalanche</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJordan%20Leopold"&gt;Jordan Leopold&lt;/a&gt;'s power play goal 5:10 into the first period put the Avalanche on the board. &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Sedin"&gt;Daniel Sedin&lt;/a&gt; scored at 9:59 to tie the score for the Canucks. Vancouver took the lead before the first intermission after &lt;a href="w%3ATaylor%20Pyatt"&gt;Taylor Pyatt&lt;/a&gt; scored his 16th goal of the season. Colorado would score four goals in a 6:37 span of the second period. &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Stastny"&gt;Paul Stastny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACody%20McLeod"&gt;Cody McLeod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMilan%20Hejduk"&gt;Milan Hejduk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Guite"&gt;Ben Guite&lt;/a&gt; each scored, which meant the end of the night for Vancouver goalie &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Luongo"&gt;Roberto Luongo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ASami%20Salo"&gt;Sami Salo&lt;/a&gt; would score with 10 second left in the second period, but Colorado opened the third period with Hejduk's second goal of the night. Jose Theodore made 28 saves and earned his 25th win of the season. &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Forsberg"&gt;Peter Forsberg&lt;/a&gt;, Stastny, and Hejduk each had three point nights for Colorado.
<h3>Los Angeles Kings @ Anaheim Ducks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20O%27Sullivan%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Patrick O'Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; scored to give the Kings the lead 9:29 into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Ryan"&gt;Bobby Ryan&lt;/a&gt; tied the score 12:25 into the second period. The score remained tied through the rest of regulation, thanks to the goaltenders on each end of the rink, which meant this game required overtime. In the shootout, &lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Brown"&gt;Dustin Brown&lt;/a&gt; scored for LA in round 2, but &lt;a href="w%3ATeemu%20Selanne"&gt;Teemu Selanne&lt;/a&gt; tied the shootout in round three. &lt;a href="w%3AMathieu%20Schneider"&gt;Mathieu Schneider&lt;/a&gt; had the decisive shootout goal in the 6th round, which gave the Ducks the win, which clinches a playoff spot for Anaheim, and also gives them their 10th consecutive home win.
<h2>Player of the Day</h2>
Today's Player of the Day is Milan Hejduk of the Colorado Avalanche. Hejduk scored a pair of goals and also earned an assist. He scored the game winning goal 10:29 into the second period, the third goal in Colorado's 4-goal flurry.

<h1>Kosmos-3M rocket launches fourth SAR-Lupe satellite</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Kosmos-3M%20rocket%20launches%20fourth%20SAR-Lupe%20satellite&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3ACosmos-3M"&gt;Kosmos-3M&lt;/a&gt; rocket has launched the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASAR-Lupe"&gt;SAR-Lupe 4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Areconnaissance%20satellite"&gt;reconnaissance satellite&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="w%3Alow%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;low Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;. Lift-off, from area 132/1 at the &lt;a href="w%3APlesetsk%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Plesetsk Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; in Northern Russia, occurred at 17:15 GMT. The launch, which was originally scheduled to occur today, was moved up to Tuesday, and subsequently delayed twice due to strong winds at an altitude of 13 kilometres, which prevented launch.

SAR-Lupe is a German reconnaissance satellite constellation, consisting of five spacecraft. The first of these was launched in December 2006. The next satellite, SAR-Lupe 5, is scheduled for launch sometime around October 2008. The spacecraft are equipped with &lt;a href="w%3ASynthetic%20Apperture%20Radar"&gt;Synthetic Apperture Radar&lt;/a&gt; (SAR), which allows them to produce imagery at night, and through cloud cover.

The carrier rocket which was used, Kosmos-3M, is a derivative of the Soviet &lt;a href="w%3AR-14%20missile"&gt;R-14 missile&lt;/a&gt;. It first flew in 1967, and the launch of SAR-Lupe 4 marks its 442 flight. It is also the 900 launch of a member of the R-14 family of rockets.

The launch was declared successful, with the satellite reaching orbit at 17:43 GMT. It is the fourteenth orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Cassini discovers organic material on Saturn moon</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Cassini%20discovers%20organic%20material%20on%20Saturn%20moon&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ACassini%E2%80%93Huygens"&gt;Cassini–Huygens&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft has discovered "organic material" and water spewing from a geyser on one of &lt;a href="w%3ASaturn%20%28planet%29"&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt;'s moons, &lt;a href="w%3AEnceladus%20%28moon%29"&gt;Enceladus&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery was made when Cassini flew by the moon on March 12.

"A completely unexpected surprise is that the &lt;a href="chemistry"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt; of Enceladus, what's coming out from inside, resembles that of a &lt;a href="w%3Acomet"&gt;comet&lt;/a&gt;. To have primordial material coming out from inside a Saturn moon raises many questions on the formation of the Saturn system," said Hunter Waite, principal investigator for the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer at the &lt;a href="w%3ASouthwest%20Research%20Institute"&gt;Southwest Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%2C%20Texas"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer saw a much higher density of volatile gases, water vapor, &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20monoxide"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt;, as well as organic materials, some 20 times denser than expected. This dramatic increase in density was evident as the spacecraft flew over the area of the plumes.

New high-resolution heat maps of the south pole by Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer show that the so-called tiger stripes, giant fissures that are the source of the geysers, are warm along almost their entire lengths, and reveal other warm fissures nearby. These more precise new measurements reveal temperatures of at least minus 93 degrees Celsius (minus 135 Fahrenheit.) That is 17 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than previously seen and 93 degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than other regions of the moon. The warmest regions along the tiger stripes correspond to two of the jet locations seen in Cassini images.

"Enceladus has got warmth, water and organic chemicals, some of the essential building blocks needed for life. We have quite a recipe for life on our hands, but we have yet to find the final ingredient, liquid water, but Enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more," said Dennis Matson, Cassini project scientist at NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

At closest approach, Cassini was only 30 miles from Enceladus. When it flew through the plumes it was 120 miles from the moon's surface. Cassini's next flyby of Enceladus is in August.

Producers of the film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASuperhero%20Movie"&gt;Superhero Movie&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, out today, released clips from the film on the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AParody"&gt;parodying&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; promotional video featuring Scientologist &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;. 

♡❤Superhero Movie♡❤ is written and directed by &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Mazin"&gt;Scott Mazin&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="w%3A2000%20in%20film"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AComedy"&gt;comedy&lt;/a&gt; about superheroes ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Specials%20%28film%29"&gt;The Specials&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The film stars &lt;a href="w%3ADrake%20Bell"&gt;Drake Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASara%20Paxton"&gt;Sara Paxton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20McDonald"&gt;Christopher McDonald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APamela%20Anderson"&gt;Pamela Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATracy%20Morgan"&gt;Tracy Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARegina%20Hall"&gt;Regina Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Bierko"&gt;Craig Bierko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Rex"&gt;Simon Rex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALeslie%20Nielsen"&gt;Leslie Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMarion%20Ross"&gt;Marion Ross&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Hart"&gt;Kevin Hart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJeffrey%20Tambor"&gt;Jeffrey Tambor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Hansen"&gt;Ryan Hansen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Spiner"&gt;Brent Spiner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20David"&gt;Keith David&lt;/a&gt;. 

Drake Bell plays Rick Riker, a young man figuring out how to use his superpowers. The film parodies blockbuster superhero movies including &lt;a href="w%3ASpider-Man%20%28film%29"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABatman%20%28film%29"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AX-Men%20%28film%29"&gt;X-Men&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AFantastic%20Four%20%28film%29"&gt;Fantastic Four&lt;/a&gt;.
In the original &lt;a href="Scientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; video, Cruise discusses his faith and his opinion on what it means to be a Scientologist, while the theme music from his ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMission%3A%20Impossible%20%28film%29"&gt;Mission: Impossible&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ series of films plays in the background. The video, which was not intended for public distribution outside of the Church of Scientology, is nine minutes long and contains heavy use of Scientology terminology. The video appeared on &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; January 15, two days before the release of a biography on Cruise by &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Morton"&gt;Andrew Morton&lt;/a&gt;: ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise%3A%20An%20Unauthorized%20Biography"&gt;Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

The Church of Scientology sent legal letters to YouTube and to &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt;, sites which were hosting the Cruise video at the time, and requested that they take it down. YouTube complied, but Gawker.com did not, and Nick Denton of Gawker.com commented: "It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it." The video later appeared on websites other than Gawker.com, including the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Post"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3AITN"&gt;Independent Television News&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. 

Attempts by the Church of Scientology to remove the video from the Internet motivated an Internet-based group known as "&lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;" to take action in a movement called &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Chanology"&gt;Project Chanology&lt;/a&gt;. Members of Anonymous bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down, including Scientology.org. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10 and March 15, with another international protest planned for April 12. 

According to Scientology critic &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20S.%20Touretzky"&gt;David S. Touretzky&lt;/a&gt;, the Scientology terms used in the video by Cruise have "entered the national lexicon", and the Scientology video itself has become something of an &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20phenomenon"&gt;Internet phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;. Touretzky also referred to the negative effect on Cruise's publicity as a consequence of the leak.
In the excerpt released online from ♡❤Superhero Movie♡❤, actor &lt;a href="w%3AMiles%20Fisher"&gt;Miles Fisher&lt;/a&gt; imitates Cruise in what Liz Shannon Miller of ♡❤NewTeeVee♡❤ described as "an eerily dead-on impersonation of Cruise’s infamous leaked Scientology indoctrination video". She also compared the clip to a different spoof of the Cruise video, by actor &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20O%27Connell"&gt;Jerry O'Connell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Ferguson"&gt;Craig Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; also spoofed the video in a clip on his show on &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Late%20Late%20Show%20%28CBS%20TV%20series%29"&gt;The Late Late Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, as did the comedy website &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Deluxe"&gt;Super Deluxe&lt;/a&gt;.

Christopher McDonald plays the villain "Hourglass" in ♡❤Superhero Movie♡❤, and told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMTV%20News"&gt;MTV News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ he was surprised at some of the parodies that successfully appear in the film: "The thing I didn't think we'd get away with was the actual Tom Cruise stuff. There may be lawsuits there."

A post at ♡❤Slashfilm♡❤ wrote positively of Fisher's performance: "Slashfilm would like to salute young actor and Harvard alum Miles Fisher for easily giving the best impression of Tom Cruise we’ve ever seen in the yuk-yuk comic book spoof." A post at ♡❤MoviesOnline♡❤ commented: "The actor hits every point he needs to and it is almost scary how close he is to the actual Tom Cruise way of thinking." Thomas Leupp of ♡❤ReelzChannel.com♡❤ called the scene "a dead-on spoof of Tom Cruise's now-infamous Scientology video". Ryan Parsons of ♡❤CanMag♡❤ wrote that Fisher impersonates Cruise "perfectly", and Ryan Tate of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ called the clip "the slickest crazy-Cruise imitation yet, as well as one of the funniest".

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; has suspended its contract with a company that delivered old and corroding ammunition from China for use by Afghan army and police forces in a way that violated the contract terms.

The ammunition was supplied by the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;-based AEY Inc., a company run by a 22-year old named Efrain Diveroli. The nearly &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;300 million contract stated that bullets were coming from &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, but were actually decades-old, damaged and corroded bullets from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

Officials from the Army Legal Services Agency notified Diveroli, via a letter, that his company is suspended from future contracting with any U.S. government agency. The letter came as part of an Army investigation since November regarding violation of the contract.

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Diveroli signed papers back on November 25, 2007 certifying that 28 pallets of ammunition for Afghanistan had been manufactured by MFS 2000, a Hungarian company, according to a memo written by investigators.

AEY violated the contract by breaking two clauses, one stating that the ammunition could not be acquired directly or indirectly from the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%E2%80%99s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People’s Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, which is a violation of American law. The other clause specified that it must be packaged to comply with best commercial practices for international shipment. 

According to the ♡❤Times♡❤, says the ammunition arrived in decomposing cardboard boxes which contained ammunition dating as far back as 1966. However, Army officials believe some ammunition even dates back further to 1962.

The Army had contracted with AEY in January 2007 to supply various types of nonstandard ammunition for use by the &lt;a href="w%3AAfghan%20National%20Army"&gt;Afghan National Army&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAfghan%20National%20Police"&gt;Afghan National Police&lt;/a&gt;, an Army official said on background. The company was required to purchase the ammunition and deliver it to &lt;a href="w%3AKabul%20International%20Airport"&gt;Kabul International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in Afghanistan. AEY was recently awarded a delivery order amount of $48,717,553 on March 17, 2007 as part of the $298,004,398 contract.

Also according to the ♡❤Times♡❤, when purchasing the ammunition, AEY worked with middlemen and a shell company which has been placed on federal list of entities suspected of illegal arms trafficking. Also, the ♡❤Times♡❤ reported that, Diveroli was secretly recorded in conversation that suggested corruption on his company's purchase of 100 million aging rounds from Albania.

Bryan Whitman, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;The Pentagon's&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson told reporters that suspension of the contract was due to the violation of the origin of the ammunition and the packaging of the ammunition, not the safety and performance.

“Safety and performance has not apparently been a factor, according to our folks in Afghanistan. They have had no safety incidents reported and no reports of any ammunition that has malfunctioned associated with this particular contract,” Whitman told the press.

He also denied that the issue happened because the Army awarded the contract to the lowest bidder and that he was not aware of AEY's qualifications to fulfill the contract.

“As the United States government does business, they are obviously always trying to ensure they get the best value,” he said. “But that does not mean that, in achieving the best value for the taxpayer, that we will accept something that is below standard for what it is we are purchasing, either.” 
According to an Army official, the suspension of the contract will not have an impact on Afghanistan operations and other contractors are expressing interest into entering into a contract. “Besides, there’s no shortage of ammunition already in Afghanistan. This will have no impact," he said.

Michael Diveroli, Efrain's father, who originally founded AEY as a small printing business, said of his son's career choice to CBS' Miami affiliate, &lt;a href="w%3AWFOR"&gt;WFOR&lt;/a&gt;, "I would prefer he became a nice Jewish doctor or lawyer rather than an arms dealer. He's never asked for my approval on the company. He doesn't always take my advice, I don't influence him. As a father of a boy genius he's hard to control."

Angelo Diveroli, Efrain's grandfather said the young man frequently accompanied him to gun shows when he was younger and became an expert at weapons. 

A friend of Diveroli said to WFOR, "The government came here and checked him out and gave him the contract. How do you give someone, a 21 year old kid a contract like that?"

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army%20Criminal%20Investigation%20Command"&gt;United States Army Criminal Investigation Command&lt;/a&gt; is continuing their investigation, according to officials.

&lt;a href="w%3ARikki%20Rockett"&gt;Rikki Rockett&lt;/a&gt;, drummer for &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aglam%20metal"&gt;glam metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3APoison%20%28band%29"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, was temporarily arrested today on an outstanding rape warrant after exiting a plane arriving at (LAX), &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

The arrest stems from an alleged incident on September 23, 2007, while Rockett — real name Richard Ream — was staying at the Silver Star Hotel &amp; Casino in &lt;a href="Mississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;. A female guest alleges Rockett raped her in his hotel room. Several days after the attack is claimed to have occurred, she filed a report with the &lt;a href="w%3ANeshoba%20County%2C%20Mississippi"&gt;Neshoba County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff's department. They determined there were sufficient grounds to arrest him and issued a warrant.

Rockett had been in New Zealand to play at &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ARock2Wgtn"&gt;Rock2Wgtn&lt;/a&gt; festival with the rest of Poison, who opened day two and were joined by &lt;a href="w%3AWhitesnake"&gt;Whitesnake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOzzy%20Osbourne"&gt;Ozzy Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;. The previous day featured &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlice%20Cooper"&gt;Alice Cooper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKiss%20%28band%29"&gt;KISS&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrenden%20Morrow"&gt;Brenden Morrow&lt;/a&gt; scored his 30th goal for Dallas 15:59 into the first. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Pavelski"&gt;Joe Pavelski&lt;/a&gt; tied the score 3:48 into the second period on a San Jose power play. &lt;a href="w%3AJere%20Lehtinen"&gt;Jere Lehtinen&lt;/a&gt; scored for the Stars on their power play later in the second period. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Thornton"&gt;Joe Thornton&lt;/a&gt; scored a third period goal for the Sharks to re-tie the score and force overtime. Thornton scored his second of the night 2:58 into the 4-on-4 sudden death overtime, giving the Sharks the win.
<h3>Phoenix Coyotes @ Los Angeles Kings</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Dallman"&gt;Kevin Dallman&lt;/a&gt; scored for Los Angeles 6:52 into the second, breaking a scoreless tie. &lt;a href="w%3AAnze%20Kopitar"&gt;Anze Kopitar&lt;/a&gt; scored a couple minutes later to put the Kings ahead by 2. &lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Brown"&gt;Dustin Brown&lt;/a&gt;'s power play goal added to the Kings' lead later in the second, and &lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Blake"&gt;Rob Blake&lt;/a&gt; put Los Angeles ahead by 4 in the third period. Kopitar had a pair of assists to go with his goal, three points on the night total. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20O%27Sullivan%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Patrick O'Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; also picked up a pair of assists. &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Ersberg"&gt;Erik Ersberg&lt;/a&gt; made 38 saves and earned his second NHL career shutout.

Around 240 demonstrators in the &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;an capital of &lt;a href="Santiago%2C%20Chile"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt; were detained Friday after anti-government protests held against the country's education system and increasingly &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20market"&gt;free market&lt;/a&gt; policies.

The annual protests, organized by the &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Left%20Movement%20%28Chile%29"&gt;Revolutionary Left Movement&lt;/a&gt;, were held on the eve of the &lt;a href="w%3ADay%20of%20the%20Youth%20Combatant"&gt;Day of the Youth Combatant&lt;/a&gt;. The day commemorates the deaths of Eduardo and Rafael Vergara, brothers who were assassinated on March 29, 1985 under the dictatorship of &lt;a href="w%3AAugusto%20Pinochet"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt;.

The protesters, many of whom were students, reportedly threw rocks into Santiago's main street, prompting squads of riot police to spray tear gas into the crowds. Other protesters marched towards the presidential palace, but it was cordoned off and heavily guarded. Most of the 240 who were detained are expected to be released after their identities are confirmed.

In between skirmishes with police, some protesters handed out flyers explaining their views. They say the government has manipulated the education system to favor the rich. "We think this neo-liberal education system that the government has introduced should be stopped," said Saray Acevedo of the National Popular Coordinator of Students.

President &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Bachelet"&gt;Michelle Bachelet&lt;/a&gt; condemned the protests. "If one wants to pay homage to the tremendous tragedy of the Vergara brothers, during a period when Chile was not democratic, the right thing to do is guarantee that democracy means being able to express yourself but without violence," she said. "Democracy in Chile is solid and there is no justification for violence," Bachelet added.

Other Chileans who didn't take part in the demonstrations agree with some of the protesters' views. "There are so many problems," said Rodrigo Núñez, 39. "It is true education is expensive and marginalizes the poor. The cost of living is high. Electricity and gas prices are up. Look at how they protest in Argentina! I voted for this government and feel conned."

2 days before Friday's protests, a bomb exploded in a Santiago bank. Police blamed the attack on "anarchists", and they believe it was connected to the annual protests.

Additional protests are planned for Saturday, when the Day of the Youth Combatant will be formally recognized.

<h1>Huge interest takes Wikileaks offline</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Huge%20interest%20takes%20Wikileaks%20offline&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="Wikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt; website, which publishes sensitive and censored material submitted by anonymous contributors, has experienced unprecedented levels of &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; traffic today through public interest. This interest has caused the website's servers to be unable to meet the demand of over 164 gigabytes of download traffic within twenty-four hours, leading the site to be temporarily inaccessible. 

The film &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFitna%20%28film%29"&gt;♡❤Fitna♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , directed and produced by Dutch politician &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeert%20Wilders"&gt;Geert Wilders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has caused controversy for its presentation of Wilders' negative view of &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; as being committed to world domination and acts of terrorism. A trailer for the film was widely uploaded to many video sharing sites, including &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;♡❤YouTube♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Video"&gt;♡❤Google Video♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; this met with anger from Islamic nations, the debacle culminating in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s government ordering the nation's internet service providers to block the YouTube site. This caused YouTube to be inaccessible to residents of other countries whose Internet service providers' equipment automatically began routing traffic to YouTube via Pakistan Telecom's servers, due to their ban accidentally propagating to other providers. Ultimately, YouTube acquiesced to the demands made by Pakistan and other organisations, in exchange for access being restored. The site ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiveLeak"&gt;LiveLeak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ originally hosted &lt;a href="http%3A//www.liveleak.com/view%3Fi%3D7d9_1206624103"&gt;a copy of the trailer&lt;/a&gt;, which has now been replaced with a video message stating that the lives of their staff have been put at risk due to hosting it. 

As a consequence of this censorship, Wikileaks mirrored the video, receiving heavy access traffic through hosting one of the few copies remaining on the Internet. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has obtained an exclusive statement from a representative of Wikileaks, affirming that the site has not been taken off-line due to external pressure, and is instead suffering technical problems due to this high demand. The representative gave the following statement:

Wikileaks gained recent public attention in the ♡❤Bank Julius Baer vs. Wikileaks♡❤ lawsuit, following publication of leaked documents that were alleged to provide evidence of money laundering, tax evasion and asset hiding by Swiss financial institution Bank Julius Baer. The documents are said to have been uploaded by Rudolf Elmer, a former chief operating officer of the bank's &lt;a href="Cayman%20Islands"&gt;Cayman Islands&lt;/a&gt; division, who was sacked following an investigation by the bank that involved polygraph testing. Wikileaks has not, however, stated that Elmer was the source of the documents. Bank Julius Baer sought an injunction against the operator of Wikileaks' domain name, Dynadot, to remove access to the site from the Wikileaks.org domain; this was granted by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The site was consequently inaccessible through this domain, although access could be obtained through many alternate addresses. Following activity by organisations such as the &lt;a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to defend the right to free speech that Wikileaks relied upon, the lawsuit was dropped and access was restored.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; pop star &lt;a href="w%3ALeona%20Lewis"&gt;Leona Lewis&lt;/a&gt; has broken Billboard records in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to become the first female British pop star to reach a number one spot on the music charts in over 20 years and became the third solo British artist ever to reach the top charts.

Lewis made the number one spot with her new hit single ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABleeding%20Love"&gt;Bleeding Love&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤ According to Billboard.com her single ranks number one in the top 100, the pop 100 and hottest digital songs.

"I'm so excited to be able to spend some time in the US and showcase my music to everyone here. Its been a dream of mine since I was a little girl and I can't wait," said Lewis on her website.

The last female singer from the UK to top the charts in the U.S. was &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Wilde"&gt;Kim Wilde&lt;/a&gt; in 1987 when she did her own version of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Supremes"&gt;The Supremes&lt;/a&gt; 'You Keep Me Hangin' On.'

Lewis took the UK by storm when she won &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%29"&gt;The X Factor (UK)&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 and became the biggest selling female artist of all time in the UK.

Individuals and organisations around the world announced their support for the environment by turning off lights and electrical appliances between 8 and 9 pm for &lt;a href="w%3AEarth%20Hour%23Earth%20Hour%202008"&gt;Earth Hour 2008&lt;/a&gt;.

In the city of origin, &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the end of Earth Hour was celebrated with a fireworks show. Although many cities were not officially covered by Earth Hour, people from regions including &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; will turn off their lights for the event. Danish royal palaces went dark at the queen's command. One of these people told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that "it [Earth Hour] is a very important event as it helps to raise awareness of climate change worldwide."

This is the first time the movement went global. The first &lt;a href="w%3AEarth%20Hour"&gt;Earth Hour&lt;/a&gt;, held on March 31, 2007, saw more than 2.2 million residents and 2100 businesses in Sydney, Australia, switch off their lights.

Substitute Lukas Podolski scored a late equalizer to claim his 1 goal of the Bundesliga season against Nürnberg. This was Lukas Podolski's first-ever goal as a substitute in the Bundesliga 

Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld made 3 changes to the side which beat Leverkusen last weekend, all of them enforced. &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20van%20Buyten"&gt;Daniel van Buyten&lt;/a&gt; replaced &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Demichelis"&gt;Martin Demichelis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Ottl"&gt;Andreas Ottl&lt;/a&gt; replaced &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20van%20Bommel"&gt;Mark van Bommel&lt;/a&gt;, who was serving a suspension, and &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Lell"&gt;Christian Lell&lt;/a&gt; replaced &lt;a href="w%3AHamit%20Altintop"&gt;Hamit Altintop&lt;/a&gt; who is out injured with fractured &lt;a href="w%3AMetatarsal"&gt;metatarsus&lt;/a&gt;. Hitzfeld experimented with preferring Philipp Lahm in an unfamiliar wide midfield role rather than the other option of &lt;a href="w%3ABastian%20Schweinsteiger"&gt;Bastian Schweinsteiger&lt;/a&gt;.

Work to extend the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20London%20line"&gt;East London railway line&lt;/a&gt; reached a significant milestone today as a new bridge was lowered into position over a street in &lt;a href="w%3AShoreditch"&gt;Shoreditch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. The line, previously part of the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Undeground"&gt;London Undeground&lt;/a&gt;, is being extended to become part of the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Overground"&gt;London Overground&lt;/a&gt; network.

The 350 tonne, 35 metre long &lt;a href="w%3Atied%20arch%20bridge"&gt;tied arch bridge&lt;/a&gt; required the use of Britain's largest mobile crane to get it into position.

Transport for London project manager Barrie Noble said, "I've been in this business a good many years and have led a fair few extraordinary projects, but lifting this bridge in really will be something to behold."

"I can't say how proud I am of the team behind it, both the TfL engineers and the contractors we are using."

The bridge was manufactured in &lt;a href="w%3AChepstow"&gt;Chepstow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; and assembled on-site. 

A section of Shoreditch High Street will remain closed over the weekend as the bridge is secured in place. The East London line closed in December 2007 and is due to reopen in stages from 2010.

<h3>Vancouver Canucks @ Minnesota Wild</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APierre-Marc%20Bouchard"&gt;Pierre-Marc Bouchard&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal for Minnesota 11:37 into the first period on a Wild power play. &lt;a href="w%3AMikko%20Koivu"&gt;Mikko Koivu&lt;/a&gt; gave the Wild a two goal lead before the first intermission. &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Burns"&gt;Brent Burns&lt;/a&gt; scored a power play goal to put Minnesota up by 3. &lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20Fedoruk"&gt;Todd Fedoruk&lt;/a&gt; scored the Wild's other second period goal at 13:28.

Burrows received a match penalty, which is an automatic suspension from the NHL, and it is unknown whether he will be available to play in Vancouver's game Sunday against the Calgary Flames.
<h3>Edmonton Oilers @ Colorado Avalanche</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Brunette"&gt;Andrew Brunette&lt;/a&gt; scored 7:22 into the first period to put Colorado on the board first. &lt;a href="w%3AMilan%20Hejduk"&gt;Milan Hejduk&lt;/a&gt; scored 40 seconds later to give the Avalanche a two goal lead.

The Oilers took the lead in the second period when &lt;a href="w%3ACurtis%20Glencross"&gt;Curtis Glencross&lt;/a&gt; scored.

Sakic also scored the decisive goal in the third round of the shootout, giving the Avalanche the win.
<h3>San Jose Sharks @ Anaheim Ducks</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Marleau"&gt;Patrick Marleau&lt;/a&gt; scored first for the Sharks 6:38 into the first period. &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Niedermayer"&gt;Scott Niedermayer&lt;/a&gt; scored on an Anaheim power play to tie the score later in the first. &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Roenick"&gt;Jeremy Roenick&lt;/a&gt; scored his own power play goal for San Jose, retaking the lead for the Sharks in the second period. &lt;a href="w%3ACurtis%20Brown"&gt;Curtis Brown&lt;/a&gt; also scored in the second for the Sharks, putting them ahead by three. They held on to snap Anaheim's 10 game home winning streak. San Jose's victory also clinches the Pacific Division title for the team's third time in franchise history.

While nearly all cover of the &lt;a href="2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 Presidential election&lt;/a&gt; has focused on the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third party candidates. These parties represent a variety of views that may not be acknowledged by the major party platforms.

As a non-partisan news source, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has impartially reached out to these candidates, who are looking to become the 43rd person elected to serve their nation from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW.

The online encyclopedia, &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, has published its 10 millionth article. The 10 millionth Wikipedia article is "&lt;a href="w%3Ahu%3ANicholas%20Hilliard"&gt;Nicholas Hilliard&lt;/a&gt;" in the Hungarian Wikipedia, according to a press release from Wikimedia Foundation head of communications Jay Walsh. The Wikimedia Foundation operates Wikipedia editions in 253 languages. The largest single language is English, which has 2.3 million articles. The official total count reached 10 million on Thursday, March 27, at 00:07 UTC.

In the press release, Wikimedia founder Jimmy Wales was quoted as saying "It's incredible to think that we've grown from one Wikipedia in English to over 250 language Wikipedias. Ten million articles is something we could never have imagined happening so fast when we embarked on Wikipedia in 2001. This is a testament to the incredible dedication of our volunteers around the world."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikimania%20jury%20chooses%20Buenos%20Aires%20for%202009%20location&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On March 28, the jury in charge of selecting the location of &lt;a href="Wikimania"&gt;Wikimania&lt;/a&gt; 2009 announced that the annual conference will be held in the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the capital of the &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentine Republic&lt;/a&gt;.

According to a an official mailing list post from &lt;a href="Wikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt; Volunteer Coordinator Cary Bass, Phoebe Ayers, and James Forrester made on behalf of the jury, Buenos Aires was chosen because of the "strong, organized team" behind the bid, the "detailed budget proposal and planning schedule," the "significant number of sponsors already lined up," "relaxed visa rules," because it has a "solid venue, situated within a well-maintained cultural center in a major international city," and because of its "good Spanish-language media contacts."

Buenos Aires was selected out of 4 official bids, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKarlsruhe"&gt;Karlsruhe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The conference venue will be the General San Martín Cultural Centre, located in the heart of the city. The conference will also be sponsored by entities like the Buenos Aires Tourism Authority and the National University of La Plata.

The bid was mainly organized by the members of Wikimedia Argentina, a local chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation.

This will be the first Wikimania celebrated in the South American continent and the first in a Spanish-speaking country.

Wikimania is an annual international conference for the editors of Wikimedia projects. The first conference was held in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, on August 4-8, 2005; the second conference was held in &lt;a href="Boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, on August 4-6, 2006; the third one was held in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, on August 3-5, 2007; this year's conference will be held on July 17-19 in &lt;a href="Alexandria"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Wikimedia Argentina reacts to the selection</h2>

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ interviewed Patricio Lorente, the President of Wikimedia Argentina, on his reaction to the selection of Buenos Aires for Wikimania 2009.

♡❤♡How do you feel about the selection?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Patricio♡❤♡: The whole group feels great satisfaction and an enormous responsibility. We've been working on this candidacy for over a year and the expectancy of getting the jury's support was very big.

♡❤♡How will Wikimania 2009 be different from other years?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Patricio♡❤♡: The location is part of the newness: it'll be the first Wikimania celebrated in the southern hemisphere and in a Latin country. The Spanish-speaking community has had, up until now, a weak participation in the global Wikimedia community, and we think this event will help integrate us. 

Secondly, it'll be a Wikimania more integrated to the host city than previous ones: we based our bid on that, making sure that the venues are in the very heart of Buenos Aires. In addition to having a comfortable ambiance for carrying out the discussions, we want the wiki community to live the city. 

Thirdly, it'll be a bilingual Wikimania. Up until now, the official language of Wikimania has been English. As part of this effort to integrate the Spanish-speaking community to the Wikimedia world we will make sure that there is simultaneous translation between Spanish and English, so that conferences are available in both languages.

♡❤♡How do you think Wikimania will affect Latin America?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Patricio♡❤♡: We hope it gives new impulse to the organization of existing communities in countries in the region, developing new local chapters. We also expect important press coverage, stimulating the appearance of new Wikimedians.

The 32nd round of the &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;English Premiership&lt;/a&gt; took place this past weekend with both the battles for the league title and the battle against relegation still raging on. The fate of one team has been sealed for the rest of the season as &lt;a href="w%3ADerby%20County%20F.C."&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt; has been mathematically guaranteed relegation, setting a new league record for earliest relegation. At the top of the table, nothing changed this week as &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United%20F.C."&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; all won.

<h2>Full Results</h2>
<h3>Saturday, March 29</h3>
<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ADerby%20County%20FC"&gt;Derby County FC&lt;/a&gt; 2 - 2 &lt;a href="w%3AFulham%20FC"&gt;Fulham FC&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
The bottom two teams in the league squared off at Pride Park early on Saturday with relegation for both teams looming. Derby's position in last has been a foregone conclusion for some time, however Fulham had a chance to jump into a tie for 18th spot with Birmingham City. Derby County struck first on 10 minutes when a shot by former Fulham player Dean Leacock bounced off the knee of Rams striker Emanuel Villa and past Fulham keeper Kasey Keller. Fulham knotted the score at one a piece in the 24th minute when a cross by Simon Davies was met by the head of Diomansy Kamara. The teams went into the break tied, but it was Fulham who took the lead in the second half when a shot by Hameur Bouazza deflected off Dean Leacock and into the Derby goal. Villa would score again however, 2 minutes later, with a header off Mile Sterjovski's cross.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AReading%20F.C."&gt;Reading FC&lt;/a&gt; 0 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3ABlackburn%20Rovers%20F.C."&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Blackburn traveled to play Reading in another match this Saturday. Rovers are in position to get into the UEFA Cup next season, sitting at 7th in the league. The game was a battle of the keepers in the end, as Reading's Marcus Hahnemann and Blackburn's Brad Friedel faced off in the opposing nets. Reading's Marek Matejovsky was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 72nd minute, but Blackburn were unable to take advantage as The Royals grabbed another crucial point in their battle against relegation.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ASunderland%20A.F.C."&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; 2 - 1 &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Ham%20United%20F.C."&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Freddie Ljungberg gave West Ham an early advantage in this match, but Roy Keane's Sunderland fought back to earn a 2-1 victory at the Stadium of Light. Kenwyne Jones' calm finishing in the 29th minute tied the game for the Black Cats, and a last minute volley from Andy Reid completed the comeback. The win is Sunderlands second consecutive, and gives them a fighting chance to stay in the league, now sitting in 14th spot on 33 points. West Ham is looking at a mid-table finish, currently at 10th place, a substantial improvement after their near relegation last season.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%20City%20F.C."&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt; 3 - 1 &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City%20F.C."&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Birmingham City looked to put clear daylight between themselves and Bolton at the bottom of the table as they welcomed Manchester City to St. Andrews. City's form had been dropping in recent weeks, and Birmingham took full advantage as striker Mauro Zarate scored off a through-ball from Frank Queudrue, and then made it two soon after the break on a cross from Gary McSheffrey. Minutes later Queudrue brought down Manchester striker Benjani in the 18 yard box, and was subsequently sent off. Elano dispatched the penalty with ease to pull one back for the away side. In the 77th minute Sun Jihai brought down Gary McSheffrey in a shoulder challenge within the penalty area, and Scotsman stepped up to restore Birmingham's two goal advantage.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3APortsmouth%20F.C."&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; 2 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3AWigan%20Athletic%20F.C."&gt;Wigan Athletic&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Relegation battled Wigan travelled to Portsmouth to take on Pompey at Fratton Park. January signing Jermain Defoe proved the difference in the match with two goals to win the match for the UEFA Cup hopefuls. A blocked shot from John Utaka bounced into the path of Defoe who finished from a sharp angle to give the home side the lead in the 32nd minute. In stoppage time Defoe grabbed his brace when he beat the offside trap and chipped the ball from Niko Kranjcar into the back of Wigan's goal.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ABolton%20Wanderers%20F.C."&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; 3 - 2 &lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Arsenal looked to put pressure on Chelsea and Manchester United early on Saturday as they traveled to the Reebok Stadium to take on Bolton. Bolton were in desperate need of a win and took an early lead through Matthew Taylor, as he headed home a cross from Steinsson on the right. Arsenal then suffered another setback when Abou Diaby was sent off for a two footed challenge. Bolton took adventage before the end of the half as Taylor netted his second of the match on a deflected shot. Arsenal came back strongly after the break, with goals from Gallas and van Persie drawing the game level. The decisive moment came in the 90th minute when a shot by van Persie deflect off a defender and into the Bolton goal. The own goal was credited to Jlloyd Samuel.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United%20F.C."&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; 4 - 0</h5>
Martin O'Neil's Aston Villa traveled to take on the Red Devils at Old Trafford. In form winger Cristiano Ronaldo put United in front in the 17th minute when a Ryan Gigg's corner ended up at his feet, and with a flick the ball went between a defenders legs and past keeper Scott Carson. Later in the half a cross by Ronaldo made its way to Carlos Tevez on the left side who dove to head the ball in for United's second. Ronaldo was again invloved in the 3rd and 4th goals as Wayne Rooney latched onto through-balls from the Portuguese and earned himself a brace.

<h3>Sunday, March 30th</h3>
<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea FC&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3AMiddlsbrough%20F.C."&gt;Middlesbrough FC&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
An early goal from Ricardo Carvalho was all it took for Chelsea to defeat Middlesbrough at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea were looking to keep pressure on league leaders Manchester United while 'Boro were aiming to edge closer to the relative protection of 40 points. The Portuguese headed home the only goal in the 6th minute, his first goal of the season. Middlesbrough put pressure on the hosts in the second half, but only managed to hit the woodwork on three occasions.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ATottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C."&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 4 &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United%20F.C."&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Two teams in close standing faced off at White Hart Lane on Sunday, with Kevin Keegan's Newcastle United coming out on top. Summer signing Darren Bent gave Spurs the lead in the 26th minute when he headed home a cross from Steed Malbranque. Newcastle were even on the stroke of half time through Nicky Butt. Tottenham defender Gareth Southgate made a defensive error and Butt took full advantage, slipping the ball past Paul Robinson. Geremi then put the visitors in front with a well taken free kick past Tottenham's defensive wall. Newcastle increased their lead in the 65th minute through Michael Owen, and Obafemi Martins finished the scoring in the 83rd minute.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool FC&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3AEverton%20F.C."&gt;Everton FC&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Liverpool won the latest edition of the Liverpool derby on a goal through Spanish Striker Fernando Torres. More than just pride was at stake this game as Liverpool lead Everton by two points for the final Champions League spot. Liverpool played strongly in the first half and Torres put the Reds ahead in the 7th minute with a right footed shot past Tim Howard. Steven Gerrard cracked a shot off the post later in the half, but Liverpool couldn't manage a second breakthrough. The win puts Liverpool in poll position to retain their Champion League position for next season, however David Moyes' side still has a chance with six games remaining.

Newspapers internationally reported that &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20phone"&gt;cellular telephone&lt;/a&gt; use increases the risk of &lt;a href="w%3Abrain%20tumor"&gt;brain tumor&lt;/a&gt;s, citing the opinion of Vini Khurana, an &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n neurosurgeon. According to the Mobile Operators Association, Dr. Khurana's conclusion "does not present a balanced analysis" and "reaches opposite conclusions to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and more than 30 other independent expert scientific reviews."

More than 100 news sources ran the story about Dr. Khurana although his findings are under peer review and not yet published in any scientific journal. Some reports and headlines called cell phone use more hazardous than smoking, claiming that "New research has revealed that mobile phones are more injurious to people’s health than smoking."

Even if Dr. Khurana is correct about the increase in brain tumor rates, these claims overstate the danger. Primary brain tumors are a rare condition that account for 1.4 percent of all cancers and 2.4 percent of cancer deaths. The death rate from brain tumors is approximately 13,000 persons per year in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Tobacco causes an estimated 438,000 deaths per year in the United States. So if cell phone use actually doubled the brain tumor casualty rate, a United States resident would still be 20 times more likely to die from tobacco than from a primary brain tumor.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHefei"&gt;Hefei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Direct &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; connection to &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has been restored in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; since this morning with the exception of the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Wikipedia"&gt;Chinese version&lt;/a&gt;, which is still unavailable and whose domain name (zh.wikipedia.org) is still a filtered keyword. This comes one week after the similar removal of restrictions on connections to all non-Chinese content of &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; website, and the unblocking of &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABlogspot"&gt;Blogspot&lt;/a&gt;. It is still unclear how long the ease of restrictions will last. 

In an April 3 commentary, BBC's Asia bureau chief Paul Danahar, who is based in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, confirmed that "Wikipedia has now been partially unblocked by the Chinese".

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; recently warned China that it wanted the internet freely accessible for the entire duration of the &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Summer%20Games"&gt;Olympic Summer Games&lt;/a&gt;. Unrestricted access is guaranteed to the 30,000 reporters and media staff expected for the Olympics under Beijing's 'host city contract'.

In 2006, China lifted and then reinstated the ban on Wikipedia. The operation of the so-called &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Firewall"&gt;Great Firewall&lt;/a&gt; is still shrouded in secrecy. Chinese Wikipedians have pleaded to the government in the past for the unblocking of Wikipedia, but to no avail.

Police in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Salt%20Lake"&gt;South Salt Lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; are searching for missing seven-year-old Hser Nar Moo, last seen at her home on Monday. In issuing an &lt;a href="w%3AAMBER%20Alert"&gt;AMBER Alert&lt;/a&gt;, notifying the public of a possible child abduction, police called on anyone with information regarding the child to contact them.

Nar Moo was last seen at her home on Monday at around 2:00 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20Time%20Zone"&gt;MDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-6"&gt;UTC-6&lt;/a&gt;), and was reported missing at around 6:30 p.m. The alert was issued today at 9:41 a.m.

Police called upon members of the public who have any information about the child to call 801-840-4000 or &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt;.

The seven-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20people"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt; girl is described as being 3 feet 8 inches tall, weighing about 45 lbs, with brown eyes and long black hair. She was wearing a pink dress to her knees and pink &lt;a href="w%3ACrocs"&gt;Crocs&lt;/a&gt; shoes.

Police reported that she speaks very little &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, though she does understand some. Her family arrived from &lt;a href="Burma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. Police indicated that she may be in need of medical attention.

The oldest known gold artifact in the Americas is a necklace from &lt;a href="Peru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="University%20of%20Arizona"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; anthropology professor Mark Aldenderfer. The necklace comes from a village in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJiskairumoko"&gt;Jiskairumoko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; range near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Titicaca"&gt;Lake Titicaca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and consists of gold that had been hammered and rolled into nine cylindrical beads, then strung with turquoise on a wool string.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARadiocarbon%20dating"&gt;Radiocarbon dating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; places the manufacture of the necklace from 2155 to 1936 B.C., which makes this item about 600 years older than the next oldest gold artifact that has been discovered the Americas and the oldest example of metalworking of any kind in the Americas. 

Gold metallurgy is almost always associated with agricultural societies. Since the materials used in the necklace are not found in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Titicaca%20basin"&gt;Titicaca basin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the existence of the necklace implies the region had trade routes and a hereditary elite.

Although this discovery was made in 2004, Professor Alenderfer and his team delayed publication in order to have the gold chemically analyzed and to minimize the risk of looters damaging the site before excavation was complete.

A 39-nation coalition in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; passed a declaration on Tuesday to ban &lt;a href="w%3Acluster%20bomb"&gt;cluster bomb&lt;/a&gt;s in a nearly unanimous vote. The gathering in &lt;a href="w%3ALukasa"&gt;Lukasa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Zambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; was the first meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3ACluster%20Munition%20Coalition"&gt;Cluster Munition Coalition&lt;/a&gt; (CMC) in Africa. 

"Africa is ready for Dublin," summarised &lt;a href="w%3AZambia"&gt;Zambian&lt;/a&gt; delegate Robert Mtonga, referring to the upcoming &lt;a href="w%3ACluster_bomb%23International_treaties"&gt;May 19-30 meeting&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; to discuss a global ban on the weapons. "Too often Africa's voice is pushed to the margins in international decision-making. But in banning cluster bombs worldwide, a common African voice will speak volumes and win the day". 
Mtonga was critical of &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, the lone voice against Monday's decision and the continent's largest producer and stockpiler of cluster bombs, and called on the country to destroy its munitions and join the coalition to outlaw their use. &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, the only other African nation to produce the controversial weapons, voiced support for the ban. 

"Strong political will" was credited with the resolution, by CMC co-ordinator Thomas Nash in recognising the drive "to stop the proliferation of this outdated weapon". 

In a released statement the CMC said that 19 African countries, including South Africa, have endorsed the Wellington Declaration. The Wellington Declaration is the basis for the upcoming negotiations at the Dublin Diplomatic Conference in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in May.

While countries such as &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; have tabled the idea of a "transition period" during which time cluster bombs would remain a legitimate weapon of war, the African delegation was resolutely against the idea, calling for an immediate ban.

Cluster munitions are dropped from aircraft, opening in mid-air and releasing a large number of smaller explosives over a wide area. Writer Theodora Williams stated that their use usually results in "...the death and maiming of thousands of innocent civilians".

There are currently 13 African nations that possess cluster bombs although Uganda has recently announced they are destroying their stockpiles. The weapons have been used in eight African conflicts in the past 35 years. In addition to &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, other nations known to have used the weapons are the former &lt;a href="w%3AYugoslavia"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Eritrea"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. 

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Chronicle"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the United States, China, Russia, and Israel have resisted any ban on cluster bombs, arguing that they can be used in self-defense. The ♡❤San Francisco Chronicle♡❤ reported that the United States has lobbied allies to create loopholes in the upcoming Oslo treaty, to allow for the use of cluster bombs. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that a U.S. official had stated that cluster bombs should not be banned if they are used responsibly in state conflicts.

In October 2007, Uganda became the first African country to state it would destroy its cluster bomb stockpiles. Uganda has announced a pan-African meeting to take place after the Dublin meeting, which would seek to garner support for the signing of a treaty in Oslo set to take place in December 2008. The weapons have been used in eight African conflicts in the past 35 years.

The CMC is an international network composed of over 250 civil society organizations in 60 countries, with the stated aim of protecting civilians from cluster munitions. Members of the CMC have been working to complete an international treaty to ban cluster munitions by 2008.

At the February CMC committee meeting in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, only 82 of the 122 nations present endorsed a draft ban on the production, usage or storage of cluster bombs.

<h2>Results</h2>
<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Schalke%2004"&gt;Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt; 0 - 1 &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Barcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
17 year old striker Bojan Krkic scored the only goal of the match for Barcelona in the 12th minute. Thierry Henry rolled his own rebound across the face of the goal and Krkic slotted the ball into the open net. After the opening goal, Barcelona closed down the game looking to hold onto their advantage. Barcelona played much of the second period defending from their half, with their forward play coming on the counter-attack. Schalke pressed hard as the game wore on and had chances through Fabian Ernst, Halil Altintop, and Christian Pander. Substitute Soren Larsen wasted Schalke's best chance to draw level when he failed to react to a cross, and it bounced off his head instead of him heading into the net. Barcelona held for the full 90 minutes and now have the advantage in the two game series.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AA.S.%20Roma"&gt;AS Roma&lt;/a&gt; 0 - 2 &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United%20F.C."&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Manchester United won the first leg of their quarter-final matches against AS Roma. The game passed with much less incident than last years, when violent crowd riots broke out. Roma started the game out strongly with Mancini and Vucinic both having attempts on goal. United's defensive line took a blow when Nemanja Vidic twisted his knee, and was replaced by John O'Shea in the 34th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo then scored his 7th Champions League goal as he sprinted into the box and headed Paul Schole's cross into the net. Roma had a chance to equalize soon after but Vucinic dragged his powerful shot just wide. Just as the home side looked to be coming close to a goal, United doubled their lead through Wayne Rooney. Roma keeper Doni made an error by missing Ji-Sung Park's headed cross, and Rooney took full advantage when the ball dropped at his feet. Ronaldo nearly made it three only minutes later, but Doni deflected his low drive onto the post. Michael Carrick then had a chance to score but scuffed his half- volley wide. United kept the pressure up and cruised to the crucial away victory.

♡❤♡Second legs will take place on Wednesday, April 9th.♡❤♡

&lt;a href="w%3AMaryland%20State%20Police"&gt;Maryland State Police&lt;/a&gt; have issued an &lt;a href="w%3AAMBER%20alert"&gt;AMBER alert&lt;/a&gt; for two teenaged boys who were reportedly abducted in a 2004 black &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%206%20Series"&gt;BMW 645&lt;/a&gt; with Maryland temporary tags. According to the ♡❤Baltimore Sun♡❤, the vehicle was later found, but the victims are still missing.

Police say that at 3 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;), early Tuesday morning, six armed men wearing masks forced their way into the two-story house. They bound and gagged the residents and when they left at around 11 a.m. they took the two brothers with them.

A relative of the boys witnessed them being led from the house to the BMW car. He began to approach but, according to police, the assailants fired a shot at him and drove away.

&lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%20County"&gt;Baltimore County&lt;/a&gt; police spokesperson, Mike Hill, said that the remaining victims in the house initially refused to give information, though they later gave some information. He said it was not known if any property was stolen from the house.

The boys have been identified as Stephon and Sterling Blackwell. Stephon is described as five feet seven inches and 145 pounds and last seen wearing blue jeans and a gray sweatshirt. Sterling is said to be five feet four inches tall and 150 pounds. He was last seen wearing blue jeans and green hoodie sweatshirt

The police are requesting anybody with information that may help in locating the victims to call (410) 307-2020 or &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle tags are Maryland 04350D.

Seven year old Hser Nar Moo, who went missing from her home in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Salt%20Lake%2C%20Utah"&gt;South Salt Lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, has been found dead less than 100 feet from her home.
South Salt Lake Police Chief Chris Snyder said at a news conference, "Once inside the apartment, they observed some evidence that led them to the bathroom of the apartment, where they discovered the body of Hser Nay Moo."

It has not been made public how the girl died. "There is some trauma present, and that's all I'm going to say," Snyder said.

As of Wednesday morning, police have five men in custody for questioning. Witnesses say that four of them are Burmese immigrants living in the same apartment complex as the child's family.

Nar Moo was last seen alive at her home on Monday at around 2:00 PM &lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20Time%20Zone"&gt;MDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-6"&gt;UTC-6&lt;/a&gt;), and was reported missing at around 6:30 PM. An AMBER alert was issued at 9:42 AM yesterday, before her body was found in the bathroom of a neighbor.

The seven year old Asian girl was described as being 3 feet 8 inches tall, weighing about 45 lbs, with brown eyes and long black hair. She was wearing a pink dress to her knees and pink Croc shoes at the time when she went missing.

Police reported that she spoke very little English, though she did understand some. It is believed her family is from Burma. 

The AMBER Alert issued yesterday is no longer active because of the discovery of the body.

The January occasion of the death of the 4,000th member of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military in the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; brought renewed focus on the military's "&lt;a href="w%3ADon%27t%20ask%2C%20don%27t%20tell"&gt;Don't ask, don't tell&lt;/a&gt;" (DADT) policy towards &lt;a href="w%3ALGBT"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt; service members, according to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and other media sources. 

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt; Major Alan Rogers, a civil rights activist in the gay, lesbian and bisexual military veteran community is the first known LGBT soldier to die in combat in Iraq. He was posthumously awarded a &lt;a href="w%3APurple%20Heart"&gt;Purple Heart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABronze%20Star"&gt;Bronze Star&lt;/a&gt;, according to reports.

Rogers was killed by an &lt;a href="w%3Aimprovised%20explosive%20device"&gt;improvised explosive device&lt;/a&gt; while on foot patrol in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; on January 27, 2008, according to an Army report.

Rogers' funeral gained national media publicity, initially on &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;, in the ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ and on &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Public%20Radio"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;'s (NPR) ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMorning%20Edition"&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/a&gt;♡❤; however, initial reports omitted Rogers' sexual orientation or anything related to the subject.

The ♡❤Post♡❤ and ♡❤Morning Edition♡❤ reports coincided with the "grim milestone" that the US military death toll reached 4,000 dead. Rogers' death and funeral gained further media attention when it was revealed that he was gay and worked to end the military's DADT policy.

Initially, members of the national media were well aware of Rogers' &lt;a href="w%3Asexual%20orientation"&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;, and it was widely reported that Rogers was not married and left no children. While technically accurate, the omission of Rogers' sexual orientation was viewed as an intentional distortion by some members of the LGBT community.

The ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3Aombudsman"&gt;ombudsman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADeborah%20Howell"&gt;Deborah Howell&lt;/a&gt;, wrote that the editors of the ♡❤Post♡❤ deliberated the question of whether to disclose his sexual orientation and ultimately made a decision not to include such information.

The Army asked that Rogers' sexual orientation not be disclosed, and the Army presented it as a concern of the family, according to news reports.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Blade"&gt;Washington Blade&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a newspaper for the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; LGBT community, reported on the ♡❤Post♡❤♡s decision to change the story and included more details about Rogers' activities and friends in the LGBT community.

Subsequently, Howell of the ♡❤Washington Post♡❤, citing Rogers' apparent feelings on DADT, wrote a column admitting that the ♡❤Post's♡❤ article “would have been richer” had it disclosed his sexual orientation and activities in the LGBT community. 

Rogers was buried with full military honors at &lt;a href="w%3AArlington%20National%20Cemetery"&gt;Arlington National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; on March 14, 2008.

At 08:01 GMT (01:01 local time) this morning, the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; launched a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinuteman%20III"&gt;Minuteman III&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; missile on a test mission from Launch Facility 09 at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Vandenberg Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. Due to a large number of delays, this is the first time that a Minuteman missile has conducted an operational test in over a year.

The missile flew 6,759 kilometres (4,200 miles) downrange on a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASub-orbital"&gt;sub-orbital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; trajectory, to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKwajalein%20Atoll"&gt;Kwajalein Atoll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; test site in the &lt;a href="Marshall%20Islands"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aapogee"&gt;apogee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reached has not yet been released, however typical Minuteman launches reach between 1,000 and 1,300km. The mission, which was designated GT-196GM, or "Glory Trip 196GM", was conducted to test the missile's operational capabilities. The missile flew with a single MK.21 re-entry vehicle, which would be used to carry a nuclear warhead if the missile were launched in hostile circumstances.

The next operational test of a Minuteman III is scheduled for early August.

<h1>Bertie Ahern to resign as Irish premier</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bertie%20Ahern%20to%20resign%20as%20Irish%20premier&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; has today announced that he intends to stand down from the office of &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AIrish"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;) on the 6th of May. Mr. Ahern made the announcement today at a press conference in Government Buildings in &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;. Ahern's imminent resignation comes on the back of over a year of controversy surrounding payments received by him in the early 1990's while he was serving as &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Finance%20%28Ireland%29"&gt;Minister of Finance&lt;/a&gt;. He has been forced to give evidence on these payments to a &lt;a href="w%3AMahon%20Tribunal"&gt;tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of inquiry and his evidence there is ongoing. 

Mr. Ahern has been a &lt;a href="w%3ATeachta%20D%C3%A1il"&gt;TD&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AMP"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt;) for 31 years and has been Taoiseach for the past 11 years, making him the second longest serving Irish Premier after &lt;a href="w%3AEamonn%20de%20Valera"&gt;Eamonn de Valera&lt;/a&gt;. He won a record 3rd term in office following the &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20General%20Election%202007"&gt;general election&lt;/a&gt; last year. He currently leads a coalition of his own party &lt;a href="w%3AFianna%20F%C3%A1il"&gt;Fianna Fáil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20%28Ireland%29"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Democrats"&gt;Progressive Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and various independent politicians.

Ahern noted, "Never, in all the time I've served in public life, have I put my personal interests ahead of the public good." Further going on to say, "I have never received a corrupt payment, and I've never done anything to dishonor any office I have held." Adding, "I know in my heart of hearts I've done no wrong and wronged no one."

&lt;a href="w%3AT%C3%A1iniste"&gt;Táiniste&lt;/a&gt; (Deputy Prime Minister) and &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Finance%20%28Ireland%29"&gt;Minister of Finance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Cowen"&gt;Brian Cowen&lt;/a&gt; is expected to succeed Mr. Ahern as both Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil. 

<h2>Reaction</h2>

Many Irish and British politicians have responded to decision to resign and made note of his work in &lt;a href="w%3AEconomy%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Ireland's economy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20peace%20process"&gt;Northern Ireland peace process&lt;/a&gt;. 
Irish President &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20McAleese"&gt;Mary McAleese&lt;/a&gt; said of Ahern, "His contributions to our thriving economy and to peace in Northern Ireland were hugely important and he deserves every credit for the work he has done." McAleese added, "Bertie Ahern will be remembered as one of the outstanding politicians of his generation both nationally and internationally."

Irish &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28Ireland%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AEamon%20Gilmore"&gt;Eamon Gilmore&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the decision stating, "I came to the conclusion many months ago that Mr. Ahern would find it impossible to continue in office because of the mounting conflicts and contradictions between the statements he originally made about his financial affairs and the evidence uncovered by the Mahon tribunal." 

Gilmore noted that Ahern made "remarkable achievements" during his tenure including "huge personal and political effort" in the Northern Ireland peace process. Finally Gilmore added, "On a personal level, I wish Mr. Ahern well in his retirement."

Opposition leader and leader of &lt;a href="w%3AFine%20Gael"&gt;Fine Gael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEnda%20Kenny"&gt;Enda Kenny&lt;/a&gt; noted that the work of the government was being "distracted" by events of the Mahon tribunal and that "set standards and principles" for others that he has "not applied to himself until now." 

Kenny added, "I know that personally this is a very sad day for the Taoiseach and I want to wish him well personally on his retirement as Taoiseach and for his future life. I have to say that this decision was inevitable. The Taoiseach here has bowed to the inevitable based on the weight of his own evidence at the tribunal."

&lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt; noted, "He is justifiably proud of the fact that he was the Taoiseach who was in place and who, with the British prime minister and the rest of us, brought about the Good Friday agreement and he deserves our thanks for that. And he deserves our gratitude for that I mean, it was a collective effort, but clearly as the Taoiseach of the day he is due appreciation for that."

&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Durkan"&gt;Mark Durkan&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic and Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, said "When he came to office, he inherited the peace process and the talks process and ensured that their opportunity for all the people of Ireland was maximized. His commitment to the north has been shown in his constant involvement either in implementing the Agreement or in initiatives to secure its implementation." He further added, "This good work involved not just high profile, high wire negotiations, but a lot of diligent private engagement with many interests."
&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, former British Prime Minister said of Ahern, "He will always be remembered for his crucial role in bringing about peace in Northern Ireland, for transforming relations between Britain and the Irish Republic and for presiding over a sustained period of economic and social advance in Ireland." Blair further added, "He will have, deservedly, a central place in his nation's political history and much more widely." He said of Ahern, "A remarkable man with a remarkable record of achievement."

&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; noted, "Bertie Ahern has been an outstanding statesman, and has made an historic contribution in helping to bring peace to Northern Ireland, transforming Ireland's relationship with the UK, and playing a key role in the development of a forward looking and dynamic Europe." Brown added, "The UK could not have had a better partner."

&lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20First%20Minister"&gt;Scottish First Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Alex%20Salmond"&gt;Alex Salmond&lt;/a&gt; said, His political career is one of great achievement. He was a key player in bringing about the historic Good Friday Agreement, and I am in no doubt his significant contribution to the peace efforts and devolution will be a fitting and lasting legacy for his 30 years in politics." 

Salmond added, "He has never failed to impress me - as taoiseach - and in his previous and wider roles in Irish politics. The accomplishments of the Irish Celtic Tiger economy demonstrate the advantage of being a small independent nation in Europe."

This localization included several fields on health and safety of semiconductor manufacturing, certification testing on electrical devices, evaluations on fire or natural diseases, and environmental issues on semiconductor manufacturing devices, etc.. Companies and manufacturers from the semiconductor industry also paid more attentions on this guideline because issues on carbon-savings, earthquakes, fire diseases, and environment-efficiencies were included into this guideline.

On the other side of the incoming trade show of 2008 SecuTech Expo, scheduled after 2 weeks at &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;, not only main fields on security devices, information security, and fire &amp; disease preventions, the digital monitoring will be a hot topic in security industry. For applications on fire &amp; disease preventions, because its issues contained industrial applications and ESH (Environmental, Safety &amp; Health) managements, if a company want to decrease the ratio of fire disease or earthquake, companies from safety and related industries should pay more attentions on disease preventions.

<h2>Results</h2>
<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 1 &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Emmanuel Adebayore struck first in the match in the 23rd minute. A low drive by Robin Van Persie was turned aside by Pepe Reina, and Adebayore headed the ensuing corner into the back of the visitors goal. Liverpool push forward looking to equalize and Dirk Kuyt provided only minutes later as Steven Gerrard stormed into the box and squared the ball to the Dutchman, who drove it into the gaping net. The marker may be judged an own goal after review, as it may have come off defender Gael Clichy as opposed to Kuyt, but only time will tell. Liverpool came alive after their goal with Torres and Hyypia both getting chances, but it was Arsenal who finished the half strongly with a flurry of corner kicks. Neither side could make another breakthrough however, and the teams went to the dressing rooms knotted at one a piece.

Robin van Persie left the game with a thigh strain and was replaced by Theo Walcott, and it was Walcott who had the first good chance as he fired a shot inches wide of the Liverpool goal. Arsenal kept the bulk of possession for the second half and it took a clearance off the line by Dirk Kuyt to keep the scores level. Alexander Hleb picked up the clearance and drove into the area where he was ran into Kuyt, but Arsenal's penalty appeals were waved off. Arsenal's next big chance was again blocked on the line, but this time by their own player. Cesc Fabregas' shot hit Nicholas Bendtner on the line, and the young Dane wasn't able to direct the ball into the open net before Yossi Benayoun cleared the ball away. The Liverpool defence held strong and the Reds earned themselves the all important away draw.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AFenerbah%C3%A7e%20S.K."&gt;Fenerbahçe&lt;/a&gt; 0 - 1 &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Chelsea would draw first blood in this quarter final off a bizarre own goal by Deivid. Florent Malouda's cross was hit in off Deivid past his own keeper to give the visitors the lead. Michael Essien had the next best chance of the game as his powerful drive skipped off the top of the crossbar and out of play. The English side remained in control for much of the first half, and Drogba came close to doubling their advantage near half-time, but was snuffed out by the Fenerbahçe keeper.

Substitute Colin Kazim-Richards tied the game up for Fenerbahçe in the 64th minute when he connected with a cross by Marco Aurelio. Chelsea tried to hit back instantly but Michael Ballack's snap shot is scooped up by Volkan Demirel. The home side then took the lead on a fine long ranged shot. Deivid made up for his earlier mistake by curling his long range drive past Carlo Cudicini's grasping arms and into the Chelsea goal. The win is a huge boost for Fenerbahçe before they travel to Stamford Bridge next week, however the away goal is important for Chelsea, and the outcome of this quarter-final is still fully up in the air.

♡❤♡Second legs will take place on Tuesday, April 8♡❤♡

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Vandalism%20on%20online%20epilepsy%20forum%20triggers%20convulsions&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An internet forum, run by the non-profit &lt;a href="w%3AEpilepsy%20Foundation"&gt;Epilepsy Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, was attacked last week by a group of vandals. The attack, first reported by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWired%20News"&gt;Wired News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, exploited a function of the forums to post &lt;a href="w%3AJavaScript"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; code. The code injected by the vandals flashed two images repeatedly and tried to lead users off to external websites showing flashing lights and shapes intended to trigger off &lt;a href="w%3Aepilepsy"&gt;epileptic&lt;/a&gt; fits. The Epilepsy Foundation had to shut down the forum, and took some measures to prevent future attacks.

In a press release, the Foundation stated that several users of the forum, sufferers of epilepsy, experienced harsh &lt;a href="w%3Amigraines"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aseizures"&gt;seizures&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the attack. One woman, RyAnne Fultz, was paralyzed by the flashing images in what she calls her worst attack in over a year, until her 11-year old son managed to get her to stop looking at the screen and close the flashing images.

They also posted a message regarding new measures saying "In our upping of security on the forums, we have established the following new rules: No animated images are allowed to be used anywhere from now on. No GIFs are allowed at all anymore as well. No rich text is allowed in the body of messages at all, either."

♡❤Wired News♡❤ additionally reports that there is "circumstantial evidence" linking the perpetrators of the attack to the internet group &lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;"Anonymous"&lt;/a&gt;, who are most well known for their recent protests and attacks against the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;, and their members created a reputation as "griefers" in the virtual worlds &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Life"&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AHabbo%20Hotel"&gt;Habbo Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. The Austrian paper Krone reports that the "usual goal of their attacks is to raise a fuss or disturb others". Following critical reports about the attack, members of the group blamed the attack on the Church of Scientology. 

♡❤Wired News♡❤ states that the attack on the forum may have been the first computer attack in history to inflict physical harm on its victims.

Between three and five per cent of all epilepsy sufferers are vulnerable to seizures triggered by flashing lights, shapes or colours, like ones used in the attack. &lt;a href="w%3APhotosensitive%20epilepsy"&gt;Photosensitive epilepsy&lt;/a&gt; has been in the news increasingly over the last few years as various media have triggered seizures in people.

Recently a logo animation for the &lt;a href="w%3A2012%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2012 London Olympics&lt;/a&gt; caused thousands of people to experience seizures. In another incident, the episode "&lt;a href="w%3ADenn%C5%8D%20Senshi%20Porygon"&gt;Dennō Senshi Porygon&lt;/a&gt;" of the animated TV series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APok%C3%A9mon%20%28anime%29"&gt;Pokémon&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ caused thousands of children to experience seizures in &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. In March, &lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt; refused to air a new video by &lt;a href="w%3AGnarls%20Barkley"&gt;Gnarls Barkley&lt;/a&gt; out of fear it would trigger seizures.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UEFA%20Cup%3A%20April%203rd%2C%202008&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

First legs of the UEFA Cup quarter finals were played out on Thursday. Germany is the only country with two clubs remaining in the competition with Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich both playing at home to Zenit St. Petersburg and Getafe respectively. Dutch Eredivisie leaders PSV Eindhoven traveled to Italy to take on Fiorentina, while Scotland's Rangers F.C. welcomed Sporting Lisbon of Portugal to Ibrox Stadium.

<h2>Results</h2>
<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ABayer%2004%20Leverkusen"&gt;Bayer 04 Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 4 &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg"&gt;Zenit St Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;</h5>

Zenit St. Petersburg took a huge step towards the UEFA Cup semi-finals by thrashing Bayer Leverkusen 4-1 at the BayArena Stadium in Germany. Russia international Andrei Arshavin scored the opener for Zenit in the 20th minute when he picked up a loose pass by Tranquillo Barnetta, dribbled past the Bayer defence, and drilled the ball into the top of the net. Bayer equalized in the 34th minute through Stefan Kiessling. Vratislav Gresko ran to the by-line and crossed into the box where Bernd Schneider headed the ball towards the net. Roman Shirokov cleared the ball off the line, but only to the feet of Kiessling who shot the ball into the bottom left corner of the net. The visitors grabbed the lead back in the 53rd minute through Pavel Pogrebniak when he connected with a cross by Arshavin. Alexander Anyukov added another for the visitors with a right footed shot from outside the box, and Igor Denisov capped off the scoring in the 64th after a swift counter-attack.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Bayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 1 &lt;a href="w%3AGetafe%20CF"&gt;Getafe&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich welcomed Getafe of Spain to the Allianz Arena. The home side scored first through Luca Toni when he headed home a cross by Bastian Schweinsteiger in the 26th minute. Getafe looked to hit back quickly, and would have if it were not for Philip Lahm clearing an effort from Mario off the line. Both teams squandered a number of opportunities in the second half including shots by Toni and Ribery for Bayern, and Casquero for Getafe. Manu then had a fantastic chance to equalize when keeper Oliver Kahn made an error, but he only manage to head the ball against the post. With the final whistle looming, Contra lobbed the ball over a charging Kahn for the crucial away goal. Getafe now have the advantage going into next weeks replay in Spain.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AACF%20Fiorentina"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 1 &lt;a href="w%3APSV%20Eindhoven"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Fiorentina and PSV played out to a 1-1 draw in Italy on Thursday. Both goals came in the second half with Adrian Mutu opening the scoring for the home side. Giampaolo Pazzini flicked a long ball into the area and keeper Heurelho Gomes reached out to punch the ball away. Instead it hit off Mutu and back into his own net. PSV's tying goal came only 6 minutes later through Danny Koevermans. Ibrahim Afellay passed him the ball from the left and the Dutch striker netted into the top corner. The outcome of the series is now up in the air after this indecisive finish, but the Dutch side does have a slight advantage thanks to their away goal.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ARangers%20F.C."&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; 0 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3ASporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal"&gt;Sporting Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Sporting traveled to Scotland to take on the only British team remaining in the competition. Rangers enjoyed the majority of the possession in the match but created few clear cut chances, the best of which coming from Lee McCulloch. Sporting's best chances came on the counterattack, the best of which coming from Grimi. His storming 70 yard run looked promising but his shot was saved by Allan McGregor. Both teams pushed for a winner nearing the end, but it would end all square after 90 minutes.

&lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, the most populous state in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, is offering rebates of up to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;5000 to residents who purchase alternative fuel vehicles. $1.62 million in rebates are scheduled to be granted statewide by California Center for Sustainable Energy, an independent nonprofit organization based in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;.

Owners of &lt;a href="w%3AVectrix"&gt;Vectrix&lt;/a&gt; electric motorcycles may qualify for up to $1,500 and &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Electric%20Motorcars"&gt;Global Electric Motorcars&lt;/a&gt; owners may receive $950 and $1,300. The largest rebates will go to owners of full-sized zero-emission cars, which have not yet been approved by the state. Compressed-gas vehicles also qualify, but the agency has already awarded its budgeted allotment for this type of vehicle. 

The eligible period for purchases and leases is May 24, 2007 to March 31, 2009. Applications will be accepted on a first come, first served basis. A complete list of qualifying vehicles can be seen at the California Center for Sustainable Energy's website.

The program is part of $25 million authorized in 2007 by &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Assembly"&gt;California Assembly&lt;/a&gt; Bill 1811 to promote alternative fuel infrastructure and vehicles. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Air%20Resources%20Board"&gt;California Air Resources Board&lt;/a&gt;, about 25,000 dedicated alternative fuel vehicles are in use in California.

&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20FC"&gt;Toronto FC&lt;/a&gt; signed midfielder &lt;a href="w%3ALaurent%20Robert"&gt;Laurent Robert&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="w%3ADerby%20County"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt; freed him of his contractual obligations. details of the contract were not released per team and league policy. &lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; We are thrilled to have Laurent join Toronto FC and become part of our club. He's a tremendous player with a lot of talent and we expect him to come in and make an impact with our team straight away. He's played at every level, and is a true professional in every respect.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – Mo Johnston, General Manager&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Laurent Robert has been capped by &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20national%20football%20team"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and have been with number of Europe's biggest clubs in England, Portugal, and his native France. 

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; I've spent a lot of time with him, and I know a lot about his game. He'll be a big asset to the team, he's got pace, his ability on free kicks is top class and he's a great finisher.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – John Carver, Head Coach&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; Laurent Robert is no stranger to Toronto FC head coach John Carver. He played for Carver while he was with &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;.

Robert will be available the game on Saturday against D.C. United, pending the completion of his International Transfer Certificate.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Department of Defence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spent thousands of dollars on controversial development seminars, Australian media reported Wednesday. The seminars are run by a &lt;a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;-based training company called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALandmark%20Education"&gt;Landmark Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The company evolved from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AErhard%20Seminars%20Training"&gt;Erhard Seminars Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "est", and has faced criticism regarding its techniques and its use of unpaid labor.

Australia's Defence Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Snowdon"&gt;Warren Snowdon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that the government is in the process of reviewing Defence Department expenditures on career development. "We're in the process now of doing an audit, completely unrelated with anything to do with Landmark, which is being undertaken into learning and development to make sure that they meet our needs. ... We have to be very sure that the courses that people do undertake are relevant, appropriate and indeed in line with what community expectations might be," said Snowdon in an appearance on &lt;a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC Radio&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤&lt;a href="The%20Australian"&gt;The Australian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and Australia's ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News%20%28Australia%29"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reported that Landmark Education had been listed in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; as a "possible &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acult"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " in the mid 1990s. When asked about this on ABC Radio, a spokeswoman for the company in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, Deborah Beroset, responded: "What happened in France was that a commission established by the French parliament issued a report in which they listed almost 200 organisations as being possible cults ... We were never contacted. We were inappropriately included in that list". 

In a program which aired Wednesday, the &lt;a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; radio program ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAM%20%28ABC%20Radio%29"&gt;AM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reported that Australia's Defence Department spent at least &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 12,270 of taxpayer funds to send government employees to Landmark Education courses. According to ♡❤AM♡❤, the Defence Department said it does not appear that further funds have been sent to Landmark Education since 2004. 

In a statement released by the Defence Department, the government stated: "A search of Defence records does not indicate exactly how many individuals attended courses with this training provider, however it is believed it was a small number of individuals. ... Defence has been unable to determine individual reasons for why groups within Defence choose this training provider."

♡❤AM♡❤ also reported that the use of unpaid labor by Landmark Education "has attracted the attention of the US and French governments," and that some individuals in the &lt;a href="mental%20health"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; field have accused the company of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abrainwashing"&gt;brainwashing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . When asked about the allegations by mental health experts that Landmark Education's techniques amounted to brainwashing, Deborah Beroset responded: "Well, there is absolutely no credence to that whatsoever."
In a March 9 article in the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHerald%20Sun"&gt;Herald Sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, Peter Rolfe reported that taxpayer money was used to send at least 37 police and government staff from &lt;a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; to seminars run by Landmark Education. Police and Emergency Services Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Cameron"&gt;Bob Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that "Decisions on the appropriateness of staff attending courses by Landmark Education are made by individual managers who remain best-placed to assess the development needs of their staff," but State Liberal MP &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMurray%20Thompson"&gt;Murray Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told the ♡❤Herald Sun♡❤ that the funds should have been put towards fighting crime. &lt;a href="Apple%20Inc."&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReebok"&gt;Reebok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have sent employees to Landmark Education seminars, according to a spokeswoman for Landmark.

In October 2006, Landmark Education took legal action against &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Archive"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and a website owner in &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, Australia in attempts to remove criticism of its products from the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. The company sought a subpoena under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in an attempt to discover the identity of an anonymous critic who uploaded a 2004 &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; documentary of the Landmark Forum to the Internet. "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVoyage%20au%20pays%20des%20nouveaux%20gourous"&gt;Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " (Voyage to the Land of the New Gurus) was produced by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APi%C3%A8ces%20%C3%A0%20Conviction"&gt;Pièces à Conviction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a French &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainvestigative%20journalism"&gt;investigative journalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news program. The &lt;a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; represented the anonymous critic and the Internet Archive, and Landmark withdrew its subpoena in November 2006 in exchange for a promise from the anonymous critic not to repost the video.

Landmark Education is descended from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AErhard%20Seminars%20Training"&gt;Erhard Seminars Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , also called "est", which was founded by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWerner%20Erhard"&gt;Werner Erhard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . est began in 1971, and Erhard's company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWerner%20Erhard%20and%20Associates"&gt;Werner Erhard and Associates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; repackaged the course as "The Forum" in 1985. Associates of Erhard bought the license to his "technology" and incorporated Landmark Education in California in 1991.

<h1>NATO summit in Bucharest enters second day</h1>

One of the biggest gatherings of world leaders, the 20th annual &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; summit which began on Wednesday continued today in &lt;a href="Bucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;.

NATO leaders begin negotiations in earnest over &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, after the opening day of their summit in Bucharest saw a successful &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; offer of more troops, but a public disagreement over the alliance's enlargement.

In the morning, the heads of the 26-strong alliance will hold their first formal working session, picking up on the themes of Wednesday's dinner - enlargement, &lt;a href="Kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, plus other issues.

The conflict of interests involves a delicate diplomatic brinkmanship between NATO's historic open-door policy and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;'s feeling that the alliances' borders are growing too close for comfort.

At the Bucharest summit, &lt;a href="Albania"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; too will begin the formal process of their membership.
NATO's backing of a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; missile defense system in &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; has been harshly condemned by &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, who will be making his first appearance at this year's summit to express his fears of a new arms race.

The leaders of Albania and Croatia will get their first taste of NATO's highest body, when they sit with their counterparts, alongside Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, in a special session.

The ambitions of &lt;a href="Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;, the southernmost of the former Yugoslav republics -- have been challenged by neighbour &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; in a dispute over its official name.

Greece refuses to recognise the former Yugoslav republic's name because it is the same as that of the northern Greek province of &lt;a href="Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; worries that this could imply a claim on its territory.

The fifth annual ♡❤♡♡❤Sony Fair♡❤♡♡❤, established and organized by &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony Taiwan Limited&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; since 2004, started at the North Square of &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20101"&gt;Taipei 101&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;TWTC Hall 3&lt;/a&gt; from April 3 to 13.

Not only executives supported this show, and high-definition AV-media showcases, but Sony BMG Taiwan will also invite several vocalists to hold some mini concerts in the Sony Fair 2008 to bring up the visitors during holiday nights.

Around 30,000 registered sex offenders in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; could be made to provide the government with their email addresses, in order for their access to social networking sites to be blocked.

New government proposals would mean that the addresses provided would be passed onto sites such as &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABebo"&gt;Bebo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;, and others, who would then be responsible for blocking or monitoring access from those email addresses.

Offenders who refuse to, or provide fake emails, could expect jail terms of up to five years under the proposal, which, according to &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJacqui%20Smith"&gt;Jacqui Smith&lt;/a&gt; is designed to allow children to be "free from fear" whilst on line.

The policy has been welcomed by online protection groups, however others have commented that the policing of the internet is not possible. The criticism comes on the same day that &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Carphone%20Warehouse"&gt;The Carphone Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; refused to disconnect customers who shared music for free.

The details of the policy will be decided in the future, by the &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20Exploitation%20and%20Online%20Protection%20Centre"&gt;Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre&lt;/a&gt;, which currently investigates around 400 reports of abuse every month, and internet firms.

It is estimated that around half of all children aged from 8 to 17 have at least one profile on a networking site.

A &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AB-1%20Lancer"&gt;B-1 Lancer&lt;/a&gt; bomber aircraft caught fire after landing at an air base west of &lt;a href="w%3ADoha"&gt;Doha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Qatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;. The incident happened at &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Udeid%20Air%20Base"&gt;Al Udeid Air Base&lt;/a&gt; at 1820 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. 

According to the Air Force, the fire has been contained and the flight crew safely evacuated from the aircraft.

The B-1 Lancer can carry a variety of satellite and laser-guided bombs and is able to remain over targets for long periods of time to assist in close-air support for troops on the ground. It has been widely deployed in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

In March, a B-1 slid off a runway at &lt;a href="w%3AAnderson%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Anderson Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Guam"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Woolly%20mammoth%20demise%20may%20have%20been%20result%20of%20climate%20change%20and%20overhunting&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
New research suggests that the extinction of &lt;a href="w%3AWoolly%20mammoth"&gt;Woolly mammoths&lt;/a&gt; may have been caused by the combined effect of both climatic change and human hunting. Scientists suggest that climate change during the end of the &lt;a href="w%3APleistocene"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt; caused their habitat to shrink in size and as a result caused Woolly mammoth populations to drop and then &lt;a href="w%3APaleolithic"&gt;Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; humans delivered the final blow to the woolly mammoths by hunting the remaining Woolly mammoths. The warming climate may have also assisted humans in over hunting the woolly mammoth, the global warming that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the &lt;a href="w%3AHolocene"&gt;Holocene&lt;/a&gt; melted ice and allowed humans to gain accesses to more mammoth habitats than previously possible.

Scientists have reached this new conclusion by combining population and climate change modeling in their research which has never been attempted in the past. This new method may have made them able to retrieve clearer data regarding the extinction of the woolly mammoth from the geological record. Previously, the two methods were used separately, yielding less conclusive evidence of a human role in the extinction of the Woolly mammoth and other Pleistocene &lt;a href="w%3AMegafauna"&gt;Megafauna&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, recent years have seen an improvement in &lt;a href="w%3APaleoclimatology"&gt;Paleoclimatic&lt;/a&gt; data, allowing scientists to draw a better conclusion from the existing data.

In a repeat of Wednesday's Champions League match, the score stayed the same with a one-all draw. In this game however it was Liverpool who drew first blood through Peter Crouch in the 42nd minute. Crouch collected a long ball, turned inside William Gallas, and fired his drive into the bottom corner of the net. Arsenal had a chance to level soon after the break, but Kolo Toure directed his free header just wide. The home side equalized just minutes later however off a free kick by Cesc Fabregas. His deep curling delivery was headed on by Nicklas Bendtner into the Liverpool goal. The draw leaves Arsenal in trouble for the title, as they are now five points behind leaders Manchester United with United in action on Sunday.

Aston Villa thrashed relegation threatened Bolton at Villa Park. Gareth Barry opened the scoring in the 9th minute when Ashley Young cut into the box and crossed to Barry, who headed home a powerful drive. Bolton came close to an equalizer when Davies hit the crossbar, but it was Villa who would score next. Young found Barry on the overlap and his first time cross was deflected past Ali Al Habsi by Gabby Agbonlahor for Villas second. Barry then scored his second of the game after a block shot by Young fell to him, and his shot deflected off Joey O'Brien and deflect into the net. Marlon Harewood then wrapped up the scoring with a glancing header of a Gareth Barry free kick.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ABlackburn%20Rovers%20F.C."&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 1 &lt;a href="w%3ATottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C."&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Rovers and Spurs played to a stalemate at Ewood Park. Dimitar Berbatov scored the opener for Tottenham in the 6th minute when he bundled over the line a cross by Jermaine Jenas.

Bently almost took the lead with a curling long-ranged free kick, but Radek Cerny saved well. Both sides pressed, but neither were able to create any clear cut chances and the game ended in a draw.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AFulham%20F.C."&gt;Fulham&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 3 &lt;a href="w%3ASunderland%20A.F.C."&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Sunderland edged another three points closer to safety on Saturday with a 3-1 victory at Craven Cottage. Fulham were desperate for points and with the loss, look the best bet to be the next team relegated. It took until the dying moments of the first half for the first goal to come. Fulham failed to clear the ball and Daryl Murphy's cross was headed home by Danny Collins. After the break, Craig Gordon was forced into two fine saves off McBride and teamate Murphy to keep the Sunderland's lead. Kenwyne Jones then headed a ball over the Fulham defence were Michael Chopra ran onto it and one-time volleyed it over Kasey Kellar to double the visitors lead. Fulham pulled one back through David Healy with his long ranged effort in the 74th minute, but hopes of a comeback were dashed only minutes later when Jones received a pass at the back post and smashed the ball home.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City%20F.C."&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; 0 - 2</h5>
Chelsea remained in the title hunt with an away victory at the City of Manchester Stadium. Richard Dunne scored an own goal in the 6th minute off a cross by Nicolas Anelka. The home side pressed for an equalizer, with efforts from Johnson, Petrov, and Mwaruwari all being unable to rattle Carlo Cudicini. Ashley Cole then had to clear a deflected effort by Johnson off the line to keep Chelsea in the lead. Soloman Kalou then double Chelsea's advantage after picking up a through ball by Michael Essien, rounding Joe Hart, and slipped the ball into the gaping net. Anelka nearly scored a third off a cross by Frank Lampard, but his header came back off the bar. The win keeps Chelsea in the title hunt while city are still chasing a spot in the UEFA Cup for next season, currently in 9th place.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United%20F.C."&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt; 3 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3AReading%20F.C."&gt;Reading FC&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Newcastle United recorded their third consecutive win with a convincing 3-0 drubbing of Reading at St. James' Park. Reading opened the game strongly with pressure in the Newcastle half, but the visitors couldn't produce any real goal scoring opportunities. Obafemi Martins then opened the scoring for the home side as he controlled a ball off his chest, rounded a defender, and slotted the ball past Marcus Hahnemann. Michael Owen had a chance to double the home sides lead minutes before the half, but his shot flew just over the net. He soon made up for the miss however, as Owen met a pass by Beye and lifted the ball over Hahnemann for Newcastle's second. Mark Viduka capped off the scoring for the home side in the 58th minute after he played a 1-2 with Beye, received the ball back just outside the 6 yard box, and finished into the left side of the net. The win puts Newcastle comfortably in 12th spot, while Reading will be looking over their shoulders down in 16th.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AWigan%20Athletic%20F.C."&gt;Wigan Athletic&lt;/a&gt; 2 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%20City%20F.C."&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Wigan pulled seven points clear of the relegation zone Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Birmingham, thanks to a brace by Ryan Taylor. In the 15th minute Antonio Valencia picked out Taylor at the far post and he hit the ball first time past Maik Taylor for the opener. Things only got worse for Birmingham and in the 37th minute their captain Damien Johnson was sent off for a reckless challenge on Kevin Kilbane. Kilbane dusted himself off and hit the post with his next attempt, before Birmingham nearly equalized on a cheeky attempt by Mauro Zarate. After the break, a scrambled ball in front of the visitors net eventually fell to Ryan Taylor and he poked the ball into the net for his and Wigans second. Wigan continued to outplay their competition, and eased to victory, leaving Birmingham only one spot out of the relegation zone.

<h3>Sunday, April 6th</h3>
<h5>1 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3ADerby%20County%20F.C."&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Everton eased to an unconvincing 1-0 victory over Derby County on Sunday, with Leon Osman scoring the only goal. It was the last place team in the league who came out strong in the match with Mile Sterjovski taking an early attempt on goal, only to be swatted away by Tim Howard. Hossam Ghaly was the inspirational player for Derby, wasting several chances which could have been goal scoring opportunities, but it was Everton's Yakubu who wasted the first half's best chance. The ball was crossed within the six yard box to the Nigerian, but from four yards out all he could manage to do was send the ball over the crossbar. Everton started the second half better, and took the lead in the 56th minute. Nelson Fernandes put in an exacting long pass to Osman on the edge of the box, and after taking a touch he lashed the ball past Roy Carroll. Emanuel Villa had a chance to equalize for the Rams when a through ball by Andy Todd found him, but all Villa could manage was a weak shot that Howard saved with his foot. Derby kept up the pressure nearing the end of the match with a slew of corners, but they couldn't manage to score. The win puts Everton only three points back of Liverpool for fourth place, while Derby are on course to set the record for least points in a Premier League season.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AMiddlesbrough%20F.C."&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; 2 - 2</h5>
A brace by Afonso Alves earned Middlesbrough a draw with league leaders Manchester United, and put a dent in the Red Devils title charge. Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring for the visitors in the 10th minute when he fired home a cross by Michael Carrick from close range. Alves scored his first Middlesbrough goal ten minutes before halftime when he latched onto O'Neil's flicked on long ball, and the Brazilian lifted it over Van Der Sar and into the net. Middlesbrough then took the lead in front of their biggest home crowd this season when Alves again found himself behind the United defense, and finished cleanly with his right boot. United appeared shell-shocked after the goal, and Alves nearly scored a hat-trick, only to see his header come off the knee of Rio Ferdinand. Wayne Rooney was getting frustrated for the visitors, but he finally broke through with a goal in the 74th. Substitute Park Ji-Sung beat out a defender and crossed the ball into Rooney, and after a deflection off a defender, the game was tied at two a piece. Both teams pushed for the winner, with Rooney missing a close ranged effort, and Van Der Sar making two fine saves, but neither could find the net. The draw puts Manchester three points ahead of Chelsea at the top of the table, while Middlesbrough look to be safe of the drop zone in 14th spot.

The city of Cincinnati, Ohio is host to 24 candidates for the what is arguably the world's top political office. As the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt; draws nearer, the candidates meet to debate the issues with each other.

But you won't find anyone named Hillary or Barack on stage. You will find men named John, but they're Jon Greenspon, John Blyth, and John Bootie, not Republican favorite McCain.

This slate of diverse candidates gathering at the University of Cincinnati are the top independent candidates in the nation, those who have chosen to not attach themselves to one of the main parties. According to online encyclopedia Wikipedia, they "may hold a centrist viewpoint between the two parties [the Democrats and Republicans], they may hold an extremist viewpoint that goes beyond that of either major parties, or they may have a viewpoint based on issues that they don't feel either party addresses."

Dubbed as the "single most exciting political event of 2008", it's the first of at least two national gatherings for these often overlooked candidates, the next being in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on May 3 and 4, 2008.

Wikinews will be reporting from this event, with two volunteer freelance photographers taking pictures of the debates and candidates.

The 2008 &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Torch"&gt;Olympic Torch&lt;/a&gt; has arrived in London today, with the delegation being met by &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; ambassador &lt;a href="w%3AFu%20Ying"&gt;Fu Ying&lt;/a&gt; and Minister for the Olympics &lt;a href="w%3ATessa%20Jowell"&gt;Tessa Jowell&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The torch had just arrived from &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Petersburg"&gt;St Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.

Tomorrow, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; will give a welcoming speech, which has already drawn criticism from other politicians for being "wholly inappropriate". 

After the speech the torch will be taken on a 31 mile relay around London, beginning at &lt;a href="w%3AWembley%20stadium"&gt;Wembley stadium&lt;/a&gt;, and finishing at the &lt;a href="w%3AO2%20Arena"&gt;O2 Arena&lt;/a&gt;, being carried by 80 athletes, dignitaries and entertainers, after initially being carried by five time Olympic gold medal winner &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Steve%20Redgrave"&gt;Sir Steve Redgrave&lt;/a&gt;.

It is expected that the relay route will be lined by hundreds of people, however around 500 people are also expected to protest against the current human rights issues in the country, which has already taken place along the route. 4 people were also arrested today, 2 of which were on &lt;a href="w%3AWestminster%20Bridge"&gt;Westminster Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, after un-furling banners on the bridge.

Around 2,000 &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; are expected to be present tomorrow at the relay, and Tessa Jowell told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that she hoped the protests would be peaceful.

The arrival of the torch comes on the same day that &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; security forces fired on Tibetan protesters, killing 8.

The torch, which has come from &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, will make its way around the world, being transported by thousands of people, and end in China on August 8th, 2008, to light the flame during the opening ceremony.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C."&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; took on the only &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; team remaining in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Cup"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Saturday, with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APortsmouth%20F.C."&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; coming out on top. Pompey had defeated &lt;a href="Manchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; 1-0 in the quarter-finals to advance to this stage, while West Brom crushed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABristol%20Rovers%20F.C."&gt;Bristol Rovers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 5-1 to advance to this stage. 

West Brom started the game strongly, with their first chance coming when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZolt%C3%A1n%20Gera"&gt;Zolton Gera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shot the ball right and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20James%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201970%29"&gt;David James&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who couldn't hold on, and the ball had to be hacked clear by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASol%20Campbell"&gt;Sol Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Baggies dominated the midfield for much of the first half and Portsmouth had to play off the counter-attack, but couldn't produce any good chances. Portsmouth began to gain steam nearing halftime, but neither team would score in the first period.

After the break it was Portsmouth who took the lead through &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANwankwo%20Kanu"&gt;Kanu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A miscommunication between defender and goalkeeper occurred after Kiely made a fine save off &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMilan%20Baro%C5%A1"&gt;Milan Baros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The ball ended up at Kanu's feet around five yards away from the goal, and the Nigerian side footed the ball calmly into the corner. After their goal Portsmouth began to control the match, but West Brom still get their chances as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Koren"&gt;Robert Koren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; smashes a shot off the crossbar. West Brom pushed for the equalizer near the end of the match, but the Portsmouth defense stood firm and will now await the winner of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarnsley%20F.C."&gt;Barnsley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; v &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACardiff%20City%20F.C."&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to see who they will take on at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWembley%20Stadium"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the final.

New signing Laurent Robert and the return of Greg Sutton were not enough for Toronto F.C. as they fell 4-1 to D.C. United in Washington. Early goals from Luciano Emilio and Santino Quaranta left Toronto in an uphill battle for the rest of the match. The hill only became bigger in the 22nd minute when Kevin Harmse put in a hard challenge on Gonzalo Peralta and was subsequently sent off. 

Marcelo Gallardo then made it 3-0 for the home side in the 52nd minute. Quaranta crossed the ball and Gallardo was wide open to smash the ball into an open net. Jaime Moreno capped off the scoring for D.C. in the 78th before Edu opened Toronto's MLS account with his first goal of the season. 

The loss leaves Toronto at 0-2-0 on the season, while DC pick up their first win after losing their opener. DC now travel to play Real Salt Lake, while Toronto will visit David Beckham and the L.A. Galaxy.

Screen legend and conservative icon &lt;a href="w%3ACharlton%20Heston"&gt;Charlton Heston&lt;/a&gt;, twice winner of an &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; during his 50 year film career, died Saturday, April 5 in &lt;a href="w%3ABeverly%20Hills%2C%20California"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

"To his loving friends, colleagues and fans, we appreciate your heartfelt prayers and support. Charlton Heston was seen by the world as larger than life. No one could ask for a fuller life than his. No man could have given more to his family, to his profession, and to his country. In his own words, 'I have lived such a wonderful life. I've lived enough for two people,'" said his family in a statement released to the press.

Heston starred in the 1959 film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABen-Hur%20%281959%20film%29"&gt;Ben Hur&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ which won 11 &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Awards"&gt;Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt;. He also starred in the 1968 film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Planet%20of%20The%20Apes%20%28film%29"&gt;The Planet of The Apes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Near the end of his life, he primarily did cameo roles, including two in the films ♡❤Tombstone♡❤ with Kurt Russell, and ♡❤True Lies♡❤ with Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

Heston's family did not state the cause of death, but in 2002, he revealed that he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Heston was 84.

In his early career, Heston spoke out against racism and was active in the civil rights movement. He played in films such as &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Omega%20Man"&gt;♡❤The Omega Man♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASoylent%20Green"&gt;♡❤Soylent Green♡❤&lt;/a&gt; (which ends with Heston saying "♡❤Soylent Green is people!♡❤"), which contain a strong environmental message.

Heston was also president of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Rifle%20Association"&gt;National Rifle Association&lt;/a&gt; from 1998 to 2003. In 2000, he declared at the NRA convention that Presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; could only take away his &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Second Amendment&lt;/a&gt; rights "From my cold, dead hands," raising a presentation rifle over his head.

&lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Ferrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AF%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula%20One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Bahrain%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Air"&gt;Gulf Air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABahrain%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Bahrain Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ABahrain%20International%20Circuit"&gt;Bahrain International Circuit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASakhir"&gt;Sakhir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;. Massa was also &lt;a href="Felipe%20Massa%20wins%202007%20Bahrain%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;the previous year winner&lt;/a&gt;. His Ferrari teammate, driver &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt;, ran second after a good start from fourth place on the grid.

&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; failed his start. During the race Hamilton unsuccessfully attacked his former teammate &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; (now again a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; driver), resulting in him losing his front wing, and dropping to last place. He eventually finished a lowly 13th place.

&lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Pole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; became the highlight of the weekend by winning the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APole%20position"&gt;pole&lt;/a&gt;, but was slow off the start and finished third on the podium. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt; teammate finished fourth. The results puts BMW as the new leader of the Constructors' championship, one point ahead of Scuderia Ferrari.

&lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; came fifth and became the only McLaren driver to finish in the points. &lt;a href="w%3AJarno%20Trulli"&gt;Jarno Trulli&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AToyota%20F1"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMark%20Webber"&gt;Mark Webber&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt;-Renault) ran 6 and 7 places respectively with &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANico%20Rosberg"&gt;Nico Rosberg&lt;/a&gt; (Williams-Toyota) closing out the top eight with 1 point.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATimo%20Glock"&gt;Timo Glock&lt;/a&gt; (Toyota) was engaged in a hard battle with &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; (Renault) and came 9th ahead of the Spanish 2005 F1 Champion.

Around 25 arrests have been made by &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; officers, during the 31 mile &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Torch"&gt;Olympic Torch&lt;/a&gt; relay in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

The torch relay began at &lt;a href="w%3AWembley%20Stadium"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt; where protesters waved flags and chanted as the torch started on its route. Protests then became more dramatic, as demonstrators attempted to extinguish the flame using a fire extinguisher, and grab the torch from the hands of TV presenter &lt;a href="w%3AKonnie%20Huq"&gt;Konnie Huq&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALadbroke%20Grove"&gt;Ladbroke Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Both of the attempts were unsuccessful, and were prevented by police officers and members of the torch's security team.

The torch continued its route, surrounded by more than twenty security officers, to be seen by hundreds of spectators, and also continued verbal protests by groups highlighting the human rights issues in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. There were also pro-China protesters present chanting slogans. It is believed that around 20 - 25 arrests have been made throughout the course of the day.

The route ends at the &lt;a href="w%3AO2%20Arena"&gt;O2 Arena&lt;/a&gt; after being carried by around 80 athletes, dignitaries and entertainers, including five time Olympic gold medal winner &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Steve%20Redgrave"&gt;Sir Steve Redgrave&lt;/a&gt;.

Five years after its launch, &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; downloadable music service in February passed &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; to become the No. 1 music seller in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, according to figures released April 3 by &lt;a href="w%3ANPD%20Group"&gt;NPD Group&lt;/a&gt;, a market research firm.

The firm said more than 4 billion songs had been downloaded from the iTunes store since its launch in 2003 and that as of February, the iTunes store accounts for 70% of all digital music sales. NPD said according to those figures, Apple's iTunes store passes U.S. electronics retailer &lt;a href="w%3ABest%20Buy"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for the No. 2 U.S. music retailer in 2007.

According to an April 2nd report in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AArs%20Technica"&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, an internal memo at Apple showed the company passed Wal-Mart as the top U.S. music seller Wal-Mart at the beginning of the year. Their projections showed that as of January 2008, Apple's iTunes held 19 percent of the U.S. music market with Wal-Mart at 15 percent, followed by Best Buy at 13 percent. Rounding out the top five were &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATarget%20Corporation"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; at 6 percent each.

Although the letter does not mention specific legal threats, the letter asks that ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ "preserve any and all documents pertaining to this matter and this customer, including, but not limited to, logs, data entry sheets, applications -- electronic or otherwise, registration forms, billings statements or invoices, computer print-outs, disks, hard drives, etc."

Despite the letter, ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ states it will not comply with the "abusive request" by the Church.

"Wikileaks will not comply with legally abusive requests from Scientology any more than Wikileaks has complied with similar demands from Swiss banks, Russian off-shore stem cell centers, former African Kleptocrats, or the Pentagon. Wikileaks will remain a place where people of the world may safely expose injustice and corruption," stated ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ in a release on its website.

♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ further states that, "in response to the attempted suppression, Wikileaks will release several thousand additional pages of Scientology material next week."

Cardiff will return to Wembley next month to play Portsmouth in the FA Cup final after defeating Barnsley on Sunday. Both teams defeated Premier League opposition to get to this stage, with Cardiff defeating Middlesbrough and Barnsley toppling London giants Chelsea. The teams continued their positive play in this match, but only a single goal was scored in the game.

It was Joe Ledley who opened the game up early with his well aimed volley. Cardiff pressurized the Barnsley goal early, and just as Robert Kozluk cleared the ball away with his head, Ledley connected with his left foot to float the ball over Luke Steele and give Cardiff the lead. The goal lit a fire under Barnsley and Stephen Foster could have equalized within minutes, but his header flew just wide. The game was played end to end for much of the first half, with Cardiff providing more of the games cutting edge.

In the second half the game continued to be played open. Ledley had a strong run down the sidelines for Cardiff, but Rae's header from the resulting cross was sent directly into Steele's arms. Kayode Odejayi then missed a glorious chance for Barnsley to draw level in the 66th minute. The Nigerian striker found himself one-on-one with Cardiff keeper Peter Enckelman, but Odejayi's shot went wide, rippling the side netting. Barnsley continued to push for the equalizer, but couldn't find the quality they had to take out Chelsea and Liverpool in previous rounds. 

The appearance in the final is Cardiff's first since 1927 when they defeated Arsenal 1-0 and brought the FA Cup to Wales. The Bluebirds will look to take the trophy out of England for only the second time in history through 127 finals. Portsmouth and Cardiff will face off in the final on May 17th at Wembley.

Davyenko commented on his performance after the match. He said that his "tennis was so good today. I think it's the best tennis of the hard-court season." He continued, "Here Nadal was favourite, and also in semi-final Roddick was the favorite. Just to beat two guys in two sets is like amazing for me." 

Nadal also commented on his performance. "I think he [Davydenko] played at a good level. He played a good match, but I didn't play well today." He continued, "So when you don't play at 100% at this level against top players, it's tough to win, especially on a hard surface. So I congratulate him more because he played better than me."

Today, the &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20torch"&gt;Olympic torch&lt;/a&gt; went out three times while traveling through &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. Olympic officials claim that this came as a result of actions by Pro-Tibetan protesters. It has been reported that the torch was extinguished, then put on a bus to keep it safe. The torch was extinguished one time by a Chinese official when the torch was in the hands of &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Douillet"&gt;David Douillet&lt;/a&gt;, and one time due to technical problems. 
&lt;a href="w%3ASylvain%20Garel"&gt;Sylvain Garel&lt;/a&gt;, of the Green Party and member of the Paris City Council tried to catch the torch from bearer &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Diagana"&gt;Stephane Diagana&lt;/a&gt;'s hands.

A ceremony on City Hall Plaza was canceled, "by Chinese officials" according to Paris' mayor &lt;a href="w%3ABertrand%20Delano%C3%AB"&gt;Bertrand Delanoë&lt;/a&gt;. A banner with "Paris defends human rights around the world" was installed on the City Hall.
&lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, head of the protest in France, put a banner on the &lt;a href="w%3AEiffel%20Tower"&gt;Eiffel Tower&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="w%3ANotre-Dame%20de%20Paris"&gt;Notre-Dame de Paris&lt;/a&gt; by its Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20M%C3%A9nard"&gt;Robert Ménard&lt;/a&gt;.

This action comes soon after the official news agency of &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; described the actions by the protesters as "vile misdeeds". A spokesman for Beijing 2008 said “the torch represents the Olympic spirit and people welcome the torch.” 

A spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; said that the IOC is concerned about the situation in &lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;, although they do not encourage people to disrupt the ceremonies. The spokesperson said "The International Olympic Committee has expressed its serious concern and calls for a rapid peaceful resolution in Tibet." He did, however, say that the style of protesting was "not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the Olympic Games". 

The BBC has reported that 500 protesters were present in Paris today. Yesterday, protesters tried to grab and extinguish the torch in London, without success.
The events were not broadcast live, as a Chinese Committee demanded to screen the footage prior to broadcast.

The jury of the inquest into the death of &lt;a href="w%3APrincess%20Diana"&gt;Princess Diana&lt;/a&gt; has returned a majority verdict, by 9 to 2, saying that the Princess was unlawfully killed through "grossly negligent driving" or "gross negligence manslaughter" on the part of &lt;a href="w%3AHenri%20Paul"&gt;Henri Paul&lt;/a&gt; who was driving and the &lt;a href="w%3Apaparazzi"&gt;paparazzi&lt;/a&gt; who were following the Mercedes before it crashed.

The jury also specified that &lt;a href="w%3AHenri%20Paul"&gt;Henri Paul&lt;/a&gt;'s driving, and the fact that all the passengers were not wearing seat belts, were also contributing causes to their deaths, additionally returning the same verdict for &lt;a href="w%3ADodi%20Al%20Fayed"&gt;Dodi Al Fayed&lt;/a&gt;.

The jury was sent to make its decision on Wednesday, April 2, after Coroner &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Justice%20Scott%20Baker"&gt;Lord Justice Scott Baker&lt;/a&gt; told them a majority of 9 was acceptable and that for a decision of unlawful killing to be delivered, then they must be sure beyond any reasonable doubt that the deaths were caused by recklessness.

Dodi Al Fayed's father, &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Al%20Fayed"&gt;Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;, said that he would not accept the verdict delivered.

The verdict ends the 6 month investigation into the Princess' death, 10 years after her Mercedes crashed into a pillar in the &lt;a href="w%3APont%20d%27Alma"&gt;Pont d'Alma&lt;/a&gt; road tunnel in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, on August 31, 1997.

<h1>401 children from Texas sect compound taken into custody</h1>

133 women and 401 allegedly abused children have been taken into state custody after officials received a call from a distressed 16-year-old girl. The children were found in a 1700-acre compound belonging to the &lt;a href="w%3AFundamentalist%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-Day%20Saints"&gt;Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints&lt;/a&gt; during a raid which started on Saturday. Children as young as 6 months have been removed from the compound.

The 16-year-old girl called in saying that she had been abused and forced to marry a 50 year old man. The girl also said that in the compound &amp;ndash; which included a medical facility, a cheese-making plant, a cement plant, a school, numerous large housing units, and a white limestone temple &amp;ndash; some females as young as 14 and 15 were already mothers. The girl has not yet been identified.

The women leaving the compound were wearing home sewn, ankle-length dresses and were said to have been kept in isolation from the outside world.

A spokesperson affiliated with the &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Department%20of%20Public%20Safety"&gt;Texas Department of Public Safety&lt;/a&gt; has said that so far, one person has been arrested for "interfering with the duties of a public servant." She also told reporters that "an unknown number of men remain on the compound and are not free to leave."

The children will be assigned attorneys and the case hearing will be held next week. Meanwhile, the children will be staying in temporary shelters, which officials say are filling up fast.

Police had been monitoring the compound ever since it was bought by the sect one year ago.

The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a polygamist sect led by &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Jeffs"&gt;Warren Jeffs&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; jailed last year for the rape and forced marriage of a 14 year old girl &amp;ndash; is a breakaway branch of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt;, which abandoned the practice of polygamy in 1890.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikinews%20interviews%20Brooks%20Lindsay%2C%20founder%20of%20Debatepedia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A reporter from ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ recently interviewed Brooks Lindsay, who is the founder of the online wiki &lt;a href="w%3ADebatepedia"&gt;Debatepedia&lt;/a&gt;, which claims to be the '&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; of Debates.' 

Brooks told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that "Debatepedia is a non-profit, free wiki encyclopedia of debates, pro and con arguments, and supporting evidence and quotes from scholars, experts, and op-ed writers (those figures that are actively engaged in these public debates)." He continued with "some people have called it the 'Wikipedia of debate', which is a pretty accurate description of what we are trying to do."

He finished by stating that the site is "trying to cover all of the pro and con arguments in any public debate, on any topic from a global to a local level, from any region in the world, and hopefully, in the future, in any language. The objective is to frame debates in a pro/con structure - when they appropriately belong in a pro/con structure - so that people can effectively "weigh" the "sides" in a debate, deliberate, draw conclusions, and take a stand. "

The second question asked why he founded Debatepedia. He replied by saying that "With arguments, evidence, and quotes being scattered across the Internet, it is currently too difficult for citizens to view all the pros and cons, quotes, and supporting evidence in debates, deliberate and take a stand. We are trying to fill this void, on a global scale, and by open-sourcing the effort over &lt;a href="w%3AMediaWiki"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt; software."

When asked how Debatepedia will develop in the future Brooks said that he expects "the community of editors to grow to a much greater extent." He also said that he hoped to be able to "clean up some of the software elements," of the site.

When questioned about the importance of Debatepedia, Mr. Lindsay said that "Debatepedia is important for the reader and citizen as a tool to deliberate more effectively, develop greater conviction in what is righteous and what is not, and to generally increase citizen-engagement in debates, issues, and advocacy, across the world. For the writer, it is a way to have a greater voice and impact on other people, and other people's thinking; it's a great public service to help edit on Debatepedia, like on Wikipedia. Finally, there is the potential that Debatepedia will be used by leaders and representatives as a way to deliberate through a topic that they have to vote on, or as a destination to direct constituents to deliberate." He said it was "perhaps a lofty goal, but real nevertheless."

In General Petraeus' opening statement he said, "I recommended to my chain of command that we continue the drawdown of the surge combat forces and that, upon the withdrawal of the last surge brigade combat team in July, we undertake a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation."

General Petraeus further told the Senators that the security gains that have been made in Iraq are "fragile and reversible". He said that &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; is supporting the insurgents.

Ambassador Crocker spoke about the recent fighting that took place in southern Iraq, centered around Basra. "Taken as a snapshot, with scenes of increasing violence, and masked gunmen in the streets, it is hard to see how this situation supports a narrative of progress in Iraq," he said.

"There is still very much to be done to bring full government control to the streets of Basra and eliminate entrenched extremist, criminal, and militia groups. When viewed with a broader lens, the Iraqi decision to combat these groups in Basra has major significance," said Crocker.

The ambassador also shed light on base negotiations between the US and Iraq. "The agreement will not establish permanent bases in Iraq, and we anticipate that it will expressly foreswear them," Crocker said. "The agreement will not specify troop levels, and it will not tie the hands of the next administration."

Committee chairperson &lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Levin"&gt;Carl Levin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, criticized &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Prime Minister of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Nouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the government of Iraq was at risk due to "incompetence and the excessively sectarian leadership."

Senators &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, the ranking member of the committee, and &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, committee member, are expected to question Petraeus and Crocker. &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, Illinois, will get his chance when Petraeus and Crocker testify before the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations"&gt;United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations&lt;/a&gt; later today at 2:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-5"&gt;UTC-5&lt;/a&gt;).

Together the three make up the remaining major party candidates in the &lt;a href="2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.

The proceedings, which are open to the public, were interrupted by protestors on more than one occasion. "Bring them home!" yelled one of them as he was escorted out of the room.

The jury of the inquest into the death of Princess Diana has returned a majority verdict, by 9 to 2, saying that the Princess was unlawfully killed through "grossly negligent driving" or "gross negligence manslaughter" on the part of Henri Paul who was driving and the paparazzi who were following the Mercedes before it crashed.

The jury also specified that Henri Paul's driving, and the fact that all the passengers were not wearing seat belts, were also contributing causes to their deaths, additionally returning the same verdict for Dodi Al Fayed.

<h3>&lt;a href="401%20children%20from%20Texas%20sect%20compound%20taken%20into%20custody"&gt;401 children from Texas sect compound taken into custody&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
133 women and 401 allegedly abused children have been taken into state custody after officials received a call from a distressed 16-year-old girl in Eldorado, Texas. The children were found in a 1700-acre compound belonging to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints during a raid which started on Saturday. Children as young as 6 months have been removed from the compound.

The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a polygamist sect founded by Warren Jeffs – jailed last year for the rape and forced marriage of a 14 year old girl – is a breakaway branch of the Mormon Church, which abandoned the practice of polygamy in 1890. The church believes that men need a minimum of three wives in order to ascend to heaven.

United States General David Petraeus, the Commanding General of the Multi-National Force - Iraq (MNF-I), and Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker, testified today before the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services on the security and political conditions in Iraq.

In General Petraeus' opening statement he said, "I recommended to my chain of command that we continue the drawdown of the surge combat forces and that, upon the withdrawal of the last surge brigade combat team in July, we undertake a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation."

Ambassador Crocker spoke about the recent fighting that took place in southern Iraq, centered around Basra. "Taken as a snapshot, with scenes of increasing violence, and masked gunmen in the streets, it is hard to see how this situation supports a narrative of progress in Iraq," he said.

Committee chairperson Carl Levin, Michigan, criticized Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki, saying that the government of Iraq was at risk due to "incompetence and the excessively sectarian leadership."

English sides Liverpool and Chelsea will face off in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals after both teams won their second leg matches on Tuesday. Chelsea were defeated 2-1 in their first leg by Turkish side Fenerbahçe and needed a win to advance, while Liverpool had tied fellow English side Arsenal 1-1 in their first leg.

<h2>Results</h2>
<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; 4 - 2 &lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Liverpool came back from an early deficit to defeat Arsenal 4-2 at Anfield. It was Abou Diaby who opened the scoring for Arsenal in the 13th minute after he picked up a ball by Hleb, powered into the area, and blasted the ball past Pepe Reina. Arsenal played well and kept the pressure on the home side, but they could not stop Hyypia from equalizing in the 30th. Gerrard's corner made its way to the veteran and he powered his header in off the post. Fernando Torres put Liverpool in the lead after the break after Crouch flicked the ball on, and the Spanish International turned Senderos before firing into the top corner. Liverpool took control of the game, but Arsenal caught them out on the counter-attack as Walcott made a run from his own half before cutting the ball back to Adebayor, who finished cleanly. With Arsenal in position to advance, Liverpool surged forward instantly after the restart. Ryan Babel was brought down in the Arsenal area by Kolo Toure, and referee Peter Frojdfeldt pointed to the spot. Liverpool captain stepped up and slammed the ball high into the net past Almunia. Arsenal was then caught out as they pressed for the equalizer, and the ball fell to Babel. The Dutchman outpaced Fabregas and struck a glorious drive past Almunia to wrap up Liverpool's spot in the next round.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; 2 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3AFenerbah%C3%A7e%20S.K."&gt;Fenerbahçe&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Chelsea joined Liverpool in the semi's for the third time in four years with a nervy 2-0 victory over Fenerbahçe. Chelsea pushed to pull even on aggregate early, and it only took them four minutes to grab the lead. A free kick from Frank Lampard found its way to Michael Ballack, and the German captain made no mistake as he headed it into the far side of the net. Joe Cole came close to soubling the home sides advantage soon after, but he saw his effort come back off the post from Kalou's cross. Chelsea keeper Carlo Cudicini had to be subbed off in the 25th minute, and the Portuguese Hilario came on as his replacement. The Turkish side took advantage of the change and should have equalized through Lugano, but he could not direct his free header on target. The game was played openly from then on, with both teams having their fair share of chances, until finally Frank Lampard put the game out of reach in the 87th minute. Michael Essien's cross was turned into the net by Frank Lampard, giving Chelsea a 3-2 win on aggregate.

♡❤♡Semi-finals are to be played April 23rd and 30th♡❤♡

The &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Flame"&gt;Olympic torch relay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, began today at 1:00 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-7"&gt;UTC-7&lt;/a&gt;). It was the only stop for the torch in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, as it makes its way around the world to &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2008 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.

The route for the torch was materially altered as protesters filled the streets along the planned route. The route, which was originally 10 kilometres long, was shortened by nearly half, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Police%20Department"&gt;San Francisco Police Department&lt;/a&gt;. In hopes that all eighty of the scheduled torch carriers would get a chance to carry the torch, the carriers ran in pairs.

The first torch carrier ran as scheduled, but then carried it into a warehouse, from which a motorcycle was observed leaving. The torch was then spotted again on a major street nearly two miles off course.

The rerouting was carefully planned, according to San Francisco Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AGavin%20Newsom"&gt;Gavin Newsom&lt;/a&gt;, who told ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, that it was because of "a disproportionate concentration of people in and around the start of the relay."

The closing ceremonies were held at &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20International%20Airport"&gt;San Francisco International Airport&lt;/a&gt; instead of the planned waterfront location at &lt;a href="w%3AAT%26amp%3BT%20Park"&gt;AT&amp;T Park&lt;/a&gt;.

Matt Helmenstine, 30, a California high school teacher carrying a Tibetan flag told Reuters: "I think it's cowardly. If they can't run the torch through the city, it means that no one is supporting the games."

"This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for us to see the torch," said Nancy Chan, a local resident, to the ♡❤San Francisco Chronicle♡❤. "There is a lot of politics around it, but that is the great thing about America - the free speech." She and her 4-year-old son ran to the new route when it was announced.
At least one protester was arrested, Xiao Tan, 32, of Chinese origin, who tried to unfurl a Tibetan flag. "I'm proud to be Chinese, but I don't like what's happening in Tibet," he told AFP. The ♡❤Vancouver Sun♡❤ reported a number of arrests, but says that violence is limited.

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Ueberroth"&gt;Peter Ueberroth&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;United States Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt;, said that the right balance had been reached, between preserving freedom of speech for protesters, while still providing an exhilarating experience for torchbearers, as well as preventing a repeat of the chaotic demonstrations that accompanied the torch in London and Paris.

Already Tuesday evening, hundreds paraded with Tibetan flags while chanting "Shame on China". On Monday, protesters hung banners from the &lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20Gate%20Bridge"&gt;Golden Gate Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. As the torch went to &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, the torch relay was subject to large scale protests in both cities.

Tight security was planned in advance. Airspace restrictions have been put in place and over 700 security personnel are expected to be deployed including &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; agents. Police leave was cancelled. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; patrolled the part of the route that was to take the torch along the waterfront at &lt;a href="w%3AFisherman%27s%20Wharf%2C%20San%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;Fisherman's Wharf&lt;/a&gt;.

"We are trying to accomplish two goals here. One is to protect the right to free speech and the other is to ensure public safety, and here in San Francisco we are good at both of those things," said Nathan Ballard about the security. Ballard is a spokesperson for San Francisco Mayor's office.

"I am saddened that such a beautiful symbol of the torch, which unites people of different religions, different ethnic origin, different political systems, cultures and languages, has been attacked," said &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Rogge"&gt;Jacques Rogge&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt;, to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing%20Organizing%20Committee"&gt;Beijing Organizing Committee&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement on Monday: "We strongly condemn the actions of the few 'pro-Tibet independence' activists who have attempted to sabotage the Olympic Torch Relay. The Olympic flame belongs to the world and these actions are a serious violation of the Olympic spirit. They are bound to fail and will surely arouse the resentment of peace-loving people who support the Olympic Games."

&lt;a href="w%3AFlickr"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, the online &lt;a href="w%3Aphoto%20sharing"&gt;photo sharing&lt;/a&gt; service owned by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; internet company &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;, today launched a new &lt;a href="w%3Avideo"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;-sharing service for "Pro" users. After 4 months of waiting since an unofficial "coming soon" on the Flickr forums, &lt;a href="w%3Asubscriber"&gt;subscriber&lt;/a&gt;s to the service are now able to upload videos of up to 90 seconds in length, or 150 &lt;a href="w%3Amegabyte"&gt;MB&lt;/a&gt; in size.

After some criticism over the website diversifying too much, Flickr Community Manager Heather Champ, and Yahoo! spokesperson George Hadjigeorgiou responded by calling these 90-second videos "long photos", which capture a "slice of life to share".

Mr. Hadjigeorgiou elaborated, by saying that "digital media has led to new behaviour with digital photography fans and we've seen a huge growth in people taking short video clips, essentially 'long photos', with their digital still cameras and mobile phones." He added that he could see "a great resonance between this new category of content and with the kind of authentic, personal moments already being shared on Flickr."

"Pro" users, who pay a yearly subscription of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;24.95 for unlimited file uploads, have also had their filesize limit increased to 20 MB for each individual photo, and other members, who do not pay a subscription, have had their limit raised to 10 MB per photo. "Free" members are currently unable to upload videos.

&lt;a href="w%3AHawaii%20Volcanoes%20National%20Park"&gt;Hawaii Volcanoes National Park&lt;/a&gt; remains closed today after high levels of &lt;a href="w%3Asulfur%20dioxide"&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt; vented from &lt;a href="w%3AKilauea"&gt;Kilauea&lt;/a&gt;. Continuing southeastern winds will exist through most of the day, causing much of the contamination to exist elsewhere on the &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii%20%28island%29"&gt;Big Island&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition to the park, the &lt;a href="w%3AVolcano%20House"&gt;Volcano House&lt;/a&gt; hotel and &lt;a href="w%3AKilauea%20Military%20Camp"&gt;Kilauea Military Camp&lt;/a&gt; remain evacuated. &lt;a href="w%3AVolcano%20Charter%20School"&gt;Volcano Charter School&lt;/a&gt; remains closed for a second day.

Sulfur dioxide can cause irritation to the nose, eyes, throat, and &lt;a href="w%3Arespiratory%20tract"&gt;respiratory tract&lt;/a&gt;. Residents in the area are recommended to avoid smoking, stay indoors, and drink plenty of fluids, among other suggestions. Residents living northeast of the volcano should be prepared to evacuate, mainly those living in Mauna Loa Estates, Ohia Estates, Volcano Village, the Keauhou Ranch area and the Volcano Golf Course region.

Trade winds on Thursday may return the conditions to normal. However, people in the region should remain prepared to evacuate if necessary.

Manchester United and Barcelona will face off in the Champions League semi-finals after both teams won their quarterfinal matches. Both sides came into their second legs having won their away legs, Barcelona having defeated Schalke 04 1-0 in Germany, and United coming out of Italy with a 2-0 decision. 

<h2>Results</h2>
<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Barcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Schalke%2004"&gt;Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Catalan giants Barcelona defeated Schalke 04 by a scored of 1-0 for the second consecutive game to secure their spot in the Champions League semi-finals. Both sides fielded full strength sides with Henry, Krcik and Eto'o in attack for Barca, and Altintop and Kuranyi as the Schalke strikers. 

The home side could have gone ahead early as Krikic received the ball from Eto'o, but the youngster mis-controlled and after a series of rebounds the balled was volleyed over by Xavi. Schalke pressed to tie the series on aggregate and Gerald Asamoah drove a shot just wide before Halil Altintop's effort was saved by Victor Valdes. Xavi had the next chance for Barca put his low shot was saved well by Manuel Neuer. Kuranyi should have scored the opener in the 21st but blazed his point blank shot wide. Barca went ahead in the 43rd minute on a bizarre goal from Yaya Toure. Toure released Krkic on the right, and his cross was headed high by Marcelo Bordon in defense. The looping ball had to be headed off the line by Mladen Krstajic but it fell to Toure, who scuffed his shot past Neuer. Barcelona had several chances to double their lead from Henry, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9s%20Iniesta"&gt;Iniesta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and substitute Giovani Dos Santos, but none could solve Neuer. Schalke pushed but couldn't produce anything too threatening and Bercelona held on until the final whistle.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United%20F.C."&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; 1 - 0 &lt;a href="w%3AA.S.%20Roma"&gt;Roma&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Coming into the match with a two goal aggregate advantage, Sir Alex Ferguson opted to play a side devoid of several big names, leaving Rooney, Ronaldo, Scholes and Neville all on the bench. Meanwhile Roma were again without talisman captain Francesco Totti, and Vucinic was paired with Mancini in his stead. 

United started strongly, looking to put the tie out of reach. Chances from Park and Tevez were sent wide before Roma keeper Doni was forced to make two good saves. The first was from Hargreaves as he was sent in all alone by Giggs, but Doni saved with his feet. Positions were then reversed as Giggs latched onto a cross by Hargreaves, but Doni again did well as he sprinted across his goal-line and made the save. Just as United was getting closer, Roma's Mancini won a penalty as he was adjudged to be brought down by Brown, however replays showed the striker performed a blatant dive. Daniele De Rossi, who scored from the spot in Serie A on the weekend, stepped up and blazed the ball over the net, coming nowhere close to the goal. Roma then started to press, and had several good chances including a header from Juan and a shot by Mancini, but the Italians were unable to break down the United defence or Edwin van der Sar.

It was Roma who came out strongly in the second half with a couple early chances. Vucinic took a long range shot which van der Sar was unable to gather, but as Cassetti pushed to latch onto the spilled ball van der Sar finally gathered and wiped out the danger. Roma's next chance came from Taddei, but his shot was blocked by a charging Mikael Silvestre. United booked their place in the semi-finals in the 69th minute as Tevez supplied the ball to Hargreaves on the counter-attack, and the Argentine sprinted into the area and dove to head the return cross past Doni. United nearly doubled their lead through Park as he was sent clear on goal but Doni charged out and the South-Koreans effort ballooned over onto the top netting. The final whistle blew and United celebrated their semi-final berth, as they will now travel to the Camp Nou to take on Barcelona.

♡❤♡Semi-finals are to be played April 23rd and 30th♡❤♡

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20nears%20US%20in%20cyber-crime%2C%20ahead%20of%20Nigeria%2C%20Romania&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; is listed second in a report on global &lt;a href="w%3ACyber-crime"&gt;cyber-crime&lt;/a&gt; statistics, behind the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and ahead of cyber-crime "hotspots" &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. The ♡❤2007 Internet Crime Report♡❤ was released in April by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Crime%20Complaint%20Center"&gt;Internet Crime Complaint Center&lt;/a&gt; (IC3), a joint operation between the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20White%20Collar%20Crime%20Center"&gt;National White Collar Crime Center&lt;/a&gt;. 

Americans reported losses of &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;240 million from global cyber-crime in 2007, a $40 million increase from 2006. The Internet Crime Complaint Center received 206,884 complaints of online fraud in 2007, a decrease from the previous year's 207,492 complaints. 

FBI special agent John Hambrick, in charge of the IC3 unit, told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ "We're seeing more schemes involving bigger ticket items, get-rich-quick and work-at-home schemes that involve higher dollar losses". As the report only includes figures from crimes reported to law enforcement, it is likely that real crime numbers were higher.
FBI Cyber Division Assistant Director James E. Finch commented on the report: "The Internet presents a wealth of opportunity for would be criminals to prey on unsuspecting victims, and this report shows how extensive these types of crime have become ... What this report does not show is how often this type of activity goes unreported. Filing a complaint through IC3 is the best way to alert law enforcement authorities of Internet crime."

In response to the report's release, the &lt;a href="w%3Ainformation%20technology"&gt;information technology&lt;/a&gt; consultancy &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Secure%20Systems"&gt;Global Secure Systems&lt;/a&gt; (GSS) warned that the United Kingdom is becoming a hotbed of internet crime. According to the report, the UK accounts for 15.3 per cent of online crime from US crime reports. "This is significantly ahead of other cyber-crime hotspots such as Nigeria (5.7 per cent) and Romania (1.5 per cent)," said David Hobson, managing director of GSS, in an interview with ♡❤vnunet.com♡❤.
The ♡❤2007 Internet Crime Report♡❤ cites the top ten countries by amount of perpetrators of online crime. In descending order, the top ten list includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, Romania, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;. Scammers living within the United States most often lived in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Men lost more money to online fraud than women in 2007, and also accounted for 75 percent of cyber-crime perpetrators.

FBI spokeswoman Cathy Milhoan told ♡❤CIO Today♡❤ that online scammers attempt to take advantage of the good will of individuals, asking for money for purported charities during crises. "The scammer tries to prey on victims who are kind of in tune with what's going on in the world. The scam changes, but ultimately they're preying on the good will of people," said Milhoan.

The most widely reported complaint was Internet auction fraud at 35.7 per cent of referred crime complaints. Other online criminal activities cited in the report include non-delivery of purchases and credit/debit card fraud, computer intrusions, spam/unsolicited e-mail, and child pornography. The report also seeks to raise awareness of other types of cyber-crimes, and describes steps individuals can take both to prevent internet crime, and to report it if they have been victimized.

This week saw the &lt;a href="w%3AMain%20Page"&gt;English-language version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the collaboratively written online encyclopedia, reach 2,000 featured articles with the inclusion of the article ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Se%C3%B1or%20Presidente"&gt;El Señor Presidente&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AFeatured%20articles"&gt;Featured articles&lt;/a&gt; (FAs) meet Wikipedia's highest standards for quality, accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style, and thus are considered the best articles on Wikipedia. 

The Wikipedia team that carries out the assessment and quality control before conferring the status of featured articles promoted five articles to FA status at the same time: ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWalter%20de%20Coventre"&gt;Walter de Coventre&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMaximian"&gt;Maximian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤El Señor Presidente♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALord%20of%20the%20Universe"&gt;Lord of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARed-billed%20Chough"&gt;Red-billed Chough&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. With five promoted at the same time, conferring the status of 2,000th on one is an arbitrary decision and in some respects any of these articles could actually make a claim to the honour.

The article ♡❤El Señor Presidente♡❤ was created and developed by a &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20British%20Columbia"&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; class, "♡❤♡Murder, Madness, and Mayhem: Latin American Literature in Translation♡❤♡". While an important milestone, the 2,000th featured article is also symbolic of Wikipedia's growing role in the 21st century learning arena. 

The professor of the class, Jon Beasley-Murray, began using Wikipedia as a collaborative space where his students could both do coursework and provide a type of virtual public service. Thus, he created a Wikipedia project, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AWikiProject%20Murder%20Madness%20and%20Mayhem"&gt;Murder Madness and Mayhem&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, that focussed on creating articles relating to the Latin American literature covered in his class. Not surprisingly, ♡❤El Señor Presidente♡❤ is considered one of the most important books in Latin American literature, written by Nobel Prize-winning &lt;a href="Guatemala"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;n writer, &lt;a href="w%3AMiguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Asturias"&gt;Miguel Ángel Asturias&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Wikinews team contacted Prof. Beasley-Murray, who agreed to be interviewed for this story. His responses can be found below. Included are sections soliciting responses from three students who took the class and helped create and bring ♡❤El Señor Presidente♡❤ to Feature Article status. Thus far the project has created seven good articles in addition to the 2,000th featured article.

<h3>Murder Madness and Mayhem</h3>
 Professor Beasley-Murray, thank you for giving us some of your valuable time and agreeing to talk to us. Can you give some background on what prompted you to start this project?

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤Prof. Jon Beasley-Murray♡❤♡♡❤: I should say first that I've written some reflections at the project on Wikipedia itself, as an essay I entitled &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AJbmurray/Madness"&gt;"Madness"&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Did you consult with fellow academics or students prior to launching this project?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: No, not really. Perhaps I should have! But off and on last summer I did discuss the idea with a friend who works in educational technology at UBC, who had helped me with the implementation of blogs in my courses. And this friend, &lt;a href="http%3A//careo.elearning.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/wiki.pl%3FBrian_Lamb"&gt;Brian Lamb&lt;/a&gt;, was as always very encouraging and supportive of this kind of experimentation. He looked into the possibility of helping me apply for a grant for the project, but it seems there aren't any for this kind of thing. I decided to go ahead anyway, essentially on my own.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I would assume the Wikipedia community was in favour of your project, did anyone outwith that community make notably critical comments about your idea?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: No, but then as I say I hardly talked to anyone about it!

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; How significant a percentage of the mark you were giving for the class came from Wikipedia contributions?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: Originally, the Wikipedia assignment was to have represented 30% of the total grade for the course. Just over half-way through the semester, progress had still been relatively slow, and I was getting worried. So I proposed to the class that we change the course assessment, and that we scrap the planned final essay or term paper. This would mean that the other elements (a mid-term, blogs and participation, and Wikipedia) would all come to be worth more. We talked about the proposal, and I gave them some time to think about it. We then had a secret ballot, and I said in advance that we would only go ahead with the change if two thirds (66%) were in favour. In the end, 85% of the class voted for increasing the significance of the Wikipedia project to 40% of the overall course grade.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; As a member of the Wikimedia Foundation's communications committee I (Brian McNeil) frequently see both sides of the conflict over how relevant or reliable Wikipedia is. This ranges from queries coming in from students working on their school paper who want a response to their librarian and teachers effectively banning use of Wikipedia, to the other extreme such as a recent case where a teaching surgeon in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; asking for permission to quote extensively from Wikipedia for a paper on the site's relevance and potential use for undergraduates in medicine. I have a stock answer detailing how to check Wikipedia sources; that Wikipedia is a great starting point for research, and that if you disallow Wikipedia you should disallow Britannica. Is this something you would agree with?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: Over the course of this semester, I've come up with a response of my own to this question. If a Wikipedia article is a good one, then you won't need to quote it, as it will have links to all the relevant sources. And if it doesn't have those links, then it isn't a good article, and shouldn't be quoted in any case.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Was the experience of using a wiki for collaboration something you would repeat? There have been suggestions for something you might call "EduWiki" for the collaborative development of course material. Would you get involved with something like that? Do you see potential for use of the MediaWiki software in other areas of education? Such a project could be hosted under Wikimedia Foundation projects such as Wikibooks or Wikiversity. Would you favour that over a closed project within academia where contributors' credentials could be verified?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: I'm not sure. As is perhaps already obvious, I'm horribly suspicious of almost anything that has "edu" in the title. And I say that with all due respect to my friends who are in "EduTech"--though I should add that they are often equally suspicious, if not more so! I've had a couple of other experiences with wikis, in relatively closed environments, and they weren't particularly successful. I think that was because there was never a critical mass. The one thing that Wikipedia really has going for it is critical mass. (Even then, of course, only a tiny fraction of the people who read Wikipedia ever edit it.)

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Would you describe your students as receptive to the idea of doing coursework where the general public could view their works in progress?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: I'd often asked students to write blogs in previous courses, which are also of course visible to the general public. But not too many people bump into such student blogs, except on rare occasions. Here, the point wasn't so much that the Wikipedia articles were public, but that they were editing one of the Internet's top ten sites. So one day I'd poked around and found out how many people had visited particular pages that we're editing. (I compiled and later updated these numbers &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AWikiProject_Murder_Madness_and_Mayhem%23Google_page_rank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) And the next class we played two little guessing games. One involved what percentage of Wikipedia's articles they thought were classified as "Good Articles"; they started at 30%, and it took them a while to get down to 0.15%. This was just after ♡❤El Señor Presidente♡❤ had made Good Article status, so it gave them a sense of the achievement, I think.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Did any students fail to fit in and find themselves unable to work with Wikipedia?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: Yes. There was a wide range of responses. Some were very enthusiastic. Others took a while to get into it. And there were a few who never really found themselves at home editing Wikipedia. I'm not sure of the reasons in each case. For some the technology stayed too intimidating, or rather (I suspect) they just didn't put in enough time to get past that first hurdle. As this was group work, however, some of the effects could be worrisome at times. So it's something I'd have to think over before trying a similar experiment again.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Do you feel that doing this part of the course in such a radically open way encouraged any of the students to work to a higher standard than the might otherwise have?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: Absolutely. No question of it. The most active students, at least, have helped produce articles of c. 4,000-8,000 words that are comprehensively researched, repeatedly revised, and with a meticulous attention to detail. The standard of every single article is far better than any term paper that they would have written otherwise. Of course, some students have been more actively engaged, and so have both learned more and been pushed more than others. But the constant reminders and questions from other Wikipedia editors, particularly the members of the FA-Team who have done much of the copy-editing, has forced them consistently to reflect upon what they are saying, how they are saying it, and what their sources are.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; In reflecting on the project, is there anything you would have done differently?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: There were aspects of the groupwork that didn't work out as they could have. And we did get off to a rather slow start: I'd have to think about how to remedy that. Moreover, once the project is over, the FA-Team and I (plus, of course, any students who are interested) plan to have a post-mortem on all aspects of the collaboration. So there are certainly things that could be improved. I know I've also learned a lot on this project, and next time would hope to benefit from what I've learned.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You've hit about 6,000 edits personally, have you caught the "wiki bug"? Will you keep editing?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: 7,000 now! I'll need to stop editing for a while once the project is over: it has been very time-consuming. But I plan to be back in the Fall.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; In light of the apparent success of your project what would you say to other academics to try and persuade them to try similar experiments?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: Absolutely. I don't want to come across as too much of a Wikipedia booster. I can understand exactly why many academics' engagement on the encyclopedia has proven to be disappointing or frustrating or worse. But I think that, especially if academics take some time to understand aspects of Wikipedia's culture, there are forms of engagement that can be very rewarding. We were rather fortunate to run into &lt;a href="w%3AWP%3AFAT"&gt;the FA-Team&lt;/a&gt;, a group of experienced Wikipedia editors that had recently been established in order to help others promote articles to Featured Article status. Their involvement has been an absolute Godsend. But I see no reason why something similar (or even unpredictably different, and perhaps better) might not emerge in other circumstances.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Before moving on to bringing your students into the discussion, I'd like to close with your thoughts on making this a regular part of the curriculum. Do you intend to do so? Do you feel other institutions should examine your project with a view to emulating it?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤JBM♡❤♡♡❤: I certainly intend to repeat the experiment. The one downside for an instructor is that, if it is to be done right, it is very labour-intensive. On the other hand, in terms of capital resources it is essentially free. My university (and many others) pays millions of dollars per year for site licences for educational software such as WebCT. That's a massive waste of money, as far as I'm concerned; though it's a lucrative racket for the people selling the software. It's also, I'd say, an abdication of an important aspect of the university's mission: to invest in the Commons. The trend in contemporary academia is too often towards privatization and enclosure. (Though I should note that there are valiant exceptions, and my former colleague &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Willinsky"&gt;John Willinsky&lt;/a&gt;'s work on open access is exemplary.) The more universities engage with Wikipedia, and the more they realize that they can do so without necessarily dropping the high standards of research and academic rigour that it is also their duty to safeguard, the more they benefit not only their own students, but also the public good.

</ul>
<h3>Good and Featured Articles</h3>

 In addition to the one featured article, seven made "Good Article" status. How much of an encouragement was that to those of you involved in the project?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤Monica Freudenreich♡❤♡♡❤: I honestly cannot speak for the rest of the class but I think that everyone involved was a little bit weary (Ed: wary?) of this project. None of us had ever embarked on this sort of thing in our undergraduate careers before and to say the least, were unsure of how this would all turn out. Being students, we are prone to leave things to the last minute and with this project that was definitely not a possibility. So, despite a slow start in general, I think the status most of the articles in our project achieved is really impressive and that is a huge encouragement in itself
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤Katy Konyk♡❤♡♡❤: I can't speak for the rest of the class but I think seeing so many articles achieve good status proved that he goal was very achievable. I think the only downside was that in class people are going to work at their own speeds so having others reach good article status, if you are not there yet, sometimes added to the pressure.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤Elyse Economides♡❤♡♡❤: I think it was a form of encouragement, but also made the task seem a bit daunting. It was exciting to see that so many of the groups could attain the goal of "Good Article" status at the end of four months, but it also spoke to the amount of time and effort needed to reach that point. Hopefully seeing their classmates achieve "Good Article" status encouraged the individual groups that the same achievement was also possible.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; How long were you involved with Wikipedia before you really felt Good or Featured was achievable?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: I created a user account in January, along with almost all of the class as it was the first time I realized that one could edit wikipedia. The page I believe was created, with the help of Dr. Beasley-Murray on January 15th. After we got a "speedy deletion" tag put on our page, I thought I should get some content up there to make sure that it wasn't deleted, as I have no idea how to create a page. So, we were involved with Wikipedia for about 3 months before we were put up for GA review and then it was just under 4 months when we were awarded the FA gold star. I do not think length of time with Wikipedia is important before achieving Good or Featured articles but rather quality of the content and willingness of other wikipedians to collaborate on the project. I relied on the more experienced Wikipedian users to let us know when Good or Featured Article status was achievable and create checklists for us to complete before getting to either stage.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤KK♡❤♡♡❤: When we were first presented with this assignment in the middle of January I admit we were very determined to get a featured article and I don't think I really realized how much overall work and reworking of the article would be required to attain that goal. In mid-February we spent a couple days trying to read every English source we could get our hands on and we were dumping the contents onto the page. It was at this time that others really started to take an interest by making suggestions and doing heaps of editing themselves. To be honest it felt a little overwhelming, realizing how strict Wikipedia rules are and all the editing we needed to do. While the extensive requirements were overwhelming at first they also made good and feature article status feel achievable because we were able to see exactly what we needed to do.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: Once Professor Beasley-Murray seriously encouraged us to start working on our articles, by assigning us to make one edit, large or small, to our article, creating an article on Wikipedia seemed slightly less intimidating, although it was still a huge endeavor. Most of the framework and information that carried through the editing process was formed during late February, and that's when the status of "Good Article" became more of a tangible goal. The input from outside contributors and Wikipedia experts also became quiet salient at this point, and it continued on through the entire process.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; If you could improve the guidelines for people wanting to take articles up to Featured status, what would you change?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤KK♡❤♡♡❤: I think the guidelines are fair and are what make Featured Articles such reliable sources. My only comment would be that the Manual of Style was extremely inaccessible to lay users, like myself and if there hadn't been professional editors who knew what they were doing I don't know if we could have gotten over that obstacle.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: Although I probably didn't work as closely with the guidelines as the other members of my group, from what I experienced, there are a fair amount of technical and professional level requirements that is appropriate for the commitment to continuity and reliability, but difficult for beginning users to understand and properly use. The guidelines are a necessary component of Wikipedia, and Wikipedia provides comprehensive resources to explain these tools. Perhaps the best way to feel confident in using the guidelines is to practice making use of them and look at other articles for examples.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Do you feel that having anything you did immediately viewable by anyone on the Internet encouraged you to aim for a higher standard than you might have with a more conventional paper that only the professor would see?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: Not really. I think what pushed us to achieve higher standards were the other wikipedian editors. They were constantly pushing us to find better references and to reference everything. In working towards GA and FA they set the bar incredibly high. Blogs and other internet sites such as Facebook are also readily viewable to anyone and they often have a very low standard, if any standard at all. So, I do not think that it was because the article and our work was being shown on the internet that we worked so hard at this project. The support of the other wikipedians along the way was critical for me to both keep working at it and to set the standard very high indeed.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤KK♡❤♡♡❤: I don't think that it was because our work would be immediately visible that we aimed for a higher standard. Personally, I think what allowed us to aim for a higher standard was the ability to receive feedback and continually rework the page, which is very unlike a paper where you only have the opportunity to submit it once and cannot fix the paper according to the comments. In this sense, Wikipedia was a much better learning tool than a paper, we were actually able to engage with the comments from other editors.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: I would almost say it has the opposite effect. While many users on Wikipedia are careful about the material they post, Wikipedia is a fairly anonymous resource, which means an individual's contributions may not be directly linked back to that person. Wikipedia is also constantly changing as editors come and go, so the information one contributes is never truly permanent. A paper is always directly linked to the individual and unlike Wikipedia, the information placed within it is permanent.
</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Do you believe that contributing something to a 'digital commons' gives you more of a sense of achievement than just turning in a term paper?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: Undoubtedly yes. This page will be read by countless people over the course of its existence. Because I have worked so hard writing and re-writing it, I am extremely proud of the finished result, I almost can't believe I helped write it when I look back over it. Term papers I have handed back end up in a binder than eventually sits under my bed and files sit on my computer unopened ever again. This Wikipedia page will be seen and likely used by others in the future. After all, I am quite confident that the references list is a comprehensive list of nearly everything published in English on the subject. Any student or person looking to read more about ♡❤El Senor Presidente♡❤ no longer has to look any further than our references list. Now that is something truly amazing!
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: Yes and no. While contributing to the creation of a "Featured Article" means disseminating that information to a virtually unlimited number of people, the creation of a term paper is also a feat in and of itself that requires a great deal of research and editing. It is true that within the forum of Wikipedia, an exponentially larger amount of people will see and recognize an individual's work, but it is equally impersonal. I find each to inspire a sense of achievement (and perhaps mixed with a sense of relief as well).

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Have you caught the "wiki bug"? Will you keep editing?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: I am not completely sure. I think Wikipedia is a great resource and I have a lot of admiration for all those out there that work to make Wikipedia a thorough and reliable resource but I don't know quite yet if I will keep editing. I would like to say yes but between two jobs and five courses right now I will have to stop or cut back until the semester ends. As for the summer, with three jobs and a couple classes, again I don't know how much time I will be able to dedicate to Wikipedia but I think as I read novels in my spare time or do research for future term papers, I will definitely add references and information about future subjects and topics I study. I do not think I will completely stop editing all together but I will undoubtedly have to cut back.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤KK♡❤♡♡❤: I don't know if I will keep editing, only because I now know the immense amount of work and research that is required to produce quality work. I have caught the 'wiki bug' in the sense that I have a lot more respect for other Good and Feature articles out there. While I may not be able to quote them in my papers I have learned that they are excellent resources and can lead me to other academic papers. Wikipedia will still be my first internet stop for an area that I know nothing about; if it can lead me to other sources than I know it is a good page.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: I think I will continue to edit, though most likely it will be in the form of minor edits, such as spelling and grammar errors, because that's my strongest area of interest. I think changing something on Wikipedia, no matter how minor it may be, gives the user a tiny sense of accomplishment.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Assuming Professor Beasley-Murray repeats this project in subsequent years, what advice would you give to students following in your footsteps and starting on Wikipedia?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: I would advise them to start early and start with doing research. Along with Wikipedia, we also had weekly reading responses to hand in. I would advise students to approach Wikipedia as something that is due weekly as well and recommend that they spend at least one hour editing Wikipedia each week or doing research on the topic. To begin, online journal databases work really well but the reality is that many articles published about novels are not online and so consulting the research librarian is an invaluable tool. I think I visited them three times for how to get the information I was looking for. And also, I would advise them not to be too overwhelmed by the process. The wikipedians set very high standards but those standards are achievable. Have faith that even as an undergraduate who is not majoring in English, you can make an incredible contribution and get real results from your hard work.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: I would also encourage them to begin their research early and get as much information onto the page as quickly as possible. It seems that the veteran and experienced Wikipedia editors and users gravitate towards pages that show substantial activity. I would also encourage them to pace themselves (something I should have practiced more) and look for guidance on other article pages and through other users. Finally, I would encourage them to contact their group members early on and form a plan for the research and editing.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Which would you describe as the harder 'marking authority'? Other professors where you've submitted conventional term papers, or the teams assessing Wikipedia contributions with a view to awarding Good or Featured status?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: No competition. Our Good Article review was extremely intense and I actually was very overwhelmed by it initially. After working through each bullet point though, I can now see why those suggestions for improvement were both necessary and important. The hard work most definitely did not stop after GA review. In fact, before GA review had even ended another editor went through the article for us, line by line and came up with an even longer list of needed improvements, and once we did that, another thorough copy-edit was done. At times I was very discouraged by the mountain or work in front of me and not entirely confident that I could fix the problem areas but with their continued support and help we did it. Professors on conventional term papers make a few comments and hand it back to you. In nearly four years of University, I have only had one professor hand back term papers and give students the option to revise, rework and re-write problematic areas in the essay. And personally, I find this process of re-writing, clarifying and improving prose to be extremely helpful. Over the course of the last few months I have learned so much about writing I cannot even express... and it shows. I have been a B+/A- student throughout my entire undergraduate career, and my last two papers have been A's! I think the grades speak for themselves.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤KK♡❤♡♡❤: Wikipedia was definitely more intense but I think it was probably a fairer process. I don't have a problem with someone being a tough critique when we have the opportunity to fix the problems. This is exactly what I enjoyed about the Wikipedia process and think this is what made it such a great learning tool.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: Wikipedia seems to hold more consistent and constant standards across the board, whereas professors can sometimes mark in an unexpected manner. However, in my experience with Wikipedia and my professors, each expect a high quality of work and challenge the contributor to create such work.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Was there significant input from other Wikipedians not taking your course? If so, was this valuable?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: In the beginning we were mostly on our own but as we grew more comfortable with how to edit on Wikipedia and started doing research on the subject, we found ourselves supported by a great number of other Wikipedians, complete strangers willing to help us on the ambitious goal of Feature Article. This help was extremely valuable, in fact I do not think that Feature Article would have been possible without their assistance and guidance along the way. I cannot thank each and everyone of them enough for looking out for us and pointing us in the right direction when we hit road bumps along the way.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: There was definitely significant input from other users on Wikipedia, even before our group neared the "Good Article" mark. One of the greatest components of Wikipedia is the sense of community that is cultivated among all the users. When they recognize an area of need, they are quick to offer aid and support.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; As a fairly open-ended question, would you see any use for wiki technology in any of your other study areas, or even where you may hope to eventually end up in employment?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: I think Wikipedia is a great resource to find concise, compiled information and given the fast pace of society today, it will only grow in importance for people needed to quickly check the names of certain people or places when working on projects or reports in the workplace. I already use Wikipedia for quick reference checks, to clarify what something or who someone is that I am not familiar with.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤KK♡❤♡♡❤: I totally see use for wiki technology. Wikipedia is often the first source I go to when I have a question. While I cannot cite Wikipedia in my school papers I have learned that if it is a good article then it can be a great database for other academic works that I can use and if not it is normally a great source to give me some basic knowledge. I think if more and more articles can reach at least Good status Wikipedia might start to be acknowledged as a reliable source.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: I have always appreciated Wikipedia as a resource to provide me with background information for many of my areas of study. While it is not acknowledge as a strictly academic source, I use it to familiarize myself with a topic before delving in to deeper research. I also find Wikipedia to be a useful resource for non-academic subjects, which is, in essence, the beauty of Wikipedia.

</ul>
<h3>The 2,000th</h3>

 How did you feel when "♡❤El Señor Presidente♡❤" was made up to Featured Article (FA) status? Did you have a celebratory drink or a party?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: I was (and still am) extremely excited. Before this semester started in January, I was not even aware that anyone could edit Wikipedia, let alone create a page and build it from scratch. I honestly did not know if it would make it through FAC but we have had so much help with copy-editing and technical Wikipedia aspects of creating the article that it really would never have been possible to get a feature article if it had not been from the help of a few key other Wikipedians. Unfortunately there was no celebratory drink or party as the work of a student never seems to end but I will admit I have been rather shamelessly bragging about it to family and friends.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤KK♡❤♡♡❤: It was very exciting but to be honest I had gotten used to editing Wikipedia for over 2 months that it was almost a little sad that the entire process was over. Creating a Wikipedia article is such a group process that I did feel a little sad to be leaving after working so intensely with such an amazing group of people. We have not had a celebratory drink, unfortunately it has been overshadowed by all the other work that school entails but I definitely think one is in order once school is done. I also don't think that it has really set in.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: It was rather a surreal feeling. It's hard to believe an article that was created in January is now deserving of "Featured Article" status less than four months later. Our whole class had a party of sorts to celebrate the end of the class, which I suppose could encompass the wrapping up of Wikipedia editing.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Were you disappointed that more of your articles didn't make FA status?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: I have not been involved with the other articles so I cannot say that I feel strongly one way or another. Perhaps this question would be better suited for Dr. Beasly-Murray, who has indeed been involved in every article.
</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Was getting the article up to that status harder than you expected?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: To be honest, I don't really know what I was expecting. When the project first began I took a good look at other articles on books that achieved Feature Article status and they looked really impressive so I knew from the beginning it was going to be a challenge but I was ready for that challenge and excited to give it a go. Basically, I jumped rather blindly into "editing" and the whole world of Wikipedia.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤KK♡❤♡♡❤: I would not say that it was harder than I expected but perhaps more work. Luckily, we had an amazing group of Wikipedia users and editors on our side who helped make it very clear what was expected for the article. Honestly, without them guiding us I think this whole process would have been a lot more difficult if not impossible. This experience has taught me that if you are willing to put in the work and time than it really is not impossible.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: It required a commitment of considerable time and effort, but I think that's to be expected for a highly recognized article. We were fortunate enough to be guided at every turn by experienced editors, who most likely the reason the article progressed so far, so quickly.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Does the lack of credit on Wikipedia concern you?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: Not at all. Wikipedia is such a group effort that I think it would be extremely difficult to give credit to only a few people. I may have been one of the principle editors tirelessly working away at this article but at the same time it would never have reached FA without the overwhelming support from other collaborators who helped us out with many aspects of the article. What still impresses me is how thoroughly they were able to copyedit the article and really focus on sentences of weakness so that the finished product is rather remarkable.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤KK♡❤♡♡❤: Personally, it does not concern me because I did this as an assignment for a class. Therefore, only having edited one article any lack on individual credit is not a worry for me, especially because this is such a group effort. What does concern me is the lack of credit Wikipedia is given in the academic community. Many people worked tirelessly on this article, and of course all the other FAs, to make sure it was all properly supported by academic sources yet it still has a bad reputation. I think FAs deserve more credit in the academic community because they are excellent sources of information.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: Not particularly. The goal of Wikipedia is to share and spread information, not formulate new ideas or pose arguments. Ultimately, users are merely compilers, gathering information and organizing it into a cohesive page. While some users may contribute more than others, all users are working towards a common goal, which doesn't precipitate the need for individual recognition. Additionally, Wikipedia has in place it's [♡❤sic♡❤] own sort of recognition and awards system that can give credit where credit's due.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Academia is often characterised as "publish or die". Do you believe the educational establishment should embrace Wikipedia or wiki technology as a way of making this publishing requirement less onerous?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: Being an undergraduate, I don't really feel as though I am faced with this "publish or die" thinking. I do think though that this has been a very valuable assignment and I see a lot of merit in doing it. It is a chance for us students who never have anything we write published to publish something on Wikipedia. I also think there are many valuable skills that one acquires from editing on Wikipedia because one does not write something once and never look at it again. Wikipedia encourages multiple revisions and re-writing or going back to the original research to further clarify points one makes. I think it also teaches valuable writing skills and helps on improve on areas of weakness in his/her writing. So, I do not know if I have answered the question per se but yes, I do think that the education establishment should embrace Wikipedia as a valuable education tool for students. Seeing that a person's name is not directly linked to any given article and one's proper name is not used while editing, I find that it would be extremely difficult for Wikipedia as it functions right now to diminish the onerous requirement of publishing articles.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: I think Wikipedia should be acknowledge for providing a (in some cases, somewhat comprehensive) background on certain academic subjects. And it would be nice for students of all levels of education to cite Wikipedia as an academic source for papers and projects. However, I recognize the difficulty in allowing Wikipedia to be considered a rigid academic source, since it is open to changes from academics and non-academics alike. I believe Wikipedia should continued to be used as a starting place for research and information and as a stepping stone to further resources.

</ul>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; How has working on getting something to FA status changed your opinion of Wikipedia from that you held prior to the start of this project?
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤MF♡❤♡♡❤: As I said before, I did not even know a person could edit Wikipedia before the start of the project, so, my views of Wikipedia have changed drastically. After working on this page for so long, and achieving FA status, I now have so much respect for all of the editors working to improve the information out there. Wikipedia is a great source and I have no doubt that it will only continue to get better. Because I have been told not to cite Wikipedia information in academic writing, before the project began I had the idea that Wikipedia is rather untrustworthy. At the same time, one of my professors this year included in our course readings some Wikipedia articles such as "&lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Bang%20Theory"&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/a&gt;" and I was shocked. I think the lesson I have learned from this is that Wikipedia can be an extremely valuable research tool and, at least with the Good and Featured Articles, they can provide the reader with a rather extensive list of academic work to references reliably. In the end, I can't say enough how much I respect all those working on Wikipedia articles day after day, compiling resources and information and really doing something remarkable. Whether professors like it or not, Wikipedia is a widely used tool by students to quickly check facts about a person, place, event, or work and I think with the help of dedicated editors, it will only continue to improve and impress.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤EE♡❤♡♡❤: It showed me the draw of using Wikipedia not only to access information, but to share it as well. It also showed me how much "behind the scenes" effort goes into creating, maintaining and editing pages. Wikipedia had always seemed like a resource dominated by experts or at least people fanatic about a certain subject. However, working on an article has shown me that truly anyone can contribute his or her bit to Wikipedia and make a significant impact.

<h1>2008 AutoTronics Taipei: Participants from IT industry to participate COMPUTEX uncertainly</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2008%20AutoTronics%20Taipei%3A%20Participants%20from%20IT%20industry%20to%20participate%20COMPUTEX%20uncertainly&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Since the AutoTronics Taipei was held from 2006, companies from electronic and automobile-related industries steadily made their stages and a good complementary in this &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20Trade%20Shows"&gt;trade show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Before the first holding in 2006, because of the establishment of Car Electronics Pavilion in 2005 TAITRONICS Autumn (Taipei International Electronic Autumn Show), it (the pavilion) ever became a hot topic in these 2 industries. And eventually, Yulon Group recruited their sub-companies grouping their own pavilion to showcase automobile parts, accessories, and applications.

Currently, automobile navigation, mobile entertainment, and road safety, were included in modern automotive devices. But in a keynote speech of TARC Pavilion, Jamie Hsu (Consultant of Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of the China) pointed out several threats and opportunities on the automotive industry, his words also echoed a notable quote by Yi-cheng Liu (Chairman of Taiwan Transportation Vehicle Manufacturers' Association): "The automobile industry shouldn't be monopolized by a company or its own industry. If this industry want to be grown up, it [the industry] should do more optimizations and transformations with the other related industries like IT and electronic."

Although some participants like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARenesas%20Technology"&gt;Renesas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFujitsu"&gt;Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiTAC"&gt;MiTAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATomTom"&gt;TomTom NV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAgilent%20Technologies"&gt;Agilent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ever participated in Taipei IT Month, CeBIT, or Computex Taipei, but there were varied comments for participation on Computex 2008.
Renesas Technology, a participant of Computex 2007, won't showcase in Computex 2008, but Fujitsu and TomTom both declared to participate in the 2008 Taipei IT Month.

Generally in the automobile industry, progressively conformed by the other industries, its success should depend on collaborations between different and similar industries because "not any company can do any monopoly in any industry" even though the automobile industry will become a "trillion industry" not only in Taiwan.

Zenit Saint Petersburg, Rangers, Fiorentina, and Bayern Munich all advance to the UEFA Cup semi-finals on Thursday. Zenit was all but assured of their advancement having won their first leg 4-1 over Bayer Leverkusen, but the other three ties were still fully up in the air. Rangers and Sporting had played a scoreless draw at Ibrox, while Bayern Munich drew 1-1 with Getafe at home and Fiorentina tied PSV by the same scoreline.

<h2>Results</h2>
<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg"&gt;Zenit St Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; 0 (4) – (1) 1 &lt;a href="w%3ABayer%2004%20Leverkusen"&gt;Bayer 04 Leverkusen&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Bayer Leverkusen were knocked out of the UEFA Cup despite winning 1-0 on the road on Thursday. Dmitri Boulykin scored the goal for German outfit in the 18th minute when he directed the ball into the net from Gonzalo Castro's cross. Leverkusen continued to press for more goals, looking to overturn their 4-1 loss in Germany last week, but couldn't find the net a second time.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AGetafe%20CF"&gt;Getafe&lt;/a&gt; 3 (1)- (1) 3 &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Bayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Bayern Munich survived two huge scares against 10-man Getafe to advance to the UEFA Cup semi-finals. Ruben de la Red was sent off in the 7th minute for Getafe for a reckless challenge on Miroslav Klose, putting a dent in the Spanish sides chances early. Cosmin Contra, who scored in the first leg, apparently thought otherwise as he cut in from the right side and fired a powerful shot over Oliver Kahn in the 44th minute. Bayern Munich pushed for the equalizer, but couldn't make any headway until the 89th minute when a shot by Toni bounced off a defender and into the path of Frank Ribery, who slotted home. The goal put the scores even on aggregate, and forced the game into extra time. Getafe took the lead only a minute into extra time when Nobrega Braulio cued up a shot for Francisco Casquero, who scored off the post. The provider then turned goal scorer as he turned home Mario Cotelo's, giving Getafe a demanding 3-1 lead. Bayern looked to be going out of the competition as they had trouble breaking Getafe down, but Toni grabbed a goal back in the 115th minute when keeper Pato dropped a cross from Mark van Bommel and the Italian jumped on the loose ball to score. Toni then scored the tying goal in the final minute of play, rising to head in a cross from Jose Ernesto Sosa. The goal put the aggregate score at 4-4, but the away goals rule meant it would be the German side advancing to take on Zenit Saint Petersburg in the semis.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3APSV%20Eindhoven"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt; 0 (1) - (1) 2 &lt;a href="w%3AACF%20Fiorentina"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
A brace by Adrian Mutu sent Fiorentina safely into the UEFA Cup semi-finals. Danny Koevermans had an early shot for PSV which was saved Sebastien Frey before Giampaolo Pazzini had Fiorentina's first chance, a shot saved by Heurelho Gomes. Mutu scored his first goal in the 38th minute off a free kick, his blasted shot going into the top corner of the net. After the break Mutu doubled the visitors lead in the 54th minute. Pazzini took a shot on goal and Gomes parried the ball away, but the rebound fell to Mutu and the Romanian cleanly finished. Fiorentina came close to a third when Riccardo Montolivo hit the crossbar. PSV then wasted a great chance to get back into the game when they were awarded a penalty when Danko Lazovic was brought down in the area. Simons shot the ball to Frey's right, but the keeper guessed correctly and made the stop. Fiorentina held on for the win, and will now move on to face Rangers.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ASporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal"&gt;Sporting Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; 0 (0) - (0) 2 &lt;a href="w%3ARangers%20F.C."&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Scottish club Rangers continued their run in the UEFA Cup after winning 2-0 in Portugal. Jean Claude Darcheville had the opening chance for Rangers as a cross made its way to the striker, but Pereira Gladstone made his way back to black the shot. Sporting's opening chance came when Da Silva Liedson headed a free kick by Leandro Romagnoli against the post. Miguel Veloso then had a chance for Sporting with a long distance shot, but his drive flew just wide of the right post. Rangers scored in the 60th minute through Darcheville as he played the ball out wide, sprinted into the area to receive a return pass, and fired home. Sporting had two chances to pull the tie even before Rangers put the game out of reach. Substitute Steven Whittaker made a run from his own half and fired home his shot in the 90th minute. Rangers will now move on to Italy for the semi-final against Fiorentina.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive interview with Jeremy Hanke, editor of ♡❤MicroFilmmaker Magazine♡❤. The magazine, which is free to read online, was started as a resource for the low budget moviemaker and features &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aindependent%20film"&gt;independent film&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , equipment and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reviews as well as articles on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afilm%20distribution"&gt;film distribution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aspecial%20effects"&gt;special effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alighting"&gt;lighting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

He says that one of the goals of the magazine is to "connect low-budget filmmakers via a feeling of community, as many...often compete so viciously against one another in film festivals for coveted "shots" with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACinema%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , that they can quickly forget their similarities."

When asked if films made on a shoestring budget can really compete with those made for millions of dollars, he replied, "no…yes…and absolutely. Allow me to explain." And so he does in the interview below.

<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Why was ♡❤MicroFilmmaker Magazine♡❤ started? How does it help the thousands of independent filmmakers out there with big ideas and little cash?♡❤♡

♡❤♡♡❤MicroFilmmaker Magazine♡❤ is free to read on its website. Why did you choose this over the paid subscription route?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Today, most of the films we see in theatres cost millions, sometimes hundreds of millions, to make. Do you think it's really possible to make films that can compete with these on a shoestring budget?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Distributing a movie can be one of the hardest aspects of production. Do you think that today, with the Internet, it's easier to go about doing this and make a profit than it might have been twenty years ago?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Do you have any advice for the amateur filmmakers reading this?♡❤♡

New 'deadly' sexual enhancement products have been found in Singaporean markets and can cause serious side effects on users.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHealth%20Sciences%20Authority"&gt;Health Sciences Authority&lt;/a&gt; (HSA) announced the presence of the illegal drugs, known as Power 1 Walnut, Santi bovine penis erecting capsule, Zhong Hua Niu Bian and fake &lt;a href="w%3ACialis"&gt;Cialis&lt;/a&gt;, which have been discovered over the past 3 months. Santi bovine penis erecting capsule has been found to contain high amounts of &lt;a href="w%3Aglibenclamide"&gt;glibenclamide&lt;/a&gt;, a potent drug used to treat &lt;a href="w%3Adiabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The tablets also contain &lt;a href="w%3Asildenafil"&gt;sildenafil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Atadalafil"&gt;tadalafil&lt;/a&gt; - potent western medicines used to treat &lt;a href="w%3Aerectile%20dysfunction"&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;. Zhong Hua Niu Bian also contains sildenafil and glibenclamide.

High consumption of the tablets can be potentially deadly as the glibenclamide in the capsules can lead to drastically reduced blood sugar levels which can lead to &lt;a href="w%3Aseizures"&gt;seizures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Astroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Acoma"&gt;coma&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Adeath"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Consuming half of a Power 1 Walnut capsule has led to &lt;a href="w%3AUnconsciousness"&gt;unconsciousness&lt;/a&gt; and frothing at the mouth.

Consumption of Power 1 Walnut has led to the death of a middle age man last week who fell into a coma. Currently, one death and two cases of coma have been reported from the total of 89 hospitalised cases linked with the consumption of the illegal drugs. It has been revealed that patients obtained the drugs by purchasing them from illegal peddlers located in various parts of Singapore.

The HSA has advised people to stop consuming the drugs and to report on any cases of consumption to them.

The reports state that the Church in Belgium is being investigated for extortion and fraud for allegedly posting false job openings in newspapers and then attempting to get those who applied to join the Church. Several ex-members of the Church have also reportedly approached authorities with accusations of intimidation and extortion.

Police in Belgium have been investigating the Church for nearly ten years which resulted in the raid on Thursday.

In a statement to the press, the Church says that the police "violated their fundamental rights" as a religious organization and accused the police of "malicious justice operations." The Church plans to contest any charges filed against it. They also state that the postings were requests for volunteers and not employees.

So far no arrests have been made, but some employees of the Church were detained and questioned by police.

The building remains closed as of publication.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) a major &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20Magnitude%20Scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 7.3 &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; has struck 131 kilometers (82 miles) southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AMacquarie%20Island"&gt;Macquarie Island&lt;/a&gt;, an Australian holding located to the south of &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

The quake struck at 11:30 a.m. local time and had a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles).

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA) states that there is no threat of a large &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;, but that small local waves may be generated close to the quake's &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt;.

The NOAA further said that, "Authorities can assume the danger has passed if no tsunami waves are observed near the epicenter within an hour of the earthquake."

So far, there is no word on injuries or damage.

On the back of new restrictions being imposed on &lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; users in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; requiring that sellers offer PayPal payments for all sales, eBay &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; is mandating that ♡❤only♡❤ &lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; payments will be acceptable as of June 17. PayPal is a wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay, and charges a 30¢ transaction fee, plus a commission between 1.1% for high volume traders, and 2.4% for low value or low volume traders. These higher costs will be passed onto buyers.

Cash payment on pick up will be the only other payment option, and it may only be offered in conjunction with PayPal.

eBay has brought in this restriction under the guise of improving customer protection, bolstering its "Paypal Buyer Protection" insurance programme to allow claims up to &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;20,000 instead of the previous maximum of $3,000, however as of June 17 many of the items which would exceed $3,000 are no longer covered by the programme, such as services, vehicles, real estate and businesses.

eBay Trust and Safety director Alastair MacGibbon said this change was not in response to the once-off fund established in March to refund eBay buyers who lost their non-existent holiday accommodation packages from the Melbourne eBay seller Robert Kobis. Mr MacGibbon said "It is part of a much larger initiative".

In addition to these measures, Paypal will be withholding funds from some sellers for 21 days

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Competition%20and%20Consumer%20Commission"&gt;Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&lt;/a&gt; has held discussion with eBay, but declined to comment. The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Consumers%20Association"&gt;Australian Consumers Association&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Christopher Zinn said the unique use of PayPal could give rise to competition issues, however if the costs charged stayed as they were, they had no further concerns.

&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt; was today sworn in for his second term as &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Spain"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. He also announced his new cabinet, which for the first time includes more women than men.

Zapatero was sworn in at a brief ceremony in &lt;a href="w%3AZarzuela%20Palace"&gt;Zarzuela Palace&lt;/a&gt;. He took the &lt;a href="w%3Aoath%20of%20office%23Spain"&gt;oath of office&lt;/a&gt; with his hand upon a copy of Spain's &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20Constitution%20of%201978"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;, which he chose instead of a &lt;a href="w%3ABible"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt;. "I promise on my conscience and honour to comply faithfully with the obligations of Prime Minister," he said, standing before &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Carlos%20I%20of%20Spain"&gt;King Juan Carlos I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Sof%C3%ADa%20of%20Spain"&gt;Queen Sofía&lt;/a&gt;.

After winning the election on March 9, parliament officially voted Zapatero into the position on Friday. An initial vote on Wednesday failed to pass, but Friday's vote only required a simple majority. Zapatero's &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party"&gt;Spanish Socialist Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; won the general election, but they fell 7 seats short of an absolute majority in parliament's lower house.

Later, Zapatero announced the members of his new cabinet. Nine of the ministers in his new cabinet are women, and eight of them are men. &lt;a href="w%3ACarme%20Chac%C3%B3n"&gt;Carme Chacón&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the housing minister, was appointed as Spain's first female defense minister. 

"It is the first government in which a woman has the defence portfolio and the first government in which there are more women than men," Zapatero said. "I feel very proud that there are more women ministers than men." &lt;a href="w%3AMar%C3%ADa%20Teresa%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20la%20Vega"&gt;María Teresa Fernández de la Vega&lt;/a&gt;, who became Spain's first female deputy prime minister in 2004, was reappointed to her position. 

Two new ministries will now be a part of the cabinet. &lt;a href="w%3ABibiana%20A%C3%ADdo"&gt;Bibiana Aído&lt;/a&gt; was named head of the new Equality Ministry. At 31 years old, she is the youngest minister in Spain's history. Molecular biologist &lt;a href="w%3ACristina%20Garmendia"&gt;Cristina Garmendia&lt;/a&gt; will head the new Science and Innovation Ministry.

Zapatero hopes the new cabinet will work to boost the nation's economy, which he says will be one of his top priorities as prime minister. "We must continue to boost the economy and do it in a new way, less dependent on construction," Zapatero said. &lt;a href="w%3AMiguel%20Sebasti%C3%A1n"&gt;Miguel Sebastián&lt;/a&gt;, Zapatero's former chief economic advisor, was named the new industry minister.

Foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AMiguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Moratinos"&gt;Miguel Ángel Moratinos&lt;/a&gt;, economy minister &lt;a href="w%3APedro%20Solbes"&gt;Pedro Solbes&lt;/a&gt;, interior minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlfredo%20P%C3%A9rez%20Rubalcaba"&gt;Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba&lt;/a&gt;, and justice minister &lt;a href="w%3AMariano%20Fernandez%20Bermejo"&gt;Mariano Fernandez Bermejo&lt;/a&gt; all kept their posts, while four other ministers were ousted.

♡❤♡♡❤"2008 Boao Forum for Asia"♡❤♡♡❤ started two days ago in Bo'ao, &lt;a href="w%3AHainan"&gt;Hainan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, and participated with government and industrial executives worldwide. Because revolutions in the &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%203.0"&gt;Web 3.0&lt;/a&gt; era have made a major impact on global economy, several elites from the Internet industry like &lt;a href="w%3AKai-Fu%20Lee"&gt;Kai-Fu Lee&lt;/a&gt; provided forecasts for this key industry in the forum.

Furthermore, &lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Siew"&gt;Vincent Siew&lt;/a&gt;, the vice-president elect, provided his comments in the forum. But two coalitions (&lt;a href="w%3APan-Blue%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Blues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APan-Green%20Coalition"&gt;Pan-Greens&lt;/a&gt;) declared different comments on Siew's participation.

But due to a hot topic of environment and &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20effect"&gt;greenhouse effect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARajendra%20Kumar%20Pachauri"&gt;Rajendra Kumar Pachauri&lt;/a&gt;, winner of 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt;, commented on this forum: "There were several sectors on energy-saving, not governments, but the public should play a great role in this global warming era."

Before the annual &lt;a href="w%3AEarth%20Day"&gt;Earth Day&lt;/a&gt; on April 22, several environmental-related events were progressively promoted in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. For example, industrial and academical units promoted several energy-efficiency policies, parts and accessories, and products in three recently-closed trade shows (AutoTronics Taipei, Motorcycle Taiwan, and Taipei AMPA) respectively located at &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;TWTC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center%20Nangang%20Exhibition%20Hall"&gt;TWTC Nangang&lt;/a&gt; with the international environmental laws and policies promoted in several nations including Taiwan. &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20Railway%20Administration"&gt;Taiwan Railway Administration&lt;/a&gt; promoted "Twin-rail Environmental Train" (in &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20language"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: 兩鐵環保專車) for bicycle and &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20transport"&gt;mass transportation&lt;/a&gt; industries. And also, &lt;a href="w%3AHBO"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; Taiwan promoted the movement of "Decreasing &lt;a href="w%3Achopsticks"&gt;chopsticks&lt;/a&gt; to save the earth" (in Chinese: 一筷救地球) to drive the public changing habits on common food habits when using environmental &lt;a href="w%3Atableware"&gt;tablewares&lt;/a&gt;.

By the way, he also commented on the upcoming event of "Taiwan Bicycle Day" and "Project of Light-weighted Electronic Vehicle" by &lt;a href="w%3AIndustrial%20Technology%20Research%20Institute"&gt;ITRI&lt;/a&gt; and said:

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Major%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; relief pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AJoba%20Chamberlain"&gt;Joba Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; returned a call to his sister after an 8-5 loss to the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Red%20Sox"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; Sunday night. After speaking with his sister who was in &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%2C%20Nebraska"&gt;Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, he was in tears and being consoled by manager &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Girardi"&gt;Joe Girardi&lt;/a&gt;.

Joba's father, Harlan Chamberlain, 55, collapsed at his home in Lincoln, and is currently at St. Elizabeth Regional Medical Center. Although the exact nature of his collapse is unknown, Harlan, a full-blooded &lt;a href="w%3AHo-Chunk"&gt;Winnebago&lt;/a&gt; Native American, has struggled with &lt;a href="w%3Apost-polio%20syndrome"&gt;post-polio syndrome&lt;/a&gt; since childhood. He has been known to be in declining health in recent years.

Still, Harlan was in attendance at &lt;a href="w%3AYankee%20Stadium"&gt;Yankee Stadium&lt;/a&gt; during the team's Opening Day series this year. He also drove down to &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City%2C%20Missouri"&gt;Kansas City&lt;/a&gt;, only three hours away from Lincoln, when the Yankees visited the &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City%20Royals"&gt;Kansas City Royals&lt;/a&gt;. He made the same trips last year when Joba made his much-anticipated Major League debut.

When asked about the situation, Girardi only said, "Personal stuff stays in [the clubhouse]."

Joba has been granted leave from the team to be with his father, and will not be with the Yankees at least during their two-game series against the &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%20Bay%20Rays"&gt;Tampa Bay Rays&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ATropicana%20Field"&gt;Tropicana Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

This weekend, April 12&amp;ndash;13, the joint Development Committee of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank%20Group"&gt;World Bank Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; (IMF) held its annual Spring Meeting in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;

The Group of Seven (G7), which is comprised of the economic policy makers from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, held its annual meeting on Friday, April 11. This meeting, which rotates locations, was also held in Washington, D.C.

The Development Committee meeting ended on Sunday, with a call from the economic leaders for assistance to the countries which been adversely affected by rising food prices. Economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in five years, while the rising costs of food and energy have not slowed.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Zoellick"&gt;Robert Zoellick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the president of the World Bank, said, "We have to put our money where our mouth is. Now. So that we can put food into hungry mouths. It's as stark as that." He called for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 500 million in emergency funds for the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Programme"&gt;World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by May 1, 2008.

"All that has been done [in the past decade] can be undone very rapidly by the crisis coming from the increase in food prices," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20Strauss-Kahn"&gt;Dominique Strauss-Kahn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the managing director of the IMF.

"Children will be suffering from malnutrition, with consequences for all their lives," he said. He cited the growing use of land for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abiofuels"&gt;biofuels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as contributing to rising food costs. In the end growing violence and civil unrest could be a result.

Strauss-Kahn further warned that eventually it could become "not only a humanitarian question," but could also affect developed nations by leading to trade imbalances.

Specifically cited as a current example, was &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, where just this weekend, violence escalated resulting in the death of a United Nations peacekeeper and the ousting of Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJacques-%C3%89douard%20Alexis"&gt;Jacques-Édouard Alexis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;United States Secretary of the Treasury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Paulson"&gt;Henry Paulson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cautioned that affected countries "need to resist the temptation of price controls and consumption subsidies that are generally not effective and efficient methods of protecting vulnerable groups."
Price controls and subsidies "tend to create fiscal burdens and economic distortions while often providing aid to higher-income consumers or commercial interests other than the intended beneficiaries," Paulson said.

In their Friday statement, the G7 said "there have been at times sharp fluctuations in major currencies, and we are concerned about their possible implications for economic and financial stability." This marked the first time since the February 2004 meeting in Boca Raton, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, that the wording on foreign exchange has been altered.

The G7 presented a plan to strengthen regulation of capital markets. They urged financial firms to "fully" disclose their at-risk investments and improve capital reserves. While the G7 did not outline new monetary or fiscal policies, it did promise action "as appropriate." The timetable for the plan is 100 days.
The head of G7 Market Economics at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATullett%20Prebon"&gt;Tullett Prebon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Lena Komileva, observed, "The implicit message is that the G7 is moving closer towards concerted action in the event that persistent volatility in the foreign exchange market presents new risk of systemic failure in the financial industry."

"While action is unlikely in the short run, they are probably already considering a pre-emptive move in foreign exchange markets to slow the dollar's decline," added Komileva. 

Economists at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGoldman%20Sachs"&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told their clients, "After a period where the possibility of G7 policy intervention seemed very remote, providing no counterweight to the dollar depreciation forces, we are moving towards a regime where G7 intervention is a more real possibility."

Theoretical physicist &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Archibald%20Wheeler"&gt;John Archibald Wheeler&lt;/a&gt; died of &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; at his residence in Hightstown, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. Wheeler is most known in the popular culture for popularizing the term "&lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20hole"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt;" to describe stars which had become so dense that nothing, not even light, could escape their gravitational pull. Although Wheeler initially objected to the idea, he later accepted the idea and coined the term "black hole" to describe such objects.

Wheeler was also known for his work along with &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Feynman"&gt;Richard Feynman&lt;/a&gt; and others in the &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan%20Project"&gt;Manhattan Project&lt;/a&gt;, which produced the first &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20fission"&gt;nuclear fission&lt;/a&gt; bomb. He was later involved in the work to build the first &lt;a href="w%3Afusion%20bomb"&gt;fusion bomb&lt;/a&gt;. As much as he was known for his research, Wheeler was known for his skill and accomplishment in teaching. 

Wheeler was born July 9, 1911, in Jacksonville, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and went on to earn his doctorate in physics at the early age of 21. He then went on to work in &lt;a href="w%3ACopenhagen"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3ANiels%20Bohr"&gt;Niels Bohr&lt;/a&gt; and later returned to the United States to become part of the Manhattan Project during &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.

Wheeler continued to work in physics after the war and was involved in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMatterhorn%20project"&gt;Matterhorn project&lt;/a&gt; to build a hydrogen bomb before the &lt;a href="w%3AUSSR"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. His politics were more militaristic than many of his fellow scientists at the time, in that he supported the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; and the building of the hydrogen bomb.

For a long time Wheeler was at &lt;a href="w%3APrinceton%20University"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; as the doctoral adviser for many prominent physicists including &lt;a href="w%3AKip%20Thorne"&gt;Kip Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; winner Richard Feynman. Wheeler went on to the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin"&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt; in 1976 when Princeton's mandatory retirement age neared.

Wheeler continued to work until near his death. Physicists both young and old have paid tribute to Wheeler; cosmologist &lt;a href="w%3AMax%20Tegmark"&gt;Max Tegmark&lt;/a&gt; told the New York Times that Wheeler had been "the only physics superhero still standing". 

He is survived by three children, along with grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Launch%20Alliance"&gt;United Launch Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAtlas%20V"&gt;Atlas V&lt;/a&gt; carrier rocket launched this evening from &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2041"&gt;LC-41&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station"&gt;Cape Canaveral Air Force Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href="w%3AICO%20G1"&gt;ICO G1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acommunications%20satellite"&gt;communications satellite&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AICO%20Satellite%20Management"&gt;ICO Satellite Management&lt;/a&gt;. Lift-off occurred at 20:12:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first commercial launch of an Atlas rocket since responsibility for the launches was transferred from &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Launch%20Services"&gt;International Launch Services&lt;/a&gt; to United Launch Alliance, through &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;. Launch was completely successful, with the spacecraft separating from its carrier rocket about half an hour after launch.

The Atlas V flew in the 421 configuration, with a 4 metre wide payload fairing, twin &lt;a href="w%3Asolid%20rocket%20boosters"&gt;solid rocket boosters&lt;/a&gt;, and a single-engined &lt;a href="w%3ACentaur%20%28rocket%20stage%29"&gt;Centaur&lt;/a&gt; upper stage. It was the 14 flight of the Atlas V, and successfully placed the satellite into a &lt;a href="w%3Ageosynchronous%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous orbit&lt;/a&gt;. The launch was dedicated to former Atlas programme employee Lynn Deckard.

ICO G1 will provide &lt;a href="w%3AS%20band"&gt;S band&lt;/a&gt; mobile communications for satellite phones. Its launch had been delayed from May last year, owing to delays with US government missions which were launching on Atlas, and then in light of the failure of a previous Atlas launch in June. It was constructed by &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Systems/Loral"&gt;Space Systems/Loral&lt;/a&gt;, and is based on the &lt;a href="w%3ALS-1300"&gt;LS-1300&lt;/a&gt; satellite bus. It is the heaviest satellite to be launched by an Atlas rocket, and the heaviest single commercial satellite to be launched into a &lt;a href="w%3Ageosynchronous%20transfer%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous transfer orbit&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking after the launch, Jim Sponnik, the Vice President of the Atlas programme told the team who had conducted the launch that they "all did extremely well and the rocket did exceptionally well". Colonel Scott Henderson, of the 45 Space Wing, United States Air Force, said that the launch was "a great success", and the result of "phenomenal effort" on the part of those involved. David Malcom, the President of Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems described the launch as a "hole in one". Tim Bryan, the CEO of ICO Satellite Management told the United Launch Alliance team that he "can't express...what every person in this room has done for our business". He also thanked Bob Day, and ICO's space team, for their work in the build up to the launch. Michael Gass, the CEO of United Launch Alliance said that the successful launch was a "testimony to this entire team", and told flight controllers "congratulations, you're the best".

The satellite's signal was acquired by ground tracking stations in Australia at 21:17, and the launch was confirmed to be accurate to within one nautical mile of the targeted orbit. The next Atlas launch is scheduled to occur in early July, with a DMSP weather satellite, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

Counting continues in &lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; for the much awaited elections of the &lt;a href="Nepalese%20Constituent%20Assembly"&gt;constituent assembly&lt;/a&gt; that took place on April 10, 2008. The 601-member constituent assembly will draft a new constitution. 335 members would be elected through the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aproportional%20representation"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; electoral system, 240 members through election in constituencies (First Past The Post/&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASingle%20non-transferable%20vote"&gt;Single non-transferable vote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; system) and a further 26 on recommendation by the Council of Ministers (the current interim government). 

Around 17.5 million voters were eligible to vote in the elections. More than sixty percent of the voters took part in the elections. Christian Science Monitor said the voters "turned out in full force." Despite a few incidences of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aarson"&gt;arson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and intimidation, elections were largely peaceful. Chief Election Commissioner Bhoj Raj Pokharel said, "Overall, the election was peaceful and successful. A clear picture of standings of political parties will be known in 10 days."

According to Kantipur Online, results have been declared for at least 204 seats with CPN-Maoists winning 112 of the seats, declared so far. Two other major parties Nepali Congress and CPN-United Marxists Leninists are just behind with 33 and 27 seats respectively.

<h1>US airlines Delta and Northwest agree to merge</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20airlines%20Delta%20and%20Northwest%20agree%20to%20merge&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Rival &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; airlines &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20Air%20Lines"&gt;Delta Air Lines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Airlines"&gt;Northwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt; announced today that they have agreed to merge. The new airline, which will use the Delta name, will be the largest commercial airline in the world.

Technically, Delta will be buying Northwest in a roughly &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;3 billion deal. Northwest shareholders will receive 1.25 shares of Delta for each share of Northwest. Based on Monday's closing prices on the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exhange"&gt;New York Stock Exhange&lt;/a&gt; this represents a 17% premium for Northwest shareholders.

Richard Anderson, the Delta chief executive officer who will also head the new company, said: "We said we would only enter into a consolidation transaction if it was right for all of our constituencies; Delta and Northwest are a perfect fit. Today, we’re announcing a transaction that is about addition, not subtraction, and combines end-to-end networks that open a world of opportunities for our customers and employees. We believe by partnering with our employees, including providing equity to U.S.-based employees of Delta and Northwest, this combination is off to the right start."

The combined company would have $35 billion in annual revenue and approximately 75,000 employees. The deal does have to receive regulatory approval. "We will look at the competitive effects of the transaction and how it would affect consumers," said Gina Talanoma, a spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;United States Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.

Airline industry consultant Robert Mann told Reuters, "It's a very optimistic view on an industry that's been very dismal for the last couple of weeks."

, the president of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; yesterday marked the anniversary of the birth of &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Jefferson"&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, the third president of the United States.

In the East room of the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Bush made a speech to mark the occasion. Mr. Bush started the speech by discussing Mr. Jefferson. "We're here tonight to commemorate the 265th birthday of Thomas Jefferson, here in a room where he once walked and in a home where he once lived," he said.

"In this house, President Jefferson spread the word that liberty was the right of every individual," continued Mr. Bush. "In this house, Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark off on the mission that helped make America a continental nation."

Mr. Bush continued his speech by claiming that "with a single sentence, Thomas Jefferson changed the history of the world." Bush continued, "After countless centuries when the powerful and the privileged governed as they pleased, Jefferson proclaimed as a self-evident truth that liberty was a right given to all people by an Almighty."

Mr. Bush then said that the ideas of Jefferson were not quickly fulfilled. "Here in America, that truth was not fully realized in Jefferson's own lifetime. As he observed the condition of slaves in America, Jefferson said, 'I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just' and 'that his justice cannot sleep forever.' Less than 40 years after his death, justice was awakened in America and a new era of freedom dawned."

Mrs. Bush also made a speech. "Thomas Jefferson believed that education is the cornerstone of a free society, so it's therefore little surprise that he viewed the founding of the University of Virginia as one of his top achievements," she said.

Former &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href="w%3ANasser%20al-Shaer"&gt;Nasser al-Shaer&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. Shaer is a former &lt;a href="w%3AEducation%20Minister%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;education minister&lt;/a&gt; and a former Deputy Prime Minister of the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian National Authority&lt;/a&gt;. He is considered a high-ranking member of &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;.

During a visit to the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;, Carter laid a wreath upon the grave site of &lt;a href="w%3AYasser%20Arafat"&gt;Yasser Arafat&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARamallah"&gt;Ramallah&lt;/a&gt;. Carter then met with Shaer, whom he greeted with a hug and kisses to both cheeks, according to a member of Carter's delegation.

Shaer told Reuters that he and Carter had a face-to-face meeting and that they discussed brokering an unofficial truce between &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; militants in the &lt;a href="Gaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;. Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in June of 2007. Carter's office has declined to comment on the closed meeting.

"Carter asked what he can do to achieve peace between the Palestinians and Israel ... and I told him the possibility for peace is high," Shaer said.

Carter told reporters that he wanted to go to the Gaza Strip, but was not allowed. Reuters reports that Israel, citing a member of Carter's delegation, denied the visit.

"I haven't been able to get permission to go into Gaza. I would like to. I asked for permission. But I was turned down. But maybe we can find a way to circumvent that," Carter said.

U.S. and Israeli officials have both expressed disapproval of Carter's visit. Both countries have sought to marginalize Hamas, while they try to negotiate a peace with &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority&lt;/a&gt; who hails from the &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; party. They see Carter's mission as counterproductive to their efforts.

Carter "in effect is undermining a current policy which is not just American but held by many others," said &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. Representative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Berman"&gt;Howard Berman&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. Berman is the chairperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs"&gt;Committee on Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.
Friday, Carter is scheduled to meet in &lt;a href="w%3ADamascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AKhaled%20Mashal"&gt;Khaled Mashal&lt;/a&gt;, who is considered the political leader of Hamas and is the head of its Syrian branch.
Yigal Palmor, an official with the Israeli Foreign Ministry said, "The official Hamas position until this day is that it won't negotiate with Israel or recognize it under any circumstance ... Jimmy Carter has dignified this position with his presence, and one cannot but wonder how this attitude is supposed to promote peace and understanding."

"Since Syria and Hamas will have to be involved in a final peace agreement, they have to be involved in discussions that lead to final peace," Jimmy Carter told reporters in Ramallah.

"Jimmy Carter's view of the forces at work in the Middle East and how he likes to attribute blame and responsibility is so warped to my way of thinking that I'm skeptical of any initiative he undertakes," said Howard Berman.

While in Israel, Carter met with Israeli &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Israel"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Shimon%20Peres"&gt;Shimon Peres&lt;/a&gt;, who criticized the planned meeting with Mashal. &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Israel"&gt;Prime Minister of Israel&lt;/a&gt; did not receive Carter.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aanimation"&gt;animator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOllie%20Johnston"&gt;Ollie Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, the last of Disney's so-called "Nine Old Men", has died at the age of 95.

Johnston died of natural causes on Monday in &lt;a href="w%3ASequim%2C%20Washington"&gt;Sequim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney%20Studios"&gt;Walt Disney Studios&lt;/a&gt; Vice President Howard E. Green.

Johnston worked on many of the Disney's classic films, including ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASnow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29"&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1937), ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APinocchio%20%281940%20film%29"&gt;Pinnochio&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1940), ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFantasia%20%28film%29"&gt;Fantasia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1940), ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABambi"&gt;Bambi&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1942), and many others. 
Johnston worked extensively with his best friend &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Thomas%20%28animator%29"&gt;Frank Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow "old man" who died in 2004. The pair met at &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; in the 1930s and worked together until Thomas' death. They retired from animation in 1978, but remained popular speakers and authors about Disney and animation.

"Ollie was part of an amazing generation of artists, one of the real pioneers of our art, one of the major participants in the blossoming of animation into the art form we know today," said &lt;a href="w%3ARoy%20E.%20Disney"&gt;Roy E. Disney&lt;/a&gt;.

Johnston devoted much of his retirement to writing and lecturing, but perhaps even more to &lt;a href="w%3ARail%20transport%20modelling"&gt;model trains&lt;/a&gt;, a field in which he became considered one of the world's foremost experts.

Ollie Johnston's last film was ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Fox%20and%20the%20Hound%20%28film%29"&gt;The Fox and the Hound&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1981) on which he worked as a supervisor.

On March 28, 2008, Ballo, a student at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Nice%20Sophia%20Antipolis"&gt;University of Nice Sophia Antipolis&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3ANice"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, took the Scientology personality test. A few hours later she reportedly killed herself by jumping from the window of her &lt;a href="w%3Adormitory"&gt;dormitory&lt;/a&gt;. Her friends and roommates claim she was in good spirits and showed no signs of a mental break down or depression prior to taking the test. The test was stamped and dated by the Church just hours prior to her suicide.

"I believe Kaja would have been alive today if she had not gone to the Scientologists," says friend and fellow student Henrik Møinichen, 19, to ♡❤Dagbladet♡❤.
"The information about the Scientology test has been made public through the priest's speech at the memorial service. I can confirm that. Due to the recency of her death, I don't wish to elaborate on or comment on other matters now," said Olav in a statement to the press.

The Church, which is located only meters from Ballo's dormitory, states that the results had shown Ballo was "depressed, irresponsible, hyper-critical and lacking in harmony." They also state that it is "unfair to blame Scientology" for Ballo's death and that the test had nothing to do with it. Ballo left behind a note telling her family she was sorry for not "being good for anything."

The incident has generated criticism against the Church from friends, family members and politicians. &lt;a href="w%3AInga%20Marte%20Thorkildsen"&gt;Inga Marte Thorkildsen&lt;/a&gt;, one of the members of Norway's Parliament, told the &lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADagbladet"&gt;Dagbladet&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that "All indications are that the Scientologist sect has played a direct role in Kaja's choice to take her own life."

Matthias Fosse, information chief for the Church of Scientology in Norway, rejected any links connection between Scientology and Ballo's suicide, and denied that the personality test was "dangerous", saying that millions of people have taken it. The Church of Scientology also pointed out Ballo's history of psychological issues and an eating disorder that she had experienced in her early teenage years.

The Church has since removed the test from its Norwegian website.

<h1>Pope Benedict XVI visit to the United States begins</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pope%20Benedict%20XVI%20visit%20to%20the%20United%20States%20begins&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3APope"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; began his &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20journeys%20of%20Pope%20Benedict%20XVI%23United%20States%20%28April%2015%20to%20April%2020%2C%202008%29"&gt;visit&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. In an unprecedented gesture, he was greeted by President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALaura%20Bush"&gt;Laura Bush&lt;/a&gt; and their daughter &lt;a href="w%3AJenna%20Bush"&gt;Jenna&lt;/a&gt;, upon his arrival at &lt;a href="w%3AAndrews%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Andrews Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in Maryland.

Today, which is also the Pope's 81st birthday, Benedict XVI visited the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; and more than 9,000 people with tickets were there to see him speak. This makes it "one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House," according to &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Press%20Secretary"&gt;White House Press Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt;. An estimated additional 4,000 people without tickets lined the streets.

The Pope was given a 21-gun salute and greeted by President Bush on the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Lawn%20%28White%20House%29"&gt;South Lawn&lt;/a&gt; of the White House. Benedict XVI addressed the crowd in a short speech. He appealed for support "for the patient efforts of international diplomacy to resolve conflicts and promote progress."

He further said, "As the nation faces the increasingly complex political and ethical issues of our time, I am confident that the American people will find in their religious beliefs a precious source of insight and an inspiration to pursue reasoned, responsible and respectful dialogue in the effort to build a more humane and free society." Benedict said he has "great respect for this vast pluralistic society" and ended his speech with "God bless America."

Kevin Waymel, 26, travelled from &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; with 80 others to see the Pope. He told ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ that he had "come to show support for the Holy Father," and credited his faith for getting him off drugs.

Afterwards, inside the White House, the first couple presented the Pope with a birthday cake. In a private meeting with Bush, Benedict XVI brought up his concerns about the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; war and the treatment of illegal immigrants in the United States, who may number as many as 20 million. Most of these are from &lt;a href="w%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; and therefore overwhelmingly Catholic.

After the meeting, Benedict XVI rode along &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania%20Avenue"&gt;Pennsylvania Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3Apopemobile"&gt;popemobile&lt;/a&gt; with throngs of people lining the street.

Wednesday evening, the Pope met with US bishops at the &lt;a href="w%3ABasilica%20of%20the%20National%20Shrine%20of%20the%20Immaculate%20Conception"&gt;Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception&lt;/a&gt;. He addressed the bishops about &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20sex%20abuse%20cases"&gt;sexual abuse by the clergy&lt;/a&gt;, which the Pope has said made him "deeply ashamed." The &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholicism%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; has paid out an estimated &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;2 billion to settle abuse cases in recent years.

Bendict XVI told the gathered bishops that the sex abuse scandal had at times been mishandled and urged them to reach out to the victims.

"It is your God-given responsibility as pastors to bind up the wounds caused by every breach of trust to foster healing, to promote reconciliation and to reach out with loving concern to those so seriously wronged," the Pope said.

Some victims had hoped the Pope would have critcised bishops for transferring pedophile priests from parish to parish. He did not go that far and instead praised training programs for priests and lay people who deal with children. "In this regard your efforts to heal and protect are bearing great fruit not only for those directly under your pastoral care, but for all of society," said Benedict XVI.

"It's the closest the Pope has come to saying that the bishops didn't do their job right. I think that's quite significant," said the Reverend &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20J.%20Reese"&gt;Thomas J. Reese&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ASociety%20of%20Jesus"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; priest and author.

Prior to his arrival, hundreds of people were already gathered outside the Basilica as Benedict XVI arrived. "I'm really excited," said an unnamed onlooker to &lt;a href="w%3ANY1"&gt;NY1&lt;/a&gt;. "It's like a dream, almost. There are, like, other foreign dignitaries, and then there's the pope. It's a unique experience and I can't wait to see him."

During his flight to the United States, Benedict XVI told reporters that he intended to discuss poverty and development aid to poor countries with President Bush. "The United States has to help these countries develop. It is in the interest of everyone, not only these countries but of the world and particularly of the United States," he said.

This is the first Papal visit to the United States by Benedict XVI, and the first visit of a Pope to the U.S. since John Paul II's visit in 1999. The pope scheduled to stay in Washington through Thursday. After that, he will travel to &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; where he plans to address the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, visit the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; site, and celebrate Mass at &lt;a href="w%3AYankee%20Stadium"&gt;Yankee Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.

Eric Bogosian is one of America's great multi-dimensional talents. "There's sort of three different careers, and any one of them could exist by itself, on its own two feet. There was that solo stuff, and then I started writing plays in the late seventies." Although his work has spanned genres, most readers will recognize Bogosian for his acting, which has included a memorable performance in &lt;a href="w%3AWoody%20Allen"&gt;Woody Allen&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADeconstructing%20Harry"&gt;Deconstructing Harry&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ to co-writing and starring in the &lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20Stone"&gt;Oliver Stone&lt;/a&gt; movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATalk%20Radio%20%28film%29"&gt;Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (based upon his &lt;a href="w%3APulitzer%20Prize"&gt;Pulitzer Prize&lt;/a&gt;-nominated &lt;a href="w%3ATalk%20Radio%20%28play%29"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;) to playing the bad guy in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUnder%20Siege%202"&gt;Under Siege 2&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ to his current role in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20%26amp%3B%20Order%3A%20Criminal%20Intent"&gt;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as &lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Ross"&gt;Captain Danny Ross&lt;/a&gt;. They may not know, however, that he had collaborated with &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Zappa"&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt; on a album, worked with &lt;a href="w%3ASonic%20Youth"&gt;Sonic Youth&lt;/a&gt;, and was a voice on &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Judge"&gt;Mike Judge&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABeavis%20%26amp%3B%20Butthead%20Do%20America"&gt;Beavis &amp; Butthead Do America&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. He started one of New York City's largest dance companies, The Kitchen, which is still in existence. He starred alongside &lt;a href="w%3AVal%20Kilmer"&gt;Val Kilmer&lt;/a&gt; in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWonderland%20%28film%29"&gt;Wonderland&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and his play ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATalk%20Radio%20%28play%29"&gt;Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was recently revived on Broadway with &lt;a href="w%3ALiev%20Schreiber"&gt;Liev Schreiber&lt;/a&gt; in the role Bogosian wrote and made famous. 

Currently at work on his third novel, tentatively titled ♡❤The Artist♡❤, Bogosian spoke with about the craft of writing and his life as a creative.

<h2>Bogosian's view of his work</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone: Which role are you most proud of?

♡❤♡DS: What kind of roles do you typically go for?

♡❤♡DS: And it's Woody Allen.

♡❤♡DS: If you could only choose one of these careers, what would you most want to go with?

<h2>How Bogosian approaches his writing</h2>
♡❤♡DS: When you tackled your first novel, was there ever a time when you were like, 'I don't even know how people get an entire novel out of their heads,' and you had to actually sit down and plot it? How did you approach your first novel?

♡❤♡DS: I saw that.

♡❤♡DS: Do you have an audience in mind when you write?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think the audience is shrinking for that sort of narrative?

♡❤♡DS: How do you break your novel out? How do you get it to stand apart? 

♡❤♡DS: Or if you have a particular point that you want to make. Some sort of allegory or some sort of commentary on society.

<h2>How Bogosian works himself into his writing</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Would you describe yourself as an experience junkie?

♡❤♡DS: Yeah.

♡❤♡DS: Would you say it comes from emotion and character?

♡❤♡DS: Do you draw any inspiration from the current political climate, either in the country or in the world?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think narrative is one of the more challenging aspects of writing?

♡❤♡DS: Do you ever ask yourself that question about your writing? 

♡❤♡DS: But do you ever ask yourself that question when you're writing, "Who cares?"

<h2>The future of the narrative</h2>
♡❤♡DS: When you look at the arc of &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20culture"&gt;American culture&lt;/a&gt;, in your experience, where do you see it heading?

♡❤♡DS: Something that's not apparent.

♡❤♡DS: I &lt;a href="John%20Reed%20on%20Orwell%2C%20God%2C%20self-destruction%20and%20the%20future%20of%20writing"&gt;interviewed a novelist named John Reed&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote this book called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASnowball%27s%20Chance"&gt;Snowball's Chance&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that was kind of a rip on &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Orwell"&gt;Orwell&lt;/a&gt;. We were talking about how limited the current narrative is--at least in the United States, where it's sin, suffer and redemption. John said he could foresee at some point these multidimensional narratives almost on a Biblical level come to fruition. Where you have various dimensions, and where it goes from the Internet to magazines to television and it ends up spanning different mediums. It's an interesting idea, and when you really think about it you can see it starting to happen. It's not being done quite yet, but you could envision it.

♡❤♡DS: But update it.

♡❤♡DS: --that this narrative is currently not popular.

♡❤♡DS: Nobody wants to find out why a person's troubled anymore?

♡❤♡DS: They just want to see what the effects are and how things resolve?

♡❤♡DS: Which are critically acclaimed but not commercially successful.

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Laughs♡❤]

♡❤♡DS: Well, it's been seen so many times that everyone knows where it's going; it gets to the point where you're like, okay, what is this? "Dejected Man"? Is this, "World Didn't Turn Out The Way You Thought It Would Man"? 

♡❤♡DS: In the end, the stories become uninteresting because you know it's going to be either a, b, c, or d that makes the conflict. Which is it going to be? People tend to like to read things because they want their interest grabbed. They don't want to read a book like when they watch a horror movie, knowing what is right around the corner.

♡❤♡DS: How is that person going to die? You know they're going to die. Are they going to be slashed across the throat? are they going to have a sword plunging through their stomach? are they going to be shot in the face?

♡❤♡DS: You know when you watch a horror movie the person's going to die; it's just a question of how.

♡❤♡DS: When you take that to a literary level, it starts becoming too formulaic, and people don't care how.

♡❤♡DS: Yeah.

♡❤♡DS: ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A30%20Days%20of%20Night%20%28film%29"&gt;30 Days of Night&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is a good example of that, too, where you did have a central character, but you didn't really go into the psychology of anything. It was based on a &lt;a href="w%3A30%20Days%20of%20Night"&gt;graphic novel&lt;/a&gt;. It's vampires in &lt;a href="w%3ABarrow%2C%20Alaska"&gt;Barrow, Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. You don't go into the vampires at all.

♡❤♡DS: One of the criticisms that somebody told me was that they really didn't go into the vampires. You had these creatures show up; they wanted to kill. They were interesting, but you didn't go into what motivated them--it became more about survival. You had all of these different scenarios and how people's lives affected how they reacted to this sudden threat that had entered their town.

♡❤♡DS: It was sort kind of a &lt;a href="w%3APinwheel%20narrative"&gt;pinwheel narrative&lt;/a&gt;, but you didn't get into, "What's driving them? What can stop them?"

<h2>Collaborations with Steven Spielberg and Frank Zappa</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What is something you notice missing from your Wikipedia article?

♡❤♡DS: What's it called?

♡❤♡DS: How do you come across these projects? 

♡❤♡DS: When you say, "were a more interesting person," who was that person?

♡❤♡DS: It's not as much of a collaboration as it is you're working on their project?

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Parish"&gt;Neil Parish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a Member of the &lt;a href="European%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and the chair of the Agricultural committee of the European Parliament, was recently interviewed by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ on the subject of biofuels and renewable transport. The interview was held after a workshop was held in the European Parliament on the subject of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abiofuel"&gt;biofuels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"I believe that the mixing of biofuels with mineral oils can provide us with significantly cleaner fuel," said Mr. Parish.

In a press release by the European Parliament about the workshop, the legislative body stated some possible disadvantages to biofuels:

In the interview Parish also said that encouraging public transport was an important method of combating climate change. Below is the relevant quote:

Mr. Parish also mentioned road pricing in the interview. 

Biofuels are often used because they provide a way of limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide. Many people do, however, note that rainforest are destroyed to make space for the production of biofuels.

A &lt;a href="w%3APegasus-XL"&gt;Pegasus-XL&lt;/a&gt; carrier rocket, air-launched by a &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20L-1011"&gt;Lockheed L-1011 TriStar&lt;/a&gt; flying from &lt;a href="w%3AKwajalein%20Atoll"&gt;Kwajalein Atoll&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Marshall%20Islands"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt;, has placed the much-delayed &lt;a href="w%3AC/NOFS"&gt;C/NOFS&lt;/a&gt; satellite into a &lt;a href="w%3Alow%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;low Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;.

C/NOFS, which stands for ♡❤♡Communications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System♡❤♡, will investigate and forecast scintillations in the Earth's ionosphere, which are responsible for degradation of signals from navigation and communications satellites. It was originally scheduled to launch in 2003, but owing to a string of delays, it was finally launched at 17:01 GMT today. It will be operated by the &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Force%20Research%20Laboratory"&gt;Air Force Research Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Test%20Program"&gt;Space Test Program&lt;/a&gt; offices of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt;.

The launch was conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AOrbital%20Sciences%20Corporation"&gt;Orbital Sciences Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first launch of a ♡❤Pegasus♡❤ rocket in almost a year. The next ♡❤Pegasus♡❤ is scheduled to launch in July, with &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AIBEX"&gt;IBEX&lt;/a&gt; satellite. The launch of C/NOFS is the 17 launch to orbit &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt; and the 39 orbital ♡❤Pegasus♡❤ launch.

Police reported on Monday, that a man in &lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; is recovering after he fell 25 feet down an elevator shaft early Sunday morning at 6:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20European%20Summer%20Time"&gt;CEST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B2"&gt;UTC+2&lt;/a&gt;), and survived. According to authorities, the only reason why the man is alive is because he landed on top of a woman who had fallen down the same shaft just one day earlier.

27-year-old Jens Wilhelms, who was not injured in the fall, was walking up a dark stairwell, passing by the elevator shaft which was undergoing repairs. When he peeked inside the open doors to see what was going on, he slipped off the edge.

"I saw the door open and I just wanted to check whether somebody was finally working on the elevator. I took a closer look inside the shaft as it was pitch black, and must have slipped off the edge somehow," said Wilhelms to the media.

Approximately 24 hours prior to Wilhelms' fall, an unidentified 57-year-old woman fell down the same shaft and was laying unconscious on the shaft's floor, bleeding internally.

Authorities say that although the woman sustained additional injuries from Wilhelms' fall, he likely saved her life.

"When Wilhelms fell down on her his weight caused additional damage to her body, but without that she could have laid there for days. The woman had been lying unconscious in the shaft for some time already," said Manfred Vonhausen, a spokesman for the Frankfurt Police Department.

The woman remains in a hospital where she is in critical condition.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Zimbabwe%27s%20election%20delay%20could%20have%20%27serious%20implications%27%2C%20warns%20UN%20Secretary-General&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; remarked on the post-election situation in &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, expressing concern about the failure of the election commission to release the results. He believes the delay could have "serious implications" for Zimbabwe's people.
At a summit in &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, which was attended by the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; leaders, Ban said the international community is waiting for "decisive action" from the governments of southern &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. "Absent a transparent solution to this impasse, the situation could deteriorate further with serious implications for the people of Zimbabwe," he said. "The credibility of the democratic process in Africa could be at stake here."

Ban said the UN is willing to help the &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20African%20Development%20Community"&gt;Southern African Development Community&lt;/a&gt; resolve the crisis, and added that a possible second round of elections would have to be conducted fairly and transparently, in the presence of international observers.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; agreed with the Secretary-General's remarks. He called on the international community to put more pressure on Zimbabwean president &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt;, who has been accused of rigging the election. 

"No one thinks, having seen the result at the polling stations, that President Mugabe has won this election," Brown said. "A stolen election would not be an election at all. The credibility of the democratic process depends on there being a legitimate government."

The summit was chaired by &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href="w%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt;, who insisted on Saturday that there was "no crisis" in Zimbabwe. &lt;a href="w%3AJacob%20Zuma"&gt;Jacob Zuma&lt;/a&gt;, leader of &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s ruling &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20National%20Congress"&gt;ANC&lt;/a&gt; party, disagreed with Mbeki, saying that "the situation is more worrying now given the reported violence that has erupted."

A new &lt;a href="w%3Aintelligent%20design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACreationism"&gt;creationist&lt;/a&gt; movie, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AExpelled%3A%20No%20Intelligence%20Allowed"&gt;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, starring &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Stein"&gt;Ben Stein&lt;/a&gt;, is scheduled to debut April 18, but several different sources have accused the film's producer of &lt;a href="w%3Acopyright%20violations"&gt;copyright violations&lt;/a&gt;. Though the movie has been criticized by Dr. &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Dawkins"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. &lt;a href="w%3APZ%20Myers"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;, and Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AEugenie%20Scott"&gt;Eugenie Scott&lt;/a&gt;, who said they were tricked into appearing in the film, as well as from movie critics and scientists, the legal issues might develop into trouble for the producers.

On April 9, a &lt;a href="w%3Acease%20and%20desist"&gt;cease-and-desist&lt;/a&gt; letter was sent to the producers of ♡❤Expelled♡❤, alleging that the appearance in the film of an identical copy of XVIVO's video entitled ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Inner%20Life%20of%20the%20Cell"&gt;The Inner Life of the Cell&lt;/a&gt;,♡❤ which was created in partnership with &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;, infringed on XVIVO/Harvard's property. Shortly after, a letter was sent by &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Bolinsky"&gt;David Bolinsky&lt;/a&gt; of XVIVO who wrote that ♡❤Expelled♡❤♡s misuse of XVIVO/Harvard's work is harmful to their work.

On April 16, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Wall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that ♡❤Expelled♡❤ producers did not receive permission to use &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Lennon"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="w%3AImagine%20%28song%29"&gt;Imagine&lt;/a&gt;" from &lt;a href="w%3AYoko%20Ono"&gt;Yoko Ono&lt;/a&gt;, who possesses the copyright on the music. At the same time, it was noted that the producer also did not receive permission from &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Killers%20%28band%29"&gt;The Killers&lt;/a&gt; for their song "All these Things That I Have Done." In addition, Myers believes ♡❤Expelled♡❤ copied material without permission from &lt;a href="w%3AWalter%20and%20Eliza%20Hall%20Institute%20of%20Medical%20Research"&gt;WEHI-TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Broadcasting%20Service"&gt;Public Broadcasting Service&lt;/a&gt;'s video ♡❤The Central Dogma: Transcription of DNA to RNA.♡❤

The topic of the film has also not been without controversy, as the scientific community does not believe intelligent design is valid &lt;a href="w%3Ascience"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;. Some scientists have panned the movie as "anti-science." Furthermore, the film received attention a month ago when Myers, who is interviewed and thanked in the film, was asked to leave a free screening of the movie by &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Mathis"&gt;Mark Mathis&lt;/a&gt;, the movie's associate producer. However, Mathis did not notice Dawkins standing in line next to Myers who subsequently saw the film and wrote critically of it.

The blast occurred outside an office of the ruling &lt;a href="w%3APSOE"&gt;Spanish Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;, and happened after a telephone warning. The building was seriously damaged.

The warning call came a half hour before the explosion, but a police patrol in the area had already spotted a suspicious package near the building. The officers were cordoning off the area when the bomb blasted. Seven were treated for minor injuries.

The bomb blast comes a day after Spain's parliament opened a new session. Five weeks ago, the Socialist Party was also directly attacked when &lt;a href="Spanish%20councillor%20shot%20and%20killed%20in%20the%20Basque%20Country"&gt;ETA killed a town councilman&lt;/a&gt; in the northern Basque town of Mondragon.

♡❤♡♡❤2008 Computex Taipei♡❤♡♡❤ (a.k.a Taipei International Information Technology Show), the second largest IT show in the world, will start on June 3 to 7 at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;TWTC&lt;/a&gt; Hall 1 &amp; 3, Taipei International Convention Center (TICC), and &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center%20Nangang%20Exhibition%20Hall"&gt;TWTC Nangang&lt;/a&gt;, in conjunction with 2008 WiMAX Expo Taipei, which will start earlier at the Taipei Show Hall 2. With two IT-related industry shows will be concurrently showcased in different venues, it will bring on many convergences and opportunities for networking and mobile-related industries worldwide including &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.

Since the Taipei Computer Association, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), and &lt;a href="w%3AIndustrial%20Technology%20Research%20Institute"&gt;Industrial Technology Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; preliminary imported the "" into the TICC, &lt;a href="w%3AWiMAX"&gt;WiMAX&lt;/a&gt;-related topics were mostly focused by several worldwide media and industrial elites. In extremity, some technologies and solutions like eSNG, wireless medical care, wireless transmission, and mobile entertainment were showcased there. And the MOEA also signed MOUs with 5 world-class WiMAX companies to help the networking industry last year in Taiwan.

Even though the signing of MOUs and new technologies will bring opportunities for WiMAX-related industries, and the mobile devices will be progressively popular in the future and more slim like an &lt;a href="w%3AUltra-Mobile%20PC"&gt;UMPC&lt;/a&gt;, but some companies from information security industry were worried about the future trend because of invisible threats on the Internet.

As of "Asia-pacific IT Security Forum" and "IT Security Pavilion" of SecuTech Expo 2008, there were several changes on participation from IT industry, but due to a major impact of "&lt;a href="w%3AEdison%20Chen%20photo%20scandal"&gt;Edison Chen's photo scandal&lt;/a&gt;", several crisis were exposed with improper habits on modern people when using the Internet.

It's a real deal that the WiMAX will bring different kind profits and benefits for different industries, but before the WiMAX became the trend, if Internet users didn't cultivate proper habits on using the Internet, the WiMAX will still bring on threats for end-users and industries.

&lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; has been angered by a decision of the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; to leave all 51 of the nation's air carriers on the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;list of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;. State-owned &lt;a href="w%3Aflag%20carrier"&gt;flag carrier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Garuda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; had hoped to begin flights to &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; imminently and has ordered ten new jetliners to serve routes there and to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Transport ministry spokesperson Bambang Ervan said "This seems like an unfair punishment for Indonesia. The EU is not a sovereign country and is not a member of the ICAO (&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organisation"&gt;International Civil Aviation Organisation&lt;/a&gt;). But we do respect the EU and its decision, and demand the same from the EU."

The ban was imposed after a string of accidents, of which the three most important were &lt;a href="Adam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;Flight 574&lt;/a&gt;, a 102-fatality accident in which a &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737-43Q&lt;/a&gt; plunged into the ocean after pilots distracted by instrument failure failed to maintain control, &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20172"&gt;Adam Air Flight 172&lt;/a&gt;, in which another B737 snapped in half after a hard landing and &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Garuda Indonesia Flight 200&lt;/a&gt;, in which a third B737 attempted landing at extreme speed and overshot the runway, killing 21.

Adam Air had also almost suffered a B737 crash the previous year, 2006, after a similar navigational instrument failure to that on Flight 574 caused the airliner to become lost for several hours, eventually performing an emergency landing hundreds of kilometres from its intended destination. Indonesia grounded the carrier in March after another accident in which a B737 overshot a runway. The carrier is also in severe financial difficulties and may soon be permanently shut down.

Meanwhile, the pilot of Garuda 200 has been charged over the accident, sparking intense controversy.

The EU reviewed the ban this week, but ruled that those responsible "have still to demonstrate that they have completed the corrective actions" needed to lift the ban. It is a blow to Indonesia, who had promised "fast-track" help to Garuda, &lt;a href="w%3AMandala%20Airlines"&gt;Mandala Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APremiair"&gt;Premiair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAirfast"&gt;Airfast&lt;/a&gt; to raise their safety to levels acceptable to the EU.

The President of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; George W. Bush met today with his UK counterpart &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, and addressed a press conference following the meeting in the Rose Garden of the White House.

President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; started the speech by saying that he appreciated the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASpecial%20Relationship%20%28US-UK%29"&gt;special relationship&lt;/a&gt; between the United Kingdom and the US. "we’re working very closely together," he said.

Bush continued by praising Mr. Brown for his reactions to the &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow%20Airport"&gt;Glasgow Airport&lt;/a&gt; terrorist attack last year. The attack occurred just days after Mr. Brown became Prime Minister.

The speech continued when Bush thanked the British Army for their work in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, which has been a subject of many newspaper headlines in the UK recently.

Bush then finished his part of the speech by commenting on &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;. "You can’t have elections unless you're willing to put the results out," he said, referring to the recent election. He also said that "more leaders in the region need to speak out" on the situation in Zimbabwe.

Brown then started speaking. He said that the bond between the UK and the US was getting stronger. He then said that both countries are making a 'strenuous effort' in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.

After admitting to price fixing on cargo services between &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Airlines"&gt;Japan Airlines&lt;/a&gt; (JAL) has been fined 110 million by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;United States Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.

Prosecutors allege JAL earned $2 billion illegally between 2000 and 2006, although it is possible the scheme was operating as early as 1995. &lt;a href="British%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AQantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt; all previously admitted being involved and paid fines. The cartel, which created artificially high prices by eliminating competition between its members, was exposed by whistleblower &lt;a href="w%3ALufthansa"&gt;Lufthansa&lt;/a&gt;, who alerted authorities in exchange for immunity to prosecution. Three other airlines are also involved.

JAL is the biggest carrier in Japan and the biggest carrier of cargo between Japan and the US.

Japan will not take any further action against the carrier. The investigation was performed by two US groups, the &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and the Department of Justice.

<h1>YouTube accounts of Scientology critics suspended</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=YouTube%20accounts%20of%20Scientology%20critics%20suspended&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Two well-known critics of &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; have had their user accounts on the video sharing website &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; suspended. The YouTube accounts of both &lt;a href="w%3ATory%20Christman"&gt;Tory Christman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Bunker"&gt;Mark Bunker&lt;/a&gt; were suspended this week. In a statement to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, YouTube explained why accounts are suspended, but did not specifically state why these particular accounts were suspended. Neither Christman nor Bunker received a notice or explanation from YouTube as to why their accounts were suspended.

On Tuesday April 15, &lt;a href="w%3ATory%20Christman"&gt;Tory Christman&lt;/a&gt; a former Scientologist and volunteer for their &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Special%20Affairs"&gt;Office of Special Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, and known as ♡❤ToryMagoo44♡❤ on YouTube, had her account suspended for unknown reasons. On Wednesday, after complaints to YouTube from other YouTube users and from members of the group &lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;, Christman's account was restored.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ confirmed Friday that &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Bunker"&gt;Mark Bunker&lt;/a&gt; known as 'xenutv1' on ♡❤YouTube♡❤, a &lt;a href="television"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; and critic of Scientology, had his user account suspended. This is the second time that Bunker's account was suspended. He was formerly known as 'xenutv' when his account was suspended the first time.

"I want to see the complaint and on what grounds did YouTube suspend my account. I have done nothing on that account that would violate any of their terms and my videos and account should not have been pulled. The only caveat to this is my first account "XenuTV" was suspended a while back for a Stephen Colbert video I had from Comedy Central. At that time I created XenuTV1 and according to YouTube's terms you can only have one account. Any time I have ever been asked to remove something that may violate their terms for copyright materials, I comply immediately. It would be wrong and a misuse of power to pull my account because of this lone loophole in their terms," said Bunker exclusively to ♡❤Wikinews.♡❤
Bunker, who is also the owner of the anti-&lt;a href="w%3AScientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; website www.xenutv.com, has become known as ♡❤Wise Beard Man♡❤ to Anonymous. He was interviewed by ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in February. Bunker started XenuTV in 1999 and began to make videos that he provided for the &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20McPherson%20Trust"&gt;Lisa McPherson Trust&lt;/a&gt;. Bunker has been a critic of the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; since 1997.

In 2006, he won a &lt;a href="w%3AEmmy%20Award%23Regional_Emmys"&gt;Regional Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt; after he and &lt;a href="w%3AKUSI-TV"&gt;KUSI-TV&lt;/a&gt; news reporter Lena Lewis produced a documentary news video on the issues with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; border with &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

With permission from Christman, Bunker responded to his account's suspension with a video post to her YouTube channel on Thursday. Bunker stated: "This afternoon at 2:41, I found out YouTube canceled my account. No justification was given to me, I got no notice from them, and there appears to be no recourse. And why did this happen? Because the Jason Beghe interview was about to be posted - and Scientology did not want anyone to see that. My tease for the Jason Beghe interview went up on Sunday, and by this afternoon we had almost six hundred thousand views, and it had been profiled in newscasts around the world. There is a lot of tension being drawn to this video, and Scientology wanted to stop it."

&lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Beghe"&gt;Jason Beghe&lt;/a&gt; is a television and film actor who joined Scientology in 1994. He gave &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;1 million to the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; over the years, and told Roger Friedman of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFOX%20News"&gt;FOX News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that Scientology head &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miscavige"&gt;David Miscavige&lt;/a&gt; called him "the poster boy for Scientology". Beghe appeared in promotional videos for Scientology in 2005. In April 2008 he left Scientology, and contacted &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Heldal-Lund"&gt;Andreas Heldal-Lund&lt;/a&gt;, who put him in touch with Mark Bunker. Bunker arranged an interview with Beghe, which was uploaded to Bunker's YouTube account on April 7. The posted video is a 3-minute portion of a larger 3-hour interview with Beghe about his criticism of Scientology. In the video Beghe states: "Scientology is destructive and a rip-off. ... It’s very, very dangerous for your spiritual, psychological, mental, emotional health and evolution. "

In an interview with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, Tory Christman commented on the suspension of her account, and now Bunker's: "Well having worked for the Office of Special Affairs which is part of the Church of Scientology, they used to have me go out and open up phony accounts, I didn't know they were stopping free speech on the net but once I realized that ... I said 'I can't do this, I didn't get into Scientology to stop free speech'. ... I'm pretty sure, you know, I'm quite sure, that it's Scientology. That's what they do, that's their view is just 'shut em down' they have no morals on it or anything. They just figure 'screw em, shut em down'."

Christman said she found out her YouTube account had been suspended on Tuesday: "I came back from lunch at four and Mark called me and said 'Do you know your account is suspended?', and by the morning of yesterday it was back up."

When asked if she had received a notice about the suspension from YouTube, Christman responded: "I never got anything, and I've looked through everything, I never got any kind of a notice, either way. ... I never heard from YouTube either way - suspending it, or putting it back. And I've written them, and it was only put back thanks to Anonymous and all the critics and people that wrote in to them, I'm quite sure - Because tons of people did, it wasn't like they just put it back up." 

"I would like to know, why was it suspended, why is Mark's suspended, what are the violations, okay, because if the Church of Scientology is just paying them off that's kind of weird, isn't it?," added Christman.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ asked Christman if she knew if the suspension of Bunker's account had anything to do with the interview with Jason Beghe: "Why Jason's video was pulled, I don't know, and I've spoken to Jason and he didn't know either."

She told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤: "I would like to know why. Someone should have a right to be told 'you are screwing up on this, remove this video' ... 'change it'. But to never be notified and then just you're suspended, that's kind of weird, I think. And I have every intention of either, YouTube can contact me, or I'm going to keep contacting ... they need to let the people know what is going on."
A YouTube spokeswoman told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that they would respond to our e-mails "as soon as possible." Within two hours YouTube issued a statement to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ saying that they "do not comment on individual videos."

"YouTube takes these issues very seriously but we don't comment on individual videos. Our general approach is simple: we have clear content policies about what videos are allowed on the site. For example we prohibit clips that infringe copyright or show extreme violence. Videos that breach these rules are removed and we disable all accounts belonging to repeat offenders," said a spokesperson for YouTube. When asked, YouTube did not state when or if Bunker's account will be reinstated.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS), a &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20Magnitude%20Scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 5.2 earthquake has struck parts of &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, and other Midwestern states in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The USGS states that the quake hit at 4:37 a.m. (&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone"&gt;central time&lt;/a&gt;) approximately 9 kilometers (6 miles) northwest of &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Carmel%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Mount Carmel&lt;/a&gt; and had a depth of just over three miles. It could be felt as far away as &lt;a href="w%3AMilwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;.

So far there are no reports of injuries, damage or deaths, but the USGS states that the damage could be light to moderate with isolated areas having heavy damage. About 7,000 people live in Mount Carmel.

A magnitude 4.6 &lt;a href="w%3Aaftershock"&gt;aftershock&lt;/a&gt; hit at 10:15 am (&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone"&gt;central time&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;a href="Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; Friday, as part of his &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20journeys%20of%20Pope%20Benedict%20XVI%23United%20States%20%28April%2015%20to%20April%2020%2C%202008%29"&gt;visit&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The first part of his visit was spent in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;. He arrived on "Shepherd One", a specially dedicated plane belonging to &lt;a href="w%3AAlitalia"&gt;Alitalia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Aflag%20carrier"&gt;flag carrier&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.

On the first day of his visit to &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, he went to the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (UN) and addressed the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. In his speech he urged leaders to solve world crises together, though the world still remains subject to "the decisions of a few," whom he did not name. Benedict XVI is the third &lt;a href="w%3APope"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; to address the United Nations in person.

The primary focus of his speech was about dialogue, diplomacy and human rights. He delivered the speech in both &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20language"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;. Benedict XVI said it was the duty of every nation to guarantee &lt;a href="human%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;.

"If states are unable to guarantee such protection, it is then up to the international community to intervene with the legal means that are provided for under the United Nations Charter and other international instruments," the Pope said.

The Pope argued that national sovereignty should not stand in the way of protecting human rights. "On the contrary, it is indifference or non-intervention which cause the real harm," he said.

The concept of "responsibility to protect," has also been championed by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;UN Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt;, in seeking international action in regions like &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;.

Benedict XVI said that religion should not be excluded at the UN because it is "a social order respectful of the dignity and rights of the person." He further added "It should never be necessary to deny God in order to enjoy one's rights. The rights associated with religion are all the more in need of protection if they are considered to clash with a prevailing secular ideology or with majority religious positions of an exclusive nature."

On Friday afternoon, after the UN address, Benedict met with members of the local &lt;a href="Judaism"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; clergy at the &lt;a href="w%3APark%20East%20Synagogue"&gt;Park East Synagogue&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3AUpper%20East%20Side"&gt;Upper East Side&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOrthodox%20Judaism"&gt;Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asynagogue"&gt;synagogue&lt;/a&gt; in New York City.

"The Jewish community make a valuable contribution to the life of the city," Benedict XVI told the congregation, "and I encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood."

&lt;a href="w%3ARabbi"&gt;Rabbi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArthur%20Schneier"&gt;Arthur Schneier&lt;/a&gt; told the Pope, that the visit was "a reaffirmation of your outreach, good will, and commitment to enhancing Jewish-Catholic relations."

Thursday, Benedict XVI held &lt;a href="w%3AMass%20%28liturgy%29"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ANationals%20Park"&gt;Nationals Park&lt;/a&gt; with an estimated 47,000 people attending. During the Mass he spoke about the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20sex%20abuse%20cases%20by%20country%23United%20States"&gt;sexual abuse by clergy&lt;/a&gt;. "No words of mine can describe the pain and harm inflicted by such abuse nor the damage that has occurred within the community of the church," he said. "I ask you to love your priests and affirm the good works they do."

Afterwards, Benedict XVI met privately with some of the abuse victims. Reverend Federico Lombardi, a spokeperson, said he met with five or six abuse victims for approximately 25 minutes.

One of these victims, Bernie McDaid, told &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (AP) about his meeting. "I said, 'Holy Father, you need to know you have a cancer in your flock and I hope you will do something for this problem; you have to fix this,'" McDaid said. "He looked down at the floor and back at me, like, 'I know what you mean.' He took it in emotionally. We looked eye to eye."

Olan Horne, another victim who has worked with McCaid told AP, "I believe we turned the pope's head a little in the right direction."

According to a Vatican official, &lt;a href="w%3ACardinal%20%28Catholicism%29"&gt;Cardinal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASe%C3%A1n%20P.%20O%27Malley"&gt;Seán P. O'Malley&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AArchbishop"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of Boston, gave the Pope a list of some 1,000 boys and girls who had been abused in the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Boston"&gt;Boston Archdiocese&lt;/a&gt; going back several decades.

"The fact that we finally got the pope to actually stand up and put a statement on record, I really think he set the bar this week," said Gary Bergeron to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Bergeron says he was abused by a priest in &lt;a href="w%3ALowell%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Lowell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.

Later on Thursday, Benedict met with religious leaders of various faiths at the &lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II%20Cultural%20Center"&gt;Pope John Paul II Cultural Center&lt;/a&gt;. He told them that, "Americans have always valued the ability to worship freely and in accordance with their conscience". He added, "children of all religions sit side-by-side, learning with one another and from one another. This diversity gives rise to new challenges that spark a deeper reflection on the core principles of a democratic society. 

"May others take heart from your experience, realising that a united society can indeed arise from a plurality of peoples, ... provided that all recognize religious liberty as a basic civil right," the pontiff said.

During the next couple of days in New York, Pope Benedict XVI is scheduled to hold Mass at &lt;a href="w%3AYankee%20Stadium"&gt;Yankee Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and visit the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center site&lt;/a&gt;.

Stagnant air spread today across southern and eastern parts of &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; including the capital city, &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

The police, fire and water services as well as the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMet%20Office"&gt;Met Office&lt;/a&gt; were all asked to give an explanation for the smell. The police and fire services were at a loss as to how to respond, but &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AThames%20Water"&gt;Thames Water&lt;/a&gt; assured its customers that there were no problems with any of its water treatment plants. A Met Office spokesperson explained that "over the last few days, we've had fresh, strong winds from an easterly direction. As a result some of our air is coming from continental Europe." The westerly wind which England usually receives is less pungent, having arrived from the Atlantic.

Geoff Dollard, an air quality expert, told the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ADaily%20Mail"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; "The feeling is that it's natural".

The origin of the smell is therefore thought to be from manure recently spread on continental &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an farms (from &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;). A spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANational%20Farmers%20Union%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29"&gt;National Farmers Union&lt;/a&gt; said: "This has happened before. In Holland and Belgium they are spreading millions of tons of muck at the moment. It is a countryside smell."

The stench is expected to die down over the weekend but Met Office spokeswoman Helen Chivers says that if there are no south or south-westerly winds, "it is possible it may hang around until Tuesday".

At 22:17 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; this evening, &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;'s first satellite, &lt;a href="w%3AVinasat-1"&gt;Vinasat-1&lt;/a&gt; was launched aboard an &lt;a href="w%3AAriane%205"&gt;Ariane 5ECA&lt;/a&gt; rocket, from the &lt;a href="w%3AGuiana%20Space%20Centre"&gt;Guiana Space Centre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AKourou"&gt;Kourou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;French Guiana&lt;/a&gt;. 

The launch was conducted by the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an organisation &lt;a href="w%3AArianespace"&gt;Arianespace&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;lian satellite, &lt;a href="w%3AStar%20One%20C-2"&gt;Star One C-2&lt;/a&gt;, was also launched on the same flight. The satellites will be placed into &lt;a href="w%3Ageosynchronous%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous orbit&lt;/a&gt;s, 35,000 kilometres above the equator, from where they will provide telecommunications services to various parts of the world. Star One C-2 separated from the carrier rocket 26 minutes after lift-off, and Vinasat-1 separated 31 minutes into the flight, completing a successful ascent.

Vinasat-1 will be operated by the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20Posts%20and%20Telecommunications%20Corporation"&gt;Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. It was constructed by &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;, and is based on the &lt;a href="w%3AA2100A"&gt;A2100A&lt;/a&gt; satellite bus. It will provide &lt;a href="w%3AC-band"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKu-Band"&gt;Ku-Band&lt;/a&gt; communications. It will be positioned in a geosynchronous orbital slot at 132°E longitude, high above Vietnam. It has an expected on-orbit lifetime of 15 years and weighs 2637 &lt;a href="w%3Akilograms"&gt;kilograms&lt;/a&gt;. The programme was started in 1998, and launch was originally scheduled for 2005, but was delayed due to political issues concerning the communication frequencies that it was to use.

The other satellite being launched is Star One C-2, which will be operated by &lt;a href="w%3AStar%20One%20%28satellite%20operator%29"&gt;Star One&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on the &lt;a href="w%3ASpaceBus%203000B3"&gt;SpaceBus 3000B3&lt;/a&gt; satellite bus, and was constructed by &lt;a href="w%3AThales%20Alenia%20Space"&gt;Thales Alenia Space&lt;/a&gt;. It has a mass of 4100 kilograms, and is equipped with C, Ku, and &lt;a href="w%3AX-band"&gt;X-band&lt;/a&gt; transponders. It will be positioned in a geosynchronous orbit at 65°W longitude, to provide services to the Americas.

This was the 18 orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the second to be conducted by an Ariane 5. It was the 182 launch to be conducted by Arianespace, and the 38 launch of an Ariane 5. The next Ariane launch is scheduled for late May, with &lt;a href="w%3ASkynet%205C"&gt;Skynet 5C&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ATurksat%203A"&gt;Turksat 3A&lt;/a&gt; for Turksat.

Speaking after the launch had been confirmed to be a success, Jean-Yves Le Gall, the CEO of Arianespace remarked that he was "delighted to share...this new success", and that he appreciated the customers' trust. Jean-Marie Robert, of Thales Alenia Space, thanked Star One for trusting in their ability to deliver the satellite, and said that he hoped the satellite would have very long lives. Lincoln Oliveira, the CTO of Star One, thanked Arianespace and Thales Alenia Space for the success of his company's satellites. He also congratulated Vietnam on its first satellite launch. Lindsey Thompson, the Vice President for programmes of Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems, thanked her company's employees for the success of the mission, and wished Vinasat-1 well. Doan Hop Le, Vietnam's Minister of Information Technology and Communications said that the successful launch was important for "confirming sovereignty of Vietnam in space", that it had "great technical and socio-economic significance", and that it brought "Vietnam's communication industry up to a new height".

<h1>Putin orders Russian government to normalize relations with Georgia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Putin%20orders%20Russian%20government%20to%20normalize%20relations%20with%20Georgia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; has instructed government officials to normalize relations with neighboring &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, two days after Russia's decision to establish ties with the separatist Georgian regions of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Ossetia"&gt;South Ossetia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbkhazia"&gt;Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

According to the Russian foreign ministry, Putin ordered authorities to hold talks with Georgia aimed at lifting bans on Georgian imports of wine and mineral water, which were banned in 2006. He also ordered the renewal of postal ties with Georgia and an end to visa restrictions. These sanctions were also imposed on Georgia in 2006, after Georgia arrested four Russian servicemen on charges of spying.
"The federal authorities have been assigned to take steps to lift the remaining visa restrictions for Georgian nationals, to speed up the restoration of border crossing at Verkhniy Larc, and to begin bilateral consultations at the experts' level on the issues of access for Georgian goods on the Russian market," said Mikhail Kaminin, a spokesman for Russia's foreign ministry.

Putin's attempt at normalizing relations with Georgia came two days after he announced Russia's intent to strengthen ties with the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are recognized by most countries as part of Georgia. Russia's decision alarmed Georgia, who called it an attempt to annex the regions.
At a meeting with &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; officials in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Georgian Vice-Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGiorgi%20Baramidze"&gt;Giorgi Baramidze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said Russia had "crossed the red line" with their decision. "We request the international community's support in order not to let Russia legalize the de facto annexation of these territories," he said.

Russia hopes the efforts to lift sanctions on Georgia will improve relations between the two countries. "We hope that our actions in this direction will be received properly by the leadership of Georgia, from which we expect positive steps in response," the foreign ministry said.

But some Georgian officials are already having doubts regarding the sincerity of Russia's actions. "Russia is trying to create the illusion of a mood of cooperation with Georgia," said Georgian foreign minister David Bakradze. "We are sure that this attempt by the Russian authorities will not lead to the fooling of our American and European friends." 

The European Union has urged Russia not to establish ties with the separatist regions and asked both countries to "refrain from any actions that could lead towards the escalation of the situation in the region". &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; also criticized Russia's decision. She called her Russian counterpart &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Lavrov"&gt;Sergei Lavrov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to express her concern. "We are very concerned at the steps that have been taken and we have made our views known," Rice told reporters.

What began as a new gas vent (&lt;a href="wikt%3Afumarole"&gt;fumarole&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href="w%3AHalema%60uma%60u%20crater"&gt;Halema&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; uma&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; u crater&lt;/a&gt; sometime between March 10 and March 12 2008, has progressed to be the first explosive eruption in Halema&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; uma&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; u Crater since 1924, and the first lava erupted from the crater since 1982. The gases accompanying the eruption have prompted the Hawai&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; i Dept. of Health to announce no-burn days for the island sugar cane industries.

The March 19 explosion of the gas vent partially destroyed the Halema&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; uma&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; u Crater Overlook. On April 9 2008, thousands of people were evacuated from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and the nearby villages because &lt;a href="w%3Asulfur%20dioxide"&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt; reached critical levels creating a very dangerous &lt;a href="wikt%3Avog"&gt;vog&lt;/a&gt;. The evacuation lasted two days. Two more explosions occurred on April 9 2008 and April 16 2008, the latter spreading a faintly pink ash on the Overlook parking lot. Scientists think molten &lt;a href="w%3Alava"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; may reside at a shallow depth within the new vent.

Halema&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; uma&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; u is a &lt;a href="w%3Apit%20crater"&gt;pit crater&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href="wikt%3Acaldera"&gt;summit caldera&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href="w%3AK%C4%ABlauea"&gt;Kīlauea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawai&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii%20Volcanoes%20National%20Park"&gt;Volcanoes National Park&lt;/a&gt;. The roughly circular caldera measures 3x5 km (or 6x6 km, including the outermost ring faults). According to the traditions of the native people, Halema&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; uma&lt;span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode'"&gt;ʻ&lt;/span&gt; u is home to &lt;a href="w%3APele%20%28deity%29"&gt;Pele&lt;/a&gt;, Goddess of Hawaiian volcanoes.

This morning, the &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20TMA-11"&gt;Soyuz TMA-11&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft landed in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, with three cosmonauts aboard. &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AYuri%20Malenchenko"&gt;Yuri Malenchenko&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeggy%20Whitson"&gt;Peggy Whitson&lt;/a&gt; were returning from the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, where they had spent six months as the &lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2016"&gt;Expedition 16&lt;/a&gt; crew. &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AYi%20So-yeon"&gt;Yi So-yeon&lt;/a&gt;, the first South Korean to fly in space, was also aboard the spacecraft, having spent eleven days in orbit. Landing was scheduled for 08:30 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, however due to an anomaly during re-entry, it occurred at 08:51, 21 minutes behind schedule. Owing to a communication outage, it took some time to confirm that the spacecraft was on the ground.

A controlled ballistic descent profile was used, which differs from the planned re-entry profile in that it is steeper. The command to switch to this profile was given by the on-board computer during re-entry, after an unspecified anomaly was detected. &lt;a href="w%3ARSC%20Energia"&gt;RSC Energia&lt;/a&gt;, the manufacturer of the &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20spacecraft"&gt;Soyuz spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; stated that this profile is considered a nominal backup, and that it was too early to speculate what caused it. Landing occurred 475 kilometres short, to the west of the scheduled landing site. The same backup profile was used during the landing of the previous Soyuz mission, &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20TMA-10"&gt;Soyuz TMA-10&lt;/a&gt;, last October.

All three crewmembers were reported to be in satisfactory health. During re-entry, there was an unusually long loss-of-signal, which caused concern for flight controllers, as well as the &lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2017"&gt;Expedition 17&lt;/a&gt; crew of the ISS.

A student at &lt;a href="w%3AGlen%20A.%20Wilson%20High%20School"&gt;Glen A. Wilson High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHacienda%20Heights%2C%20California"&gt;Hacienda Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; was arrested Friday on suspicion of making criminal threats against students. The student arrested, described as a male minor by &lt;a href="w%3AHacienda%20La%20Puente%20Unified%20School%20District"&gt;Hacienda La Puente Unified School District&lt;/a&gt; police, confessed to making threats against students at the high school via a post to the &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; article about the school.

The student was arrested on Friday at approximately 11:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt;, according to a statement from Hacienda La Puente Unified School District Department of Police and Safety Chief Al Vasquez made to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APasadena%20Star-News"&gt;Pasadena Star-News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The student made "a complete confession", said Superintendent Barbara Nakaoka to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWhittier%20Daily%20News"&gt;Whittier Daily News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. She also said that "Our police officers are continuing to work with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to determine the validity of the threat."

Sheriff's Lt. Victor Sotelo told the ♡❤Whittier Daily News♡❤ that the police filed a "detain petition" which recommends that the minor not be released to his parents, and be held at Juvenile Hall. The &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Youth%20Authority"&gt;California Youth Authority&lt;/a&gt; will decide what happens next to the boy. Lt. Sotelo said that law enforcement searched the student's home and recovered evidence.

A Wikipedia administrator by the username Dreadstar notified others about the threat in a post to the "&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AAdministrators%27%20noticeboard/Incidents"&gt;Administrators' noticeboard&lt;/a&gt;" on Wednesday at 8:58 p.m. PST, saying: "Can someone review this threat to see if any action should be taken?" John Reaves, another Wikipedia administrator, contacted local police in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; at 9:40 p.m. PST, and was in contact with a detective in order to work with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;Internet service provider&lt;/a&gt; to find more information on the &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; that made the threat. 
&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/a&gt; sheriff's officials contacted Hacienda La Puente Unified School District police and informed them of a threat made against Glen A. Wilson High School posted to its article on Wikipedia. Two threats were made via posts to the Wikipedia article: an initial post, and a subsequent threat when the first post was removed by a Wikipedia editor. 

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ quoted a portion of the threats: "This is a warning. Do not remove this from this page. On Friday, April 18, 2008, there will be a shooting at this school. Current list of victims to be shot on this day: ...", said the initial post. The post named a hit list of specific students, and also said a shooting would affect "a good majority of the badminton team and almost every single fob." The poster threatened: "Take this text down and it will guarantee their death..." 

While police were in the process of contacting the specific students named in the threat, a second threat was made on Wikipedia: "You removed my last edit. I gave you a fair warning. Now the people listed in my previous edit will be victims in the Glen A. Wilson Shooting to occur this Friday. Your lack of attention to the seriousness of my warning will now be the reason as to why you will receive all fault of this event." The threats were later removed from the edit history of the article by Wikipedia administrator Persian Poet Gal, at 9:08 p.m. PDT on Friday, after the student had been arrested.
All students' backpacks were searched before classes began Thursday. At the time Hacienda La Puente Unified School District police told the ♡❤Pasadena Star-News♡❤ that the random checks were a precautionary measure related to the upcoming anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbine%20High%20School%20massacre"&gt;Columbine High School massacre&lt;/a&gt;, which took place April 20, 1999. &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Harris"&gt;Eric Harris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADylan%20Klebold"&gt;Dylan Klebold&lt;/a&gt; killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded many others in &lt;a href="w%3AColumbine%20High%20School"&gt;Columbine High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; before committing suicide.

Classes were canceled at the high school on Friday. In a statement to the ♡❤Los Angeles Times♡❤, Chief Al Vasquez explained the decision to close the school: "If I had not thought it was credible, we would not have closed the school. I mean, not one but two threats." Chief Vasquez said that the high school would be open for classes on Monday.

The first event was a visit to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center site&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALower%20Manhattan"&gt;Lower Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.

The Pope rode his &lt;a href="w%3APopemobile"&gt;Popemobile&lt;/a&gt; down a ramp, to the bottom of the site. Accompanied by &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Egan"&gt;Cardinal Edward Egan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20New%20York"&gt;archbishop of New York&lt;/a&gt;, he knelt at a rectangular pool and prayed silently for the victims of the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;. Then he held up a single lit candle, before he began to speak.

"Turn to your way of love those whose hearts and minds are consumed with hatred," the Pope said. "Grant that those whose lives were spared may live so that lives lost here may not have been lost in vain."

"God of peace, bring your peace to our violent world; peace in the hearts of all men and women and peace among the nations of the earth," he said. Afterwards, he met with family members of 16 of the victims and also with four of the rescue workers.

"I didn't really have anything to say to him," George Bachmann, a now-retired fire fighter, who broke his back and suffered burns as a first responder. "Being in his presence was enough for me."

In the afternoon on Sunday, Benedict XVI travelled to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bronx"&gt;The Bronx&lt;/a&gt; to hold &lt;a href="w%3AMass%20%28liturgy%29"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AYankee%20Stadium"&gt;Yankee Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, which is the home &lt;a href="w%3Abaseball%20park"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="baseball"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; team. The stadium has been the scene of papal Masses by Paul VI in 1965 and John Paul II in 1979.

The Popemobile entered the stadium at 2:19 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;) and drove around the baseball field in front of the crowd of over 57,000.

"Your pastoral visit is for all of us gathered here in New York a blessing for which we are all grateful," said Cardinal Egan in his introduction. "It is an extraordinary privilege to be allowed to tell you what a deep and appreciated grace your presence is for all of us."

Benedict XVI told the crowd that the Mass was "a summons to move forward with firm resolve to use wisely the blessings of freedom, in order to build a future of hope for coming generations."

During the &lt;a href="w%3Ahomily"&gt;homily&lt;/a&gt;, the Pope said "The Gospel teaches us that true freedom, the freedom of the children of God, is found only in the self-surrender which is part of the mystery of love. Only by losing ourselves, the Lord tells us, do we truly find ourselves." He also touched on the subjects of peace, human rights and religious freedom which had been hallmarks of his previous addresses while in the United States.

It also marked the 200th anniversary of the archdioces in New York, &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Philadelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Louisville"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt;, which were all created in April 1808.

"It's like Jesus Christ visiting America," Clemens Semon, 50, a resident of &lt;a href="w%3AOzone%20Park%2C%20Queens"&gt;Ozone Park, Queens&lt;/a&gt; who immigrated from &lt;a href="Ivory%20Coast"&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/a&gt; told ♡❤The New York Times♡❤. "You see how many pack together, come together to see him? He's a unifier, he brings hope and peace."
Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Lynne Cheney joined the Pope for the farewell ceremony at New York's &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport"&gt;John F. Kennedy International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Senator and presidential candidate &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and former President &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; had been expected, but did not attend. They were even mentioned in Cheney's prepared remarks. 

"You've encountered a nation facing many challenges, but with more blessings than anyone could count," Cheney said in his five-minute speech. "All Americans respect your message of peace, justice and freedom."

In the Pope's remarks, the pontiff mentioned the visit to the World Trade Center site, "My visit this morning to Ground Zero will remain firmly etched in my memory." His last comment as he turned to leave was, "May God Bless America."

Benedict XVI waved goodbye from the doorway of his &lt;a href="w%3AAlitalia"&gt;Alitalia&lt;/a&gt; "&lt;a href="w%3AShepherd%20One"&gt;Shepherd One&lt;/a&gt;" at 8:40 p.m. EDT.

The papal airplane "Shepherd One" touched down at &lt;a href="w%3ARome%20Ciampino%20Airport"&gt;Rome Ciampino Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, at 10:40 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20European%20Summer%20Time"&gt;CEST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B2"&gt;UTC+2&lt;/a&gt;) on Monday.

It provides information on a variety of different issues. One of these is receiving organ donations. “The decision to receive a donated organ should be made after receiving competent medical
counsel and confirmation through prayer,” says the handbook.

The handbook also explicitly bans assisted suicide. It claims that “a person who participates in &lt;a href="w%3Aeuthanasia"&gt;euthanasia&lt;/a&gt;, including so-called assisted suicide, violates the commandments of &lt;a href="w%3AGod"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;.”

The guide also mentions cremation. The guide says that “cremation is not encouraged,” although it is permitted.

The finances of the church are also discussed in the handbook. It says that "when tithes and other offerings are given to the Church, they belong to the Lord, to whom they are consecrated. These offerings include all contributions to the ward and general missionary funds." It then says that it is " therefore improper to refund missionary or other contributions to contributors." As with all other charities, the process of not returning donations complies with tax and legal requirements.

Eleven people have died after a military helicopter crashed during an anti-narcotics flight in Western &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ABell%20212"&gt;Bell 212&lt;/a&gt; went down near &lt;a href="w%3AUruapan"&gt;Uruapan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMichoac%C3%A1n"&gt;Michoacan&lt;/a&gt;.

Michoacan is a major area in Mexico's anti-narcotics operations, which are conducted by the nation's military. The rotorcraft went down around midday. Police cordoned off the scene and forensic officers have moved in to examine the site. The Defense Department is investigating.

A statement by the military confirmed the crash. "There are 11 men dead, including a colonel, and one soldier was injured," said a state attorney general's office spokesman. The wounded soldier, who was the sole survivor, was flown to a &lt;a href="w%3AMexico%20City"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; military hospital, and remains there in a serious condition.

Although authorities released no crash details, witnesses say the helicopter lost power during attempts to land. "The motor stopped and the helicopter plummeted to the ground," said one local resident named Agustin Vargas. The flight had been headed to a &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; field with the intention of raiding it.

A civilian known as 'Jimmy Justice' who resides in &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; (NYC), &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, the largest city in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, has been videotaping NYC police officers and city workers, breaking the law while on the job.

Since 2007, he claims to have caught "hundreds of officers and other city employees violating the law," and says he has them all on camera. He has posted his best confrontations with them to the video sharing website &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, Justice states that he has been asked to do a United States television show and ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ got an exclusive interview with him. For protection, Justice wished not to be called by his real name in fear of police retaliation.

Last year, Justice videotaped a police officer parking in front of a fire hydrant, but has only recently gained attention on social networking news sites such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADigg"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Areddit"&gt;reddit.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . So ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ contacted Mr. Justice, known as ♡❤JimmyJustice4753♡❤ on YouTube, for an exclusive interview to find out what caused him to get revenge on the law. 

On June 30, 2007, Justice caught officer E. Anderson of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Police%20Department"&gt;NYPD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , traffic division, parking directly in front of a fire hydrant while she went inside a restaurant to take a 15 minute lunch break.

"Do you think there is something wrong with parking a vehicle, blocking a fire hydrant,?" says Justice while following Anderson to her car after her meal.

"Mrs. Anderson I'm talking to you," says Justice as Anderson ignores him. "You parked your vehicle blocking a fire hydrant. You are not allowed to do that. Somebody else would get a ticket for that. Why are you allowed to do it? You should be ashamed of yourself Mrs. Anderson."

By this time, the incident has gained the interest of people nearby the scene and passing it. One unidentified woman, who claims to be a retired NYC police officer decides to intervene stating that people "are not supposed to film any police, [or] anybody employed with the police department because of the terrorism." A short time later the woman walked off camera.

Since 2007 Justice says he has caught "hundreds of law enforcement officers and city officials" on "over 30 hours of video" violating laws from illegal U-turns in business districts to blocking bus stops and fire hydrants. Justice has only uploaded the "most colorful ones to YouTube" and recently, on April 8, 2008, Justice videotaped a NYPD tow truck officer blocking a hydrant while he also ate lunch inside a restaurant. According to NYC law, it is illegal for any vehicle to park within 15 feet of a fire hydrant and to park in front of a bus stop. It is also illegal for any person to make a U-turn in a business district. Fines for these violations can cost a driver up to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; $115.00 for each violation occurred.

When ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ asked Justice why he decided to start filming the violations made by officials he answered, "what bothers me is watching an officer write someone a summons and then commit the exact same violation with their official vehicle. I started making these videos to remind the officers (and complacent civilians) that City employees have to abide by the same laws that they are paid to enforce. I plan on doing this and inspiring others to do this as well as a means of leveling the playing field against discourteous officers."

"In NYC, the traffic cops are notorious for their draconian indiscretion in handing out summonses to civilians for petty violations. Obviously the laws are not enforced as a matter of public safety, but rather to raise revenue," added Justice.

Justice makes little effort to get the violations on videotape saying "all I have to do to catch them is open my eyes."

"The problem with abuse of authority is rampant in New York City. I take my video camera with me on the way to work and on the way to social events and band rehearsals and when I see action it takes me less than 4 seconds to have the camera out and in record mode," states Justice.

His videos have drawn the attention of media and he has been featured on ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AABC"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's♡❤ 'I-caught videos' and ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInside%20Edition"&gt;Inside Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .♡❤ Justice also states that the popularity of his videos have gotten the attention producers in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHollywood"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and as a result, there are plans for a television show.

Since Justice began getting even with officials and their violations, he states that there has been a positive change in the communities.

"The publicity my videos have received has effected positive change in the community, but we still have a long road ahead of us," added Justice.

As a result of his videos, at the time the NYPD launched an investigation into the violations, but it is not known if any officers were charged or punished. Justice himself has never been arrested, but has been assaulted.

"I have never been arrested for this yet but they have threatened me with arrest. I have been spit on, cursed at, assaulted, and I had 2 cameras broken already," added Justice.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
According to police in &lt;a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, no one was injured after a &lt;a href="w%3Asemi-trailer%20truck"&gt;semi-trailer truck&lt;/a&gt; carrying paper from &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; hit a railroad &lt;a href="w%3Aviaduct"&gt;viaduct&lt;/a&gt;, tearing the truck in half.

At approximately 11:00 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;) on April 21, an unidentified man driving the truck westbound on Walden Avenue between Wasmuth and Roetzer streets hit the viaduct which tore his truck in half sending debris and cargo over most of the road.

Police describe the truck's cabin as a "can of sardines."

"He made it all the way through, but his truck looks like a can of sardines," said officers on police radio communications who were on scene. 

The driver was given a traffic citation and admits he did not notice signs posted along Walden which state the bridge's clearance.

The street and the viaduct remained closed into the early morning hours of Tuesday April 22. According to Don Poleto of the city's Public Works office, the bridge was not damaged.

The majority of state schools in the city of &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; have already announced their closure, although many of the schools for students age 16+ are expected remain open.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that the strike, which is expected to take place on Thursday, will be the first national teachers' strike in 21 years.

Monday, &lt;a href="Luxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="Skype%20Limited"&gt;Skype Limited&lt;/a&gt; announced a new monthly service plan called "Unlimited". It's expected that the service will bring on different opportunities for mobile users and change style on communications.

As of Skype Limited, this "Unlimited" monthly service with no long-term contract is designed for different kind users from 34 countries. There are three main services, "Unlimited Country" for local landline call by user's choice, "Unlimited World" to communicate with 34 countries globally, and exclusivity services for different continents in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;.

In a launch press conference in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, Robert Lo, Vice President of PChome Online, commented this new service to media in Taiwan and said: "After the WiMAX technology was progressively accepted in public world-wide, the population of Skype will be more improved."

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidate &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; warned &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; against an attack on &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;; "I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran," the former &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Lady"&gt;First Lady&lt;/a&gt; said.

Clinton was speaking in an interview on &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Morning%20America"&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ television program.

"In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them," Clinton said. "That's a terrible thing to say but those people who run Iran need to understand that because that perhaps will deter them from doing something that would be reckless, foolish and tragic."

"One of the things that we've seen over the last several years is a bunch of talk using words like 'obliterate,'" &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; said in a separate ABC interview. "It doesn't actually produce good results. And so I'm not interested in saber-rattling."

Last night, on &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACountdown%20with%20Keith%20Olbermann"&gt;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Hillary Clinton said US allies in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; are "intimidated and bullied into submission by Iran." Here also, she warned that an attack on Israel would bring "massive retaliation" for Iran.

Clinton and Obama face off today in the &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania%20Democratic%20primary%2C%202008"&gt;Pennsylvania Democratic primary&lt;/a&gt;. With 158 delegates at stake, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; is the largest of the remaining states and territories yet to decide.

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minster &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, US President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and Mexican President &lt;a href="Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n"&gt;Felipe Calderón&lt;/a&gt; met yesterday at the &lt;a href="w%3ASecurity%20and%20Prosperity%20Partnership%20of%20North%20America"&gt;Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America&lt;/a&gt; summit, held this year in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.

The first meeting was between Bush and Calderón. Afterwards, Bush noted that they "had a very long and very good discussion on a variety of issues. U.S. and &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; relations are very important."

Bush congratulated Calderón. "I want to congratulate you and thank you for your strong leadership," he said.

"We talked about trade, and how trade has been beneficial to both of our countries," continued Bush, describing the meeting before the speech. "When you and I grew up in our respective countries, the border region of Mexico and the United States was very poor. And today when you go down there, there's prosperity on both sides of the border," he said, claiming that the countries had been successful in combating poverty.

Mr. Calderón then took over. "Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you so much for your hospitality and for a very long and productive discussion we had today. As is fitting for the relationship that Mexico and the United States enjoy, we have been able to discuss a long list of issues today, because we have a very complex and rich relationship."

Later in the day Bush met with Canada's Prime Minister. "I don't know if the people of Canada understand the leadership role you took in Romania, but it was strong and effective," stated Bush in the joint press conference after the meeting.

Later in the press conference, Bush noted that he's "always interested in making sure that, if there's any bilateral tensions or bilateral issues, that I know of them, so that we can work collaboratively to deal with them."
Bush also mentioned other points from the meeting: "We also talked about the importance of trade between Canada and the United States, and Canada and Mexico, and the United States and Mexico. And I assured the Prime Minister that I'm a strong advocate for free trade. I believe it's in our nations' interests that we continue to have a free trade agenda. All of us want to make sure we're treated fairly, and we can do that. And this summit comes at an opportune time to reaffirm the benefits of the trading arrangements between our three nations."

Calderón finished the press conference with, "we [the two leaders] have some important joint work going on, not just in this continent but around the world, including in Afghanistan. I appreciate your words about Bucharest, and I can tell you our armed forces look very much forward to working in partnership with your people in Kandahar."

April 22 was Earth Day. It is a tradition started by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3AGaylord%20Nelson"&gt;Gaylord Nelson&lt;/a&gt; with the first Earth Day in April 1970. Earth Day &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; was started in 1990.

In Central Park, &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, the "Green Apple festival" marked the event. In &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; an "an entertainment event with an awareness component."

An earth fair was also held in Catalunya, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. The earth day website says that "the theme for this year's edition is the Fight Against Genetically Modified Organism which Poison the Planet."

Golden Gate Park, &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, also held an event to mark the day. This event is similar to an event last year that marked last year's earth day.

There were also events to mark the day in &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. The Earth Day website said "youth groups from Universities will make a vow as Citizens of the World and will launch Beja Contest 2008," in its description of these events.

There were also events in &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Earth Day website, Lincoln Park Zoo hosted some of these events.

Events in &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; also marked the day. The Earth Day website says that the "booth and Event Area within Yoyogi Park" hosted the event.

Other places across the world also marked the day. The Earth day website says that "Earth Day 2008 is expected to be the biggest yet, From Tokyo to Togo, to our flagship event on the National Mall in Washington, DC and 7 other U.S. cities, we will be galvanizing millions of people around the world behind a Call for Climate, our global warming action theme. "

Jim Connaughton, the chairman of Council on Environmental Quality for the US government, described Earth Day and explained how it was founded. Below is his description:

Connaughton also described what &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; is doing to mark the event:

Across &lt;a href="w%3AEaster"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt; weekend &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; was host to &lt;a href="w%3ARock2Wgtn"&gt;Rock2Wgtn&lt;/a&gt;, an international two-day &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; festival. Large crowds showed up at &lt;a href="w%3AWestpac%20Stadium"&gt;Westpac Stadium&lt;/a&gt; to see the various acts. The world has never seen an event of this kind before, and New Zealand has never had any kind of major rock festival or multi-day music festival.

Day one featured three theatrical acts. &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt;, known for their monster costumes, opened the night. They were followed by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ashock%20rock"&gt;shock rock&lt;/a&gt;er &lt;a href="w%3AAlice%20Cooper"&gt;Alice Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, whose themed set included the horror theatrics regularly associated with him and a hanging stunt he recently restarted after a gallows collapse nearly killed him two decades ago. The night was headlined by the distinctively costumed band &lt;a href="w%3AKiss%20%28band%29"&gt;KISS&lt;/a&gt;, complete with their famed black-and-white makeup.

The first major act on the stage on day two was the American hard rock/&lt;a href="w%3Aglam%20metal"&gt;glam metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3APoison%20%28band%29"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;. After Poison, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; act &lt;a href="w%3AWhitesnake"&gt;Whitesnake&lt;/a&gt; took to the stage and performed their set to the crowd. British-born American rocker &lt;a href="w%3AOzzy%20Osbourne"&gt;Ozzy Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;, who, as well as a solo career, fronts the world-famous &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sabbath"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt;, was the second night's headline act.

The festival's entertainment did not stop at the six main acts. There was also support performances from three New Zealand bands - The Symphony of Screams, The Valves and &lt;a href="w%3ASonic%20Altar"&gt;Sonic Altar&lt;/a&gt;. Their sets were accompanied by a special effects package from award-winning studio &lt;a href="w%3AWeta%20Workshops"&gt;Weta Workshops&lt;/a&gt;, who are known for their work on movies such as &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20film%20trilogy"&gt;The Lord of the Rings film trilogy&lt;/a&gt;. This came in the form of 'Drusila the Dragon', which rose up to a height of six foot and wigspan and moved for the audience, shining lasers from its eyes and breathing red smoke. Flame Fire Productions were hired to put on a fire show featuring several dancers alongside the performers. Also performing were six local guitarists and a group of '&lt;a href="w%3Azombie"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;' cheerleaders.

Wikinews was able to secure two exclusive interviews with those responsible behind the scenes for putting on such a show. Weta Workshop's Philip Sharpe, who supervised the project and Milly Bea, current manageress of Flame Fire Productions, discussed their roles. In the first installment, Milly Bea tells us about "a definite highlight" for Flame and lets us know everything from her thoughts on Gene Simmons's tongue to just how much kerosene it takes to put on a fire show at a rock fest.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20Independence%20Party"&gt;United Kingdom Independence Party&lt;/a&gt; (UKIP) has gained its first representation in the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AHouse%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; today.

Dr. &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABob%20Spink"&gt;Bob Spink&lt;/a&gt;, MP for &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACastle%20Point%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Castle Point, Essex&lt;/a&gt; has recently defected from the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; over an alleged attempt by local Conservatives to deselect him. He claims to have been "disenchanted" with the party for years and denounced Conservatative policies, saying "I have been increasingly disappointed with the Tory party's failure to be honest with the public on a wide range of issues like pensions, crime, immigration and defence, which is why I voted against the Tory whip so often in recent years and finally resigned the whip last month."

He said he was "delighted to join the UKIP team, helping to fight for &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain's&lt;/a&gt; interests in Europe and for better policy on the issues that really matter to people", adding that "UKIP provides an alternative that's not the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABritish%20National%20Party"&gt;BNP&lt;/a&gt; and a party that listens to the people."

He was welcomed with open arms by UKIP, party leader &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANigel%20Farage"&gt;Nigel Farage&lt;/a&gt; saying he is "delighted to welcome the hard-working and deeply principled Bob Spink as UKIP's first member of Parliament," calling Spink "articulate, quite controversial and a bit of a character". One of UKIP's two &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3APeerage"&gt;peers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ADavid%20Verney%2C%2021st%20Baron%20Willoughby%20de%20Broke"&gt;Lord Willoughby de Broke&lt;/a&gt;, added "I am thrilled that UKIP now has a representative in the House of Commons. I look forward to working with him to further UKIP's programme of leaving the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;." 

Dr. Spink has rejected ideas of holding a local by-election, saying on &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABBC%20Radio%204"&gt;BBC Radio 4&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AToday%20programme"&gt;♡❤Today♡❤&lt;/a&gt; programme "I was elected as Bob Spink. I work hard for my constituents and I will continue to do so. I am following to the letter every word that I promised them in my manifesto and I only wish the parties were doing the same, including the Tory Party." UKIP say they are confident he will retain his seat at the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANext%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election"&gt;next general election&lt;/a&gt;.

A postal worker saved a baby's life after the baby fell from a two-story apartment window in &lt;a href="w%3AAlbany%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. Lisa Harrell was delivering a package when she saw the 1-year-old fall. She caught the baby.

The baby was sitting on a bed when her mother walked out of the room for a moment; the baby then crawled out the open window. The mother will not be charged.

According to paramedics, the baby was not injured when falling from the second story of the building.

"I just feel like, you know thank God I was at the right place, at the right time," said Lisa. "I started crying. I just said thank God I caught this baby. I was delivering an express piece of mail. I had deviated from my route," she said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=China%2C%20France%20attempt%20to%20repair%20relations%20in%20wake%20of%20protests&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After anti-&lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; protests were held in major &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; cities over the weekend, China and France are now attempting to smoothen relations. China has discouraged the actions of the "radical" protesters, and French President &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; sent a letter to a Chinese Olympic athlete who has gained national fame in China following a controversial incident in the &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; Olympic torch relay.

At a press conference on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman &lt;a href="w%3AJiang%20Yu"&gt;Jiang Yu&lt;/a&gt; said the demonstrations were "encouraging and touching," but added that "we do not agree with some people's radical actions." She added that China should continue to harbor friendly bilateral relations with France.

The Chinese state-run newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Daily"&gt;China Daily&lt;/a&gt; expressed the government's views on the protests in an editorial, warning against "false patriotism" and encouraging tolerance of differing opinions. "Over-the-top nationalism is not constructive, but can do harm to the country," the English-language newspaper said. "If we want to improve things, we will have to encourage responsible patriotism."

Some Chinese protesters have called for a boycott of French goods, in particular the French retailer &lt;a href="w%3ACarrefour"&gt;Carrefour&lt;/a&gt;, which Chinese bloggers accused of supporting the &lt;a href="w%3ADalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;. Carrefour denied this allegation, saying in an interview that "Carrefour has not given any direct or indirect support to any political or religious cause."
The protests in China were a reaction to pro-Tibetan demonstrations held in Paris on April 7, when the Olympic torch was making its journey through the French capital. Pro-Tibet activists disrupted the torch relay by attempting to extinguish the flame or otherwise halt the proceedings. 

One of the more controversial incidents of the torch relay involved Chinese Olympic fencer &lt;a href="w%3AJin%20Jing"&gt;Jin Jing&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of the athletes chosen to bear the torch. Protesters tried to wrestle the torch from wheelchair-bound Jin, who is now regarded by many Chinese as a national hero because of the incident.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy sent a letter to Jin, condemning the attack she suffered and praising her courage. "I would like to express to you my deep feeling towards the way you were shoved in Paris on April 7 when you were holding the Olympic flame. You showed an outstanding courage, which honors you, and all your country," Sarkozy wrote in the letter. He also extended a personal invitation to her.

"This friendly move by President Sarkozy is appreciated by the Chinese people," said ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu. The letter was personally delivered by French Senate President &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Poncelet"&gt;Christian Poncelet&lt;/a&gt;, who is scheduled to meet with Chinese President &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; and other Chinese leaders this week. Former French Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Pierre%20Raffarin"&gt;Jean-Pierre Raffarin&lt;/a&gt; is also scheduled to visit China.

The &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="w%3AJoffrey%20Lupul"&gt;Joffrey Lupul&lt;/a&gt; scored against the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Capitals"&gt;Washington Capitals&lt;/a&gt; shortly into overtime on Tuesday winning with a 3-2 final score in the seventh game of their first round series.

In the Western Conference, the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%20Sharks"&gt;San Jose Sharks&lt;/a&gt; were victorious in their first round series against the &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary%20Flames"&gt;Calgary Flames&lt;/a&gt; after a 5-3 win. These teams also required the full set of seven playoff round games. The Sharks will meet the &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Stars"&gt;Dallas Stars&lt;/a&gt; when their next playoff round begins on Friday.

Second-round playoff games for the remaining eight teams begin late this week. The rounds for Montreal-Philadelphia and Colorado-Detroit begin on Thursday while the New York-Pittsburgh and Dallas-San Jose rounds begin on Friday. Teams must win four games out of a maximum seven per round.

&lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, one of the two remaining contenders for the Democratic nomination for &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania%20Democratic%20primary%2C%202008"&gt;Pennsylvania Democratic primary&lt;/a&gt;.

With 99.51% of districts reporting, Clinton received 1,238,232 votes (54.6%) and Obama got 1,030,703 (45.4%). This translates to an estimated 84 delegates for Clinton and 74 for Obama. Additionally, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; has 29 unpledged "&lt;a href="w%3Asuperdelegate"&gt;superdelegate&lt;/a&gt;s".

Despite her win, she still lags behind frontrunner &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; in the number of delegates. Neither candidate has the needed number of delegates to clinch and secure the Democratic Party's presumptive nomination spot.

Clinton now has an estimated 1,593½ committed delegates, while Obama has 1,721½. 2,024 delegates are needed for an outright win. 306 delegates are still up for grabs at the remaining primaries, caucuses and conventions.

Among the 794 "superdelegates", Clinton holds the edge. 488 of them have publicly endorsed candidates. 256 say they will vote for Clinton, while 232 say they will choose Obama. 306 have not committed their votes. 

"Some people counted me out and said to drop out. But the American people don't quit, and they deserve a president who doesn't quit either," Clinton told supporters at a rally last night in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;.

"I've won the states that we have to win, Ohio, now Pennsylvania," Clinton said in an interview on &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. "If you can't win the states we have to win in the fall, maybe that says something about your general-election appeal."

This morning on &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Morning%20America"&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ program, Clinton said the result is "fresh information" for uncommitted "superdelegates" that shows "the broad base of coalition that I put together is exactly what we are going to need to have in the fall."
"Now it's up to you, Indiana," said Barack Obama at a rally in &lt;a href="w%3AEvansville%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Evansville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, where he spent election night. "You can decide whether we're going to travel the same worn path, or whether we will chart a new course."

The &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana%20Democratic%20primary%2C%202008"&gt;Indiana Democratic primary&lt;/a&gt; is on May 6, 2008. 

In the &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania%20Republican%20primary%2C%202008"&gt;Pennsylvania Republican primary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, who is already the &lt;a href="w%3Apresumptive%20nominee"&gt;presumptive nominee&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;, received 72.7% of the vote, while &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; got 15.9% and &lt;a href="Mike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; rounded out the field with 11.4%.

Recently released figures have revealed that the number of foreclosures in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has more than quadrupled. The figures for the first quarter of 2008 show a significant increase on previous figures.

There were 47,171 foreclosures on California properties in the first quarter of 2008. The figure for the same period last year was just over 10,000.

The Attorney General of &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; released a report that showed an increase. It said that "the collective efforts of servicers and government officials to date have not translated into meaningful improvement in foreclosure prevention outcomes." The Attorney General also commented on the report:

"I've been left recently in the unfamiliar position of facing no opposition within my own party," said McCain at the beginning of the speech. " As you might recall, it was a different story last year, when I could claim the unqualified support of Cindy and my mother -- and Mom was starting to keep her options open," he continued. "As I recall, a few pollsters even declared my campaign a hopeless cause, and there was no margin of error to soften the blow."

McCain also visited &lt;a href="w%3AEdmund%20Pettus%20Bridge"&gt;Edmund Pettus Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in &lt;a href="w%3ASelma%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Selma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. "I've seen courage in action on many occasions in my life, but none any greater or used for any better purpose than the courage shown by John Lewis and the good people who marched for justice with him," he said there. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Lewis%20%28politician%29"&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; who is also known as a civil rights activist.

In Virginia, McCain also said that "the struggles of this community and others like it matter when we talk about our nation's economy -- they are not just a problem, they're a priority."

McCain also criticized &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. "Raising taxes on businesses in Ohio and elsewhere, as both my opponents propose to do, will not bring the old jobs back, and it sure won't create new ones, " he said.

The majority of state schools in the city of &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; are closing for the strike, although many of the schools for students age 16+ are expected to remain open.

Some schools that originally said they would be closed have made the decision not to close for the strike.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that the strike, which is expected to take place on Thursday, will be the first national teachers' strike in 21 years.

Christine Blower from the National Union of Teachers, which is organising the strike, said:

News reports are claiming that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adoll"&gt;dolls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; depicting former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANazi"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leader &lt;a href="Adolf%20Hitler"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt; will go on sale in &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. These reports cite Ukraine's ♡❤Zerkalo Nedeli♡❤ newspaper which reported that a toy manufacturer would release the line of Hitler dolls in the summer.

The 40cm doll will reportedly first be available in &lt;a href="Kiev"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt; with a £100 (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APound%20Sterling"&gt;GBP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) price tag and comes with a large range of accessories in a presentation box with the dates of Hitler's birth and death.

Nazis images are illegal in Ukraine, with positive portrayal specifically banned. However, there are allegations that right-wing nationalist politics are gaining strength in the country and that xenophobia and racism are on the rise, including some said to be comparable to that present in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; under Nazi rule. Fascism and propaganda are also banned.

When the former &lt;a href="Soviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, including Ukraine, was invaded by Germany under Hitler's rule 2&amp;ndash;3 million Ukrainians were among the casualties, of which 1.5 million were &lt;a href="Jew"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt;.

Adolf can be dressed in various guises, including "early days Adolf", which consists of a brown shirt and jodhpurs, and "Wartime Adolf", which features a grey tunic, black trousers and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIron%20Cross"&gt;Iron Cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; medal. The doll also comes with boots and shoes, caps, gloves, full uniforms, cane and belt which can be placed on Hitler, whose arms move, allowing the doll to replicate the famed salute of its real life counterpart.
Also included is a model of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlondi"&gt;Blondi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Hitler's female &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20Shepherd"&gt;German Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was exceedingly loyal to Hitler. Hitler poisoned Blondi with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acyanide"&gt;cyanide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1945 at the same time as taking his own life in his bunker at &lt;a href="Berlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;.

"It is like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarbie"&gt;Barbie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Kids can undress fuhrer, pin on medals and there's a spare head in the kit to give him a kinder expression on his face. He has glasses that are round, in the manner of pacifist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Lennon"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ," said one saleswoman. The company, which will release the dolls in Summer, says that if demand is high a range of toys themed on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThird%20Reich"&gt;Third Reich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may be released, to include barracks, working models of crematoriums and gas chambers, concentration camps and interior models of the chancellery.

The doll is not set to be released until the summer, but ♡❤&lt;a href="BBC%20News%20Online"&gt;BBC News Online&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has footage suggesting that some stores are selling the doll already.
