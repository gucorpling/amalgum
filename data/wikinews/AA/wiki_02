CARACAS, Venezuela – 
The Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; met the Venezuelan President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; on February 14, 2005 in &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and Venezuela signed agreements of cooperation on many areas. According to the Brazilian government this was a strategical encounteur. This meeting is the first of three meetings that President Lula will have with South American Presidents in three days. The scheduled meetings are with the presidents of: &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; (February, 14), &lt;a href="w%3AGuiana"&gt;Guiana&lt;/a&gt; (February, 15) and &lt;a href="w%3ASuriname"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt; (February, 16).

President Lula was accompanied by the following comitiva: the Minister of Development, Industry, and External Trade Luiz Fernando Furlan, the Minister of Finance Antônio Palocci, the Minister of Foreign Relations Celso Amorim, the Minister of Health Humberto Costa, the Minister of Mines and Energy Dilma Roussef, the Minister of Tourism Walfrido Mares Guia, the President of Petrobras José Eduardo Dutra, the President of National Economic and Social Development Bank (BNDES) Guido Mantega, the President of Eletrobrás Silas Rondeau Cavalcante Silva and the Special Secretary for Aquaculture and Fisheries José Fritsch. In addition a delegation of executives representing enterprises from Brazil accompanied the President.

The Brazilian Ministry of External Relations told the trip aims the construction of a strategical alliance and commercial integration between both countries. The Brazilian Presidential Advisor Marco Aurélio Garcia said:"With this gesture, Brazil will consolidate one of its major political goals, which is the constitution of a South American community of nations". He added: "These agreements with Venezuela are strategical. We want this agreement as a model for other agreements in the region." 

According to President Lula the integration of the Latin America is the priority number one of his government. Days before the arrival in Venezuela and commenting about the trip Lula said: "We're going to do the same thing in Colombia and in other countries in which integration is no longer a campaign speech but part of the way we deal with real things, day to day". 

The integration of the Latin America is the politics repeatedly proposed by Lula during the meetings of the &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. According to him and the others members of the Foro there must be a integration among all the left parties and governments of Latin America. The union aims to be an alternative and opposing force to the politics and influence of the richest countries, mainly the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Among the organizations which are usually participants of the Foro de São Paulo are: &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Cuba"&gt;Communist Party of Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColombian%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Colombian Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Bolivia"&gt;Communist Party of Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Brazil"&gt;Communist Party of Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParaguayan%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Paraguayan Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APeruvian%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Peruvian Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20of%20Peru"&gt;Socialist Party of Peru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;National Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFarabundo%20Mart%C3%AD%20National%20Liberation%20Front"&gt;Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGuatemalan%20National%20Revolutionary%20Unity"&gt;Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATupamaros"&gt;Tupamaros&lt;/a&gt;.

On December 4, 2001 during the 10th edition of the Foro de São Paulo in &lt;a href="w%3AHavana"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; Lula said:"A shoal of small fish may mean the finishing of the hungry in our countries, in out continent. We should not think as the History ended on our journey by the Earth. Even it happens just once, or with one gesture, let's effectively contribute to the improve the life of millions of human beings who live socially excluded by this neoliberal model."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.fpabramo.org.br/sala_leitura/forosp_cuba.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

In Venezuela, once again, he brought out the integration wish: 
"This is the biggest dream I am carrying, that we can negotiate collectively, not like one country, but like a set of countries so we can do that our people may have the chance to conquer the full citizenship."

<h2>Economic cooperation</h2>

Brazil and Venezuela signed agreements of cooperation in the sectors of electric energy, mining, exploration of oil and gas, science and technology, fishing and agrarian development, military, communication and Defense of the Amazon. They discussed about the creation of the South Development Bank and collaboration in the audio-visual diffusion.

PDVSA (Venezuelan Petroleum S.A.) and Petrobrás (Brazilian Petroleum S.A.) signed a intention protocol for the building of an oil refinery in Brazil. The investiment will be worth of U$ 2 billion and the expected production is 150 thousand to 200 thousand barrels. Another four agreements were signed covering petroleum exploration and production in Venezuela.

The National Economic and Social Development Bank (BNDES) will liberate U$ 900 million to finance infrastructure projects in Venezuela. 

Contracts worth of U$ 235 million were ratified. According to the superintendent of the BNDES's Area of Foreign Trade Luiz Antônio Araújo Dantas these U$ 235 million funds will be for the third line of the Caracas subway, the purchase of harvestors and other agricultural machinery and for the La Vueltosa Hydroelectric Plant.

Brazil will sell to Venezuela 26 attack airplanes type &lt;a href="w%3AEMBRAER%20Super%20Tucano/ALX"&gt;Super Tucano&lt;/a&gt; and 12 airplanes type &lt;a href="w%3AAMX%20International%20AMX"&gt;AMX-T&lt;/a&gt; manufactured by &lt;a href="w%3AEMBRAER"&gt;EMBRAER&lt;/a&gt; (Brazil's Aircraft Company). According to the representant of EMBRAER in Venezuela Joany Kings the program will cost USS 300 million in two years.

The Venezuelan Air Force is using 20 old model &lt;a href="w%3AEMBRAER%20Tucano"&gt;Tucanos&lt;/a&gt;. 
The new model Super Tucano is equipped with last generation technology and can carry up to 1.15 ton of bombs. 
The AMX-T model is a two-seat advanced trainer AMX variant which can do strategical attacks from long distance using guided bombs. 

Brazil will transfer technology knowledge to Venezuela with the goal to stimulate Venezuelan development in the military field and other areas.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARSA%20security"&gt;RSA security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; conference that Microsoft will release major security changes to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and will release a new version prior to the release of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Longhorn"&gt;Longhorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the replacement for Windows XP expected any time after 2005.

Microsoft plans to include many features to increase security. These features are to protect against threats such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20virus"&gt;computer viruses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aspyware"&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aphishing"&gt;phishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Release of a test copy of the new version is expected some time in the middle of this year. Also in the works is a Microsoft developed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnti-virus%20software"&gt;anti-virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; program. This move puts pressure on other major players such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMcAfee"&gt;McAfee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASymantec"&gt;Symantec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The anti-spyware product is currently planned for release to Windows users for free.

Analysts contend that these plans to rework Internet Explorer are likely due to increased competition from smaller browsers such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;a href="AOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt; plans to release a new version of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANetscape%20Browser"&gt;Netscape Browser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with protection against phishing as well.

To further compete, more content related services may be incorporated into the browser. Martin Reynolds, a vice president of technology forecasting firm Gartner Inc., said, "I don't think we will see a whole bunch of new features. We will see the existing features of the browser tightened up so the security becomes more manageable."

Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, today announced that the 2004/2005 season of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; has been canceled. The announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days. The dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players. The majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount. The club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million. Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said ♡❤"The shame of this is that our fans deserve better."♡❤

This will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded. That year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Oldest%20human%20fossils%20dated%20as%20200%2C000yrs%20old&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Two sets of remains, one a near complete set, the other just a skull, found in &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; forty years ago, have been dated using &lt;a href="w%3APotassium-argon%20dating"&gt;potassium-argon&lt;/a&gt; dating, as the oldest human remains yet discovered at 195,000 years old. Remains from Herto, Ethiopia held the previous record of 160,000 years.

The findings, published in the February 17 issue of the journal Nature, show the remains ♡❤Omo I♡❤ and ♡❤II♡❤, approach what geneticists believe is the age of the human race &amp;mdash; 200,000 years. Due to geological activity in the region, this number may not be accurate; it is feasible that the fossils are as young as 104,000.

The uncertainty is due to the method by which they were dated from the known geological age of surrounding rock. The exact dig location where the fossil remains had been excavated in 1967 needed to be relocated.

It was determined that ♡❤Omo I♡❤ and ♡❤II♡❤ were buried in the lowest sedimentary layer, dubbed ♡❤Member 1♡❤, of the 100-meter-thick Kibish rock formation, near the Omo River. By searching for datable material in that layer, and then dating it using the &lt;a href="w%3APotassium-argon%20dating"&gt;potassium-argon&lt;/a&gt; method, a research team was able to estimate an age for the fossils by association.

The date found agrees with findings from genetic studies on modern human populations, which use extrapolation to determine a date for the earliest modern humans.

In the same ♡❤Member 1♡❤ sediment layers, were found additional ♡❤Omo I♡❤ bones, animal fossils, and stone tools.

"Those who believe that there is widely scattered evidence of 'modern' behavior going back 200,000 years in Africa will be delighted that modern human anatomy also goes back that far," according to study co-author John Fleagle, a physical anthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York.

When comparing the two sets of fossils, there is an anatomical difference between them. ♡❤Omo II♡❤ is much more primitive in appearance, while ♡❤Omo I♡❤ more resembles modern anatomy. Their existence in the same location in the same geological timeframe, may change the way scientists believe humans evolved.

Chris Stringer, director of the Human Origins Group at the Natural History Museum in London: "Given what we see in larger fossil samples from other regions, we may need to accept that African populations showed large [physical-form] variation at this time."

A funeral procession several kilometers long wound its way through the &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="Beirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; for the former Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yesterday. Mr Hariri was assassinated three days ago, on the 14th of February, when explosives equivalent to approximately 300 kg of TNT were detonated as his motorcade drove past the St George Hotel in the Lebanese capital. The hundreds of thousands of mourners in the funeral procession were convinced that the assassination was carried out by the &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n government and used the opportunity to voice their anger at the Syrians. 

The funeral united the many Lebanese factions, with Christians, Druze, and Shia and Sunni Muslims marching side by side in the procession, accompanied by the tolling of church bells.

&lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;, a friend to Mr Hariri, was in Beirut yesterday and praised the work that Mr Hariri had done in his fight for Lebanese democracy and independence. He also offered his condolences to Mr Hariri's family.

The &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;US House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; has paid tribute to the former Lebanese Prime Minister and also called for Syria to withdraw troops from Lebanon. Mr Hariri was described as a philanthropist who chose to put the future of Lebanon above political interests and used his own funds to assist the country's economic reconstruction after years of civil war.

&lt;a href="Darrell%20Issa"&gt;Darrell Issa&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said demonstrations by Lebanese calling for Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon underscore the key issue facing the country, "There is no proof that Syria was directly responsible for this assassination,” he said. “But there is no doubt that Syria has remained in Lebanon far longer either than their mandate, or than in the agreements under the Taif Accords of 1989."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Rahall"&gt;Nick Rahall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;a href="West%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , also took to the floor of the House to denounce the killing. "It was a criminal act, it was a heinous act of terrorism, of those who don't have the courage to work through the political system or differences. I do not know who is to blame, certainly there are enough outside forces in the region that once again are looking to Lebanon to play their ugly, deadly games," he said.

The United States withdrew its ambassador from &lt;a href="Damascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt; following the bomb attack, and has again demanded that Syria withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

After five hours of meeting, the presidents &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; put a end to the diplomatic tension that had completed two months.
The crisis started with the alleged irregular arrest (according to Venezuela) of the &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; guerrilla Rodrigo Granda by Colombian authorities. 

President Chavez said: "We have decided to turn the page so we can fix the things that were misadjusted, clarify the things that could be clouded and work together in the construction for the common people".

The meeting was scheduled for early this month, however it was postponed due to a disease of the Colombian president.

The encounter served both to finish the harshness between the two countries and to resume bilateral agreements and the activity in the border which were paralyzed as a result of the crisis.

Moreover Chávez insisted on Venezuela is not a santuary of guerrillas. Uribe admitted that the Colombian armed conflict is a problem which must be solved by his country despite the disturbances caused by subversive groups in the neighboring countries to Colombia.

As a result of the meeting, the presidents will organize a binational high level commission in the next weeks. The commission will evaluate the crisis's consequences, reinforce the integration between both countries and coordinate the future of the antiterrorist fight. The fight against terrorism will be done by security organisms of both countries by means of a rigorous legal adjustment in the actions which implies to cooperate so that the sovereignty is not affected and the sovereignty is respected, according to Uribe.

&lt;a href="w%3ARSPCA"&gt;RSPCA&lt;/a&gt; inspectors found about 500 cattle dead on a remote station in Western Australia. Water is being trucked in to care for another 2500 cattle on Windidda station, east of Wilun, which is leased to an Aboriginal corporation.

State Agriculture Minister Kim Chance says the propery was found abandoned and only two of the property's 13 watering stations were working.

"The lease is owned by an aboriginal corporation (but) the precise of identity of the corporation is somewhat obscure," Mr Chance said.

WA RSPCA spokesperson Kelly Oversby said they made the shocking discovery after an anonymous tip-off. 

"Experienced inspectors have told us it is the worst case of animal cruelty they have ever seen," Ms Overby said.

"As well as the cattle, brumbies, camels, dogs and kangaroos have all perished."

&lt;a href="w%3AGoiania"&gt;GOIÂNIA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – Yesterday the Brazilian police removed families who have illegally occupied an area in , &lt;a href="w%3AGoi%C3%A1s"&gt;Goiás&lt;/a&gt; state, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. The occupiers resisted and there was a conflict which resulted in 2 deaths, with at least another 45 injured and a further 800 arrested according to recent reports in Brazilian newspapers.

The occupation was coordinated by the regional branch of the Movement of Workers Without a Roof. 
The occupied area was in Parque Oeste Industrial, in Goiânia. There were 2,862 families (men, women and infants) living there according to the government of Goiás and 4,000 according to the movement's leaders. The area had been under occupation since May 2004. The expanse is 891,000 m² as stated by the newspaper &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dm.com.br/impresso.php%3Fid%3D73207%26amp%3Bedicao%3D6314"&gt;Diário da Manhã&lt;/a&gt;. 
They named the area Condomínio Sonho Real (Real Dream condominium).

Failure by the occupiers to obey a court determination to leave the area resulted in the use of the police force to enforce the Law.

The serious conflict began yesterday (February 16, 2005) at around 9:20 AM when about 500 policemen from the Battalion of Shock entered the area to remove the families. The Battalion of Shock is a specialized Military Police unit set up to deal with activist conflicts. 

The trespassers were expecting a frontal attack, however the police demolished a wall at the rear with the help of a front-end loader and surprised them. The resistance didn't last long and by 11:00 AM all occupiers had been removed.

Guerrilla tactics were used by the occupiers. They dug 70 cm deep trenches, prepared hidden traps with props of wooden and metal, built barricades with stacks of tires, stones and other materials. Some dwellings were incinerated and they used &lt;a href="w%3Amolotov%20cocktails"&gt;molotov cocktails&lt;/a&gt; and other self-made bombs. Scythes, hoes, machetes and guns were also used. 

The police commander, Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Elias, said that lethal weapons were not used by the police. The shots which were heard during the conflict originated from the members of the movement gun's.

Pedro Nascimento, aged 22, and Wagner da Silva Moreira, aged 20, both died during the conflict. Police claim they were victims of friendly fire. The injured were transported to hospitals. Four of those hospitalized required intensive care.

The Secretary of Public Security of Goiás, Jônathas Silva, considered the operation a success. "We would not like that it had victims, but unfortunately the occupiers were armed," he said.

The police arrested two leaders of the occupation: Américo Rodrigues and Agildo Wagner Jaime. Another 21 leaders escaped and they are being pursued by the police.

The United States' second attempt to test a ballistic missile defence system ended in failure on Monday when the interceptor missile did not leave the launch pad.

An unarmed ballistic missile was fired from Kodiak Island, Alaska, which was supposed to have been shot down by the interceptor missile. However the missile remained in its silo in the Ronald Reagan test site on the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean.

The test is the second straight failure of the system; in a test two months ago, the missile also failed to fire, that time due to a software fault. Initial investigations into Monday's failure blamed a malfunction in ground support equipment, rather than a fault with the missile itself.

The tests are the first in two years; in an earlier series of tests, the system intercepted five of eight target missiles launched.

The project, known as the 'son of Star Wars' (the cancelled 1980s Strategic Defence Initiative was known as the Star Wars program), was announced by President George W. Bush in 2002. The system was supposed to have been operationally deployed last autumn.

This year, $9.1 billion is to be spent on the development of the system. But in his budget for 2006, Bush has cut the spending to $7.8bn.

Lance Armstrong has announced that he will attempt to win a seventh Tour de France crown in 2005.

The 34-year-old Texan announced his intentions in a statement on Wednesday, ending months of speculation.

Armstrong, who suffered from testicular cancer from 1996 to 1998, has won six straight Tour de France titles; a feat no-one else has achieved. 

This season, Armstrong will be riding with the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team, after US Postal Service ended their sponsorship of his team last year.

Five times Tour runner-up and 1997 winner Jan Ulrich said in response to the news, "It's good that he is there. The best should be at the Tour."

Armstrong will also be racing in two other road cycling stage races in France and the U.S. this spring, and will be in a one-day race in Belgium in April. There is the possibility of Armstrong competing in more races this season if he and his team manager believe he is fit enough.

Boeing has unveiled a new ultra-long range version of its 777 airliner, capable of flying from London to Sydney non-stop.

The 777-200LR can fly for 9,420 nautical miles (17,446 kilometers) with 301 passengers onboard, giving it a range greater than any other airliner in the world.

The aircraft can fly from New York to Singapore and from Los Angeles to Dubai with a full passenger and luggage load non-stop, and has been named the Worldliner by Boeing to mark the fact it can connect almost any two cities on Earth. 

Although it can fly from London to Sydney non-stop, the 777-200LR will have to break its return journey to refuel due to direction of the prevailing winds in the upper atmosphere.

So far, Boeing has received five orders from two customers for the 777-200LR since it was announced in February 2000. The first of the new airliner will be delivered to Pakistan International Airlines in January 2006. EVA Airways is the other launch customer.

First flight is scheduled in early March.

The 777-200LR will be the basis for an all-freight version of the 777, announced last November.

Boeing's European rival Airbus, which has out-sold Boeing since 2003, believes that the future of passenger flight is in very large aircraft like its new twin-deck A380 airliner flying up to 840 people between a relatively small number of large hub airports world-wide. Passengers would then take connecting flights to reach their final destinations. 

Boeing, by contrast, believes passengers will want to fly direct between more local airports too small to handle aircraft like the A380.

&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; is now the world's largest consumer of resources, passing the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

China's consumption exceeds the U.S.'s in grain and meat, coal, and steel, with the U.S. only still using more oil a year.

China uses more wheat and rice than the U.S. every year, with the U.S. only taking more corn. In total, China consumed 382 million tons of grain in 2004 while the U.S. used 278 million tons.

The world's most populous country also eats more meat, consuming 64 million tons a year compared to the U.S.'s 38 million, despite the average Chinese person eating 49 kg a year (the U.S. average is 127 kg). 

However the U.S. still uses three times as much oil, consuming 20.4 million barrels a day in 2004 while China uses only 6.5 million. But China's oil consumption doubled between 1994 and 2004, while the U.S.'s only increased by 15%. Japan is the world's third largest oil consumer. Car sales doubled in China over the last two years.

China is rapidly heading to being the largest producer of carbon dioxide, the gas responsible for the greenhouse effect. Two-thirds of China's electricity is generated by burning coal, using 800 million tons a year.

China has a population of 1.3 billion people and its increases in consumption are being driven by a booming economy. However, the country only had an average per-capita income of $5,300 in 2004, one-seventh of the U.S.'s $38,000. The U.S., with its population of around 295 million being about four times less than China's, still consumes considerably more per person than does China, despite the differences in raw values.

The country now imports large amounts grain, soybeans, iron ore, aluminum, copper, platinum, phosphates, potash, oil and natural gas, forest products for lumber and paper, and cotton. In order to feed its demand for raw materials, the country has formed economic relationships for long term imports from major exporters such as Russia, Brazil and Australia.

The country is also growing rapidly in economic strength; along with Japan, it buys most of the U.S. Treasury's securities that allows the US to run its huge financial deficit.

Australia has defeated New Zealand by 44 runs in the one off Twenty20 international match at Eden Park.

This victory, in the first full international Twenty20 match, gave Australia a unique treble having won the first ever test match and then the first ever limited overs international.

Batting first, Australia set a total of 214, with Australian captain Ricky Ponting top scoring with 98 runs from 55 balls, including 8 fours and 5 sixes. New Zealand's Kyle Mills led the bowling attack with 3 for 44.

In reply New Zealand were all out for 170. Scott Styris top scored for New Zealand with 66 runs from 39 balls. Australian paceman Michael Kasprowicz finished the match with figures of 4 for 29 from his 4 overs.

The New Zealand team had dressed in the 1980s beige uniform for the occasion. Many had also grown facial hair suiting the 1980s for the match.

The teams now go on to play a one-day series followed by a test match series.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Greenspan"&gt;Alan Greenspan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChairman%20of%20the%20Federal%20Reserve"&gt;Chairman of the Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that there will be ♡❤more of the same♡❤ in coming months from the Fed. In his speech during testimony before the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs"&gt;U.S. Senate Banking Committee&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan noted that the economic fundamentals of the appeared to be stable. On Thursday, Greenspan spoke before the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20Financial%20Services"&gt;U.S. House Committee on Financial Services&lt;/a&gt; and when faced with questions regarding &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Security%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Social Security reform issues&lt;/a&gt;, he hinted that he was in favour of partial privatization of Social Security - but the general consensus on Wall Street is to expect more of the same.

However, economic advisors were somewhat disappointed that most of the testimony in both speechs was focused on the upcoming Social Security reform and did not address monetary policy as broadly as they'd hoped. Mike Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc, is quoted in the Investors Business Daily as saying "Chairman Greenspan provided few explicit insights into his plans for monetary policy."

Greenspan reiterated his concerns about market reactions to the burgeoning federal deficit. "We are not sure to what extent and how much the market will respond," he said.

Parsing Greenspan's reports to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; obsession, but the general consensus from his recent testimony is to expect little change in the current &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Fed&lt;/a&gt; policy. Economists expect "measured" hikes to the central bank's short-term interest rates from the next few meetings of Fed policy-makers.

"In my view the bottom line is that we are in for more of the same," said Steve Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.

Toronto,Ontario – 
Foreign investors invested a record &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CA$&lt;/a&gt;53.2 billion into &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Candian&lt;/a&gt; securities in 2004, &lt;a href="w%3AStatistics%20Canada"&gt;Statistics Canada&lt;/a&gt; says.

This was almost double the CA$18.5 billion recorded in 2003 and just beat the previous record of CA$52.8 billion in 1993.

Of the 53.2 billion, about 35 billion was put into stocks and 20 billion into various bonds. 

"For the year as a whole, foreign investors picked up $20.2 billion in Canadian bonds; a substantial increase over the $7.0 billion purchased in 2003 but just half the high of 2001," the agency said.

Roughly half of the purchases were directly influenced by the acquisition of &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hancock%20Insurance"&gt;John Hancock Financial&lt;/a&gt; services in April which has created the largest North American insurer.

Canadians themselves were also buying foreign securities in record amounts.

"Overall for 2004, Canadian investors purchased $16.2 billion in foreign securities. Of this, outlays of $15.1 billion were made in foreign bonds - almost double the amount from the year before and by far the largest ever yearly investment by Canadian investors in the foreign bond market,"

Final figures from &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; today showed that the Shia &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Iraqi%20Alliance"&gt;United Iraqi Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has won a slight majority in the new &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20National%20Assembly"&gt;Iraqi National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. The party took 140 out of the 275 seats in the Assembly. 

The major opposition party will be the ♡❤Kurdish Alliance♡❤, which took 75 seats. The third largest party will be that of interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's party, which won 40 seats. 

Reports in U.S. media say that many Sunni voters stayed away from the polls either because of a fear of violence or to support the call by some radical clerics to boycott the elections. As a result, the Sunni-led Iraqis Party won only five seats in parliament. The results are summarized in the following table:

Chief UN election adviser, Carlos Valenzuela, congratulated those involved with the election. He commented that "The elections were not perfect, they were never meant to be, but they were extremely successful."

There were fears before the election in international circles that a low turnout could jepordise the legitimacy of the new assembly. However, nearly 8.5 million Iraqis voted - 58% of the registered electorate. As noted previously, the turnout percentage did vary significantly among the various population groups. By combining the two different Shiite parties and comparing to estimated population groups in Iraq we find:

The Shiite and Kurdish groups had more than 80% turnout whereas the Sunni group had a turnout under 4%. The low turnout by Sunni voters resulted in much higher representative success for both the Shiite and Kurdish groups in the parliament.

ÑEMBY, &lt;a href="w%3AParaguay"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; – 
Paraguayan authorities have confirmed the discovery of the body of Cecilia Cubas
Gusinky, aged 31, daughter of the former Paraguayan President Raul Cubas. She
was kidnapped on September 21, 2004 in the outskirts of &lt;a href="w%3AAsuncion"&gt;Asuncion&lt;/a&gt;.

The body was found inside a tunnel under a house which is located in
Ñemby, 29 km from Asuncion. Members of the
leftist party Patria Libre (Free Country) were believed to live there.

This kidnapping shocked Paraguayan public opinion because Cecilia was the
daughter of a former President and because two days ago it was discovered that
the kidnappers would have been advised by the &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="w%3ACommunist"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; insurgent armed group &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt;.

The authorities claim the kidnappers were led by the Patria Libre member Osmar Martínez. He was exchanging emails with Trotador505
who according to Colombian police is Rodrigo Granda, FARC chancellor. Martínez was arrested in January in Caaguazú, 200 km from Asunción.
"We don't deny our fraternal relationship with this brotherlike organization",
Martínez said in relation to FARC.
He also told how he had photographs of himself with &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, Brazilian
President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;, politicians of the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALibya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and added: "I am proud of relating to the great men of universal history".

People are speculating on the possible participation in the crime by members of the Paraguayan police.

The advanced state of decomposure indicates Ms Gusinsky had been
dead for more than a month.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Negroponte"&gt;John Negroponte&lt;/a&gt;, United States Ambassador to &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, has been nominated
as the country's first National Intelligence Director by President
&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. The two-month-old directorate, created by Congress as part
of an intelligence community overhaul, will be one of the most
powerful positions in the federal government.

Negroponte will oversee 15 intelligence agencies, coordinating
operations and setting budgets. He will, as head of the new office,
report directly to the President.

"John brings a unique set of skills to these challenges," said
President Bush at a press conference this Thursday.

Negroponte has served in the American foreign service since the early 60's,
from Vietnam to the United Nations and now currently Iraq.

Lieutenant General Michael Hayden, director of the National Security
Agency was also announced as deputy to Negroponte.

Senate confirmation is still required before either can assume the
offices.

Negroponte has been a controversial figure in the past for his time as ambassador to &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; from 1981 to 1985, when the United States under the &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Reagan&lt;/a&gt; administration was involved in violent conflict in Central America. Fearing that Central American governments were turning towards &lt;a href="w%3ACommunism"&gt;Communism&lt;/a&gt;, the Reagan administration assisted numerous rebel groups in attempts to overthrow left-wing governments, especially in the case of the &lt;a href="w%3ASandanista"&gt;Sandanista&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href="w%3ANicaragua"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;. Central American activists have accused Negroponte of ignoring human rights abuses by the Contras and their Honduran hosts, which the Reagan administration funded by secretly selling arms to &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. (See &lt;a href="w%3AIran-Contra%20Affair"&gt;Iran-Contra Affair&lt;/a&gt;)

Engineer Russ Tedrake has designed a &lt;a href="w%3Arobot"&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt; that is engineered to walk like a human. Tedrake did his work in the &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;. 

The robot uses a method called "passive-dynamics" to move, taking advantage of gravity and kinetic energy to move its limbs. This approach differs from standard motorized robots (such as the famed &lt;a href="w%3AAsimo"&gt;Asimo&lt;/a&gt;), and requires only a small fraction of the energy to achieve the same amount of locomotion. 

These passive-dynamic robots have sensors that collect information two hundred times every second, constantly sending new instructions to the motors. The sensors also dictate the course of actuators that control tension in the robot's ankles.

The robots learn from their experience walking, getting a bit more precise with each step. Effectively, the robot will also learn to walk on different types of terrain, like going from grass to sand. Tedrake comments on this:

The &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; government has criticized the &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; public service broadcaster &lt;a href="w%3ASveriges%20Television"&gt;Sveriges Television&lt;/a&gt; (SVT) for their recently launched campaign called "Fri Television". One of the promotional films in the campaign refers to the media situation in Italy. The film says that president &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Sivlio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; was elected after a campaign on his own television channels and that he now also controls the state television, &lt;a href="w%3ARAI"&gt;RAI&lt;/a&gt;.

The music theme of the campaign is a &lt;a href="w%3AMandolin"&gt;Mandolin&lt;/a&gt; version of the popular Italian song "O' sole mio".

The Italian government has said that this is a matter for Italy. Telecom minister &lt;a href="w%3AMaurizio%20Gasparri"&gt;Maurizio Gasparri&lt;/a&gt; said that the information is false. The Swedish ambassador in Italy, &lt;a href="w%3AStaffan%20Wrigstad"&gt;Staffan Wrigstad&lt;/a&gt;, was yesterday called to the Italian ministry of foreign affairs.

The CEO of SVT, &lt;a href="w%3AChristina%20Jutterstr%C3%B6m"&gt;Christina Jutterström&lt;/a&gt;, says that she doesn't have plans to stop the campaign. "This campaign is like Italian shoes. It's pointed and a bit uncomfortable", Jutterström said to the Swedish news program Rapport.

Over £2m has been recovered by &lt;a href="w%3AGarda%C3%AD"&gt;Gardaí&lt;/a&gt; ("Irish Police") in multiple raids in the &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. Seven arrests have so far been made in &lt;a href="w%3ACork"&gt;Cork&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; during a series of raids. Of the £2m found, approximately £60,000 was in Northern Bank notes. Forensic examinations are being carried out to see if the money is related to the £26m Northern Bank raid in December. The finds come on top of £175,000 which was surrendered to police in Dublin on Thursday night.

One of those arrested so far, an unnamed Cork man has appeared in court charged with &lt;a href="w%3AIRA"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; membership. Irish police chief Noel Conroy commented that several of those arrested are suspected members of the IRA.

After the revelation that the IRA were possibly involved in the December robbery, speculation has been mounting in the national media that the main Republican party, &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt;, were aware of plans for the robbery. Sinn Fein President, &lt;a href="Gerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently in &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; said people should not be in a rush to blame republicans. However it is clear that he is under a lot of pressure as he has decided to return to Ireland early from his trip.

The December robbery is widely blamed for having ruined chances at a new peace deal in Northern Ireland. Unionist parties have called for Sein Fein and the IRA to be excluded from future discussions.

Three children were killed Sunday in Vistahermosa, &lt;a href="w%3AMeta%2C%20Colombia"&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; when a landmine exploded during a soccer game. According to residents the landmine had been left by &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC's&lt;/a&gt; guerrillas.

The children were identified as 4-year-old William Cardona, 9-year-old Javier Cardona and 8-year-old John Jairo Cardozo were buried on Tuesday in Maracaibo. 

The deaths of the boys resulted in a peaceful protest by 1,500 students from local elementary and middle schools. The students walked the streets of the town along with their teachers, since most of the adults feared the retaliation by the armed groups of FARC.

Colonel Carlos Hugo Ramírez Zuluaga of the XII Brigada Móvil del Ejército said that there are about five thousand landmines in the region which is part of the old zone of distension where the insolvent dialogues of peace with the FARC were carried out between 1992 and 2002.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANon-governmental%20organization"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt; Campaña Colombiana contra Minas (Colombian Campaign against Landmines) denounced the deaths on Tuesday.

Following pressure from &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n leaders, &lt;a href="Togo"&gt;Togo&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFaure%20Gnassingb%C3%A9"&gt;Faure Gnassingbé&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has announced on Friday that new elections will be held within 60 days. Mr. Gnassingbé was selected as the successor of his father &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGnassingb%C3%A9%20Eyad%C3%A9ma"&gt;Gnassingbé Eyadéma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Africa's longest serving leader, who passed away two week ago. 

"I have decided in the higher interests of the nation to continue the process of transition in line with the constitution of 1992 ... and organise the presidential election within the stipulated time of 60 days," Mr. Gnassingbé told in a televised address on a state channel. He said that he intends to remain in power until the elections.

Mr. Gnassingbé's selection with the army's help &amp;mdash; in contrast to the process outlined by the Togolese constitution &amp;mdash; has drawn sharp criticisms from world leaders and Togo's population. Despite his decision to hold elections the criticism continued. On Saturday &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigerian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOlusegun%20Obasanjo"&gt;Olusegun Obasanjo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the chairman of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEconomic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States"&gt;Economic Community of West African States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that Togo faces "immediate sanctions" if Mr. Gnassingbé did not step down. According to the constitution in effect at the time when Gnassingbé Eyadéma died, upon the president's death power is transferred to the head of the national assembly.

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; announced Wednesday they were in negotiations with &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; for the sale of anti-aircraft missiles.

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that he received a letter from Russian President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; in which he told him that Moscow will go ahead with the planned arms deal. 

&lt;a href="al%20Jazeera"&gt;al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; quoted Mr. Sharon saying "I wrote to President Putin but we got an answer [saying] they are going to sell that kind of weapon to the Syrians." There are conflicting reports among news agencies about what type of missiles are being sold&amp;mdash;some have reported that they are &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIgla"&gt;SA-18 Iglas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , while others have reported that they are &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrelet"&gt;Strelets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Iglas are shoulder-fired weapons capable of being carried by individual people, contrasted to Strelets which can only be fired when attached to vehicles, Reuters reported. The former would presumably be more attractive for terrorist proliferation.

In the past Russia had denied that it wanted to sell missiles to Syria. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Israel have protested sales of the missiles, saying Russian arms supplies would aid terrorists in the Middle East. 

There have been concerns that US-made &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFIM-92%20Stinger"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; missiles, similar to the Igla, have been acquired by terrorists in the Middle East and pose potential dangers for military and domestic flights when they are taking off. During the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;Afghan-Soviet war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1979&amp;ndash;1989), the USA sold Stinger missiles to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amujahadeen"&gt;mujahadeen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; fighters to use against the USSR. Various branches of the mujahadeen later became the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, with whom the US has been engaged in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terror"&gt;War on Terror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; since the 2001 World Trade Center/Pentagon attacks.

<h1>Reporters can be jailed, Appellate Court says</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ &amp;nbsp;

&lt;a href="w%3AJudith%20Miller%20%28journalist%29"&gt;Judith Miller&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; and Matthew Cooper of &lt;a href="w%3ATIME"&gt;Time magazine&lt;/a&gt; can be jailed for refusing to reveal their sources to a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; federal &lt;a href="w%3Agrand%20jury"&gt;grand jury&lt;/a&gt;, according to the decision of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20court%20of%20appeals"&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit"&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;

The reporters were among those approached with information about &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; employee, and have refused to testify before an inquiry into the leak of national security information. Neither reporter actually wrote an article about Ms. Plame, whose identity was actually broken by &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Novak"&gt;Robert Novak&lt;/a&gt; in a July 14, 2003 column in the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Sun-Times"&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/a&gt;, but they have been the target of Special Counsel &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.

The U.S. Intelligence Identities Act makes it illegal to reveal the identity of CIA officers. However, the three-judge panel's decision on Tuesday upheld a lower court's ruling last year that Ms. Miller and Mr. Cooper should answer confidential conversations with government sources. Citing secret evidence presented by Mr. Fitzgerald, the panel said this case differs from the classic uncovering of wrongdoing by reporters relying on unnamed sources.

A 6.5 magnitude earthquake has hit the &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href="w%3ASulawesi"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;. The tremor, lasting about 2 minutes, sparked panic in numerous seaside communities on the island. According to officials, no injuries have been reported but sea water levels have risen up to four meters in areas.

Though precise details of the earthquake are still unclear, the US Geological Survey has said the tremor just after 0800 local time (0000 UCT) was 10km (6 mi) beneath the sea bed. Local meteorological officials have reported to the Associated Press news agency the earthquake had been 37km (23 mi) under the Sea of Flores.

The outgoing governor of the &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20Australia"&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Ian Macfarlane, has warned that the Australian economy will probably begin to slow after over a decade of solid growth. Mr Macfarlane, in a speech to the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, said that both interest rates and inflation were likely to rise. "We forecast gradual rises in underlying inflation, with it reaching 2½ per cent by end 2005 and 3 per cent by end 2006."

The Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, responded to the news by saying that "We will never go back to the 17 per cent interest rates under this Government" and added that homeownership "should always be something which is kept within the reach of Australians on modest incomes."

<h1>Airlines fight new EU passenger compensation legislation</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Airlines%20fight%20new%20EU%20passenger%20compensation%20legislation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Airlines have attacked new &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; legislation which will force them to pay greater compensation to customers in the event of overbooking, cancellations and delays.

Consumer groups have praised the new rules, which set the level of compensation between €250 and €600 depending on the circumstances and the length of the flight. "This is some comeback for passengers who have been inconvenienced," James Fremantle, industry affairs adviser for the Air Transport Users Council, told Reuters. Before this legislation came into effect, passengers "bumped" from a flight could claim between €150 and €300.

The new rules apply to all scheduled and chartered flights. Previously only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking&amp;mdash; they did not have to extend compensation to travellers affected by flight cancellations. Low cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels arguing that the compensation paid will exceed the price of the ticket.

The effort by the EU is to discourage airlines from deliberately overbooking flights, a practice which has become routine for most major airlines. Overbooking often leads to "bumping", where passengers who cannot be guaranteed a seat are moved to a later flight. In future when this happens airlines will have to offer compensation. Additionally, if flights are cancelled or delayed by more than two hours all passengers must be compensated. This will be the case except in "extraordinary circumstances", the definition of which may or may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes.

"It's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this," &lt;a href="w%3ARyanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt; deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley told BBC radio 4's &lt;a href="w%3AToday%20programme"&gt;Today programme&lt;/a&gt;. It has also been claimed that the advice may mislead customers by having them believe that they may be entitled to compensation if flights are delayed due to bad weather.

Marja Quillinan-Meiland, European Commission spokeswoman has said that there are "grey areas" but added "these are not as big as the airlines are making out." Disputed cases would be heard by national enforcement bodies which would decide if there is a case to answer. 

&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20regional%20airlines"&gt;European Regions Airline Association&lt;/a&gt; (ERAA) director of air transport Andy Clarke said "we reckon it's going to cost European air passengers – not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by the passengers – 1.5bn euros, that's over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers. That's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted."

These extra costs may also lead to carriers cancelling routes to areas that have been identified as problem destinations. 

The European Low-Fares Association (ELFA) is mounting a legal challenge to the laws. ELFA and &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Air%20Transport%20Association"&gt;International Air Transport Association&lt;/a&gt; expect a ruling from the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;European Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; in fall of 2005, until then airlines have said they will comply with the regulations.

Politicians, associations and citizens took part in the gathering, set up by the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; newspaper Il Manifesto, Sgrena's employer. According to demonstrators there were 500,000 people, while the Police estimates a turnout of 200,000.

"The march is a way to say, loud and clear, that we want Giuliana Sgrena to be freed... to say no to terrorism and violence", &lt;a href="w%3APiero%20Fassino"&gt;Piero Fassino&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratici%20di%20sinistra"&gt;Democratici di Sinistra&lt;/a&gt; (Democrats of the Left) party, said.

Giuliana Sgrena was kidnapped near Baghdad's University on February 4 while she was covering Iraqi elections for Il Manifesto. On February 15 &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; Television received a video showing Sgrena demanding help from Italian politicians and people, and asking for Italian troop's withdrawal from Iraq.

Former Roman Catholic priest Paul Shanley was sentenced to 12-15 years in prison on Tuesday, February 15, 2005. The sentencing occurred at Middlesex Superior Court in &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. Shanley was recently convicted of multiple counts of child rape and indecent assault and battery against a child.

Shanley's conviction is part of the aftermath of what the Boston Globe called a series of "brutally damaging revelations about scores of priests who over a period of decades had kept their jobs despite raping, molesting, and groping children and adolescents." The revelations culminated in the resignation of &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Cardinal%20Law"&gt;Cardinal Bernard F. Law&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Archdiocese of Boston on December 13, 2002.

Australia has defeated New Zealand in the first of five One Day Internationals between the two nations in &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

Batting first Australia set a moderate total of 7 for 236. Opener Matthew Hayden showed a welcome return to form top scoring with 71 runs from 109 balls.

In reply New Zealand looked to be struggling at 5 for 113 but Hamish Marshall's innings of 76 from 69 balls brought them back into the equation, however the Australian pace combination of Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath took New Zealand's final 4 wickets cheaply in the 47th and 48th overs bowling the Kiwi's out for 226.

The series continues on Tuesday in &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>China steps up anti-gambling campaign</h1>

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing (北京; pinyin: Běijīng)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – Chinese President &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; is stepping up a government campaign to eradicate illegal gambling in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, detaining over 4,000 gamblers in an effort to clean up the public image of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; party.

Cadres and officials within the party have been caught using illicit funds, sometimes embezzled from local, state-run organizations, to gamble at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACasino"&gt;casinos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; set up in border-towns within &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMacau"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and in other popular gambling resorts outside of the direct control of the mainland government.

To assuage any fears that this latest campaign extends to ordinary working-class citizens, Deputy Public Security Minister Bu Jingfu has announced that ordinary citizens need not worry about being prosecuted for "friendly" games of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amahjong"&gt;mahjong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He did not specifically address whether mainland citizens should reconsider visiting the numerous mahjong gaming parlors which dot urban centers throughout the country.

"The whip that is used to beat wolves should not be used to beat sheep," stated Bu Jingfu.

China allows a "social welfare" &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alottery"&gt;lottery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , for which citizens can purchase tickets that help to fund social programs. However, this legal form of gambling is mostly favored by lower-income players who don't have the opportunity to travel to the lavish gaming casinos frequented by the wealthier class of businessmen and party officials who can travel across the border on easily obtained one or two-day &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVisa%20%28document%29"&gt;visas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Despite relatively harsh penalties for those who are caught participating in illegal gambling operations, a number of provinces are well-known for hosting high-stakes gamblers in illegal, underground operations that are run on the mainland under the noses of local authorities. To combat these operations on a national level, the Public Security Ministry has sent 13 "inspection teams" to these provinces in an attempt to crack down on these operations.

One historian believes that China's government, which in its various forms has tried to stop avid gamblers for thousands of years, will have no better luck with its current campaign, than it has in the past.

"It is really hard to get rid of gambling," said Guo Shuanglin, a professor of history at People's University in Beijing.

Guo explained, "There were strict laws against gambling in almost every dynasty in China. Take the Song Dynasty, for example, when gamblers were sentenced to death. In the Ming Dynasty, gamblers' hands were chopped off. Even in the period of the Republic of China, they had a very strict anti-gambling law."

As far away as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , casino operators are seeing a shift in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ademographics"&gt;demographics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for their most elite players, called "whales", who are known to bet upwards of US$50,000 a hand. Since the 1980s, Las Vegas has seen a shift from Japanese businessmen to Chinese players, who now make up over 50% of the high-end clientele at some Las Vegas casinos.

Shen Mingming, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeking%20University"&gt;Beijing University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; expert on Chinese gambling, is skeptical that China's government can sustain a long-term campaign against gambling.

"It means long hours for the police, and it cannot be sustained," he said. "When the campaign is over, these organizations just quietly come back to life. Can you keep doing these campaigns every few months?"

However, this time China's government has set up a special telephone number, to encourage citizens to turn in government officials who are embezzling government funds for illicit gambling runs.

China has recently conducted a series of high-profile arrests of corrupt officials who are caught gambling with public funds, two of whom used tens of millions of dollars to fund their gambling lifestyle.

The government has also made one special arrest to show that even high-level officials are not immune to prosecution due to their party position. Cai Haowen, who had been groomed by former Chinese President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJiang%20Zemin"&gt;Jiang Zemin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was arrested this month on an overnight train in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJilin"&gt;Jilin (吉林; pinyin: Jílín)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; province, while fleeing authorities for embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars and losing it all while gambling.

Finally, China is starting to crack down on the easy visa programs which have permitted so much traffic to gambling emporiums outside of mainland government control. The new visa program requires that records be kept of the identity of the visa holder. This new visa requirement has started to have a noticeable effect on some border-town casinos, leaving a number of properties with idle employees and few Chinese customers.

Thirty fans were arrested and five officers were injured Saturday night in &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United%20F.C"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;'s 2-0 win at Everton in an &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Cup"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; match up.

Officers in riot gear were called out to the Everton Valley section of the city to separate the rival fans of the teams. It is believed that Ill-feeling marking &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt;'s return to &lt;a href="w%3AGoodison%20Park"&gt;Goodison Park&lt;/a&gt; erupted outside the ground into what Merseyside Police called "large-scale disturbances". Officers were hit by rock, bottles, and other projectiles, several needed to be taken to area hospitals for treatment of their injuries.

During the match, a missile from the crowd struck United keeper &lt;a href="w%3ARoy%20Carroll"&gt;Roy Carroll&lt;/a&gt;. Everton have vowed to ban for life the fan who threw the projectile, believed to be a coin, which injured Carroll. Police also reported recovering a mobile phone which was thrown onto the pitch during the game.

Madrid - &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; today will be the first of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; nations over the next few years to vote on the &lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20establishing%20a%20Constitution%20for%20Europe"&gt;treaty establishing a EU constitution&lt;/a&gt;. The referendum being held, one of 9 confirmed by member countries, is expected to draw 40 to 50% of Spain's 35 million voters. 

Polling stations have been opening since 0800 UTC, with a small stream of people casting their ballot. The question on the ballot paper is:

It is expected that a yes vote will come from the referendum, though the referendum is non-binding, with parliament having the final say.

However, despite constant media bombardment, as many as 90% of Spaniards are unsure of the content of the constitution, according to a government poll. 

Spain has been a member of the European Union since 1986 and has received large amounts of development grants and subsidies. Since joining, it has grown into one of biggest economies in Europe and the world. 

<h2>Results</h2>

According to the Spanish Interior Ministry, all of the ballots being casted 77% have said "sí" (yes) to the &lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20establishing%20a%20Constitution%20for%20Europe"&gt;treaty establishing a EU constitution&lt;/a&gt;. However turnout has been low with only 42% of the voters voting in this referendum.

&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing (北京; pinyin: Běijīng)&lt;/a&gt; – The Chinese government is rebuffing a joint statement issued by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, which has broken new diplomatic ground by declaring that &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; is a shared strategic security concern for the two nations.

Beijing's opposing statement read, "Chinese Government and people resolutely opposes the United States and Japan in issuing any bilateral document concerning China's Taiwan, which meddles the internal affairs of China, and hurts China's sovereignty."

China's Foreign Ministry also, "urged the United States to see to their respective commitments toward Chinese people concerning Taiwan, and refrain from doing things that affect peace and stability in Asia and Pacific."

The US-Japan statement also asked &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, "to improve the transparency of its military affairs".

The joint statement was issued after a US-Japan meeting, attended by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;US Defense Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, Japanese &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Japan%29"&gt;Foreign Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANobutaka%20Machimura"&gt;Nobutaka Machimura&lt;/a&gt;, and Japan's defense chief Yoshinori Ono.

On the US-Japan relationship, Rumsfeld declared, "I can't think of a time when the relationship has been closer or more constructive".

Rumsfeld also noted that China, which is in Asia, is, "increasing its military capabilities in a fairly significant way".

"It (the Taiwan Strait) is seldom, if at all, referred to in a formal document," said a US official.

Diplomats pointed out that the joint US-Japan statement was a first in the 50-year alliance between the two countries.

Former Pentagon official Dan Blumenthal believes Taiwan will welcome this statement.

"China has been investing very heavily on &lt;a href="w%3ABallistic%20missiles"&gt;ballistic missiles&lt;/a&gt; that they deploy across the Taiwan Strait as a tool of coercion and intimidation. They have some five- to six-hundred missiles pointed at Taiwan, but it concerns other regional actors as well, not just Taiwan," he said.

Bilateral discussions between US and Japanese officials at the cabinet and ministerial levels of their respective governments have not been held since December, 2002.

A flash of energy from across the galaxy on December 27 was 100 times larger than any previously seen. The x-ray burst was powerful enough to affect our ionosphere in the same way a solar flare does.

According to astronomers at the , the enormous energy burst from a remote magnetar was likely caused by an abrupt adjustment, or "starquake", in the outer layer of the magnetar, causing a "catastrophic" disruption of its magnetic field.

More energy was released in a tenth of a second than our sun has emitted since the dawning of the human race.

The magnetar, known as SGR 1806-20, is 50,000 light years away in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. That places it on the opposite side of our Milky Way galaxy, which is roughly a disk 100,000 light years across.

Magnetars are a rare type of neutron star with unusually strong magnetic fields. SGR 1806-20 is only 20 kilometers in diameter, rotates once every 7.5 seconds, and has a mass comparable to our sun.

Neutron stars are stars which have exhausted their nuclear fuel and collapsed. There are no electrons or atoms in the cores of these massive objects, just neutrons packed tightly together.

An article from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics will be published soon in Nature magazine.

An outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonic%20plague"&gt;pneumonic plague&lt;/a&gt; has killed 61 people as of February 15 in the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (WHO).

The deadly disease has struck in Ituri district, Oriental province, in the northern part of Congo. While 61 deaths have been confirmed, the total number of cases is not known.

Samples have been taken from 40 patients and sent to laboratories in &lt;a href="w%3AKinshasa"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt; for analysis. So far, all the victims have been suffering from pneumonic plague, with no cases of &lt;a href="w%3Abubonic%20plague"&gt;bubonic plague&lt;/a&gt; detected.

All the victims are workers at a diamond mine employing 7,000 people. The mine was re-opened on December 16 last year, and the first cases were reported four days later.

Teams from &lt;a href="w%3AM%C3%A9decins%20sans%20Fronti%C3%A8res"&gt;Médecins sans Frontières&lt;/a&gt;, WHO, Medair and the Ministry of Health have gone to the region to assess the situation, while a multi-disciplinary team flew to the area yesterday. 

If access is possible, the team will assist in treatment, surveillance, and in the tracing of people who have possibly been exposed to the disease.

Pneumonic plague is a highly infectious disease which has caused many epidemics and pandemics in history. Pneumonic plague differs from bubonic as it specifically infects the lungs.

The infected lungs raise the possibility of person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets. The incubation period for pneumonic plague is usually between two to four days, but can be as little as a few hours. The initial symptoms of headache, weakness, and coughing with hemoptysis are indistinguishable from other respiratory illnesses. Without diagnosis and treatment the infection can be fatal in one to six days; mortality in untreated cases may be as high as 95%. The disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics.

It is primarily a disease of rodents. Human infection most often occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has previously fed on an infected rodent.

Globally, the World Health Organization reports 1,000 to 3,000 human cases of plague every year.

Passengers and employees in the &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Blue"&gt;Virgin Blue&lt;/a&gt; terminal took ill early morning, reporting &lt;a href="w%3Avomiting"&gt;vomiting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Anausea"&gt;nausea&lt;/a&gt; and difficulty breathing. Around 10 a.m. hundreds were evacuated from the terminal as a precaution.

At this stage the source of the leak has not been identified.

American author and journalist &lt;a href="w%3AHunter%20S.%20Thompson"&gt;Hunter S. Thompson&lt;/a&gt; found dead in his Aspen, Colorado home of an apparent suicide. His son, Juan Thompson, told the Associated Press that his 67-year-old father shot himself at the &lt;a href="w%3AAspen%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Aspen, Colorado&lt;/a&gt; residence.

"On Feb. 20, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson took his life with a gunshot to the head at his fortified compound in Woody Creek, Colorado. The family will shortly provide more information about memorial service and media contacts. Hunter prized his privacy and we ask that his friends and admirers respect that privacy as well as that of his family," Juan Thompson said in a statement issued to Aspen Daily News. The death was confirmed by Pitkin County Sheriff Bob Braudis.

Hunter S. Thompson was best known for his 1972 book "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". He was recently married and had emotionally supported his friend John Kerry's candidacy.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Romania%20plans%20its%20next%20privatisation%20initiatives&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; Government has made plans and identified its aims for the next privatisation program which will end in 2006. By the end of next year, the government hopes to sell all of its shares in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomtelecom"&gt;Romtelecom&lt;/a&gt;, Romania's largest telecommunications company, which is currently owned by Greece's OTE but which the government maintains a 47% share in. The full privatisation will occur in two phases, with some of the government's existing shares being sold on the Bucharest Stock Exchange this year, and the remainder being sold in 2006.

By 2006, the government also wants to sell its share in Postelecom, another telecommunications operator, and complete the privatisation of the Radiocomunicaţii, the national radio communications company.

The Government also wantes to begin analysis and consulting into the privatisation of ♡❤Poşta Română♡❤, or Romanian Post, the full privatisation of which is set to be completed by 2009 at the latest.

Romania has embarked on a quite comprehensive program of privatisation since 2000, having privatised a part of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomtelecom"&gt;Romtelecom&lt;/a&gt;, as well as full privatisations of several energy distributors and the nation's largest banks, in addition to other smaller companies. However, these privatisations are dwarfed by that of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APetrom"&gt;Petrom&lt;/a&gt;, Romania's national oil company, which was bought by Austria's OMV in 2004 and is the largest Romanian privatisation ever.

The current &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJustice%20and%20Truth"&gt;Liberal-Democrat&lt;/a&gt; governing coalition in Romania has privatisation and economic liberalism as one of its main policies, having also introduced a 16% flat tax rate for personal income and corporate profits at the start of 2005.

The largest multiplex cinema complex in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; opened on Friday in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. The cinema is operated by Movieplex Italy and is located in the Plaza Romania shopping centre. Robert Longhi, the general manager of Movieplex, said that the value of the investment reached 4.7 million euro. It is estimated that, during the first year of activity, the cinema will attract one million customers.

Plaza Romania is one of the newest shopping centres in Bucharest, having opened in October 2004 after a 45 million euro investment by Anchor Group, a Turkish company, which also invested in the Bucharest Mall, another large shopping centre in the Romanian capital.

As the bicentennial anniversary of &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAbraham%20Lincoln"&gt;Abraham Lincoln's&lt;/a&gt; birth approaches in &lt;a href="w%3A2009"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, renewed interest is resulting in a new Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in &lt;a href="w%3ASpringfield%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Springfield, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; in the United States of America &amp;ndash; the town he called home.

<h2>Romance</h2>
Extrapolating out of a long-neglected set of interviews conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Herndon"&gt;William Herndon&lt;/a&gt;, Lincoln's partner in law for 16 years, scholars have found that Lincoln seemed to have a soft side. Within a few years of his arrival, Lincoln fell in love with a local tavern keeper's daughter &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="w%3AAnn%20Rutledge"&gt;Ann Rutledge&lt;/a&gt;. Herndon was surprised to hear about her, but of 24 people Herndon interviewed to who knew Lincoln and Ann at the time, 22 said he courted her. But in August, Rutledge contracted typhoid fever and died.

From then on, Lincoln would resemble the stoic man celebrated today. However, he was not without depression upon the death of his lover. One witness remembered, "He made a remark one day when it was raining that he could not bear the idea of its raining on her grave." Lincoln's exceptional reaction, to the point that many worried that he would commit suicide, had more to do with his own past &amp;ndash; the death of his mother when he was but nine years old.

Lincoln would court again, this time to Mary Todd. After a guilty one year and still no commitment, Lincoln wrote to &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Speed"&gt;James Speed&lt;/a&gt;, a friend with whom he lived for more than four years, that he was racked with the "never-absent idea that there is ♡❤one♡❤ still unhappy whom I have contributed to make so. That still kills my soul." Upon a hasty marriage, "the debilitating episodes of 'hypo'"&amp;mdash;as Lincoln called his depressions&amp;mdash;"did not recur," and henceforth, Lincoln was known for his resolution, a matter of necessity to actually initiate and carry out the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20War"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href="w%3AEmancipation%20Proclamation"&gt;emancipate&lt;/a&gt; the slaves.

<h2>Sexuality</h2>
In a his book, ♡❤The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln♡❤ ( ) (published posthumously), published last month, the late psychologist &lt;a href="w%3AC.A.%20Tripp"&gt;C.A. Tripp&lt;/a&gt; asserts that Abraham Lincoln was "predominately homosexual". Most historians, however, disagree, pointing out that Tripp is applying 20 century social mores to a 19 century context. They have noted that many men slept in beds together in the 19 century, and that Tripp is wrong when he states that Speed is the only one to whom Lincoln signed letters "Yours forever" &amp;ndash; he signed notes to at least a dozen other people this exact way. Historian David Herbert Donald writes, "I simply cannot believe that, if the early relationship between Joshua Speed and Lincoln had been sexual, the president of the United States would so freely and publicly speak of it."

<h2>Early Politics</h2>
In his 20s and 30s, Lincoln was more subversive than people acknowledge. As a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Whig%20Party"&gt;Whig Party&lt;/a&gt;, he published anonymous letters in local newspapers deriding his party's political opponents, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;. This practice was not uncommon at the time, but Burlingame, a historian who is writing a four-volume biography of Lincoln, has come across more than 200 such letters he believes were penned by Lincoln. During the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20presidential%20election"&gt;presidential elections&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201836"&gt;1836&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201840"&gt;1840&lt;/a&gt;, he accused the Democratic candidate, &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Van%20Buren"&gt;Martin Van Buren&lt;/a&gt;, of supporting black &lt;a href="w%3ASuffrage"&gt;suffrage&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;what he seemed to suggest as an unforgivable sin.

However, through writing a mockery of the Democratic state auditor, James Shields, for being, "a fool as well as a liar," being challenged to a duel by Shields, and the two men barely being persuaded by their seconds to call it off, "Lincoln may, for the first time, have understood 'honor' and honorable behavior as all-important, as necessary, as a matter of life and death," writes Wilson.

Four years after his squabble with Shields, Lincoln was elected to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. However, his &lt;a href="w%3A1846"&gt;1846&lt;/a&gt; two-year term was uneventful&amp;mdash;he passed no bills and his only notable speech criticized the ongoing &lt;a href="w%3AMexican-American%20War"&gt;Mexican War&lt;/a&gt;, making him seem disloyal at home. Upon the elections of &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201848"&gt;1848&lt;/a&gt; he merely went back home and got to work in his law practice. He was incredibly successful &amp;ndash; he probably handled over 5,100 cases over his career &amp;ndash; and earned perhaps twice the money historians previously thought. His supporters made him out a simple backwoods man, but Cullom Davis, &lt;a href="w%3AProfessor%23Main%20positions%3A%202"&gt;professor emeritus&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Springfield"&gt;University of Illinois&amp;ndash;Sprinfield&lt;/a&gt;, commented that, "by the mid-&lt;a href="w%3A1850"&gt;1850&lt;/a&gt;s, you'd have to say he was enjoying an upper-middle-class lifestyle."

Again, he was a heroic man who would not only take clients whose cases he philosophically agreed with, Lincoln represented all people across all spectrums &amp;ndash; from murderers to adulterers, farmers to doctors. In &lt;a href="w%3A1847"&gt;1847&lt;/a&gt;, Lincoln even defended a &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; slave owner who wanted to keep some slaves in Illinois, where slavery was illegal. Lincoln lost.

Fortunately, Lincoln's large law practice gave him national recognition, and when push came to shove, despite being moralistically human, Lincoln tackled, head-on, the most vexing issue of at least one and one-half decades. The &lt;a href="w%3AKansas-Nebraska%20Act"&gt;Kansas-Nebraska Act&lt;/a&gt;, which created future states such that voters could decide for themselves whether slaves would be allowed in their area, completely undermining the &lt;a href="w%3AMissouri%20Compromise%20of%201820"&gt;Missouri Compromise&lt;/a&gt;, gave Lincoln the inspiration he needed, along with an enduring and haunting image of shackled slaves on the Ohio River, "like so many fish upon a trot-line."

And so Lincoln leapt into the fray, denouncing slavery, although he undoubtedly found its guarantee entwined in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. Abraham Lincoln, however, would once again show his capacity to rise and meet the challenge; before leaving Illinois for the White House, he told a group of journalists, "Well, boys, your troubles are over now; mine have just begun."

As part of the confidence-building measures in the newly agreed ceasefire being brokered by Palestinian President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; and Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; has released 500 Palestinian prisoners into &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;.

The release is the largest mass release of Palestinian prisoners for nearly a decade, since the release of 800 prisoners in 1996, and comes within a package of measures agreed by the Palestinian and Israeli governments at the Egyptian resort of &lt;a href="w%3ASharm-el-Sheik"&gt;Sharm-el-Sheik&lt;/a&gt;.

"Releasing prisoners is a very good step," said Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief.

Abbas and the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; expressed disappointment that Sharon has refused to release larger numbers of the more than 8,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons. Israel has promised to release an additional 400 prisoners in the coming months, with the names to be determined by a joint Palestinian-Israeli committee.

Israel is very concerned that the former prisoners not jeopardize the peace initiatives, and has required each to sign a pledge not to return to violence.

The Israeli cabinet approved Sharon's plan to withdraw from Gaza and the evacuation of Settlers from the West Bank on Monday, Feb. 21.

&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; – 
A simple saliva test can predict whether children will get cavities, how many cavities they will get and which teeth are most vulnerable.

Developed by researchers at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usc.edu/"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles, the test quantifies the genetic component of &lt;a href="w%3Atooth%20decay"&gt;tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;, spotting the risk when something can be done about it. 

"When we apply this to young children, it allows us to predict what might be their future caries history&amp;mdash;the number of cavities that they'll get by, say, their late 20s or early 30s," says researcher &lt;a href="http%3A//uscsd03.usc.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_results.asp%3FEmployeeID%3DX99"&gt;Paul Denny&lt;/a&gt;. 

Called the Caries Assessment and Risk Evaluation (CARE) test, the test measures the relative proportions in &lt;a href="w%3Asaliva"&gt;saliva&lt;/a&gt; of different types of sugar chains called &lt;a href="w%3Aoligosaccharides"&gt;oligosaccharides&lt;/a&gt;. The same sugar chains are present on tooth surfaces. 

The effect of sugar chains on teeth's resistance to disease is analogous to the effect of "good" and "bad" cholesterol on blood vessels. "Good" sugar chains tend to repel bacteria that cause cavities while "bad" allow bacteria to bond to teeth and start the decay process. Unlike cholesterol, however, sugar chain makeup in humans is 100% genetically determined. 

Denny and colleagues have found that the sugar chain makeup in saliva can predict a child's future cavity history to plus or minus one cavity with greater than 98% confidence. 

The findings suggest that in developed areas of the modern era genes play a more significant role in tooth decay than in former times or third world nations where gross malnutrition and negligent oral hygiene held the greatest impact on dental health.

Avalanches following the worst snow in two decades have killed over 100 people south of Srinagar in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n-administered Kashmir, with many more still missing and remote areas still isolated. Forty-five tourists have been rescued, and the death toll is expected to rise as rescuers--including a large number of Indian troops--deal with the 4.5 metres of snow that have fallen since last Friday.

The crisis has cut off electricity in Srinagar for three days and is not affecting the water supplies. There are queues for cooking gas, and helicopters have been bringing in additional supplies.

&lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; today became the first &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; member to ratify the new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20establishing%20a%20Constitution%20for%20Europe"&gt;EU Constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Areferendum"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . With a vote of 77%, the Yes camp, lead by Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Luis%20Rodriguez%20Zapatero"&gt;Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was the winner. Speaking about the result he said, ♡❤"Today has been a great day for all Europeans"♡❤. 
The No campaigners, who achieved 17% of the vote, were eager to point out the low turnout of 42%.

With the referendum, one in three Spaniards gave a yes vote. This is in stark contrast to the 90% of the Spanish Parliament that voted yes for the Constitution.

Despite the apparent enthusiasm by Spaniards for the new constitution, a recent government poll indicated only one in ten actually knew anything about its contents.

The official campaign was mainly dedicated to ask for the ♡❤yes♡❤ vote, without explaining the contents of the text. Very popular faces of singers and footballers were used for this campaign.

Although a Yes vote is a welcome start for the constitution - which must be ratified by all 25 member states by November 2006 - Spain was seen by many political commentators as an easy win. It is expected that of the twenty-five countries, Britain is the most likely to vote No.

An &lt;a href="earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude of 6.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hit &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. The earthquake was centered around the southeastern town of Zarand, about 440 miles away from the capital, &lt;a href="Tehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;. Early reports indicate at least 40 villages with a combined population of 30,000 people have been damaged, with 420 deaths and slightly less than a thousand injured. 

Earthquakes are nothing new to Iran, with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2003%20Bam%20earthquake"&gt;one in the nearby desert city of Bam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; killing 31,000 people in December 2003. Heavy rain and bad visibility have made early relief efforts difficult; despite this some 1,500 members of the Iranian &lt;a href="Red%20Crescent"&gt;Red Crescent&lt;/a&gt; have begun organising camps for the newly homeless.

<h1>Canada's next ambassador to U.S. instigates outrage over missile defense</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

OTTAWA - &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20McKenna"&gt;Frank McKenna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada's&lt;/a&gt; next Ambassador to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, announced Canada's partnership in the U.S.A.'s &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Missile%20Defense"&gt;continental missile shield program&lt;/a&gt;. "We are part of it now," he said at a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; has said there is no deadline, that Canada has not made a decision and will not until the matter has been debated, and Defense Minister Bill Graham agrees: "Canada's position is not a done deal."

Opposition parties expressed a range of responses on this hotly contested topic. Bloc Québécois MP Michel Gauthier charged "They don't want to tell the population that we've got our arm in the wringer of the washing machine and it's sucking us in." 

Stephen Harper, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; and a long-time proponent of the missile shield program, was angered by the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;'s failure to live up to its promise to bring the issue up in parliament before any decisionmaking. "How could this prime minister secretly make this decision, so clearly breaking every commitment he's made to this house and to Canadians?"

The Canadian public is adamantly opposed to the missile defense, as they have shown in several polls. Martin's own party is on record opposing the installation of U.S. missiles in space or Canadian territory, so there were outcries from within the Liberal Party as well as from the opposition. 

Recent tests of the missile defense have failed, on February 14, 2005 and December 15, 2004. The next most recent test was more than two years earlier.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has admitted this week's decision to commit an additional 450 troops to &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; is a policy backflip.

During the 2004 election campaign Mr Howard indicated that there would be no major increase in the number of Australian troops in Iraq. However yesteday's announcement is set to more than double the number of Australian troops on the ground in Iraq.

Mr Howard justified the reversal of policy as being in the "broader interests of democracy in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;". He also explained that the decision came in response to requests from &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; leaders.

The commitment of extra troops comes as a result of the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; government's decision to withdraw 1400 soldiers from Iraq, in response to political pressure in Holland.

The Australians will be deployed to the Iraqi province of &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Muthanna"&gt;Al Muthanna&lt;/a&gt; to provide military support for Japanese engineers working on reconstruction projects.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, has publically-approved the accession of candidate countries &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, which are set to join the EU on January 1, 2007. The approval comes after Bulgaria and Romania completed accession negotiations in June and December respectively, and the text for the Accession Treaty was completed earlier this month.

The next step before accession will be the approval of the Accession Treaty by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on April 13, before the document is expected to be signed on April 25.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOlli%20Rehn"&gt;Olli Rehn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the European Commissioner for Enlargement, who is from Finland, said that the EC's approval marks a new stage in the relations between the EU and the two candidate countries, and gives a clear message that the Commission welcomes Bulgaria and Romania into the European family.

However, Rehn also said that the two countries have a lot left to be done until their accession in less than two years. The release states that, "The Commission will continue to carefully monitor whether the two countries respect their engagements and obligations until accession and will support the two with all the instruments at its disposal."

Another important mention was that of the safeguard clause, which means that if any of the two countries do not meet their reform fulfillments and there are serious problems with their progress respecting their obligations, the EU can postpone accession by one year, to 2008.

The Romanian prime minister, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu%20Tariceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , responded to the approval by saying that, "The EC approval for the Accession Treaty confirms Romania is fulfilling its commitments and that the country is on schedule with the integration process."

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomanian%20leu"&gt;leu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania's&lt;/a&gt; national currency, continues to appreciate against the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUS%20dollar"&gt;US dollar&lt;/a&gt; after it reached high levels a few days ago. Yesterday, one euro could be bought for just 35,844 lei, down from 36,133 lei two days ago. These rates are also significantly stronger from the period in mid-2004 when the euro was worth more than 40,000 lei. Last week, the leu reached such a high rate against the euro that the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANational%20Bank%20of%20Romania"&gt;National Bank of Romania&lt;/a&gt; had to intervene and restore the exchange rate back to around 37,000 lei per euro. The leu's growth also had an impact on global exchange rates, weakening the US dollar worldwide by 1%.

The National Bank, however, is hesitant to intervene in the marketplace once again due to the positive effects of the leu's appreciation on importers, who can now get products for lower prices, and for consumers, who now have higher purchasing power for imported goods. Romanians are also pleased that their currency, which has faced long periods of fairly sharp depreciation in the 1990s due to high inflation, is finally picking up again and strengthening against other currencies.

The leu's appreciation, however, isn't all positive, because it is putting a great deal of pressure on exporters. Other countries are finding Romanian exports more expensive, and therefore less competitive, due to the leu's appreciation, and this could widen the already large account deficit in the country.

Analysts predict, however, that the leu's surge cannot be stopped and it will continue strengthening against the euro, reaching a rate of 34,000 lei for one euro in the next week.

The current leu will be replaced in July 2005 with the New Leu (RON), with 10,000 old lei = 1 New Leu. The revaluation is expected to prepare Romania for adoption of the euro in 2012. Starting from next month, all Romanian prices must be shown in both the old currency and the new currency. The National Bank of Romania has said that it expects the exchange rate between the New Leu and the euro to hover at around 3.5 RON = 1 euro when the RON is introduced.

Astronomers claim they have discovered the first galaxy made entirely of dark matter. 

The &lt;a href="w%3Agalaxy"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; was found 50 million light years away using the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.jb.man.ac.uk/tech/lovell/"&gt;University of Manchester's Lovell Telescope&lt;/a&gt; in Cheshire and confirmed with the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.naic.edu/"&gt;Arecibo telescope&lt;/a&gt; in Puerto Rico. 

While it contains mass that rotates like a normal galaxy, it contains no stars. Rather, it appears to entirely comprise &lt;a href="w%3Adark%20matter"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt;, mysterious matter that differs greatly from the normal (baryonic) matter with which we're familiar. 

The discovery came from a five-year project to study the distribution of &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrogen"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; atoms throughout the Universe. Hydrogen gas releases radiation that can be detected by &lt;a href="w%3Aradio%20telescope"&gt;radio telescopes&lt;/a&gt;. 

In the cluster of galaxies known as &lt;a href="w%3AVirgo"&gt;Virgo&lt;/a&gt;, an international team from the UK, France, Italy and Australia led by researchers at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cf.ac.uk/"&gt;Cardiff University&lt;/a&gt; found hydrogen atoms amounting to 100 million times the mass of the Sun. 

They have named the find VIRGOHI21. 

The find is considered incredibly important because cosmological models suggest that dark matter is five times more abundant than baryonic matter in the Universe yet is difficult to study from Earth because of the planet's proximity to the Sun.

"The Universe has all sorts of secrets still to reveal to us, but this shows that we are beginning to understand how to look at it in the right way," says &lt;a href="http%3A//www.astro.cf.ac.uk/cgi-bin/staff%3F-k%2BDaviesJonathan"&gt;Jon Davies&lt;/a&gt; of Cardiff. "It's a really exciting discovery."

<h1>Effort on to eradicate Polio from Asia in 2005</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has announced its goal to eradicate &lt;a href="w%3APolio"&gt;Polio&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AAsia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. 

The 16 year old private-public project aims to add &lt;a href="w%3APoliomyelitis"&gt;Poliomyelitis&lt;/a&gt; to the list of childhood diseases which have been eliminated. The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARotary%20International"&gt;Rotary International&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Children%27s%20Fund"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt; are leading the Initiative and coordinating a series of overlapping immunization campaigns in the region.

In 2004 &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; cut their number of &lt;a href="w%3APolio"&gt;Polio&lt;/a&gt; cases by 45%. In 2005 the goal is to cut the number of cases by 100%.

The three countries are the last in Asia to have endemic polio, and the disease is confined to a small number of regions within the country. Only 186 cases were reported in 2004, down from 336 the previous year.

<h1>Mysterious power failure takes down Wikipedia, Wikinews</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mysterious%20power%20failure%20takes%20down%20Wikipedia%2C%20Wikinews&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
On Monday, at 10.14 pm UTC, the Wikimedia server cluster experienced a total power failure, taking down Wikipedia, Wikinews, and all other Wikimedia websites.

The servers are housed in a &lt;a href="w%3Acolocation%20centre"&gt;colocation facility&lt;/a&gt; (colo) in &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D%2520412%2520East%2520Madison%2520Street%2520Suite%25201100%2520%2520Tampa%252C%2520Florida%252033602"&gt;Tampa, Florida, USA&lt;/a&gt;. They occupy two racks, with each rack receiving electricity from two independent supplies. However, both supplies have circuit-breakers in them, and both opened at the same time, leading to a total power failure. All computers immediately went down. It's normal for fire safety regulations to prohibit &lt;a href="w%3AUninterruptable%20power%20supply"&gt;uninterruptible power supplies&lt;/a&gt; in colos, with the colo providing its own UPS and generator instead. The circuit breakers were on the computer side of this emergency power system, so none of the computers continued to receive power to survive the breaker trip or shut down safely.

The actual reason why the circuit breakers tripped is currently unknown.

When power was restored, it was discovered that most of the &lt;a href="w%3AMySQL"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt; databases that store the data which makes up Wikipedia et al had been corrupted. The main database and the four slaves had all damaged the data on their hard disk drives beyond the ability of the auto-correction to repair. Only one copy survived safely, on a machine that is used for report generation and maintenance tasks, which remained 31 hours backlogged while catching up after an unusually heavy update load during the previous week. 

Volunteer Wikimedia engineers worked through the night rebuilding the databases from the sole good copy onto the other servers. The Wikipedia database is over 180Gb in size, making the copying process last 1.5 - 2 hours for every server it was performed upon.

Regular back-ups of the database of Wikipedia projects are maintained - the encyclopedia in its entirety was ♡❤not♡❤ at risk. The last database download was made on February 9; all edits since then could only have been laboriously rebuilt from logs and recovered from the damaged database requiring much more time and effort.

Limited read-only service was established late Tuesday afternoon, with editing becoming possible 24 hours after the power failure. Final repairs continue now, as well as upgrades to prevent similar issues in the future. Server-intensive features, such as categories and 'watchlists' that display recent changes to selected articles to registered users, remain disabled to ease the load on the recovering systems.

The process which led to the damage originated with the operating system, disk controllers, or hard drives failing to flush the data correctly. 

If the power to a database server is cut mid-write, the database may be corrupted and unreadable, however the operating system, hardware, and software are designed to make this very unlikely. In a previous incident in 2004 power was also lost to a server but the database was undamaged.

To avoid such damage, each database server saves a copy of an edit to be applied to the database on a separate storage system before making the actual update to the database itself. This so-called 'write-ahead logging' should ensure that in the event of a system crash, the database can be rebuilt from a 'last-good' state by replaying the edits saved in the log. 

Earlier this year popular blogging site LiveJournal suffered a similar power failure when another customer at their colocation facility pressed an Emergency Power Off button, intended for use only by firefighters. The company suffered database corruption similar to that seen at Wikimedia. 

LiveJournal are now fitting UPS to their servers to ensure that they have time to shut down safely in the event of a power failure. Wikimedia was said to be investigating the possibility of fitting similar equipment at the time of this failure.

Several pundits have suggested that the use of another database, such as the proprietary database Oracle or the free PostgreSQL, would have avoided the database corruption seen at the server cluster. A post-mortem of the incident show the failure was in the operating system, or the hardware, or some combination of the two. LiveJournal, which also uses MySQL, reported similar database corruption after their power cut.

The Wikimedia foundation only allows the use of &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt; on its systems, and future versions of the &lt;a href="w%3AMediawiki"&gt;Mediawiki&lt;/a&gt; software will support the PostgreSQL database.

Users are reminded that during times of system failure or excessive demand, they can still search Wikipedia &lt;a href="http%3A//www.google.com/advanced_search%3Fq%3D%2Bsite%3Awikipedia.org%26amp%3Bnum%3D100"&gt;using Google&lt;/a&gt;. The articles may be viewed using Google's cache.

♡❤♡London, Dublin♡❤♡ - The illegal &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20dye"&gt;food dye&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤Sudan Red 1♡❤, derived from chillies and banned in the EU since &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, due to an associated risk of cancer has been found in several hundred products on European shelves. Products containing the illegal ingredient range from &lt;a href="w%3ACrisps"&gt;crisps&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href="w%3ACasserole"&gt;casseroles&lt;/a&gt; and various chicken products to dozens of seasonings and sauces. The Italian food authorities found the illegal dye over routine checks, and thus alerted the British and subsequently the Irish authorities. 

The dye found its way into the European food supply as a primary ingredient in a batch of ♡❤Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce♡❤ ingredient manufactured in &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; by ♡❤Premier Foods♡❤, which was then used in all of the affected food products. As a result of the find over 400 products have been withdrawn in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The financial cost of recalling all the affected products in Britain alone is expected to top £100m, €145m.

Despite the recall many industry experts are trying to calm the public. One common analogy in use is, ♡❤"Just like one cigarette is unlikely to cause cancer on its own, one meal containing Sudan Red is also unlikely to cause cancer."♡❤ The problem is, if people regularly consume the dye, then the risk of cancer is greatly increased.

<h2>Which products are affected</h2>

Several lists have been published by the UK and Irish food standard authorities. All products on the following lists contain the dye and should either be thrown out or returned to the shop where purchased:

A compound in the common daisy-like plant feverfew kills human leukemia stem cells and could form the basis for newer, more effective drugs for the disease.

American researchers at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.urmc.rochester.edu/"&gt;University of Rochester Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in New York say that it could take months to develop a useable drug from the compound, &lt;a href="w%3Aparthenolide"&gt;parthenolide&lt;/a&gt;. 

However, they are working to do so with chemists at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.uky.edu/"&gt;University of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; who have identified a water-soluble molecule with the same properties. The US &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nci.nih.gov/"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; has also accepted the work into its rapid access program, which aims to speed experimental drugs into human clinical trials. 

"This research is a very important step in setting the stage for future development of a new therapy for leukemia," says Rochester researcher &lt;a href="http%3A//www.urmc.rochester.edu/GEBS/faculty/Craig_Jordan.htm"&gt;Craig Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. "We have proof that we can kill leukemia stem cells with this type of agent, and that is good news."

Parthenolide appears to target the roots of &lt;a href="w%3Amyeloid%20leukemia"&gt;myeloid leukemia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Astem%20cell"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, while current treatments including the relatively new drug &lt;a href="w%3AGleevec"&gt;Gleevec&lt;/a&gt; don't. So, "You're pulling the weed without getting to the root," says Jordan. 

Used for centuries to fight fevers, inflammation and arthritis, &lt;a href="w%3Afeverfew"&gt;feverfew&lt;/a&gt; earned interest from the Rochester researchers after other scientists showed that it could prevent skin cancer in animal models. 

So the researchers investigated how a concentrated form of the plant component parthenolide would affect leukemia cells and normal cells. 

Comparing the impact of parthenolide to the common chemotherapy drug &lt;a href="w%3Acytarabine"&gt;cytarabine&lt;/a&gt;, they found that parthenolide selectively killed leukemia cells while sparing normal cells better. 

While the findings suggest that parthenolide is a good starting point for new drugs, people with leukemia aren't being encouraged to take high doses of feverfew as they could not take enough of the remedy to halt the disease. 

The research is reported in the journal ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.bloodjournal.org/"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

<h1>Palestinian legislators approve new cabinet for Abbas</h1>
♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ 

Legislators in &lt;a href="w%3ARamallah"&gt;Ramallah&lt;/a&gt; have accepted a cabinet with few returning staff after twice rejecting Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia's more staid proposals.

"We have agreed in principle with Abu Mazen (Abbas) to let this crisis pass," Fatah MP Mohammed Horani said.

Members of the dominant &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; party rejected two earlier line ups, before accepting the third late Wednesday after a further meeting with President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;. Fatah controls 63 of the 85 seats in the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Legislative%20Council"&gt;Palestinian Legislative Council&lt;/a&gt;.

The legislators were dismayed by a lack of change in the initial offerings, reportedly heavy with old guard politicians from the previous administration. Approximately 70% of the 24 cabinet members are new ministers that have not served before. Reports differ, with Reuters claiming 17 ministers are new, while the Times of London claims 20.

Nasser Yousef has been accepted to take the security forces roughly from behind, and Mohammed Dahlan, currently a security advisor to Abbas, is also in the new line up. Abbas is reported by the CBC as eager to consolidate control in security as part of an effort to clean up corruption and tighten domestic oversight in the occupied territories.

Some of the politicians who will not be a part of the new cabinet include Nabil Shaath, the Foreign Minister, and Saeb Erekat, the Negotiations Minister. 

The cabinet will now be brought to the Legislative Council on Thursday for a vote.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; has been re-admitted to &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGemelli%20Hospital"&gt;Gemelli Hospital&lt;/a&gt; with a relapse of &lt;a href="w%3Ainfluenza"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; which saw him hospitalised earlier this month. 

He was wheeled into Gemelli Hospital on a partially elevated stretcher, and was waving to people as he entered the clinic.

Later, &lt;a href="w%3AVatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls announced that the pope had undergone a &lt;a href="w%3Atracheotomy"&gt;tracheotomy&lt;/a&gt; to assist his breathing.

The Pope's re-admittance again raises questions about how long his papacy will last. One of his close aides refused to rule out the possibility of the Pope retiring saying it was up to his "conscience". The Pope has recently indicated that he has no intention of retiring by saying that the call "to guard his flock" was "particularly alive in him". 

The operation lasted around thirty minutes, and Navarro Valls said to media that it was a success.

&lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; – 
The former Finnish rally driver and current Member of the European Parliament for Grand Sud-Est France, &lt;a href="w%3AAri%20Vatanen"&gt;Ari Vatanen&lt;/a&gt;, harshly criticised Finnish President &lt;a href="w%3ATarja%20Halonen"&gt;Tarja Halonen&lt;/a&gt; and the current Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AErkki%20Tuomioja"&gt;Erkki Tuomioja&lt;/a&gt; for having an anti-American stance and maintaining old-fashioned ideologies about defence strategies that hark back to the 1970s, in an article in the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Wall%20Street%20Journal%20Europe"&gt;Wall Street Journal Europe&lt;/a&gt;. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt; member, born in Finland, said that considering that 94% of the nations in the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organisation"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; members, it does not make sense for Finland to not join.

According to Vatanen, when the MEP first tried publish the piece in the &lt;a href="w%3AHelsingin%20Sanomat"&gt;Helsingin Sanomat&lt;/a&gt;, the newspaper refused to publish it.

Accondingly Helsingin Sanomat, 57% of Finns are against joining NATO, while 23% are in favour.

Helsingin Sanomat is the main newspaper of Finland and the biggest daily subscription-based newspaper in Scandinavia. The paper is independent and non-aligned.

A paste containing synthetic tooth enamel can seal small cavities without drilling. &lt;a href="http%3A//homepage2.nifty.com/nmc/home.html"&gt;Kazue Yamagishi&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues at the FAP Dental Institute in Tokyo say that the paste can repair small cavities in 15 minutes.

Currently, fillers don't stick to such small &lt;a href="w%3Acavities"&gt;cavities&lt;/a&gt; so dentists must drill bigger holes. &lt;a href="w%3Ahydroxyapatite"&gt;Hydroxyapatite&lt;/a&gt; crystals, of which natural enamel is made, bond with teeth to repair tiny areas of damage. 

Yamagishi and colleagues have tested their paste on a lower premolar tooth that showed early signs of decay. They found that the synthetic enamel merged with the natural enamel. The synthetic enamel also appears to make teeth stronger which will improve resistance to future decay. As with drilling, however, there is still the potential for pain: The paste is strongly acidic to encourage crystal growth and causes inflammation if it touches the gums. 

The paste is reported in the journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Anature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Yukos sought Chapter 11 protection, to prevent the forced sale of the subsidiary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYuganskneftegaz"&gt;Yuganskneftegaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by the Russian authorities.

Judge Letitia Clark said that the oil company didn't have a strong enough presence in America to warrant Chapter 11. 

The sale was made to pay Yukos' &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;27.5 billion tax bill, Yuganskneftegaz was originally sold for US$9.4 billion to a little known company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaikalfinansgroup"&gt;Baikalfinansgroup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤(Байкалфинансгруп)♡❤ which was later bought by the Russian state-owned oil company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARosneft"&gt;Rosneft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤(Роснефть)♡❤.

At least eight UN peacekeepers have been killed in an ambush by militiamen in the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;. The attack happened in the morning and it is believed that the Lendus ethnic militia known as FNI are likely to be behind the attack. The peacekeepers are all believed to be from &lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; and are in the &lt;a href="w%3AIturi"&gt;Ituri&lt;/a&gt; area of the Congo along with 4,800 other peacekeepers from several contries including &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMorocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;. 
A UN spokesperson has said ♡❤"There are at least eight dead and some still missing"♡❤ indicating that it is possible that more have been killed or injured. The spokesperson has added that ♡❤"Lendus are not people that take hostages, they just kill."♡❤

The British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the &lt;a href="w%3Aminimum%20wage"&gt;minimum wage&lt;/a&gt; is to go up from GBP 4.85 (EUR 7.03) per hour to GBP 5.05 (EUR 7.32) per hour in October and GBP 5.35 (EUR 7.76) per hour in October 2006. The minimum wage for 18-21 year-olds, the development minimum wage will also go up from GBP 4.10 (EUR 5.94) per hour to GBP 4.25 (EUR 6.16) per hour. The rises was a recommendation by the &lt;a href="w%3ALow%20Pay%20Commission"&gt;Low Pay Commission&lt;/a&gt;, a government organisation responsible in the minimum wage said that the minimum wage has increased the amount of jobs in the market. 

The minimum wage started in the UK in 1998 as one of the election proposal of the Labour government and it started at GBP 3.60 (EUR 5.22) per hour. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ATrade%20Union%20Congress"&gt;Trade Union Congress&lt;/a&gt; said they welcome the rise, however they want the minimum wage to go up to GBP 6.00 (EUR 8.70) per hour. The &lt;a href="w%3AConfederation%20of%20British%20Industry"&gt;Confederation of British Industry&lt;/a&gt; (CBI) called for a "pause year" on the minimum wage to assess the above inflation rises

Political speculators are says the announcement is to coincide with a possible general election in May this year.

Jacksonville, Florida – 
A genetic mutation has been linked with typical, late-onset Parkinson's in a step towards new drugs that target particular forms of the disease.

American and European researchers led by neuroscientists at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mayoclinic.org/jacksonville/"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in Jacksonville, Florida discovered the mutation in a recently identified gene called &lt;a href="http%3A//www.google.ca/search%3Fq%3DLRRK2"&gt;LRRK2&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="http%3A//www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx%3FarticleID%3D2005-01-18-2"&gt;previous studies have already linked to some forms of Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;.

The mutation, dubbed G2019S, is the first, the researchers say, to be associated with typical, late-onset &lt;a href="w%3AParkinsons%20disease"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. 

"From a research point of view, this is the first time we could identify what appears to be typical Parkinson's disease cases before people develop symptoms," says Mayo Clinic neuroscientist &lt;a href="http%3A//mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/staff/farrer_mj.cfm"&gt;Matthew Farrer&lt;/a&gt;. "We know if someone inherits the mutation they are going to get Parkinson's disease."

The mutation was discovered by sequencing the LRRK2 gene in families with Parkinson's from the US, Norway, Ireland and Poland. 

It was found in 22 of 42 family members of people with Parkinson's while it was absent in more than 2,000 healthy controls. 

All people with G2019S mutations shared a genetic pattern indicating a common, ancient ancestor. 

The finding shows that the most common form of Parkinson's disease, which was thought to be sporadic, has a genetic component. 

While it's a small number of cases, says Farrer, the finding should help in the creation of Parkinson's models. 

Farrer and colleagues are also starting to examine the cellular role of the LRRK2 protein and why the mutant gene causes disease. 

"It's an exciting time in the study of the genetics of Parkinson's disease," says Farrer, who notes that there are already clinical trials of drugs called mixed-lineage kinase inhibitors that may be targeted at the form of the disease linked with the mutation. 

The research is reported in the ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/"&gt;American Journal of Human Genetics&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Four are dead and fifty injured after a suicide bomber set off an explosion at a nightclub in central &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt;. The blast was in the queue going into the club, Stage, on the main promenade. The bomber had been stopped from entering the club by security guards just before the explosion. 

At first the militant groups &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Aqsa%20Martyrs%27%20Brigades"&gt;al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; all denied involvement, but according to the BBC the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt; later claimed responsibility for the blast. A spokesman for the group stated that "Israel has not abided by the pacification period. This is the main reason that led to this operation".

&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; released a statement after a meeting with his security chiefs:

The swift condemnation and call for action by the Palestinian leader has caused Israeli officials to declare that the attack, the first since an informal truce began early this month, would not derail the peace process. It was also the first suicide bombing in Israel in almost 4 months, during which pullbacks from occupied territories have been announced, and Palestinian prisoners have been released.

The three &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; soldiers in the centre of an Iraqi abuse scandal have been jailed for between 140 days and two years and all three have been dismissed from the army. L/Cpl Mark Cooley, 25, Cpl Daniel Kenyon, 33, and L/Cpl Darren Larkin, 30, assaulted a number of Iraqi prisoners in &lt;a href="w%3ACamp%20Bread%20Basket"&gt;Camp Bread Basket&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt;. 

Gen Sir Michael Jackson said that he wanted to, "place on record how appalled and disappointed I was when I first saw those photographs at the outset of the trial", and has said he apologised "to those Iraqis who were abused" and to Iraq as whole. 

The men said they felt they were scapegoats as they felt they were other soldiers in the abuse and one of the men's lawyers said there was, "a significant number of other soldiers, including many senior to him, some of whom have been promoted, were involved in the mistreatment of Iraqis that day".

In a separate court martial last year, the soldier who took the photos used as evidence in the trial, Gary Bartlam, admitted taking photographs of the Iraqis simulating sex acts. He was sentenced to 18 months in a youth detention centre and disgracefully discharged from the British Army.

A last gasp effort is underway to prevent the &lt;a href="w%3Adeportation"&gt;deportation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMontserrat"&gt;Montserratian&lt;/a&gt; refugees from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/a&gt;, to the disaster-stricken volcanic island they fled ten years ago.

Representative &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20Owens"&gt;w:Major Owens&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;, NY), of &lt;a href="w%3ABrooklyn"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, is hoping the outpouring of support for victims of the Asian tsunami will save the refugees from returning to an island with an active volcano that is at constant risk of a further catastrophe.

Until last year, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; had allowed the families to stay in the United States under a special designation called “Temporary Protected Status”. But in July, secretary of homeland security, &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Ridge"&gt;Tom Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, withdrew the status—not because it was safe to return to Montserrat, but because the volcano would remain active for decades to come and therefore was no longer a “temporary” danger. On February 27, the city’s estimated 100 Montserratians and their families will be forced to leave or risk deportation. A further 200 families, many of them living in Boston, are also under threat.

Earlier efforts to win a reprieve for the Montserratians were blocked by anti-immigrant forces in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, led by congressman Tom Tancredo, of Colorado, Rep. Owens said. But he added that a new bill, which he introduced at the end of last month, might be more popular in the wake of the Asian disaster.

“We hope that the approaching emergency situation plus the drama of the tsunami will help change some of the attitudes about this,” Rep. Owens said. “And some of the people who opposed this legislation on the basis that they opposed immigration, will see that it is not about immigration but about coming to the relief of people who have been victims of a natural disaster.”

Meanwhile, New York’s tiny Montserratian community must wait and hope. For those not fortunate enough to have married a US citizen or to have found an employer willing to sponsor them, the coming weeks are crucial.

Pearl Ryner, 40, a refugee who works as a medical technician at the King’s County Hospital in Brooklyn, said she refused to get married just so that she can stay in the United States. But she is a single mother with four children and she does not want to uproot her family and start over again.

“I worry. I cry. I am still hoping,” Ms. Ryner said. “What do I do? Where do I begin? How do I pick four kids up and take them away? If I buy a plane ticket, where do I go? These are questions that I do not have an answer for.”

The Department of Homeland Security has suggested that because Montserrat is a &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20overseas%20territory"&gt;British overseas territory&lt;/a&gt;, Montserratians should go to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. But the refugees say they have no relatives or friends they can stay with in the UK, and that they have made homes and started careers and lives in the United States.

If the refugees are deported to Montserrat it will be to a 35 square-mile island, two-thirds of which is buried beneath volcanic rubble and ash. The capital, Plymouth, in the south east of the island has been abandoned, and there is a housing and employment shortage.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASoufriere%20Hills%20volcano"&gt;Soufriere Hills Volcano&lt;/a&gt; erupted in 1995, but the British Foreign Office website warns that the volcano remains active. Heavy rain can cause mudflows, and people suffering from breathing problems risk airborne dust and volcanic ash. The collapse of a lava dome in 2001 spewed clouds of ash that affected Puerto Rico, a self-governing territory of the United States, 200 miles away.

Moreover continued volcanic activity is triggering landslides that have caused two tsunamis in Montserrat during the past ten years. The first, on December 26, 1997, created a wave three meters tall, which rolled northwards along the coast. The second, in July 2003, measured about four meters and traveled to Guadeloupe 30 miles away.

Sherry Coriette, 28, who works for a major retail company in New York, said that she still has not decided what to do. “I have a good job, I pay my bills,” Ms. Coriette said. “Eight years ago I left with nothing and now I am having to face starting all over again.”

Matthew Dunn, chairman of the New York Chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said that as long as there was a potential for danger, the United Sates should offer the people of Montserrat a safe haven.

“I would argue that is what our country is all about: helping and protecting people,” Mr. Dunn said. “But the biggest shame in all of this is that because there is so few of them, they do not have a big enough voice.”

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; is the #1 producer of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aopium"&gt;opium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the world &amp;mdash; responsible for 87% of all illicit opium production &amp;mdash; according to reports from the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Office%20on%20Drugs%20and%20Crime"&gt;Office on Drugs and Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (UNODC), and its opium production has accelerated since the coalition invasion in 2001.

The November 2004 annual reports put out by UNODC show that Afghanistan opium production has been increasing each year since the coalition invasion. The UNODC report for 2004 shows a 64% increase over the previous year in the area of opium production, and a 22% increase in export value for the year(&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 2.8 billion).

"It could be brought under control with a good dose of law enforcement, which at the moment is lacking," Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of UNODC, said in an interview in 2003 when reports showed an increase in hectares under production of 8% over the previous year. "I believe that the war against terrorism, leaving aside addiction, will not be won unless we control the opium economy of Afghanistan."

Doug Wankel, Counter Narcotics Coordinator at the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Embassy in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said the opium industry in Afghanistan is financing terrorism in an interview with USA Today. "It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism. ... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."

Calling the data "disheartening," UNODC reported that Afghanistan now produces three-fourths of the world's opium. The report estimated revenues from growing and trafficking to be half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product.

Analysis of sediments taken from hundreds of metres beneath the &lt;a href="w%3Aocean%20floor"&gt;ocean floor&lt;/a&gt;
has shown them to contain living &lt;a href="w%3Amicroorganism"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt;. According to a study produced
by a team of researchers supported by the International Ocean Drilling
Program, this is the first time that microbes have been found in abundance at such depths.

Scientists have long speculated about how much of the &lt;a href="w%3Abacterium"&gt;bacterial&lt;/a&gt; content of
the sediments is biologically active. Techniques used to stain the bacteria and
identify them could not previously discriminate between live and dead
cells. For this study a new technique that could distinguish between alive
and dead cells was used.

The results were surprising. The sediments, some of which had been
collected from up to 800 metres from beneath the sea floor and
are said to be up to 16 million years old, contained between 10-30% living
bacteria. Scientists estimate that between 60-70% of all bacteria are
living deep beneath the surface, far from any sunlight.

"We didn't have clear evidence that bacteria there were alive until now,"
said ecologist and team member Lev Neretin of the Max Planck Institute for Marine Biology
in Bremen, Germany. According to calculations,
the populations of bacteria multiply at the same rate as their surface
cousins and contribute significantly to the balance of greenhouse gases,
consuming and producing CO2. They also contribute methane via a metabolic
process that does not require oxygen.

"Because they play such a major role in the biochemical processes in the
subsurface, clearly they are driving lots of reactions that produce the
chemical steady state on Earth," said Dr John Parkes, one of the original
co-authors of the paper which appeared in Nature magazine, "possibly we
might not have oil and gas formations without them."

How could these bacteria get so deep beneath the ocean floor? "The only
reasonable way is for them to be buried there," says Bo Thamdrup, a
microbiologist from the University of Southern Denmark, Odense. The
extremes of temperature and pressures tolerated by these bacteria add
weight to the assertion that microbes may flourish in the extreme
conditions of other planets.

"It is well known that bacteria living in deep oceans have special
adaptations to help them survive," says Thamdrup. "I'm sure these bacteria
have special adaptations too." A full genetic analysis may soon reveal
them.

&lt;a href="w%3AWichita%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Wichita&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; – 
Wichita Police today arrested Dennis Rader, who is suspected of being the &lt;a href="w%3ABTK%20killer"&gt;BTK killer&lt;/a&gt;. BTK, an acronym for "Bind, torture, kill," was the name the serial killer gave himself after killing eight people between 1974 and 1986 in that manner. The killer was thought to have disappeared for 25 years before he resurfaced in March of 2004. He was later linked to two unsolved murders, which took place in 1985 and 1991. Police Chief Norman Williams publicly announced the guilt of Mr. Rader prior to any trial preparations when he said to reporters ♡❤"The bottom line, BTK is arrested."♡❤

The commander of the task force investigating the BTK killings, Lt. Ken Landwehr, said Rader had been arrested after being pulled over in a routine traffic stop. Authorities had questioned a ♡❤"person of interest"♡❤ Friday, which led them to a Park City home just outside Wichita and eventually to the identity of BTK.

BTK was notorious not only for his brutal way of killing people, but for taunting police and other investigators with letters throughout his 12-year killing spree. Investigators had run out of leads until police received a letter from BTK in March of last year.

Police have said they charge Rader with eight counts of first-degree murder and two other homicide charges. According to CNN, police were able to use Rader's daughter's &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; to find Rader. DNA of close family members has been used in a few previous cases to identify suspects, through a new technique known as &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ksg.harvard.edu/news/opeds/2004/Lazer_guilt_by_association_new_scientist_102304.htm"&gt;familial searching&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrinceton%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
According to Ryan Walsh, editor of the websites for both the Princeton Journal of Science and American Foreign Policy, internet news service Wikinews was the topic of a report by Federico Baradello in a &lt;a href="w%3APrinceton%20University"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; course on mass media and public policy. The course, offered through the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, studies "the impact of policy on the content, presentation, influence, and technology of a rapidly-evolving 21st century news media," according to the school.

Walsh, currently a junior at Princeton, characterized the report in an to Wikinews user &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3APingswept"&gt;Pingswept&lt;/a&gt; as "great" and added that "everyone in the class seemed to enjoy learning about Wikinews, and Federico was a great speaker."

According to an from Baradello, the report, which took place on Monday, 21 February 2005, provided a "basic overview of its history (evolution), ownership, viewership, and position in the news market." It included a &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DWikinews%3ASubmit_a_story%26amp%3Boldid%3D26668%23Princeton_Student_Discusses_Wikinews_in_Class%7C"&gt;live demonstration&lt;/a&gt; of adding new content to Wikinews. The barebones content provided in the demonstration was developed into this article.

Baradello's report is available on &lt;a href="http%3A//communitas.princeton.edu/blogs/wws309"&gt;the course's blog&lt;/a&gt;. His final course paper on the decentralization of news gathering includes a case study on Wikinews with commentary from Jimmy Wales and will be available in PDF form by late May.

The founder of &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Benenson"&gt;Peter Benenson&lt;/a&gt;, passed away last night after suffering for some time from a serious illness. At age 83, it is forty four years since he founded Amnesty as a result of reading an article about the imprisonment of two students in &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; who had drunk a toast to liberty. 

Amnesty International said they will be holding a public memorial service and there will be private ceremony for family members however there will be no funeral service. Amnesty International's current Secretary-General, Irene Khan, said after his death: ♡❤"Peter Benenson's life was a courageous testament to his visionary commitment to fight injustice around the world."♡❤

The organisation was initially formed in 1960 for ♡❤"a one-year campaign for the release of six prisoners of conscience."♡❤ Today Amnesty has over 1.8m members and campaigns for human rights on a global basis. Mr. Benenson was originally trained as a lawyer before he dedicated his life to the promotion of human rights.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — One of the biggest domestic banks in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20America"&gt;Bank of America&lt;/a&gt;, has admitted to losing computer tapes containing 1.2 million federal employee accounts, including the accounts of several U.S. senators, in a statement by the bank. According to the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;, most of the accounts belong to staff and civilians in the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;. The bank said the tapes were lost in December 2004 as they were being transported to a data back-up centre by a commercial plane.

Currently, the U.S. are looking in to the matter, a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime such as this. All parties concerned are worrying about possible &lt;a href="w%3Aidentity%20theft"&gt;identity theft&lt;/a&gt; as it contained valuable information such as bank account numbers, names and addresses.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABucharest%2C%20Romania"&gt;Bucharest, Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 6.6 million tourists visited &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, marking an 18% increase over 2003, announced the National Authority for Tourism (ANT). This was one of the highest rates of tourism growth in Europe. However, it remains slightly below the number of Romanians who spent their holidays in other countries throughout 2004 - a figure of 6.9 million.

Carmen Moraru, the promotion and marketing director at ANT said that many tourists came as part of holiday packages or tours, organised around the regions of Maramureş, Transylvania, Moldova, the Prahova Valley and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADanube%20Delta"&gt;Danube Delta&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2005, the number of tourist arrivals is set to rise further, mainly due to a Romanian promotion campaign launched across Europe. The country's tourist revival is mainly due to its diversity - it is home to Europe's largest delta, the Black Sea Coast with its resorts, the Carpathian Mountains with their skiing and winter activities, Transylvania with its ecotourism, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aagritourism"&gt;agritourism&lt;/a&gt; and beautiful landscapes, as well as the medieval history of cities like &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASibiu"&gt;Sibiu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASighisoara"&gt;Sighişoara&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The planning board of Cambridge, Massachusetts voted in unanimous approval of &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to build a 410,000 ft² (38 090 m²) science center at 24 Oxford Street, according to the local newspapers, the Harvard Crimson and the Cambridge Chronicle. More than half of the space in the building will be constructed underground.
The Northwest Science Building, as it will be called, will house the laboratories of roughly 30 Harvard science faculty members, as well as a chilled water plant and an electrical substation. The building was designed by Craig Hartman, an architect in the San Francisco office of &lt;a href="w%3ASkidmore%2C%20Owings%20and%20Merrill"&gt;Skidmore, Owings and Merrill&lt;/a&gt;, who also completed Harvard University Master Plan in 2002, according to the firm's website. Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill also designed such notable buildings as &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASears%20Tower"&gt;Sears Tower&lt;/a&gt; and the recently completed international terminal at the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20International%20Airport"&gt;San Francisco airport&lt;/a&gt;.

The vote to approve the plan occurred at the February 15, 2005, meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board at the City Hall Annex, 344 &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Avenue"&gt;Massachusetts Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge. In what the Harvard Crimson called a "departure from the norm," there were no comments from residents at the hearing. The Crimson reported that the Harvard officials at the meeting took this as "a signal that the community was well-informed about the project prior to the presentation." The sign advertising the hearing can be seen at right.
In related news, the Director of Urban Design for Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill's New York office, Vishaan Chakrabarti, will be &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/calendar/details.cgi%3Fpopup%3Dy%26amp%3Bevent_id%3D1005066%26amp%3Bevent_instance_id%3D1005093"&gt;speaking&lt;/a&gt; at the Harvard Graduate School of Design on March 1, 2005.

Ireland got off to a perfect start, despite having to play against the wind; with a drop goal by &lt;a href="w%3ARonan%20O%27Gara"&gt;Ronan O'Gara&lt;/a&gt; putting the homeside 3 points up after just four minutes. But due to some awful defence by the Irish, England too the lead with a try by &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Corry"&gt;Martin Corry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Hodgson"&gt;Charlie Hodgson&lt;/a&gt; had no trouble converting to put England ahead by four points. Ronan O'Gara quickly got another 3 point from a drop goal to bring the score to 7-6 in favour of England. Two minutes later England went behind after a successful Irish penalty. England went ahead again at twenty five minutes with a penalty from Hodgson after a dry spell of fifteen minutes for the visitors. Ireland earn't a hard fought drop goal just after the half hour mark by Ronan O'Gara. 

At half time, Ireland were just marginally ahead at 12-10. Eight minutes into the second half, Ireland missed a chance to go five clear when an O'Gara penalty went wide. Hodgson got his third score with a drop goal at fifty seven minutes to bring England anhead by one point. However their lead was short lived as a &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20O%27Driscoll"&gt;Brian O'Driscoll&lt;/a&gt; try and subsequent conversion by Ronan O'Gara put the Irish ahead 19-13. Despite numerous strong attacks in the last fifteen minutes, England failed beat the Irish defense.
Ronan O'Gara was the ♡❤RBS Man of the Match♡❤

An &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian baby, born with two heads, is recovering after a successful operation to remove the second head in &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.

The ten-month old baby was suffering from a condition known as &lt;a href="w%3ACraniopagus%20parasiticus"&gt;Craniopagus parasiticus&lt;/a&gt;, which is a medical condition where an undeveloped, parasitic &lt;a href="w%3Atwin"&gt;twin&lt;/a&gt; head is attached to the body of a developed twin.

The second head was said to be able to smile and blink, but was not capable of independent life.

Manar Maged underwent a thirteen hour operation to have the head removed. There have only been eight cases of this condition recorded. A baby suffering from it underwent a similar operation in the &lt;a href="w%3ADominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt; in February 2004 but did not survive.

Baby Manar is doing well and shows no signs of paralysis. It is expected that she will remain in intensive care for at least a week.

Nine people were rescued by helicopter from the roof of a blazing skyscraper in Taiwan on Saturday.

The people were dining in the rooftop restaurant when a fire broke out lower in the 25 story Golden Plaza Tower. The fire is said to have started in a disco on the 18th floor at about 4pm local time.

Four people died in the fire, including two employees of the tower. The body of a security officer was found on the 18th floor with another body found nearby. Two more were found in an elevator. Two or three people suffered minor injuries after inhaling smoke.

The building in Taichung, Taiwan's third largest city, houses offices, shops and schools.

Those fleeing the building at ground level had to cover their heads to protect themselves from falling glass and other debris. Fire fighters extinguished the blaze after an hour and a half.

Pope John Paul II made a surprise appearance at the window of his 10th floor hospital suite at Gemelli Hospital in Rome and waved to onlookers, shortly after he missed the weekly Angelus blessing for the first time in his 26-year papacy. It was his first public appearance following his tracheotomy on Thursday.

Archbishop Leonardo Sandri, substitute Secretary of State of the Vatican, performed the weekly Angelus blessing in the Pope's absence. He also read a message written by the Pope. "I ask you to continue to follow me with your prayers," it said.

The pope's appearance was broadcast worldwide on television and was shown on a giant screen in St. Peter's Square.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABucharest%2C%20Romania"&gt;Bucharest, Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The construction of the oil pipeline linking &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConstanta"&gt;Constanţa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATrieste"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; could commence as soon as 2007, claims Eugen Tapu, the Romanian State Secretary in the Economy and Trade Ministry. The exact date will depend on how fast the countries involved in the project can sign the project.

The pipeline will run from Constanţa, Romania's largest port on the Black Sea, through Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia before ending up in Trieste, northern Italy. Tapu named Chevron Texaco, British Petroleum and OMV among the companies interested in the project.

The oil pipeline is expected to cost Romania 1.9 billion &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;.

He rejected rumours that the value added tax, which is applied to most goods and services, will increase due to negotiations with the &lt;a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; and a need to boost government revenue.

After introducing a low flat tax rate of 16% on January 1, 2005, which applies to both personal income and corporate profits, the government has had to fund the tax cuts through alternative means, including increases in other types of taxation, to avoid running a high budget deficit. For example, from April 1, the government will increase &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aexcise"&gt;excises&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as well as a range of other taxes. Despite the increase, Romania continues to have one of the lowest fiscal burdens in Europe due to the new 16% flat tax rate.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABucharest%2C%20Romania"&gt;Bucharest, Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; ports of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConstanta"&gt;Constanţa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMidia"&gt;Midia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMangalia"&gt;Mangalia&lt;/a&gt; were closed on Saturday due to heavy fog. The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADanube-Black%20Sea%20Canal"&gt;Danube-Black Sea Canal&lt;/a&gt; was also caused due to reduced visibility. The canal, which runs for 64 km, is an important part of the European shipping channel that links the North Sea to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.

The port closures left 54 ships in the harbour or stranded at sea, said Alexandru Mezei, the director of shipping navigation at Constanţa Port, the largest port in Romania. However, he claims that the closure was necessary to prevent accidents from occurring, as the fog had reduced visiblity below safe levels.

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agene"&gt;gene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been discovered that turns &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astem%20cell"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; into &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; killers, promising new treatments that boost the body's ability to destroy tumors.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scientists from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKorea%20Research%20Institute%20of%20Bioscience%20and%20Biotechnology"&gt;Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Daejeon say that the gene, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVitamin%20D3%20Upregulated%20Protein%201"&gt;Vitamin D3 Upregulated Protein 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (VDUP1), spurs &lt;a href="w%3Astem%20cells"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; to become &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20killer%20cells"&gt;natural killer cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

These components of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aimmune%20system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can eliminate virus-infected and cancerous cells. Research leader Inpyo Choi says the team observed that VDUP1 plays a decisive role in causing stem cells to become natural killers. 

The discovery was made by examining mice bred to lack the gene. The mice had a dramatic reduction in the number and activity of natural killer cells. 

Besides determining the gene's importance to the immune system, Choi and colleagues have developed technology needed to spur the creation of natural killers from a person's own &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abone%20marrow"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stem cells. 

Choi calls this "the first step toward developing new treatments using our own immune system to fight cancers and other serious diseases."

La Jolla, California, USA – 

A rare antibody has yielded insight into creating an effective AIDS vaccine. 

Scientists at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.scripps.edu/"&gt;The Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; in La Jolla, California and several other institutions say that the neutralizing &lt;a href="w%3Aantibody"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; broadly defuses &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;. 

Neutralizing antibodies are secreted into the bloodstream following exposure to a virus, where they bind to viral particles, prevent them from infecting cells and spur their destruction. Because neutralizing antibodies attack viruses before they enter cells, they could form the basis for effective &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; vaccines if present before exposure to HIV. But while the body makes many antibodies against HIV, they are usually unable to neutralize the virus. Some people, however, do produce effective neutralizing antibodies for HIV. 

Dennis Burton of Scripps and colleagues have now described the structure of one of these, called 4E10. In tests, the antibody neutralized nearly 100 strains of HIV from around the world. 

Isolated about a decade ago from an HIV-infected person by study coauthor Hermann Katinger of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.boku.ac.at/iam/"&gt;Institute for Applied Microbiology of the University of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; in Vienna, Austria, the antibody shows what type of structure can neutralize HIV. 

It appears that 4E10 targets an area on the HIV surface protein GP41 that the virus uses to fuse its membrane to a human cell's membrane during infection. 

Because the antibody's structure shows what this area on HIV's surface looks like, it provides scientists with a template for reverse-engineering components for AIDS vaccines. 

The research is reported in the journal &lt;a href="http%3A//www.immunity.com/"&gt;Immunity&lt;/a&gt;.

The Government has resigned amid a protest by 10,000 people in Martyrs Square. The -backed government lead by Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Karami"&gt;Omar Karami&lt;/a&gt; was under pressure in recent weeks, particularly after former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20al-Hariri"&gt;Rafik al-Hariri&lt;/a&gt; was killed earlier this month.

The protests were demonstrating over Syria's large military presence in Lebanon. Syria has over 14,000 troops in Lebanon.

Announcing his resignation, Karami said, ♡❤"Out of concern that the government does not become an obstacle to the good of the country, I announce the resignation of the government I had the honour to lead."♡❤ In response to the governments decision to resign, opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AWalid%20Jumblat"&gt;Walid Jumblat&lt;/a&gt; said, ♡❤"The people have won."♡❤

The Syrian Government, which backed the government of Mr Karami said that the matter was "an internal affair" for Lebanon.

A suicide car bombing in &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Hilla"&gt;al Hilla&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, has killed 125 people, mostly &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i applicants for police and army waiting for medical exams becoming the worst single event since the initial invasion. At nearly the same time another car bomb exploded in Musayyib, 30km north of Hilla.

The attack occurred about 8:30 a.m. local time Monday, in a crowd of mostly &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a"&gt;Shi'a&lt;/a&gt; recruits applying for positions with the country's security forces, and as citizens were arriving at the nearby outdoor market.

The recruits were waiting for required medical exams at a clinic across from the mayor's home and the market. Shoppers in the market, men, women and children, were among the dead from the blast.

There are conflicting reports regarding the Musayyib explosion, with some reports indicating only the bomber died and others suggesting a police officer also dying from the blast.

Babil province police released a statement regarding the blast, reporting several arrests were made after but not elaborating further.

Attacks by the insurgency forces appear to have increased in deadliness. Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib said Monday at a news conference in Baghdad "the number of casualties is much more than before."

&lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Hilla"&gt;al Hilla&lt;/a&gt; was the scene of a major battle in the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;2003 invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, with several hundred Iraqi forces reported to have been killed in fierce fighting. The city is now included in the Polish military zone under the occupation of Iraq.

&lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20View%2C%20California"&gt;Mountain View, California, USA&lt;/a&gt; – The Mozilla Foundation recently released an update to Mozilla Firefox. According to the developers, Mozilla Firefox 1.0.1 patches 17 security flaws and improves stability. The update is available from &lt;a href="http%3A//www.getfirefox.com"&gt;Getfirefox.com&lt;/a&gt; by clicking 'Download Now' or '&lt;a href="http%3A//www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/all.html"&gt;Other Systems and Languages&lt;/a&gt;'.

Windows users should currently be seeing a small icon on the menu bar of the browser indicating that an Automatic Update to the new version is now available for installation.

Mozilla Firefox 1.0.1 is available at the time of writing in US English, French, Spanish (Latin American), German, Italian, Dutch, Finnish and Polish, among many other languages.

However the updated Windows version has a flaw affecting anyone who previously installed Firefox as a 'zipped' build, rather than using the standard automatic installer method. (Zipped builds are often customized versions designed for increased speed or development work). If version 1.0.1 is installed over a zipped build, users are reporting that the browser crashes when attempting to enter text into the location or search boxes.

Anyone encountering this problem is advised to delete their Mozilla Firefox folder in 'Program Files', then re-install. Their bookmarks, extensions etc will not be affected.

The system will be installed at the hydroelectric power station in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABistrita"&gt;Bistriţa&lt;/a&gt;, and will include 52 sound flood warning stations on the Bistriţa River Valley. They will warn individuals by code signals in case of a flood alert. The system will be tested on in the following two days.

Especially in the Bistriţa region, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aflood"&gt;floods&lt;/a&gt; continue to be quite a frequent problem, even though they are not particularly severe.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABucharest%2C%20Romania"&gt;Bucharest, Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The number of businessmen from the United Kingdom who intend to invest in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; has doubled this year in comparison to 2004, showing that the country is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for British investors.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AQuinton%20Quayle"&gt;Quinton Quayle&lt;/a&gt;, the UK's ambassador in Romania, said at a conference held by the Romanian-British Chamber of Commerce that there are approximately 20 British companies investing in Romania this year, but would not reveal more information.

Brian Davies, president of the British company Sanders Polyfilms, which currently has operations in Romania, claims that investors from the UK come to the country not only for the local market, which is the second-largest in Central and Eastern Europe, but also because Romania could be a great export centre to other markets in the region.

Other factors that make Romania attractive are a low flat tax rate of 16% on personal income and corporate profits, as well as a skilled, English-speaking workforce. 

So far, companies from the United Kingdom have invested $1.2 billion in Romania. Romania's total foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2004 was 4.1 billion &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the UK, other large investors in Romania are Austria, Italy, Germany and France.

Relations between the UK and Romania have been boosted recently as a result of the Romanian president, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;, making a visit to London earlier in the year. During his election campaign last year, Băsescu said that he wanted to create a London-Bucharest-Washington axis, accenting the importance of Romania's relationship with the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Romania's ties to the UK are also important as the UK will hold the EU's rotating presidency from July to December 2005, at a crucial stage of Romania's preparations for EU accession, which is expected to occur in 2007.

&lt;a href="w%3AAylesbury%2C%20England"&gt;Aylesbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; – The &lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal F.C.&lt;/a&gt; midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AJermaine%20Pennant"&gt;Jermaine Pennant&lt;/a&gt;, currently on loan to &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%20City%20F.C."&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt;, has today pleaded guilty to drink-driving, driving while disqualified, and driving without &lt;a href="w%3Aauto%20insurance"&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3AAylesbury"&gt;Aylesbury&lt;/a&gt; magistrates court. Pennant received a sentence of three months imprisonment. Pennant's lawyer, Bary Warbutton, has said that the footballer will appeal against the severity of the sentence.

The incident occurred on January 23 of this year, Pennant was arrested after crashing teammate &lt;a href="w%3AAshley%20Cole"&gt;Ashley Cole's&lt;/a&gt; car into a lamppost. The 22-year-old claimed that he crashed the car after attempting to operate the car's &lt;a href="w%3ASatellite%20navigation"&gt;Satellite navigation&lt;/a&gt; system.

Despite the claim by Warbutton that imprisonment "could completely destroy his career", Birmingham City have said that they will stand by the player, and help to rehabilitate him. Arsenal released a statement saying that the sentence would not impact the player's future with the club; his contract with club expires in the summer, at the same time as his loan-spell with Birmingham ends.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts%2C%20USA"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
An analysis of &lt;a href="w%3Amelatonin"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; studies has upheld the controversial supplement's effectiveness as a sleep aid. 

The analysis, which included 17 peer-reviewed scientific papers, was aimed at determining whether supplements of the hormone can improve sleep among insomniacs, older adults and others. 

"A meta-analysis essentially tells 'yes' or 'no'—that a treatment does or does not have a significant effect," says &lt;a href="http%3A//web.mit.edu/bcs/people/wurtman.shtml"&gt;Richard Wurtman&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;, the study's principal investigator. "When a meta-analysis says 'yes,' there should no longer be any controversy about whether the treatment works." 

Previous studies by Wurtman and colleagues showed that small doses of melatonin, about 0.3 milligrams, are necessary for restful effects. The researchers found, however, that commercially available melatonin pills can contain 10 times the effective amount. 

At that dose, says Wurtman, the hormone's effects end after a few days because melatonin receptors in the brain become unresponsive when exposed to too much of the hormone. 

Such inadvertent overdosing, say the researchers, has contributed to controversy over melatonin's efficacy. 

But the new meta-analysis shows that melatonin does indeed have positive effects on sleep—even though some of the analyzed studies also involved high doses of the hormone. 

The research is reported in the journal ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10870792"&gt;Sleep Medicine Reviews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Researchers from the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUCL%20Great%20Ormond%20Street%20Institute%20of%20Child%20Health"&gt;Institute of Child Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have shown that a chemical in the tea reduces cell death following such incidents, which in turn could fight tissue death and organ failure. 

Led by Anastasis Stephanou, the researchers showed in heart cells that the chemical &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aepigallocatechin-3-gallate"&gt;epigallocatechin-3-gallate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (EGCG) inhibits cell death, apparently by blocking the action of a protein called Star 1. 

This protein is activated in cells after a stressful event and contributes to inducing cell death. 

EGCG also appears to speed recovery of heart cells to spur tissue recovery. 

Stephanou says that while the researchers are "extremely encouraged" by the findings, more research is necessary before people are advised to drink green tea after heart attack or stroke. 

The research is reported in ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20FASEB%20Journal"&gt;The FASEB Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

In a 5-4 decision, the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; ruled today, in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARoper%20v.%20Simmons"&gt;Roper v. Simmons&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, that it is unconstitutional to impose &lt;a href="w%3ACapital%20punishment"&gt;capital punishment&lt;/a&gt; on those who committed crimes while juveniles. Justice &lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Kennedy"&gt;Anthony Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; wrote the majority opinion to overturn the &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20penalty"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt; for juveniles, which was also supported by Justices &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;John Paul Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Souter"&gt;David Souter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Bader%20Ginsburg"&gt;Ruth Bader Ginsburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Breyer"&gt;Stephen Breyer&lt;/a&gt;. Dissenting were Justices &lt;a href="w%3AAntonin%20Scalia"&gt;Antonin Scalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Rehnquist"&gt;William Rehnquist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20Thomas"&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, with Justice &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; providing a separate dissent.

Christopher Simmons received the death sentence for brutally kidnapping and murdering Shirley Crook as part of a burglary. The case worked its way up the court system, with the courts continuing to uphold the death sentence. However, in light of a 2003 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAtkins%20v.%20Virginia"&gt;Atkins v. Virginia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, that overturned the death penalty for the &lt;a href="w%3Amental%20retardation"&gt;mentally retarded&lt;/a&gt;, the Missouri Supreme Court reconsidered Mr. Simmon's case. It concluded that "a national consensus has developed against the execution of juvenile offenders" and sentenced Mr. Simmons to life imprisonment without parole.

The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, where it was argued on October 13, 2004. The constitutionality of capital punishment for juveniles was put into question, citing the &lt;a href="w%3AEighth%20Amendment"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; that protects individuals from cruel and unusual punishment. 

Previously, a 1988 Supreme Court decision ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThompson%20v.%20Oklahoma"&gt;Thompson v. Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ barred execution of offenders under the age of 16. In 1989 ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20v.%20Kentucky"&gt;Stanford v. Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ brought into question the constitutionality of execution for those under age 18. At the time the Supreme Court upheld the possibility of capital punishment for offenders who are 16 or 17 years old when they committed the capital offense. The same day in 1989 the Supreme Court ruled it was permissible to execute the mentally retarded in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APenry%20v.%20Lynaugh"&gt;Penry v. Lynaugh&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. However, in 2003, the decision was reconsidered in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAtkins%20v.%20Virginia"&gt;Atkins v. Virginia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ citing that decency standards had evolved and execution of the mentally retarded was now considered to be cruel and unusual punishment and thus unconstitutional. 

♡❤Roper v. Simmons♡❤ brought the age issue to the table again. In question is whether it is Constitutionally permissible to execute an offender who committed a capital crime while under the age of 18. As in the issue of executing the mentally retarded, the Supreme Court has now decided that society’s standards have evolved since the 1989 case and that it is indeed cruel and unusual punishment to execute a juvenile, under age 18.

Supporting this ‘’evolving standard’’, is the body of scientific and sociological research that finds juveniles have a lack of maturity and sense of responsibility, compared to adults. Adolescents are overrepresented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior. In recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every State prohibits those under age 18 from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent. Juveniles are also more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. They have less control, or experience with control, over their own environment. They also lack the freedom that adults have, in escaping a &lt;a href="w%3ACriminogenic"&gt;criminogenic&lt;/a&gt; setting. 

Another key basis to support the “national consensus” on the death penalty for juveniles, is the increasing infrequency that it is applied at the state level. While 20 states have the juvenile death penalty on the books, only six states have executed prisoners for crimes committed as juveniles, since 1989. And, just three states have done so in the past 10 years: &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, five of the states that allowed the juvenile death penalty at the time of the 1989 case have since abolished it. Thus, the execution of juveniles is indeed becoming increasingly unusual in the United States and a “national consensus” has developed.

In evaluating whether penalties violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, the Supreme Court has taken guidance from the law of foreign countries and international bodies. Since 1990, only seven other countries – &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; – have executed juveniles. Since then, however, each of those seven countries has either abolished the death penalty for juveniles or made public disavowal of the practice. Now, one finds the stark reality that the United States stand alone, as the only country in the world that continues to allow execution of juveniles. Furthermore, only the United States and &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt; have yet to ratify Article 37 of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Convention on the Rights of the Child (September 2, 1990), expressly prohibits capital punishment for crimes committed by juveniles. 

In drawing the line at 18 years of age for death eligibility, the Supreme Court considered that is also where society draws the line between childhood and adulthood for a multitude of other purposes. 

Both the Scalia dissent, joined by Rehnquist and Thomas, and Justice O’Connor’s separate dissent put into question whether a “national consensus” had indeed formed among the state laws. In addition, Scalia also objects to taking guidance from foreighn law in interpreting the Constitution.

Implications of this ruling, are particularly felt in the State of Virginia, where it is now most certain that &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Boyd%20Malvo"&gt;Lee Boyd Malvo&lt;/a&gt; will not face the death penalty. He is responsible in-part, along with &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Allen%20Muhammad"&gt;John Allen Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;, for the &lt;a href="w%3ABeltway%20Sniper"&gt;DC Sniper&lt;/a&gt; Attacks that terrorized the Washington DC area in October 2002. He had already been spared the death penalty in his first trial, for the murder of FBI employee, Linda Franklin, outside a Home Depot store in Falls Church, Virginia. However, Mr. Malvo is also set to face trial in Prince William County, Virginia for another murder, and yet to face trial in &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere for other killings. In light of today's Supreme Court decision, the prosecutors in Prince William County may not pursue the charges against Mr. Malvo, after all. The primary reason for extraditing these two suspects from &lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, where they were arrested, to Virginia, was in fact the differences in how the two states deal with the death penalty. While the death penalty is allowed in Maryland, it is only applied to adults, whereas Virginia had also allowed the death penalty for juvenile offenders.

&lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89lan"&gt;Élan&lt;/a&gt;, the largest &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; pharmaceutical company, and its partner &lt;a href="w%3ABiogen"&gt;Biogen&lt;/a&gt; have withdrawn the multiple sclerosis drug ♡❤Tysabri♡❤ from clinical trials after the death of a patient. The drug was seen by many as a possible blockbuster drug with the potential to alleviate much of the suffering of the millions of &lt;a href="w%3Amultiple%20sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; suffers worldwide. However it is now quite unlikely that it will ever make it to market.

The news has seen the shares of both companies fall steeply, with Élan having lost almost 70% of its value after Monday's announcement. Two years ago Élan was the largest Irish PLC, with a value in excess of $20bn, but an accountancy scandal saw its shares fall from over €73 to €1.50 within a few weeks. Since then the stock had risen back to trade between €16 and €18 a share on the back of good restructuring news. However the withdrawal of ♡❤Tysabri♡❤ leaves Elan with almost no potential future revenue streams.

Biogen shares which had hit a 52 week high of $70 just two weeks before the announcement have since fallen to just $41.26. Combined equity losses on Monday for the two firms was over $17.8 billion.

The paitent who died had been taken in combination with another drug - ♡❤Avonex♡❤ - for the last two years. If it emerges that the death was as a result of taking ♡❤Avonex♡❤, then it is possible ♡❤Tysabri♡❤ could be re-introduced to the market. However for the moment rivals will be seeking to steal a lead in the potentially lucrative MS drug market.

<h1>Britain unveils flu pandemic preparedness plan, buys 14m courses of treatment drug</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Britain%20unveils%20flu%20pandemic%20preparedness%20plan%2C%20buys%2014m%20courses%20of%20treatment%20drug&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The government of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has unveiled their strategy to deal with any future &lt;a href="w%3Ainfluenza"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in their Pandemic Influenza Contingency Plan.

The document, based on the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s framework for responses, explains how the UK would respond to a major outbreak of flu. 

Any flu pandemic would differ from the seasonal outbreaks of flu observed worldwide every year. While seasonal flu kills 12,000 Britons annually, a pandemic would affect far more people and could result in the deaths of up to 50,000 people in the UK if there were no medical intervention.

The government will have the power to cancel events where large numbers of people gather, such as football (soccer) matches. It could also advise travel restrictions to and from areas of high infection, but would not be able to enforce any such measures.

Schools might be closed in the event of a flu pandemic, and infected people would be asked to remain at home, although again no &lt;a href="w%3Aquarantine"&gt;quarantine&lt;/a&gt; measures could be imposed by the government.

Further plans include education of the public to recognize symptoms of the flu and how to avoid infection.

Measures will be made to maintain basic services in the event of a pandemic despite staff absences through illness.

A major cornerstone of the plan is the prescription of oseltamivir, an oral neuraminidase inhibitor drug that combats influenza. The drug is currently marketed by Hoffman La Roche under the trade name Tamiflu®. 

The UK Department of Health intends to stockpile 14.6m courses of the drug over the next two financial years, giving enough to treat one in four of the population - the ratio recommended by the WHO. 

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have also bought the equivalent amounts of anti-viral drugs. The U.S. has also bought large amounts of similar drugs.

The total cost of the acquisition was not published by the government, but the BBC estimated the cost to be £180 million.

Unlike a vaccine, oseltamivir can be used to treat any strain of the influenza virus. Many new variants of the influenza virus are seen every year, and combined with the long lead times associated with the development of vaccinces, mass vaccination is frequently impractical.

Some parts of the newly-revealed plan already exist. The UK government recently gave £500,000 to the WHO for survellience of so-called 'bird flu' in South East Asia, a possible source for any future pandemic. The Department of Health will also continue to monitor flu-like cases seen by doctors and hospitals.

<h2>Background on Influenza, from &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

Influenza is an extremely variable disease; similar viruses are found in pigs and domestic fowl. In areas where there are high concentrations of humans, pigs and birds in close proximity, such as parts of Asia, simultaneous infections across species enable genetic material to be exchanged between the various strains of flu. This appears to be the principal method by which new infectious strains arise. 

It is believed that sooner or later, a recombination may occur to produce a strain as lethal as the 1918 virus. In late 1997, a new strain of avian influenza (also known as bird flu) originating from chickens infected 18 people in Hong Kong, of whom 6 died. This strain did not appear to be readily transmissible from human to human, but such a high mortality rate, and the possibility of a further recombination to make it more infectious, meant that the risk was considered so great that all domestic poultry in Hong Kong was slaughtered. Avian influenza transmissible to humans resurfaced in January 2004 in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand.

There were several serious outbreaks of influenza in the 20th century. The most famous (and the most lethal) was the Spanish Flu pandemic (type A influenza, H1N1 strain), which lasted from 1918 to 1919 and is believed to have killed more people in total than World War I. Lesser flu pandemics included the 1957 Asian Flu (type A, H2N2 strain) and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu (type A, H3N2 strain).

Although there were scares in New Jersey in 1976 (the Swine Flu), worldwide in 1977 (the Russian Flu), and in Hong Kong in 1997 (Avian influenza), there have been no major pandemics subsequent to the 1968 infection. Increased immunity from antibodies and the development of flu vaccines have limited the spread of the virus and so far prevented any further pandemics.

&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20supremacy"&gt;White supremacist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust%20denial"&gt;Holocaust denier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AErnst%20Z%C3%BCndel"&gt;Ernst Zündel&lt;/a&gt; was expelled from &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and arrived in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; today. A Federal Court judge ruled that his &lt;a href="w%3Aanti-Semitism"&gt;anti-Semitic&lt;/a&gt; activities were "not only a threat to Canada's national security, but also a threat to the international community of nations."

In a press release given by &lt;a href="w%3AB%27nai%20Brith"&gt;B'nai Brith&lt;/a&gt; Canada, executive vice president Frank Dimant said that "For decades Zundel has spewed his venom and imbued his brand of hate in a new generation of white supremacist groups that had made him a hero ... Zundel's day of reckoning has finally come." Canadian Jewish Congress National President Ed Morgan was quoted as saying that “this is a significant day for the &lt;a href="w%3AJewish"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; community (of Canada) and for all those who treasure tolerance in a multicultural society ... Zundel’s departure demonstrates Canada’s abhorrence for those who would propagate Holocaust denial and antisemitism. It brings closure to our efforts to bring this man to justice." 

Zündel's &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; lawyer, Peter Lindsay, said Zündel is "very disillusioned about the process and about being the victim of a secret trial, and now being deported based on evidence he's never seen."

Upon arriving in Germany, Zündel, 65, was immediately taken into custody by authorities on the grounds that he was running a web site denying the existence of the &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;, which is a crime in that country. Prosecutors in the city of Mannheim have issued a warrant for his arrest according to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. A spokeswoman for the federal Justice Ministry, on condition of anonymity, said authorities were able to open a case against Zundel because his Holocaust-denying site can be accessed in Germany.

In 1977, Zündel founded a small press publishing house called &lt;a href="w%3ASamisdat%20Publishers"&gt;Samisdat Publishers&lt;/a&gt; which issued such pamphlets as ♡❤The Hitler We Loved♡❤ and ♡❤Why and Did Six Million Really Die?♡❤ by &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Harwood"&gt;Richard Harwood&lt;/a&gt; aka Richard Verrall (a British neo-Nazi leader) as well as booklets claiming that &lt;a href="w%3AUFO"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt;s were actually Nazi secret weapons operated from secret Nazi military bases in &lt;a href="w%3AAntarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;. Zundel lived in Canada for 42 years as a landed immigrant. His last two years were spent in a Toronto jail, where he was held under the Canadian security certificate law. The law was passed after the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, and allows the Canadian government to hold suspects of terrorism without charge, based on secret evidence that does not have to be disclosed to a suspect or his defense.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABucharest%2C%20Romania"&gt;Bucharest, Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The city centre of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, is set to get a major facelift due to a real estate project called ♡❤Esplanada♡❤ (The Esplanade), which will be constructed by TriGranit Development Corporation. The total investment in the project will be greater than 800 million &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; and aims to build a modern commercial pedestrian area in downtown Bucharest, with several shopping malls, office buildings, hotels and dwellings. It will be the largest real estate program in Romania since the fall of Communism in 1989.

Bucharest is currently looking at possibilities to improve its appearance and rebrand itself as a lively, creative and vibrant city. Many initiatives have sprung up to improve the city, including the organisation of CowParade later this year. Additionally, the old town centre will be restored. Due to Romania's current economic boom, several other major construction projects are taking place.

Bucharest City Hall has blocked traffic in the city center due both to the old town restoration and to the ♡❤Esplanada♡❤ project.

On Monday, February 28, 2005, &lt;a href="w%3AJambo%20OpenOffice"&gt;Jambo OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href="w%3ASwahili"&gt;Swahili&lt;/a&gt; office suite, was released at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. The office suite was translated from the English version of &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt;, an open source suite based on &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;' StarOffice. Jambo OpenOffice.org was translated by a multinational team including Swedish and Spanish programmers, as well as linguists from the University of Dar es Salaam. Monday's release included builds for Linux and Windows.

The office suite has four components: a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation creator, and a drawing program. The translation effort required translating 18,000 English strings, made up of one or more words, many of which have previously had no direct Swahili equivalent. As part of the translation, the team developed a glossary of 1500 technical words in Swahili. The office suite also includes a spellchecker with a lexicon of 70,000 words.

Swahili is not the only African language into which OpenOffice is being translated. According to Ethan Zuckerman, a fellow at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABerkman%20Center%20for%20Internet%20and%20Society"&gt;Berkman Center for Internet and Society&lt;/a&gt;, OpenOffice is being translated into nine official languages of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; by Translate.org.za. The same organization is also supporting translation efforts to bring the software into the Rwandan language &lt;a href="w%3AKinyarwanda"&gt;Kinyarwanda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AHausa"&gt;Hausa&lt;/a&gt;, a language spoken largely in &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;.

Swahili is spoken by approximately 55 million people worldwide, predominantly in East African countries, including &lt;a href="w%3ATanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡Interview with the project coordinator♡❤♡

♡❤Replies to questions from by Alberto Escudero-Pascual, March 3, 2005♡❤

The suite contains more than 99% of the strings in Swahili. The ones
that are left in English (less than 100 strings out of 18,000) will
be worked out in the next release. Yes, this release is fully functional
in Swahili.

No alternatives. This is the first ever release of a word processor in Swahili.

I "expect" the software to get installed in all the primary schools of
the country. I also expect the software to be installed in the main
universities of the country and colleges. We have postive feedback
from them but this is a rather "political" decision out of my (our)
control.

The secondary schools have compulsory English so they might not want
to install it.

East Africa, ufff that is like asking what IT infrastructure is in the
whole Europe :-D
If you mean connectivity, all is satellite VSAT upstreams. Most of
the local loops in Dar are based on &lt;a href="w%3AIEEE%20802.11"&gt;IEEE 802.11b&lt;/a&gt;. It is expensive for
most of the locals. But there is &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tix.or.tz/"&gt;an Internet Exchange already in Dar es Salaam&lt;/a&gt;
where the ISP peer together. Things will always get
better. The software is placed in the IX.

The software will spread slowly, but I am sure that will spread.

The Tanzanian team will start translating OOo training documentation,
and next they will work with Firefox. A Linux desktop might come next
year.
I have no idea what will it take to translate Knoppix, but the
priorities should be in getting first a couple of good tools as
OpenOffice and Firefox and do loads and loads of training material in
Swahili.

I have developed an almost automatic version to update JambOOo 1.1.3 in
Kiswahili. The UDSM has access to one of the build servers. I expect a
new release of JambOO, maybe 1.1.4 with all the bug corrections in six
months. The next step is to migrate to OOo 2.0, I have no clear
picture of how that will happen.

Nope, the Win32 version was developed entirely in Sweden and Spain during
Christmas 2004 . The new build system does not require Visual Studio
to "update" the Swahili strings.

SIDA (Swedish International Cooperation Agency) has funded the
University of Dar es Salaam and the Institute of Kiswahili Research
for one full year. My company IT+46 also was funded by SIDA to support
the project technically.

IT+46 has contributed 50% of its working-time at no cost to the project.

Our plan was to be in Tanzania only six months and handle all the
technology and the training back to the university as we want them to
keep on with the development by themselves. Now, we are trying to find
similar projects that need support. There are many languages out there
after all.

Senior &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; officials said Tuesday that U.S. president &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has not returned a telephone call &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; made to him last week, due to the Canadian government's decision to not participate in the U.S. missile defence initiative.

The Prime Minister was hoping explain Canada's reasons for saying no.

Although the White House has formally stated it's "disappointment" on the decision, it also stated that Bush would likely talk with Martin on the issue when the two meet with Mexican President Vicente Fox on March 23 to discuss the future of &lt;a href="w%3ANAFTA"&gt;NAFTA&lt;/a&gt;, the North American free trade agreement.

A Martin spokesperson told the ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤ that "the decision to not participate (in ballistic missile defence) ... was Canada's alone to take ... The Bush administration, while disappointed in the decision, recognizes that fact and is not seeking apologies." The CanWest News Service reported that another Martin spokesperson, Melanie Gruer, played down the reports by saying that "The President has been travelling," and that Prime-minister Martin's aides acknowledge the pressures on busy leaders' schedules. 

U.S. officials had mentioned that Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice's&lt;/a&gt; decision to postpone a visit to &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; was in response to the non-participation decision. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Pettigrew"&gt;Pierre Pettigrew&lt;/a&gt; spoke twice to Ms. Rice, finally ensuring that she will come to Canada as planned, despite concerns it was cancelled over the disagreement.

Martin, orgininally backed the missile defence initiative and committed to closer co-operation with Washington when he came to office in 2004. This position was reversed last week

The green paper of the future of the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; has asked for the Board of Governors to be scrapped and replaced by two boards, one representing the public and an executive board. The proposals were announced by the British Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell in the House of Commons. 

Other things she has asked for is the &lt;a href="w%3ATelevision%20licence"&gt;licence fee&lt;/a&gt; be kept, currently at GBP 121 (EUR 176.26) per householder, more independent television to be made on the BBC, currently 10% must be made by independent television companies &amp; to stop chasing ratings, mainly by copycating programmes from other channels. 

She said that the board of governors was “unsustainable” and lacked “clarity and accountability”. Shadow Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said that the green paper did “not go far enough” countining saying that they were “largely cosmetic changes to the structure and oversight of the BBC”. 

The green paper was made as the Charter that is the basis of the BBC is to reviewed in 2007 as required by law.

A compromise put forward by the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; that would have allowed easier passage through the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Commons&lt;/a&gt; of the proposed new anti-terror legislation has been rejected by &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;. The bill proposes new "control orders" for terror suspects which include house arrest, curfews, tagging and bans on internet and phone use. The bill will replace current powers that allow the detention of foreign terror suspects without trial which has been ruled against as a breach of human rights by the law lords.

The Conservatives wanted a "&lt;a href="w%3Asunset%20clause"&gt;sunset clause&lt;/a&gt;" inserted into the bill which would have allowed ministers to revisit it in November. &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MPs&lt;/a&gt; from all parties have severely criticised the way the bill has been seemingly "steamrollered" through the Commons with only two days to debate the plans before a vote is called.

Conservative leader &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Howard"&gt;Michael Howard&lt;/a&gt; said in the Commons that it would be "far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through."

Mr. Blair said that the new house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable. "I believe they are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk," he added.

Opposition to the bill by the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; have already won concessions this week. &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Home%20Department"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Clarke"&gt;Charles Clarke&lt;/a&gt; has backed down and allowed judges to have the first say in the most severe control order cases, however, this may not be enough to ensure a smooth ride through the Lords. It is expected that the bill will face tough opposition and demands for a radical re-draft.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Oaten"&gt;Mark Oaten&lt;/a&gt; has urged the Conservatives to "stick firm? There's a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months," he said.

A spokeswoman for &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; said that it was a "basic principle" that people should only be punished after a fair trial. "Having a judge impose those punishments does not sanitise them either," she added.

Steve Fossett, piloting the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, has set the record of being the first person to fly around the world unrefueled, solo. He is also got the record for longest unrefueled flight of a jet aircraft.

Steve departed from Salina &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; 18:47 CST on Monday and has successfully crossed the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Northern &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and Southern and Central &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAsia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He then crossed the Pacific moving from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , then went on to Southern &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . From there her crossed the Southwest &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and landed back in Salina Kansas at 13:50 CST on Thursday. 

One major problem has been encountered during this trip. Somewhere in the first several hours of the flight 2600 pounds of fuel was lost. The engineers have two theories on what caused this loss. One is an extreme case of the fuel evaporation. It was expected to evaporate, but not at anything approaching this rate. The other possibility is that there was a leak or other type of error in the plumbing. Because the aircraft had never been flown fully fueled before, there was no previous data on what could be causing this.

Steve Fossett is already in the record books for being the first to pilot a balloon around the world. He has also been unsuccessfully attempting to achieve a record altitude for a glider for the last four years.

The aircraft was built for Sir Richard Branson and his Virgin Atlantic Airways. It was constructed by Burt Rutan. Burt also designed the Voyager airplane which was piloted by his brother Dick Rutan and Jenna Yeager on the first unrefueled flight around the world. Burt is also the designer of Space Ship One, the first private craft to enter space.

Margaret Wilson was appointed as Speaker of The House of Representatives. She becomes New Zealand's first female Speaker of the House. She also rounds out the top positions within New Zealand being taken by women. All four of Governor-General, Prime Minister, Chief Justice and the Speaker of the House are female.

Wilson was voted in with 64 votes. Clem Simich (National MP) received 37 and ACT MP Ken Shirley got five votes. The position has usually been appointed unopposed, but the other two candidates stood to protest at the lack of consultation by Prime Minister &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;.
Wilson takes over from Jonathan Hunt, who leaves to become the High Commissioner for New Zealand in London. Hunt will remain in the backbenches until early next month. Wilson was previously Attorney-General, a position that Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Michael Cullen now holds.

The state owned &lt;a href="w%3ATelephone"&gt;telephone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Amonopoly"&gt;monopoly&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Costa%20Rica"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;, the ♡❤Costa Rica Electricity Institute♡❤, (ICE) has called for &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; to be made a criminal offence. In Costa Rica it has been illegal for anyone other than ICE to offer telephone services. With a reputation for preventing any rivals from challenging its monopoly, but also for providing an efficient service, ICE has recently seen its monopoly dented with as many as 20% of calls being routed through &lt;a href="Skype"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; and other VoIP service providers. 

On the other hand those who seek to promote the &lt;a href="w%3ASoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; industry in Costa Rica, which already has a dominant 78% share of the market in &lt;a href="Central%20America"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Caribbean"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;, have reacted by saying the proposal would be disastrous both to software development and the country's ability to &lt;a href="w%3AOutsourcing"&gt;outsource&lt;/a&gt; work. The ICE claims that its telephone structure is being used by VoIP service providers, which is almost certainly true given that Skype offers calls from the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; to phones in Costa Rica for 8 US$ cents per minute.

Ex-Ontario premier &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Harris"&gt;Mike Harris&lt;/a&gt; has allegedly made some comments that may link him to the violence that happened in a police action in 1995 which left a native activist killed.

&lt;a href="w%3AKettle%20Point"&gt;Kettle Point&lt;/a&gt; chief &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Bressette"&gt;Tom Bressette&lt;/a&gt; testified on Tuesday that he was warned just 12 hours before &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;OPP&lt;/a&gt; officers marched on &lt;a href="w%3AIpperwash%20Provincial%20Park"&gt;Ipperwash Provincial Park&lt;/a&gt; and killed native protestor &lt;a href="w%3ADudley%20George"&gt;Dudley George&lt;/a&gt; to "get those fucking Indians out of the park even if you have to draw your guns to do it". The warning was allegedly on the telephone by &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Watts"&gt;Bob Watts&lt;/a&gt;, a former employee of the Ontario Native Affairs Secretariat, on Sept. 6, 1995, just hours before OPP officers marched on &lt;a href="w%3AIpperwash%20Provincial%20Park"&gt;Ipperwash Provincial Park&lt;/a&gt;.

Bressette claims that Watts told him Harris, who was premier of Ontario at the time, had made the comment in "some kind of cabinet meeting". Harris has always denied that he had nothing to do with the police action at the park. Peter Downard, his lawyer, says that his client will "absolutely" deny the allegations. and that his reputation has been tarnished with "very low-grade quality information that ordinarily would never have seen the light of day in a legal proceeding."

The inquiry is finding out how George was killed during a confrontation between Ontario Provincial Police officers and three dozen people protesting that ancestral burial grounds had been desecrated in Ipperwash Provincial Park. Acting Sgt. &lt;a href="w%3AKenneth%20Deane"&gt;Kenneth Deane&lt;/a&gt; has already been convicted of criminal negligence causing George's death. The inquiry continues today.

&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Fossett"&gt;Steven Fossett&lt;/a&gt; (60) landed safely back on soil earlier this evening to claim the world record for flying non-stop by himself around the world. He landed at 7.49 pm UTC in Kansas after what had been a nerve racking last few hours.

Having left with over 18,100 pounds of fuel on board the futuristic single seater ♡❤GlobalFlyer♡❤, it emerged that 2,600 pounds of fuel had "disappeared". This meant that had the winds gone against Fossett, he would have run out of fuel before the finish line. Luckily however, he was able to conserve fuel due to strong tail winds throughout the last few thousand miles of the journey.

Yuri Kravchenko, a former Interior Minister in &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, has been found dead in his home just hours before questioning for the case of murdered journalist Georgiy Gongadze. Early reports indicate that he committed suicide, but the circumstances of his death will most likely result in further investigation by the authorities.

Yuri Kravchenko was the Ukraine's Interior Minister in 2000 when Mr. Gongadze was murdered. Mr. Gongadze's headless body was buried in the woods near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKiev"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but his head was never found. Nobody has yet been arrested for the murder, but it was believed that Mr. Kravchenko's evidence could have led to an arrest.

Simply massaging low birth weight babies with &lt;a href="w%3Asunflower%20seed"&gt;sunflower seed&lt;/a&gt; oil can protect them from potentially fatal infections.

Infections and complications from preterm birth cause more than half of all neonatal deaths, and very low birth weight babies are particularly vulnerable. 

Preterm babies have immature skin that lacks a protective film called &lt;a href="w%3Avernix"&gt;vernix&lt;/a&gt; that has antimicrobial properties. 

In some countries, such as India, newborns are routinely massaged with &lt;a href="w%3Amustard%20oil"&gt;mustard oil&lt;/a&gt;. 

But mustard oil, says Gary Darmstadt of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.jhu.edu/"&gt;John Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt; in Baltimore, Maryland, can delay recovery of the skin barrier and have a toxic effect on skin. 

Seeking an alternative low-cost product, Darmstadt and colleagues experimented with sunflower oil and an ointment called &lt;a href="http%3A//www.eucerinus.com/"&gt;Aquaphor&lt;/a&gt; that comprises petrolatum, mineral oil, mineral wax and lanolin.

The researchers tested the treatments on 497 newborns (72 hours old or less) and preterm babies (less than 33 weeks gestation) between 1998 and 2003 in Bangladesh.

They applied the treatments to the entire body besides the scalp and face three times daily for the first 14 days and then twice daily until discharge. 

Babies treated with sunflower oil were found 41% less likely to develop infections than controls.

"Evidence is emerging that the skin is much more important as a barrier to infection than previously recognized, particularly in preterm infants whose skin is underdeveloped," says Darmstadt. "The good news is that treatment is available to strengthen the function of the skin as a barrier in these vulnerable newborns."

Giuliana Sgrena was freed from captivity in Iraq today. The &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; journalist was abducted in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; exactly a month ago while she had been reporting for Il Manifesto.

The Islamic Jihad Organisation had taken her hostage on the 4th February with the demand that Italy withdraw all of its troops from Iraq. On February 16, a video was released with a clearly distraught Mrs Sgrena begging for Italy to withdraw from &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. However despite the video, the &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Senate"&gt;Italian Senate&lt;/a&gt; voted to extend its miltary forces' stay in Iraq.

The reason for her release is unknown. Some Italian journalists have suggested that the Italian government paid a ransom.

Later on Friday, Sgrena's newspaper reported that U.S. forces fired at a car carrying the reporter shortly after her liberation, killing an Italian secret service agent. The editor of Il Manifesto newspaper, Gabriele Polo, was reported by Reuters as saying that Sgrena's car was fired on as it made its way to Baghdad airport. "This news which should have be a moment of celebration, has been ruined," Polo told Sky Italia television. 

"An Italian agent has been killed by an American bullet. A tragic demonstration which we never wanted that everything that's happening in Iraq is completely senseless and mad," he added.

&lt;a href="Bill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the software giant &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, has been made a ♡❤Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire♡❤ in recognition of his business skills and work on poverty reduction. He received the title on Wednesday, March 2, at a private meeting with Queen Elizabeth.

Now at age 48, Bill Gates is the world's wealthiest man, according to Forbes Magazine. Bill Gates rose to fame in the early nineties as the CEO of Microsoft, the maker of &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows%2095"&gt;Microsoft Windows 95&lt;/a&gt;, the world's best selling &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;computer operating system&lt;/a&gt; at the time.

Though Mr. Gates has now been knighted, he cannot use the term ♡❤Sir♡❤ since he is not a citizen of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. He can instead place the letters &lt;a href="w%3AKBE"&gt;KBE&lt;/a&gt; after his name. If he chooses to become a subject of the Queen in the future, he can have his title upgraded to ♡❤Sir♡❤.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Public%20Library"&gt;New York Public Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; launched a new website that offers over 275,000 historic images culled from the library's collections. The images have been digitized by the library's Digital Imaging Unit with assistance from outside contractors, according to a press release issued by the library.

Most of the images are over 100 years old, and many have entered the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20domain"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Despite the public domain status of the images, the library will be charging for reproduction rights for the images. The images are freely downloadable for "personal use." The library's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3AFAQ"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; notes that, "This use is solely for one’s private study or display, and the image(s) are not to be disseminated."

In an email to a , Tom Lisanti, the library's Manager of Photographic Services &amp; Permissions noted that, "The usage fee is not a copyright fee. You are free to obtain a copy of these images from a source other than NYPL. Usage fees help ensure that the Library is able to continue to acquire, preserve and provide access to the accumulated knowledge of the world."

The issue of whether the library is creating a new work with a new copyright when it scans in the public domain images has not been resolved, according to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20Law%20School"&gt;Stanford Law School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; professor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Lessig"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In an email to the same , Lessig writes, "This hangs on a tough, unresolved question: whether the digitization produces a 'thin' copyright around the public domain work. That copyright would not forbid you from extracting the public domain component, though how you would do that is hard to see (and hence this is a hard question)."

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Children%27s%20Fund"&gt;United Nation's Children Fund&lt;/a&gt; (UNICEF) have released figures showing that world-wide, deaths from the disease &lt;a href="w%3Ameasles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; have dropped by 40% over the last five years.

In 1999, 873,000 people died from disease, while that number fell to 530,000 in 2003 - a drop of 39%. The largest drop was seen in Africa - 46%.

Just ten years ago a million children a year died from the disease and another 30 million were affected, often being left with long-term disabilities such as brain damage and blindness.

WHO/UNICEF started a drive to cut measles deaths in 1999, with the aim of halving deaths by the end of 2005. Governments around the world began implementing their proposals.

The main aim was to achieve the &lt;a href="w%3Avaccination"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt; of at least 90% of all children born (around 130 million a year). A second aim was to ensure that all children between nine months and 14 years old receive a second chance for immunization, either through routine health care or special initiatives. The special initiaves have proved especially effective, vaccinating 350 million children from 1999 to 2003.

An indirect benefit of the drop in measles cases has been the releasing of money previously used for measles treatment for other health care projects. For example, in Togo, 95% of children under five now receive vaccinations against measles and &lt;a href="w%3Apolio"&gt;polio&lt;/a&gt;, mosquito nets to guard against &lt;a href="w%3Amalaria"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;, and de-worming tablets.

<h1>Report finds Afghanistan is on the verge of becoming a narcotics state</h1>
♡❤♡March 5, 2005♡❤♡

A &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; State Department report &lt;a href="http%3A//www.state.gov/g/inl/rls/nrcrpt/2005/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was released on Friday, March 4, officially detailing the extent to which &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aopium"&gt;opium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; production has soared in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;U.S invasion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; three years ago. The report made its way to &lt;a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; via Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;. Although the scope of study is large, investigating the status of illicit narcotics in almost every country during 2004, attention has focused on Afghanistan. With more than 510,000 sprawling acres of the impoverished country (three times the amount in 2003) utilized for Opium poppy cultivation (the raw material for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aheroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), the report warns that the country is becoming a "narcotics state" like &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In addition, the report indicated that Afghanistan's opium production soared to 5,445 tons last year, producing 17 times more of the raw drug material than second-place &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;. The report stated that the explosion of narcotic production in Afghanistan is "an enormous threat to world stability."

To combat this issue, the &lt;a href="President%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration has proposed US$780 million to institute a plan that works on two levels: to promote alternative crops to farmers and to increase military interdiction for finding and destroying heroin labs and storage facilities. At the time of publishing, the U.S. government has already committed US$1.2 billion to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProhibition%20%28drugs%29"&gt;counter-narcotics activities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for 2005.

♡❤♡ (Karol Józef Wojtyła) 1920-2005♡❤♡

After months of failing health, ♡❤His Holiness♡❤ passed away today, April 2, at 9:37 p.m. local time (19:37 UTC). He was 84 years old. An email message to journalists from the spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls from &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Vatican"&gt;The Vatican&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the death at 20:00 UTC.

The Pope had a &lt;a href="w%3Atracheostomy"&gt;tracheostomy&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year to help him breathe, and then lost his ability to speak last week. On Thursday March 31 he developed a urinary tract infection that led to septic shock and cardiovascular collapse. A nasogastric feeding tube was inserted to help him regain strength. The Pope elected not to return to Rome's Gemelli hospital, but instead to stay in his own apartments where he was tended to by his personal doctors and Vatican medical staff.

The same night, he was administered the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAnointing%20of%20the%20Sick"&gt;Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ also known as the last rites. On Friday April 1, the Vatican said he was having difficulties with both his heart and his kidneys.

&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; news agency Agenzia Giornalistica Italia reports the pope's final message was "I am happy, you be happy, too. Let's pray together with joy. I entrust everything to the Virgin Mary with joy".

A description of the last moment of the holy father from father Jarek Cielecki, director of the Vatican service news and of the Italian TV catolic Tele Padre Pio, tells us the last moment of life of this great man. "The Holy father died looking at the window, gathered in prayer. As such he was conscious. Just before dying, the Pope raised his right hand in a sign of blessing, as if he was aware of all the people gathered in prayer. Then, as soon as the prayer ended, the Pope did a huge effort, said the word 'Amen' and died."

The Vatican has announced that the funeral will take place on Wednesday, April 6 and that the Pope's body will lie in state from Monday, April 4.

<h2>Tributes</h2>
Many have paid tribute to the Pope and his more than quarter-century reign:

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Reagan"&gt;Nancy Reagan&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20King"&gt;Larry King&lt;/a&gt; compared the lives of the late Pope and of her late husband &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, saying, "He and Ronnie had so much in common. They were both actors." Noting other similarities between their lives, including their shared interests in outdoor activities and the fact that attempts were made to assassinate them both in 1981, she concluded by saying, "It's amazing how their lives crossed."
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;Prime Minister of Canada&lt;/a&gt; said, "What the Pope really stood for is the bringing of all faiths together."
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AAnn%20Widdecombe"&gt;Ann Widdecombe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with the BBC said, "It's being talked of already, not only by Catholics but by the world, as a great Papal reign," adding from her personal experience of having met the Pope, "I felt I was in the presence of God just for being in the presence of that Pope."
BULLET::::- His Eminence Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, in an announcement to ITV News in front of Westminster Cathedral, described the late Pope as "One of the greatest leaders of our modern world; one of the greatest Popes in the Church's 2000 year history." Clearly moved, he concluded his remarks saying "The Church will miss him; the world will miss him; and I will miss him."
BULLET::::- In a public statement, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, said "All Popes belong to the world, but Americans had special reason to love the man from Krakow." He stated that "We will always remember the humble, wise, and fearless priest" and concluded by describing the late Pope as "a son of Poland who became Bishop of Rome and a hero for the ages".
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ACarlo%20Azeglio%20Ciampi"&gt;Carlo Azeglio Ciampi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Italy"&gt;President of Italy&lt;/a&gt;, said "All the Italians, me too, are mourning for the Holy Father... I'll never forget extraordinary events like the Jubilee meeting. John Paul II has left a mark in the history, he'll be remembered as one of those men who indicated a way... the overcoming of the divisions between East and West, a world order sustained by the peace. &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; We have admired the Pope for the strength of his ideas, his courage, the extraordinary opening to the dialogue with all the religions. It will keep on living in our hearts."

<h2>Reaction around the world</h2>
The announcement of Pope John Paul II's death in &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Peter%27s%20Square"&gt;Saint Peter's Square&lt;/a&gt; at 19:58 UTC was met with applause, a traditional Italian gesture of respect, followed by silence.
The Italian government declared three days of national mourning. (Earlier in the day, all major Italian sporting fixtures had already been cancelled.) It was reported that he had already been dubbed 'John Paul the Great' by many in the tearful crowd in St Peter's Square.

In &lt;a href="w%3AKrakow"&gt;Krakow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, a crowd gathered in the square outside of the Archbishop's residence. The Polish government declared a period of national mourning, from today until the funeral.

Many Catholic churches around the world remained open to allow people to pray, or held special masses. In &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Mary%27s%20Pro-Cathedral"&gt;Pro-Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; remained open until midnight to allow people to pray privately for the deceased Pope. In the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, Westmister Cathedral remained open to allow people to sign a book of condolence.

The flag of the United States flying over the White House was lowered to half mast.

<h2>Biography</h2>

Born Karol Józef Wojtyła in &lt;a href="w%3AWadowice"&gt;Wadowice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; on May 18, 1920, Pope John Paul II became the first non-Italian pope in 455 years when he was chosen on October 16, 1978 to lead the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; following the sudden death of &lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20I"&gt;Pope John Paul I&lt;/a&gt;.
His more than 100 trips abroad have attracted enormous crowds (some of the largest ever assembled). With these trips, John Paul has covered a distance far greater than that traveled by all other popes combined. They have been seen as an outward sign of the efforts at global bridge-building between nations and between religions that have been central to his pontificate.

Pope John Paul II has beatified and canonized far more persons than any previous pope. It is reported that as of October 2004, he has beatified 1,340 people. Whether he has canonized more saints than all his predecessors put together, as is sometimes claimed, is difficult to prove, as the records of many early canonizations are incomplete or missing.

First diagnosed in 2001 and confirmed by the Vatican in 2003, the Pope had suffered from &lt;a href="w%3AParkinson%27s%20disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; during the last few years of his life. This restricted him to only speaking a few sentences at a time and also affected his hearing and mobility.

Four &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; (RCMP) officers were shot and killed while raiding a house in the rural town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMayerthorpe%2C%20Alberta"&gt;Mayerthorpe, Alberta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The suspected shooter, James Rosko, 46, also died in the raid. The RCMP reported that he committed suicide after killing the four officers with his own rifle.

The officers were carrying out a court-ordered property seizure. They discovered stolen property and a marijuana growing operation. 

The following officers were killed in action:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Const. Peter Schiemann, 25
BULLET::::- Const. Anthony Gordon, 28
BULLET::::- Const. Lionide Johnston, 34
BULLET::::- Const. Brock Myrol, 29

</ul>
The shooting has shocked the peaceful region and the country of Canada. The &lt;a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; has responded by agreeing to recommend tougher laws for grow-ops. Local citizens are reacting to the losses with memorials and condolences. 

The rural town of Mayerthorpe, with a population of about 1,600, is located about 130km northwest of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdmonton%2C%20Alberta"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; military is funding the research and development of a weapon that could be used to inflict excruciating pain from up to 2 kilometres away, but is meant to otherwise leave victims unharmed. Pain researchers have been left furious after work aimed at controlling pain has been used to develop technology aimed at maximising it.

Intended for use against protesters and rioters, the research focuses on the effect electromagnetic pulses can have on pain reception. Due to be ready by 2007, the Pulsed Energy Projectile (PEP) weapon will fire a burst of electrically charged gas, or ♡❤plasma♡❤, which will generate an electromagnetic pulse on impact. It is this pulse which will trigger impulses in nerve cells causing extreme pain. 

A review of the non-lethal weapon by the US Naval Studies Board in 2003 concluded that PEPs produced “pain and temporary paralysis” in animal test subjects. Studies ongoing at the University of Central Florida in &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; aim at optimising this effect. The ultimate aim is to generate a pulse which will trigger optimum pain in the subject without damaging tissues. Studies due to be carried out on lab grown cells aim at identifying the threshold of pain that can be inflicted on someone without causing death. There is some concern that the studies will fall short of demonstrating a safe level for a plasma burst. 

The work came to light after documents were released under the US's Freedom of Information Act to the &lt;a href="w%3ASunshine%20Project"&gt;Sunshine Project&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation who aims to expose biological weapons research. One document entitled “Sensory consequences of electromagnetic pulses emitted by laser induced plasmas” concerned the generation and firing of PEPs. Pain researchers have condemned the research, claiming that it could be put to use as a means of torture and that it is unethical. 

“I am deeply concerned about the ethical aspects of this research,” said Andrew Rice, a consultant in pain medicine at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. “Even if the use of temporary pain can be justified as a restraining measure, which I do not believe it can, the long-term physical and psychological effects are unknown.”

Clinical psychologist at University College London, Amanda Williams expressed concern that victims risk long term harm. “Persistent pain can result in a range supposedly non-destructive stimuli which nevertheless change the functioning of the nervous system,” she says. Studies “cannot tell us about the pain and psychological consequences of such painful experience,” she said.

DNA tests have proven that &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Blunkett"&gt;David Blunkett&lt;/a&gt; is not the father of &lt;a href="w%3AKimberly%20Quinn"&gt;Kimberley Quinn's&lt;/a&gt; baby son, Lorcan. The spokesman of the former minister said that test, categorically denies that David Blunkett is the father of Ms. Quinn's second son Lorcan. The test was carried out a few weeks ago with consent of both parties. 

However Stephen Quinn, the real father, attacked Blunkett by saying "We are angry that Mr Blunkett has yet again chosen to talk to the press about... our family."

Mr. Blunkett was the former home secretary in the United Kingdom, until he resigned after it emerged that he had had an affair with Mrs. Quinn.

&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; security officer &lt;a href="w%3ANicola%20Calipari"&gt;Nicola Calipari&lt;/a&gt; has been killed, and &lt;a href="w%3AGiuliana%20Sgrena"&gt;Giuliana Sgrena&lt;/a&gt; as well as two other security agents have been wounded after &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; forces opened fire on the car they were travelling in shortly after Sregna's release from captivity.

Multinational Force &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; officials have stated that the car approached a military check-point at speed at 8:55pm Baghdad time on Friday. Soldiers opened fire on the vehicle, injuring Ms Sgrena and killing one other.

"There was suddenly this shooting, we were hit by a hail of gunfire, and I was speaking with &lt;a href="w%3ANicola%20Calipari"&gt;Nicola&lt;/a&gt;, who was telling me about what had been happening in &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in the meantime, when he leaned towards me, probably also to protect me. And then he collapsed and I realised that he was dead," &lt;a href="w%3AGiuliana%20Sgrena"&gt;Ms. Sgrena&lt;/a&gt; told Italy's &lt;a href="w%3ARAI"&gt;RAI&lt;/a&gt; radio.

She said the shooting continued "because the driver wasn't even managing to explain that we were Italian."

When questioned if the car was going too fast as it approached the U.S. troops, she said: "We weren't going particularly fast given that type of situation." 

Ms Sgrena was given medical care by &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20Forces"&gt;Coalition Forces&lt;/a&gt; medical personnel for a superficial wound to her shoulder. Her left-wing newspaper, &lt;a href="w%3AIl%20Manifesto"&gt;Il Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that the bullet had previously passed through the body of Calipari.

The Prime Minister of Italy, &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt;, has demanded an explanation for the shooting. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; told Mr Berlusconi during a telephone call that there would be a full investigation, and offered his apologies.

Boeing's Launch Systems, Launch Services and Delta Program business units are to be allowed to bid once more for U.S. space launch contracts, the USAF has announced.

Boeing had been suspended since July 24, 2003 after violating federal law. The company was discovered to have been in possession of thousands of pages of documentation from Lockheed Martin, Boeing's rival during the 1998 evolved expendable launch vehicle source selection process. 

The USAF and Boeing have signed an interim agreement to protect the Air Force's interests. The agreement allows for the reinstating of the suspension if Boeing is indicted or convicted, or if new evidence is found. 

Boeing will have to submit to outside verification of the remedial steps it has taken, and cannot charge the Air Force for associated costs. Internal management responsibilities for ethical practice have been changed.

Lockheed Martin's Atlas V and Boeing's Delta IV are two types of expendable rocket, designed to reduce the cost of space launches.

The &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; government plans to pass an anti-secession law, aimed at preventing a declaration of &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20independence"&gt;Taiwan independence&lt;/a&gt;. The law shows the "strong determination of the Chinese people" and will "never allow secessionist forces working for 'Taiwan independence' to succeed at breaking away from the mainland" according to an announcement made by China's Premier &lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20People%27s%20Congress"&gt;National People's Congress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;.

The Chinese State Council is also planning to increase the country's military budget by 12.6 percent, to US$29.98 billion, for the current fiscal year.

The anti-secession law, as well as the military budget increase will both be discussed during the parliamentary meetings which begin today, and continue for the next 12 days. Over 3,000 delegates assembled in the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Hall%20of%20the%20People"&gt;Great Hall of the People&lt;/a&gt; today to listen to Wen's two hour speech and begin discussions.

Taiwanese politicians reacted with disappointment to the planned anti-secession law, and promised protests in the streets of Taipei and Kaohsiung this Sunday. Taiwan's President &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; even threatened to introduce an "anti-annexation" law to oppose China's move.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; are repeating their calls for &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; to completely withdraw from &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. The two countries are leading an international campaign, based upon the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; Resolution 1559.

Syria's president &lt;a href="w%3ABashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt; promised to gradually withdraw his troops from the region, but the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;US State Department&lt;/a&gt; is calling Bashar al-Assad's promise "insufficient" and demanded an "immediate and full withdrawal".

The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement which read, "We note the announcement by the president of the Syrian republic of his decision to apply" UN Resolution 1559. "We, therefore, expect him to fully withdraw his troops and services from Lebanon as soon as possible."

Bashar al-Assad has announced a "two-phase" withdrawal of Syria's troops, but the timetable is not yet determined.
"The Syrian army wants to pull out quickly ... as soon as possible logistically," said Syrian cabinet minister Buthaina Shaaban.

Other countries shared the concerns of the US and France:

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Pettigrew"&gt;Pierre Pettigrew&lt;/a&gt; stated, "Today's announcement by Syria of a redeployment of its troops to the Beka'a Valley and from there to the Syrian-Lebanese border falls short of Syria's obligations and the requirements of the people of Lebanon and the international community".
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordanian&lt;/a&gt; Foreign Minister Hani al-Mulqi said, "Implementation of the resolution should result in a stronger Lebanon and a Lebanon that is undivided."
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASilvan%20Shalom"&gt;Silvan Shalom&lt;/a&gt; said that a complete Syrian withdrawal "will allow free and democratic elections, letting the Lebanese elect their own leaders creating an independent country, not vassal state, and maybe in the near future leading ... to a greater understanding and maybe even peace with Israel."

</ul>
Lebanese opposition leader Walid Jumblatt welcomed Bashar al-Assad's announcement, calling it a "positive start", but other leaders, such as former President Amin Gemayel are concerned that "the Syrian army will stay in the mountain range within the Lebanese border".

The international campaign to ask Syria to withdraw from Lebanon has gained increased publicity since the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, on February 14.

&lt;a href="w%3AWestmeath"&gt;Westmeath&lt;/a&gt; managed to beat &lt;a href="w%3ADonegal"&gt;Donegal&lt;/a&gt; by the narrowest of margins in a thrilling game at &lt;a href="w%3AMullingar"&gt;Mullingar's&lt;/a&gt; Cusack Park earlier today. The &lt;a href="w%3AGaelic%20football"&gt;Allianz NFL Division 1A&lt;/a&gt; clash had been tipped to end in a draw, but a late burst of energy by the lakelanders ensured a victory. 

Both teams scored a goal with Colm McFadden and Dessie Dolan both finding the back of the net, however both teams had several missed chances; with Ryan Bradley hitting the woodwork in an early penalty and Martin Flanagan unable to beat the goalie.

The final score was 1-12 to 1-11.

&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; journalist &lt;a href="w%3AGiuliana%20Sgrena"&gt;Giuliana Sgrena&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that it was "no accident" when US troops shot at her car, resulting in the death of an Italian intelligence officer who had helped to secure her release from captivity earlier that day.

Speaking to the press at the &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; hospital where she is being treated for a gunshot wound to her shoulder, she said, "It can't be just said that it was just an accident. We can't accept this, it is not possible."

Sgrena's suggestion is being reinforced by her partner, Pier Scolari who said "I hope the Italian government does something because either this was an ambush, as I think, or we are dealing with imbeciles or terrorized kids who shoot at anyone," 

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at a press conference in Rome today looked visibly angry and said "I immediately invited the American ambassador to come speak with me, to clarify the actions of the American military for such a grave accident that someone is going to have to take responsibility for,"

Sgrena claims that Italian secret service agent &lt;a href="w%3ANicola%20Calipari"&gt;Nicola Calipari&lt;/a&gt; was fatally hit when he moved in front of her in the car after the soldiers opened fire on the group.

"It wasn't a checkpoint, but a patrol that started shooting after pointing some lights in our direction," the Ansa news agency cited Sgrena as telling prosecutors. "We hadn't previously encountered any checkpoint, and we didn't understand where the shots came from." The New York Times quotes Sgrena as stating that, "There was no bright light, no signal."

The London Observer reported, "Sgrena told colleagues the vehicle was not travelling fast and had already passed several checkpoints on its way to the airport. The Americans shone a flashlight at the car and then fired between 300 and 400 bullets at if from an armoured vehicle. Rather than calling immediately for assistance for the wounded Italians, the soldiers' first move was to confiscate their weapons and mobile phones and they were prevented from resuming contact with Rome for more than an hour."

The US military said in a statement: "About 2100 [1800 GMT], a patrol in western Baghdad observed the vehicle speeding towards their checkpoint and attempted to warn the driver to stop by hand and arm signals, flashing white lights, and firing warning shots in front of the car. When the driver didn't stop, the soldiers shot into the engine block, which stopped the vehicle, killing one and wounding two others." 

American soldiers have had been victims of suicide car-bomb attacks in the past. On &lt;a href="Twin%20bombings%20hit%20Baghdad%27s%20Green%20Zone"&gt;December 4, 2004&lt;/a&gt;, two cars exploded next to a checkpoint at the Green Zone in Baghdad, killing 16 and wounding dozens. &lt;a href="Suicide%20car%20bomb%20attack%20in%20Baghdad"&gt;On December 13&lt;/a&gt;, another car exploded in Baghdad killing 13.

Sgrena had been held captive for a month by Iraqi rebels. She works for the Italian newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AIl%20Manifesto"&gt;Il Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, founded by the former leader of Communist Youth Luciana Castellina&lt;a href="http%3A//play.rbn.com/%3Furl%3Ddemnow/demnow/demand/2004/nov/video/dnB20041124a.rm%26amp%3Bproto%3Drtsp%26amp%3Bstart%3D48%3A06.00"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.democracynow.org/article.pl%3Fsid%3D04/11/24/1532244"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper has been characterized by the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Refoundation%20Party"&gt;Partito della Rifondazione Comunista&lt;/a&gt; as a "communist daily" that has been "engaged against the war [in Iraq]."

Fisichella, driving a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20Sport"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , started from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apole%20position"&gt;pole position&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leading for the majority of the 57 lap event.

Fellow Renault driver &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; finished third, with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARubens%20Barrichello"&gt;Rubens Barrichello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; separating the pair.

It was an unhappy weekend for defending world champion &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who began from the rear of the field after his qualifying hopes were severely dented by Melbourne's changeable weather. Schumacher made steady progress through the field during the race but retired on lap 43 after a collision with fellow German &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h1>CIA sending suspects overseas for &quot;rendition&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=CIA%20sending%20suspects%20overseas%20for%20%26quot%3Brendition%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; has been secretly authorized by a &lt;a href="w%3AClassified%23U.S.%20Government.27s%20Classification%20system"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; directive, signed by US &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;, to send suspects overseas as part of a "rendition" process.

The program has been used to manage the large case load which has accumulated since the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;, leaving US officials free to concentrate on the "high value" suspects who are kept under US control at secret locations throughout the world.

Today, US officials were reluctant to defend this policy for any specific cases, but &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokesman &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Bartlett"&gt;Dan Bartlett&lt;/a&gt; presented a generic defense of US anti-terrorism policies on Sunday talk shows in the United States.

A former government official claimed that the program was "fully authorized" and that the CIA was "not doing anything illegal" in an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, and said that the leadership of the House and Senate intelligence committees was able to find out about the program, or had been informed of its existence.

Allowing the CIA to have so much power in deciding who can stay in the country and who is shipped off to other countries is controversial, because in the past, the White House, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; would have been involved in approving individual cases of sending prisoners to other countries.

While refusing to admit that the rendition policy even exists, the Bush administration claimed that they do not hand over people to be &lt;a href="w%3ATorture"&gt;tortured&lt;/a&gt; in other countries, to get around US laws which prohibit such practices.

However, the New York Times interviewed a number of current and former officials who believed that the policy was designed to allow the government to plausibly deny that torture was being tolerated.

The case of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMamdouh%20Habib"&gt;Mamdouh Habib&lt;/a&gt; attracted widespread attention in that country, after he was released in January after 40 months, without any charges being pressed. Australian officials were aware that he had been transferred by the United States to &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; for six months. During this time, Habib claims he was subjected to various methods of torture, including &lt;a href="w%3AElectric%20shock"&gt;electric shock&lt;/a&gt; and being held under water.

The United States denies that Habib was tortured with their knowledge, although US officials were not present during his overseas captivity and could not guarantee that he had not been tortured. Egypt has not confirmed that Habib was ever in the country.

A similar case involving &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; born &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMaher%20Arar"&gt;Maher Arar&lt;/a&gt;, deported to Syria in October, 2002, subsequently held and allegedly tortured for 374 days, led to Canada issuing a travel advisory strongly cautioning Canadians born in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, Syria, &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; against travel to the United States for any reason. A subsequent internal &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;RCMP&lt;/a&gt; investigation found several instances of impropriety in the Arar case, including the provision of sensitive information on Arar to US officials, and that a liaison officer may have known of the deportation plan but did not contact his supervisors.

Mr. Arar's attempt to sue American Attorney-General &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Ashcroft"&gt;John Ashcroft&lt;/a&gt; over the incident in January 2004 was dismissed when the US government invoked the rarely used "state secrets privilege", claiming that to go forward in open court would jeopardize intelligence, foreign policy, and national security interests.

Legal analysts point out that information obtained through the use of torture is useless in court proceedings, but US officials insist that the information obtained from such interrogations is still useful for their purposes, and that "it has resulted in the capture of terrorists."

The owner of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, &lt;a href="w%3ADeutsche%20B%C3%B6rse"&gt;Deutsche Börse&lt;/a&gt; has said it is quitting the takeover of the owner of the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, LSE. Its planned &lt;a href="w%3APound%20Sterling"&gt;GBP&lt;/a&gt; 1,3 billion (&lt;a href="w%3AEUR"&gt;EUR&lt;/a&gt; 2 billion) takeover (530p per share) was stopped by opposition for various shareholders from both parties. Its announcement is a setback for the chief executive &lt;a href="w%3AWerner%20Seifert"&gt;Werner Seifert&lt;/a&gt;. 

This just leaves the &lt;a href="w%3AEuronext"&gt;Euronext NV&lt;/a&gt; as the sole bidder of the LSE. It owns the stock exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and the tiny London-based exchange &lt;a href="w%3A%20London%20International%20Financial%20Futures%20and%20Options%20Exchange"&gt;Liffe&lt;/a&gt;.

Hans Albrecht Bethe (pronounced ♡❤Bay-ta♡❤) was born on July 2, 1906 in the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrasbourg"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , then part of &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; (now part of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;). He studied physics at &lt;a href="Frankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; and obtained his doctorate from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Munich"&gt;University of Munich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Bethe, whose mother was [[Judaism|Jewish}}, fled Germany in 1933 when the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Nazi Party|Nazi Party]]&lt;/span&gt; came to power. Bethe, along with hundreds of other Jewish academics, were fired from their posts as a result of one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s first anti-Semitic acts. Bethe moved first to [[England]] and in 1935 to the [[USA]] where he taught at Cornell University. 

Between 1935 and 1938, he studied [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:nuclear reaction|nuclear reactions]]&lt;/span&gt; and reaction cross sections. This research was useful to Bethe in more quantitatively developing [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Niels Bohr|Niels Bohr]]&lt;/span&gt; 's theory of the compound nucleus.

During [[World War II]], he served as a prominent member of a special summer session at the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:University of California, Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]]&lt;/span&gt; at the invitation of [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Robert Oppenheimer|Robert Oppenheimer]]&lt;/span&gt; , which outlined the first designs for the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:atomic bomb|atomic bomb]]&lt;/span&gt; and served as the beginning of the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Manhattan Project|Manhattan Project]]&lt;/span&gt; . When Oppenheimer started the secret weapons design laboratory, [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]&lt;/span&gt; , he appointed Bethe as Director of the Theoretical Division. 

After the war, Bethe argued that a crash project for the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:hydrogen bomb|hydrogen bomb]]&lt;/span&gt; should not be attempted, though after [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Harry S. Truman|President Truman]]&lt;/span&gt; announced the beginning of such a crash project, and the outbreak of the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Korean War|Korean War]]&lt;/span&gt; , he signed up and played a key role in the weapon's development. In 1968, he reflected upon the choice, noting that "It seemed quite logical. But sometimes I wish I were more consistent an idealist." Though he would see the project through to its end, in Bethe's account he was primarily hopeful that the weapon would be impossible to produce. He later characterized [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Stanislaw Ulam|Stanislaw Ulam]]&lt;/span&gt; as the "father" of the hydrogen bomb, and [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Edward Teller|Edward Teller]]&lt;/span&gt; as its "mother," and himself as its "midwife." 

Among his many honors, Bethe received the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Max Planck medal|Max Planck medal]]&lt;/span&gt; in 1955, and in 1961 he was awarded the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Eddington Medal|Eddington Medal]]&lt;/span&gt; of the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Royal Astronomical Society|Royal Astronomical Society]]&lt;/span&gt; for his work in identifying the energy generating processes in stars. In 1967, Bethe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his studies of the production of solar and stellar energy, [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:stellar nucleosynthesis|stellar nucleosynthesis]]&lt;/span&gt; . He postulated that the source of this energy are [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:nuclear fusion|thermonuclear reactions]]&lt;/span&gt; in which [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:hydrogen|hydrogen]]&lt;/span&gt; was converted into [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:helium|helium]]&lt;/span&gt; .

During the 1980s and 1990s, Bethe campaigned for the peaceful use of [[nuclear energy]], arguing against the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:nuclear arms ace|nuclear arms ace]]&lt;/span&gt; and against [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:nuclear testing|nuclear testing]]&lt;/span&gt; . In 1995, at the age of 88, Bethe wrote an open letter calling on all scientists to "cease and desist" from working on any aspect of nuclear weapons development and manufacture. In 2004, he signed a letter along with 47 other Nobel laureates endorsing [[John Kerry]] for president of the United States citing [[George W. Bush|Bush]]'s apparent misuse of science.

<h1>Insulin levels tied to Alzheimer's</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Insulin%20levels%20tied%20to%20Alzheimer%27s&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInsulin"&gt;Insulin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; production has been discovered in the brain and linked to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , potentially changing how the illness is viewed and treated.

While &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainsulin%20resistance"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a characteristic of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adiabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is linked with neurodegeneration, the new finding provides a strong connection between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.

"What we found is that insulin is not just produced in the pancreas, but also in the brain," says study senior author Suzanne de la Monte of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARhode%20Island%20Hospital"&gt;Rhode Island Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="Brown%20University"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrown%20University%20Medical%20School"&gt;Medical School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "And we discovered that insulin and its growth factors, which are necessary for the survival of brain cells, contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's." 

This raises the possibility, says de la Monte, of a "type 3" diabetes. 

The finding was made by studying a genetic abnormality in rats that blocks insulin signaling in the brain.

In the rats, de la Monte and colleagues found that insulin and related proteins IGF I and II are expressed in neurons in several regions in the brain. 

Additionally, they determined that a drop in insulin production in the brain contributes to brain cell degeneration, a symptom of Alzheimer's. 

"These abnormalities do not correspond to type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but reflect a different and more complex disease process that originates in the CNS (central nervous system)," the researchers report. 

Analysis of postmortem brain tissue also revealed that the proteins aren't produced at normal levels in human Alzheimer's sufferers. 

Insulin and IGF I were significantly reduced in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus—all areas affected by Alzheimer's—while not in the cerebellum, which is generally not affected by Alzheimer's. 

The study "opens the way for targeted treatment to the brain and changes the way we view Alzheimer's disease," says de la Monte. 

The research is reported in the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJournal%20of%20Alzheimer%27s%20Disease"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sunday%20Times"&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AObserver"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt; newspapers today both stated that &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARod%20Eddington"&gt;Rod Eddington&lt;/a&gt; is planning to step down in the Summer. Althought no official announcement has been released from the airline about Mr Eddington's future, speculation is already mounting on who the successor will be.

Possible internal candidates include marketing director Martin George and finance director John Rishton. However it is quite possible that an external executive such as &lt;a href="w%3AWillie%20Walsh"&gt;Willie Walsh&lt;/a&gt;, former CEO of &lt;a href="w%3AAer%20Lingus"&gt;Aer Lingus&lt;/a&gt;, could take the post. Mr Walsh successful turned around Aer Lingus into one of the most profitable ♡❤national carriers♡❤ in the world after it had almost bankrupt in 2002.

Mr Eddington took over the top job at British Airways in May 2000

Peruvians living near the site of a release of mercury are preparing to sue a U.S. mining company, announcing last Saturday that they will bring their case before a Denver judge.

On &lt;a href="w%3AJune%202"&gt;June 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2000"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, a serious accident in the province of Cajamarca, in &lt;a href="w%3APeru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, poisoned many residents with &lt;a href="w%3Amercury%20%28element%29"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt;, a highly toxic &lt;a href="w%3Aheavy%20metals"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt;. A truck from &lt;a href="w%3ANewmont%20Mining"&gt;Newmont Mining Company&lt;/a&gt; dumped two metal canisters of mercury along an &lt;a href="w%3AAndean"&gt;Andean&lt;/a&gt; highway, in the communities of San Juan, Choropampa, and Magdalena. Curious townspeople (mostly children) picked up the silvery droplets, and some even drank some of it. Many residents became sick from severe mercury poisoning. Some of those who came in contact with the mercury suffered &lt;a href="w%3Ablindness"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt;, and one even had a purplish &lt;a href="w%3Arash"&gt;rash&lt;/a&gt; on her body.

Over 300 people directly suffered the effects of mercury poisoning.

As the owners of the Yanacocha mine which produced the mercury, Newmont Mining offered up to US$6 thousand to more than 700 local residents, but over 1,100 others are still engaged in a legal battle with Newmont over the case.

In today's &lt;a href="w%3Aglobalization"&gt;global economy&lt;/a&gt;, many international businesses have looked overseas to maintain their profits, but environmental law professor &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Otto"&gt;James Otto&lt;/a&gt; is asking about the cost to the &lt;a href="w%3Aenvironmentalism"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20health"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt;. "Any company that wants to mine internationally now must not only have the legal right to mine but also a 'social license' to operate," he said. "Peru has been a wake-up call."

As the Peruvian residents gear up for their lawsuit against &lt;a href="w%3ADenver"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;-based Newmont Mining, the world's largest gold mining firm, some of these important questions may finally be answered. After the breakdown of mediation talks with Newmont on &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary%2020"&gt;January 20&lt;/a&gt;, the residents and their lawyer decided to stop negotiating behind closed doors and take their case to the public. Last Saturday, &lt;a href="w%3AMarch%205"&gt;March 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, they announced that they are bringing their suit before Denver District Judge &lt;a href="w%3AJudge%20Robert%20Hyatt"&gt;Robert Hyatt&lt;/a&gt;. "If successful," states &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Krowder"&gt;Ken Krowder&lt;/a&gt; who represents the plaintiffs, "[this] would mark the first time an American firm is held accountable for environmental damages overseas."

This is not the first time Newmont Mining has had trouble with an emerging &lt;a href="w%3AThird%20World"&gt;Third World&lt;/a&gt; environmental movement. Recently, in &lt;a href="w%3AAugust%202004"&gt;August 2004&lt;/a&gt;, a US$543 million lawsuit was filed against Newmont Mining by the &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; Environmental Ministry and local villagers. They claim that pollution caused by the company’s mining activities has caused serious illnesses and other health problems, including &lt;a href="w%3Askin%20disease"&gt;skin disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Atumor"&gt;tumors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Abirth%20defect"&gt;birth defects&lt;/a&gt;, and a decline in &lt;a href="w%3Afish"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; stocks, a staple food. One particular mining practice used frequently by Newmont Mining in Indonesia is submarine tailings disposal, a waste disposal method for mercury and &lt;a href="w%3Aarsenic"&gt;arsenic&lt;/a&gt; that is outlawed in the United States.

At least six Newmont Mining managers, including an &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt;, face up to 15 years in a &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; prison for environmental and &lt;a href="w%3Acorporate%20crime"&gt;corporate crime&lt;/a&gt; in that case.

The local Peruvian residents are continuing their fight for safer mining practices and compensation for existing damage and injuries. Thousands of local townspeople protested against the Yanacocha mine last fall, demanding protection for the local water supply.

Newmont Mining officials have blamed the June 2000 mercury spill on a contractor, and have lost the battle to keep the case out of the American court system.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The President of &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Mesa"&gt;Carlos Mesa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; officially resigned Sunday, March 6. Now the President of Senate Hormando Vaca Díez is the temporary President of the Republic of Bolivia. 

Mesa resigned because of the announcement of highways's blockages by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , both the leader of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acoca"&gt;coca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; growers and the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS). The blockages serve to pressure the Legislative so the Hydrocarbons Law can be approved. The law aims to raise the taxes levied on hydrocarbon extraction from 18 to 50%.

The MAS is a political party formed basically by coca-growing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acampesinos"&gt;campesinos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (known as ♡❤cocaleros♡❤), &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acommunists"&gt;communists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , admirers of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aindigenous"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; people. The party is against the government of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the alleged American influency in the region, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aliberalism"&gt;neoliberalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aglobalization"&gt;globalization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Morales in his own words, explain some of the MAS motivations:

Morales is an admirer of Fidel Castro and he says he is inspired by the presidents of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He supports the creation of an anti-imperialist block formed by Latin-American and Arabian countries against the USA, which is being organized by the Brazilian President.

Bolivia economy depends on exportation of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahydrocarbon"&gt;hydrocarbon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (oil and gas). Other sources of resources comes from the cultivation of coca.
The coca growers demands the same treatment the government is giving to hydrocarbons. However, the production of coca in great quantities is controversial since the coca is the raw material of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Cocaine is considered illegal in Bolivia and in the majority of other countries

In October 2003, Morales caused the resignation of the President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada. After the resignation of Lozada, Mesa, the vice-president, assumed the command of Bolivan government.

Morales said about the resignation of Mesa:"The only resignation purpose is to blackmail, this resignation is not worth, it basically serves so the October agenda does not occurr (agenda purpose is nationalization of gas production and to proclaim a Constitutional Assembly [Note:where politics propose a new Constitution]). 

The blockades of roads occurred in two strategical places: at the city of El Alto, neighboring to the capital, and at El Chapere, which binds the cities of Cochabamba and Santa Cruz de la Sierra. 

The country is divided. There were some protests and manifestations for and against Mesa.

Two engineers, Andrea Alù and Nader Engheta of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Pennsylvania"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; have come up with a 'plasmonic cover' which they claim could render objects "nearly invisible to an observer".

The idea is still in its infancy, but it is said not to violate any obvious laws of physics. John Pendry, a physicist at Imperial College in London, UK: "The concept is an interesting one, with several important potential applications. It could find uses in stealth technology and camouflage."

Earlier attempts at constructing an invisibility screen resulted in the &lt;a href="w%3Achameleon"&gt;chameleon&lt;/a&gt;-principle: screens were coloured to match their background, rendering them hard, but not impossible to see, but usually from only a limited point of view.

The principle on which the technology is founded can be explained as follows: an object can be seen because light scatters from its surface back to our eyes. If the scattering of light could be prevented, the object could not be seen. By making a screen resonate in tune with the light, scattering of light would be prevented. This can be achieved by using &lt;a href="w%3Aplasmon"&gt;plasmon&lt;/a&gt;s, waves of electronic density caused by &lt;a href="w%3Aelectron"&gt;electron&lt;/a&gt;s in a metalic surface moving in sync. If the frequency of the light is close to that of the shield, the light scattered by the object will be negligible compared to the light scattered by the shield. For &lt;a href="w%3Avisible%20light"&gt;visible light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Asilver%20%28metal%29"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Agold%20%28metal%29"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; can be used as metals, for other frequencies, such as &lt;a href="w%3Ainfrared"&gt;infrared&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aultra-violet"&gt;ultra-violet&lt;/a&gt;, other metals will have to be used.

&lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; passed a new law that &lt;a href="w%3ACodification"&gt;codifies&lt;/a&gt; a legal basis for authorising the use of military force to stop &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; from formally declaring its independence from the mainland. The anti-succession law was passed by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20People%27s%20Congress"&gt;National People's Congress&lt;/a&gt; on March 8 in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;.

The deputy chairman of the NPC told members gathered at the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Hall%20of%20the%20People"&gt;Great Hall of the People&lt;/a&gt; that, "If possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity." The broad language of the law does not specify any exact measures China might take, but its effect is to reinforce the mainland's long held position of a one-China principle.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMainland%20Affairs%20Council"&gt;Mainland Affairs Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; described the law as "malicious" and "crude". Taiwan views the development as violating international norms for peacefully resolving disputes. "This law exposes China's plot to impose armed force to swallow up Taiwan," read the council's written statement. "In essence, it has handed its military a blank check to unleash force against Taiwan." A Taiwanese Defence Ministry spokesperson announced that military exercises will be held this summer to practice defending against an attack.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20house"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; had urged China to reconsider the law before it was passed. White House press secretary &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McCellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; said, "We view it as unhelpful - something that runs counter to recent trends toward a warming in cross-strait relations. We oppose any attempts to determine the future of Taiwan by anything other than peaceful means."

China has always officially maintained that Taiwan, which split from the mainland in 1949, is a rogue territory which must eventually reunify with China. Just recently in a ‘four point guideline' set forth on March 5, 2005, Chinese President &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; said, "On no account shall the 1.3 billion Chinese people allow anyone to undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will not have the slightest hesitation, falter or concession on the major principle issue of opposing secession. The 'Taiwan independence' secessionist forces must abandon their secessionist stand and stop all 'Taiwan independence' activities."

Chinese opposition to a plan by Taiwan President &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; for a referendum on a new constitution that may violate Jintao's ‘four-point guideline' is seen in part as prompting the new law.

Genetic abnormalities behind the premature aging disease Progeria have been corrected in cells in a step towards gene therapy for the condition.

Affecting about one in eight million children, &lt;a href="w%3AHutchinson%20Gilford%20Progeria%20Syndrome"&gt;Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria&lt;/a&gt; (HGP) causes sufferers to rapidly experience symptoms of old age. 

The average life expectancy of those afflicted is just around 14 years, with many dying from such age-related conditions as heart disease. 

The disease is known to be caused by a mutation in the gene &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi%3Fdb%3Dgene%26amp%3Bcmd%3DRetrieve%26amp%3Bdopt%3DGraphics%26amp%3Blist_uids%3D4000"&gt;lamin A&lt;/a&gt;. 

The mutation is thought to adversely affect the expression of genes by preventing appropriate genetic "editing." 

The inappropriate editing cuts &lt;a href="w%3AExon"&gt;exons&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;"sentences" of genetic information&amp;mdash;too short.

Tom Misteli and colleagues of the US &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nci.nih.gov"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; have now found a way to correct the editing error.

They did this using synthetic molecules called morpholino oligonucleotides that Misteli likens to a "molecular Band-Aid."

The researchers say the discovery could aid the development of gene therapy for Progeria.

The research is reported in the journal ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nature.com/nm/index.html"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤

The British national airline, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; has announce that the former CEO of &lt;a href="w%3AAer%20Lingus"&gt;Aer Lingus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWillie%20Walsh"&gt;Willie Walsh&lt;/a&gt; is to be their new CEO. Mr Walsh is to replace the current CEO, Australian-born &lt;a href="w%3ARod%20Eddington"&gt;Rod Eddington&lt;/a&gt; in September after his retirement. 

Willie Walsh started as a cadet for Aer Lingus at the age of 17, later becoming a captain of the airline. In 1998, he became the chief-executive of the airline's charter subsidiary Furtura, and later in 2000 chief finance officer. In the wake of 11th September 2001, he became the chief-executive of Aer Lingus, itself. Worried about what happen to &lt;a href="w%3ASwissair"&gt;Swissair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASabena"&gt;Sabena&lt;/a&gt;, he looked at the rival Irish airline &lt;a href="w%3ARyanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration and made Aer Lingus in effect a &lt;a href="w%3ALow-cost%20carrier"&gt;no-frills airline&lt;/a&gt;, such as replacing the infamous turquoise uniforms with polo shirts and promoting via the Internet.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAslan%20Maskhadov"&gt;Aslan Maskhadov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the leader of the separatist movement in &lt;a href="Chechnya"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt;, is reported to have been killed by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20special%20forces"&gt;Russian special forces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

&lt;a href="FSB"&gt;FSB&lt;/a&gt; head &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANikolay%20Patrushev"&gt;Nikolay Patrushev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced that special forces attached to the FSB (the successor to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKGB"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) had "today carried out an operation in the settlement of Tolstoy-Yurt, as a result of which the international terrorist and leader of armed groups Maskhadov was killed, and his closest comrades-in-arms detained". A body was shown on Russian television that looked very much like Maskhadov. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAkhmed%20Zakayev"&gt;Akhmed Zakayev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one of his closest allies who acted as his spokesman and "Foreign Minister", told a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n radio station that it was probable that Maskhadov had indeed been killed

Russia had considered the Chechen separatists terrorists, and accredited the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeslan%20school%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;Beslan school hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , along with other acts to the militants. Maskhadov has condemned any crime against civilians.

Aslan Alivitch Maskhadov, born 21 September, 1951, was the leader of the separatist movement in the Russian republic of Chechnya. He was credited by many with the Chechen victory in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Chechen%20War"&gt;First Chechen War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which secured temporary ♡❤de facto♡❤ independence for Chechnya. In January 1997, Maskhadov was elected President of Chechnya on a platform including demands for independence from Moscow. Following the start of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Chechen%20War"&gt;Second Chechen War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1999, he returned to leading the guerrilla movement against the Russian army.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Syria%20begins%20withdrawing%20troops%20from%20Lebanon&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; has begun to withdraw its troops from northern and southern &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; despite a large rally in Beirut to support the Syrian presence.

Lebanese Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul-Rahim%20Murad"&gt;Abdul-Rahim Murad&lt;/a&gt; said troops would pull back to the eastern Bekaa Valley on Tuesday, but refused to give a date for a full withdrawal. The movement of the 6,000 troops involved would take six to ten days, he said. Syria has a total of 14,000 soldiers in the country.

Earlier, a peaceful &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;-organised rally saw hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets of &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; to show their support for the Syrians. The pro-Syrian Lebanon-based Shia Muslim organization, which maintains an armed militia in Lebanon, promised more rallies throughout Lebanon. According to &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Aoun"&gt;Michel Aoun&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Lebanon"&gt;Prime Minister of Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that the turnout was artificially inflated, with &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt;, Syrian, and other non-Lebanese groups attending, as well as with coercive tactics used by Syrian intelligence officials.

Lebanese opposing the presence of Syrian troops held counter-rallies just 300m away, with smaller turn-outs.

Syria has come under increasing political pressure to withdraw. &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said in a speech today, "Freedom will prevail in Lebanon. All Syrian military forces and intelligence personnel must withdraw before the Lebanese elections for those elections to be free and fair." 

Lebanon plans to hold a general election in May.

Syrian troops and intelligence officers have been present in Lebanon since the country began a peace-keeping mission in Lebanon during the 1976, following the start of &lt;a href="w%3ALebanese%20Civil%20War"&gt;Lebanon's civil war&lt;/a&gt;. U.S. forces withdrew in 1984 after a suicide attack killed 241 Marines. Ever since, Syria has had a strong political hold on its neighbour.

United Nations Resolution 1559 requires the immediate and complete withdrawal of all Syrian forces from Lebanon. &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; have made similar calls.

&lt;a href="w%3APortland%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A cloud of white steam and ash rose as high as 36,000 feet from &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20St.%20Helens"&gt;Mount St. Helens&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnites%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; at 5:27 p.m. PST today. The eruption was visible from the &lt;a href="w%3APortland%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan area in the neighbouring state of &lt;a href="w%3AOregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, causing traffic slowdowns as commuters slowed to watch the spectacle. News helicopters have shown photos of lava emerging inside the crater. Although the eruption was mostly over by 6:07 p.m. PST, an ashfall advisory until 9:00 p.m. PST has been announced for communities around the mountain. 

The volcano has been building a new dome in its crater in recent months and causing tremors. It seems to have done enough damage to knock out at least two of the &lt;a href="w%3Aseismometer"&gt;seismometer&lt;/a&gt;s operated on its dome by the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network, although this could be the result of either damage to the seismometers themselves, or their telemetry equipment.

The volcano is most famous for its dramatic &lt;a href="w%3A1980%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens"&gt;eruption in 1980&lt;/a&gt; which killed 57 people and blew the top off the mountain.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The Brazilian physicist Cesare Mansueto Giulio Lattes, aged 80, known as &lt;a href="w%3ACesar%20Lattes"&gt;Cesar Lattes&lt;/a&gt; died on March 8, 2005 at 3:40 pm. His death was caused by a cardio-respiratory failure and occurred at the Hospital of the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (&lt;a href="w%3AUniversidade%20Estadual%20de%20Campinas"&gt;Unicamp&lt;/a&gt;), in the Barão Geraldo district, in the city of &lt;a href="w%3ACampinas"&gt;Campinas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20State"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; state, Brazil.

Lattes, along with Giuseppe Occhialini and &lt;a href="w%3ACecil%20Powell"&gt;Cecil Powell&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for the discovery of the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20particles"&gt;subatomic&lt;/a&gt; particle called the &lt;a href="w%3Apion"&gt;pion&lt;/a&gt;, in 1947. This discovery was very important for the understanding of the sub-atomic structure of the &lt;a href="w%3Aatom"&gt;atom&lt;/a&gt;.

The physicist was born on July 11, 1924 in &lt;a href="w%3ACuritiba"&gt;Curitiba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParan%C3%A1"&gt;Paraná&lt;/a&gt;. For the last 30 years of his life he lived at Campinas, in Barão Geraldo. He worked at the Brazilian university Unicamp and he was the founder of its Department of Cosmic Rays and Chronology of the "Gleb Wataghin" Physics Institute.

Over 27 children are dead, and another 100 are hospitalized, after eating tainted &lt;a href="w%3ACassava"&gt;cassava&lt;/a&gt; on the central &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippine&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href="w%3ABohol"&gt;Bohol&lt;/a&gt;, according to local officials. Francisca Doliente told &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; that a friend who shared a portion of the cassava with her 9-year-old niece, Arve Tamor, was "gone...She died".

"It was during recess time. The children bought cassava," said &lt;a href="w%3AMabini"&gt;Mabini&lt;/a&gt; Vice-Mayor Ester Tabigue.

"Several children were brought here vomiting and complaining of stomach aches," said Dr. Elpidio Bonito. He noted that seven children did not make it to the hospital before succumbing to the &lt;a href="w%3AFoodborne%20illness"&gt;food poisoning&lt;/a&gt;.

At the Ubay L.G. Cotamura Community Hospital, Dr. Leta Cutamora confirmed 14 fatalities and 35 others under treatment.

Almost 50 students from the San Jose Elementary School were sent to two other hospitals. One of the sellers of the cassava, a middle-aged woman, was also sent to the hospital.

Cassava is a starchy delicacy made from a tropical plant. It is poisonous when raw, and must be prepared properly so it is not converted into cyanide by the human digestive system.

"Some said they took only two bites because it tasted bitter and the effects were felt five to 10 minutes later," said Dr. Harold Garcia, from the Garcia Memorial Provincial Hospital.

A sample of the cassava will be studied at local Crime Laboratory Group, to try and determine what caused the food poisoning. The cassava was deep-fried and caramelized.

The trial of the former Brazilian deputy Hildebrando Pascoal was scheduled to began on March 8 at 8:30 AM in &lt;a href="w%3ABras%C3%ADlia"&gt;Brasília&lt;/a&gt;. However the trial began about an hour later, because Pascoal needed to talk to his lawyer.

Pascoal, the former police officer Reginaldo Rocha de Souza and the alleged drug dealer Alexandre Alves da Silva are in trial because they are accused of murdering the police officer Walter Ayala in September 1997.

There are several other serious accusations against Pascoal, including: dealing with the drug cartel, leading death squads, robbery and political corruption. 

The case was widely discussed in Brazil because a witness (whose identity could not be revealed since its life was in danger) said that Pascoal personally cut off the arms and legs of a man with a chainsaw. Another one told Pascoal killed at least 60 people.

Pascoal says he is innocent and that all the accusations were forged by his enemies: the former Court President of &lt;a href="w%3AAcre"&gt;Acre&lt;/a&gt;, Jersino José da Silva and the Federal Prosecutor, Luiz Francisco de Souza.

Pascoal has been in jail for about 6 years.

<h1>Report urges Kenya to ban plastic bags</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Report%20urges%20Kenya%20to%20ban%20plastic%20bags&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
They are cheap, useful, and very plentiful, and that is exactly the problem, according to researchers. A report issued on Feb. 23 by a cadre of environment and economics researchers suggested that &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; should ban the common plastic bag that one gets at the checkout counter of grocery stores, and place a levy on other plastic bags, all to combat the country's environmental problems stemming from the bags' popularity.

<h2>The trouble with bags</h2>

The new report was a result of work by Kenyan government, the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis. It evaluated the state of waste management in the country with particular attention to plastic bag pollution, and recommended that bags less than 30 microns in thickness be banned, a levy be placed on suppliers of thicker bags, and a number of programs be developed to encourage people in the country to not litter, but to recycle and use alternative or reusable bags for their shopping needs instead.

On one hand, the bags are often better than the alternatives, and are getting better. The Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI) in the United States quotes the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Arizona"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATucson%20Garbage%20Project"&gt;Garbage Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's report that plastics are getting more compact and take up less space in landfills. Plastic bags compare favorably with paper bags which require more energy to produce, generate more waste and burn less cleanly, according to the SPI.

But on the other hand, the bags have gotten so thin as to be barely reusable and recyclable: grocers will frequently double-bag heavy produce, and the bag weighs so little that a great number of bags have to be collected to create an effectively recycled mass of plastic. The light-weight bags are easily picked up by wind, and end up escaping open trash bins and refuse heaps. By littering the landscape, plastic bags become a choking hazard for cattle; in the sea they hurt marine mammals. In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , plastic bags were banned after they were blamed for blocking storm drains and causing flooding. Even if they do enter the landfill successfully, the bags take up to 1000 years to bio-degrade.

Plastic bags in Kenya are an especially acute problem. According to the report, waste management in the country isn't very effective, due partially to a lack of municipal trash pickup in squatter settlements and satellite towns outside the cities' boundaries. Less than 25% of the solid waste generated daily gets processed by a combination of public and private efforts. 

Sometimes plastic bag litter can have even further consequences. According to 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Kenyan Professor Wangari Mathaai, discarded bags fill up with rainwater and become perfect breeding grounds for malaria-bearing mosquitoes. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMalaria"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is Africa's most deadly infectious disease in children, and over 50% of all hospital visits in some areas are malaria-related. Social costs of plastic litter add up as well: countries lacking comprehensive waste management often sprout underground economies of ragpickers &amp;mdash; typically children who wander refuse heaps and collect potentially recyclable materials for sale to shady businessmen operating from official dump sites. The ragpickers in developing countries struggle with plastic bags, preferring thicker materials that require fewer items to be picked up for the same weight.

The problem with bags is that they are victims of their own success: they are so very cheap to manufacture that, at a cost of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 0.01 per bag, retailers often absorb the price of bags into the price of merchandise they sell. This makes the bag appear free to the consumers, who in turn do not value it, and toss the bag away with little reuse. In a vicious circle, the low cost of the bags drives down the amount of material used to manufacture them, creating bags that are flimsy and not easy to reuse.

The report places an emphasis on learning from the successes and failures of other countries' approaches to regulating the plastics industry. Several European countries introduced legislation that deals with plastic bags. In Ireland, a surcharge on plastic bags decreased their use by 90%. A similar move in Denmark saw the bag use drop by 66%. Australia and New Zealand have also considered or implemented some plastics regulation legislation. South Africa's plastic bag problem reached a climax in 2003 &amp;mdash; plastic bags littered the street to such an extent that they earned the nickname "national flower". The country introduced regulations similar to those proposed in Kenya, and within less than a year a reduction in plastic litter was already apparent, according to the report.

The report also recognizes that policies require tradeoffs, and incorporates this into their recommendations. For example, the suggested policy of banning thin bags in favor of thicker ones seems counterintuitive: after all, the thicker ones contain more material that is the cause of the pollution. Furthermore, a ban on thin bags will decimate the industry producing those bags, likely resulting in job losses for Kenyans, as was the case in South Africa when that country introduced similar legislation. However the report notes that this will be offset by increases in production of alternative bags, or in the recycling industry.

<h2>Making plastics</h2>

The manufacture of plastic bags is a sizable industry. In the United States alone the film, sheet, and bag portion of the plastics industry produces more than $26 billion in sales in one year. The sheer number of plastic bags used are staggering, too: in Hong Kong more than a quarter of a billion bags get used every year, in San Francisco over 50 million, and almost 300 million in Kenya. The SPI &amp;mdash; the parent organization of the Film and Bag Federation &amp;mdash; claims that more than 80% of consumers reuse plastic bags as trash can liners or for similar purposes, but that's misleading even when restricted to the United States, as the number of bags used is still very high on a per-capita basis. According to the Worldwatch Institute, an independent environmental organization, Americans throw away 100 billion plastic bags every year, with only 0.6% of the bags being recycled.

The bag manufacturer association in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; the Film and Bag Federation &amp;mdash; appears aware of environmental issues surrounding their products. The Federation's web site explores some environmental concerns, mainly recycling and reuse. But the issue of plastic bag overuse or excessive littering in developing countries is not addressed directly on their site.

Donna Dempsey, the Executive Director of the Film and Bag Federation, said in an email to a Wikinews reporter that "there are better ways in Kenya and other places to reduce the amount of bags used, such as re-educating the grocery bag checker not to double bag products and on the amount of groceries one bag is made to carry". She said that members of the association &amp;mdash; companies in the United States and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; are investing millions of dollars into "bag to bag" recycling programs, which use material from recycled plastic bags to create new plastic bags, as well as programs that buy back recycled bags and turn them into plastic decking.

<h2>Support and opposition</h2>

The government of Kenya has signaled that they support solutions to problems caused by plastic waste. At the opening speech of the UNEP Governing Council/Ministerial Environment Forum on Feb. 21, 2005, Kenya's President &lt;a href="Mwai%20Kibaki"&gt;Mwai Kibaki&lt;/a&gt; said: "In our major cities, plastic bags are used in large quantities at the household level. However, these bags are not disposed of in ways that ensure a clean environment. My country welcomes initiatives to address this problem." 

Prof. Wangari Maathai, who is the country's deputy environment minister, supports the effort from her official position. She promotes the 4-Rs &amp;mdash; Reduce, Recycle, Re-use, Repair &amp;mdash; and encourages the use of locally-made cotton or sisal bags. Yet as the authors of the report write policy action must be fairly swift to be effective, so should the government commit to the report authors' recommendations it will have to quickly match political action with their words of support.

Plastic bag pollution has been a contentious issue with the people of Kenya for a number of years. Six years ago, the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya organized a campaign march to urge the government to regulate the bag producers. But not everyone is optimistic about the plans to regulate plastic bags. Dave Jones from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; believes that the way to control pollution is to have clear policies on land ownership: "No single land owner would allow his property to be polluted by others" he writes in a letter to Kenya's daily newspaper, the Daily Nation. In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after the bag regulations were implemented negative reactions included concerns that the poor already re-used the flimsy bags as source materials in producing home-made items such as hats or purses &amp;mdash; occupations made impossible by the ban.

After the recent killing of &lt;a href="Chechnya"&gt;Chechen&lt;/a&gt; rebel leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAslan%20Maskhadov"&gt;Aslan Maskhadov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , it was not clear who would take his place. His son Anzor Maskhadov, aged 29, has quickly emerged as the most likely candidate to carry on his father's work.

Speaking at his home in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaku"&gt;Baku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Azerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Maskhadov told the &lt;a href="Reuters"&gt;Reuters news agency&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤"I will continue my father's work. I have been in touch with his associates who are living abroad."♡❤ He went on to describe the killing of his father as a ♡❤"terrorist act"♡❤ planned by the &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n authorities.

The Chechnya area of Russia has effectively been at war with Russia for much of the past decade: pro-independence guerrilla groups are faced by Russian regular army and special police forces. Numerous crimes against civilians and human rights infringement incidents reported in the area, involving both Russian army and rebel groups. 

Late President Maskhadov was considered a moderate pro-independence Chechen leader, in contrast with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShamil%20Basayev"&gt;Shamil Basayev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He made numerous negotiations offers, all of them left unanswered by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKremlin"&gt;Kremlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . With Russian forces nominally controlling most of the Chechnya, his ability to control Chechen warlords was being questioned, though he reportedly managed to maintain lateral cease-fire in most parts of Chechnya shortly before his death. 

Maskhadov was the last publicly elected leader of the self-proclaimed Republic of Ichkeria. It's first elected president, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADzhokhar%20Dudayev"&gt;Dzhokhar Dudayev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was killed in the sophisticated special forces operation of Russia's &lt;a href="FSB"&gt;FSB&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s.

Russian state run-media and MPs hailed the killing of Mr. Maskhadov — many believing his rebels were responsible for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeslan%20school%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;Beslan school siege&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoscow%20theater%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;Moscow theater hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2004.

Russian government took the hard-line position against Chechen rebels, denying any negotiations with the rebels after hostage takings and bomb explosions in &lt;a href="Moscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANord-Ost"&gt;Nord-Ost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), downed airliners, hostage taking in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeslan"&gt;Beslan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other terrorist acts attributed to Chechen rebel groups. In many cases, Chechen groups claimed responsibility for these acts. Maskhadov denied any involvement in terrorist acts. According to Russian government's point of view, the war in Chechnya is merely a 'counter-terrorist operation' with an objective to 'restore the constitutional order'.

An international team has extracted and sequenced a &lt;a href="w%3Aprotein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; from a 75,000-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ANeanderthal"&gt;Neanderthal&lt;/a&gt; fossil in research that demonstrates a new method of comparing genetic relationships between organisms.

"This research opens up the possibility of getting detailed protein information from past human populations, to make inferences about the evolution of human diet and physiology," says &lt;a href="http%3A//www.artsci.wustl.edu/~anthro/blurb/b_trink.html"&gt;Erik Trinkaus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wustl.edu/"&gt;Washington University in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;.

The research was led by Trinkaus and colleagues from Washington University in St. Louis and the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.eva.mpg.de/"&gt;Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology&lt;/a&gt; in Leipzig, Germany. 

The oldest fossil human protein ever sequenced, the protein came from a Neanderthal discovered in Shanidar Cave, Iraq.
Protein sequences can be used in a similar way to &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; to provide information on genetic relationships between extinct and living species. 

Since ancient DNA rarely survives, protein sequencing could be used to determine such relationships for very old fossils that no longer contain DNA. 

For their study, Trinkaus and colleagues sequenced the bone protein osteocalcin from a Neanderthal and found that it is the same as that in modern humans. 

The researchers also found big differences in the sequences of Neanderthals, humans, chimpanzees and orangutans from that of gorillas and most other mammals. 

They suggest that this is a dietary response related to an abundance of vitamin C in the diets of herbivores such as gorillas that is absent from the diets of omnivorous primates such as humans and Neanderthals. 

The research is reported in the ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.pnas.org/"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

<h1>Italian PM rejects US version of shooting</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Italian%20PM%20rejects%20US%20version%20of%20shooting&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In his first public speech since the fatal shooting that killed an &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; Intelligence agent in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Italian &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; has rejected the version of events presented by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; administration. 

The intelligence agent, &lt;a href="w%3ANicola%20Calipari"&gt;Nicola Calipari&lt;/a&gt;, was escorting freed hostage, Italian journalist &lt;a href="w%3AGiuliana%20Sgrena"&gt;Giuliana Sgrena&lt;/a&gt;, when their car came under fire by US troops on the journey to &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; airport last week, leaving Nicola Calipari dead and Giuliana Sgrena and another intelligence agent wounded. 

Mr Berlusconi has disputed US claims that the car was speeding and also said that the US military had known of and authorised the car's journey. Berlusconi's speech to parliament comes a day after his Foreign Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AGianfranco%20Fini"&gt;Gianfranco Fini&lt;/a&gt; made a similar speech to lawmakers, where he refuted Ms. Sgrena's claims that the shooting was the result of an ambush. 

The US began their official investigation on March 8, four days after the shooting. The results are yet to be determined.

However in a statement given immediately after the attack by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt;'s 3rd Infantry Division, who controls Baghdad, said that Italian officials had given no advance warning to the US Army of their journey, and that the car was speeding and refused to stop. One Army official stated that the car was traveling over 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour) and almost &lt;a href="w%3AHydroplaning%20%28road%20vehicle%29"&gt;hydroplaned&lt;/a&gt; several times, an assertion that Sgrena herself seemingly corroborated in her article for ♡❤Il Manifesto♡❤.

"The United States has no intention of evading the truth. I'm sure that in a very short time every aspect of this will be clarified." Mr Berlusconi said, describing the shooting as an "accident." Adding that he expected the findings of an investigation into the shooting, being led by a US brigadier general, in cooperation with Italian authorities, to be released in three to four weeks.

Meanwhile the office of Italian President &lt;a href="w%3ACarlo%20Azeglio%20Ciampi"&gt;Carlo Azeglio Ciampi&lt;/a&gt; said that it had received a letter from &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; saying that the shooting was a "terrible tragedy" and that "President Bush assures President Ciampi that the United States will move toward a swift and exhaustive joint investigation."

Recently, the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; and the Italian RAI TGI television released photos of the car after the attack by American soldiers.&lt;a href="http%3A//story.news.yahoo.com/news%3Ftmpl%3Dstory%26amp%3Bu%3D/050308/481/rom17003082010"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//homepage.mac.com/cfj/.Pictures/sgrena-car-ap-2-lg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The pictures show little visible damage to the vehicle. 

Sgrena claims that the American soldiers fired between 300 and 400 rounds at the car from an armoured vehicle. This is disputed by the US military, as a tank or other fighting vehicle would likely have entirely destroyed the car.

In recent days, reports have surfaced that Microsoft may plan to backport its WinFS system to Windows XP.

The technology, intended to track file metadata for better organization and searching capability, had previously only been planned as part of the forthcoming Microsoft Windows Longhorn operating system release.

Support for Windows XP, while surprising, may aid developers in speeding adoption of the new technology in their applications.

The &lt;a href="w%3Acyclone"&gt;cyclone&lt;/a&gt; "Ingrid" will hit the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; later today. "Ingrid" is the strongest cyclone that strike Australia since 1974 when cyclone "Tracy" devastated huge areas, including the city of &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%2C%20Australia"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; on the north coast.

Though "Ingrid" has lost momentum during the last few days and now ranks 4 instead of 5, several communities in north-western Australia have been evacuated, daycare centers have closed and flights and ships are grounded or in port. Even more people might be evacuated to nearby airbases if the situation worsens.

President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20Basescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; today had a half-hour meeting with President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGeorge%20Walker%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a press conference in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AOval%20Office"&gt;Oval Office&lt;/a&gt;, as part of Băsescu's visit to the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUSA"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;. During the press conference, Bush said that Romania was a "special ally" of the United States, as well as "a friend". 

Bush said that he was impressed by Băsescu's high-profile fight against corruption, as well as his vision for consolidating democracy and prosperity in the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; region, an area of strategic concern for the United States. He also acknowledged Romania's support and involvement in the democratisation project in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGeorgia"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMoldova"&gt;the Republic of Moldova&lt;/a&gt;.

Since the 1999 NATO military intervention in Kosovo, Romania has been a key ally for the United States in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASoutheastern%20Europe"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;. It has also been one of the most vocal supporters of the US-led invasion of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, sending over 800 troops and planning to increase its contigent at a time when other countries are pulling out. Băsescu, which has been Romania's president since December 2004, has also signalled his intention of closer ties with the United States, as well as the United Kingdom, by envisioning the creation of a Bucharest-Washington-London axis of co-operation. Băsescu visited Tony Blair in London last month. Ties between the countries are expected to increase as the US moves its military bases from Germany to an area near the town of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConstanta"&gt;Constanţa&lt;/a&gt;, a Black Sea port in Romania.

Before Băsescu's arrival, Bruce Pitcairn Jackson, the president of Project for Transition Democracies, said that Romania and Bulgaria are the "success stories" of Southeastern Europe and that the two cuntries' EU accession, expected in 2007, will significantly increase the prospects of democracy in the Black Sea area.

Analysts also say that, due to the support of the United States and the United Kingdom, Romania will become the most powerful force in Southeastern Europe and a source of democracy and prosperity.

Romania's &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aflat%20tax"&gt;flat tax&lt;/a&gt; rate of 16% on personal income and corporate profits, which went into effect on January 1, 2005, has proved to have a positive effect on Romanian salaries, which increased by 5.2% in the January 2005 in comparison to December 2004. The effect is even larger when compared to January 2004, with net wages increasing by 25.3% and gross wages increasing by 18.8%.

In January 2005, the gross (pre-tax) average monthly salary was 9,514,658 &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomanian%20leu"&gt;lei&lt;/a&gt;, while the net (after-tax) average monthly salary was 7,233,298, which is equal to roughly 200 &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; or US$270.

Romania's flat tax system is one of the most liberal fiscal policies in Europe and was introduced in order to boost spending power and salaries, encourage foreign investment and greater consumer spending.

&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; supermarket chain &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASelgros"&gt;Selgros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cash and Carry has announed that it intends to open two new stores in &lt;a href="Transylvania"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;'s western region, this year. The two new stores will be in the cities of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACluj-Napoca"&gt;Cluj-Napoca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArad"&gt;Arad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , both major Transylvanian centres. The cost of building each store will come to an average of around 15 million &lt;a href="euro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;, with the Cluj-Napoca store scheduled to open first.

This week, Selgros opened its eighth cash-and-carry store in Romania, in the western Transylvanian city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOradea"&gt;Oradea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The chain already operates stores three stores in &lt;a href="Bucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one store each in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrasov"&gt;Braşov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATargu%20Mures"&gt;Târgu Mureş&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConstanta"&gt;Constanţa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATimisoara"&gt;Timişoara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

After Bucharest, Transylvania is Romania's most prosperous region and has therefore been the focus of foreign investment as well as a centre for the operations of foreign companies.

This treaty, which the United States remains within, gives foreign citizens the right to demand that they see a home-country diplomat when detained. The optional protocol, that the United States just left, puts disputes about those rights under the International Court of Justice. 

State Department spokeswoman Darla Jordan said, "The International Court of Justice has interpreted the Vienna Consular Convention in ways that we had not anticipated that involved state criminal prosecutions and the death penalty, effectively asking the court [International Court of Justice] to supervise our domestic criminal system... [Withdrawal from the protocol is a way of] protecting against future International Court of Justice judgments that might similarly interpret the consular convention or disrupt our domestic criminal system in ways we did not anticipate when we joined the convention."

After a week of swirling rumors, Hong Kong's leader Tung Chee-hwa announced at a press conference today at 5:36 p.m. that, "An hour ago, I tendered my resignation as Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to the Central Government." It has not yet been officially accepted by Beijing, though it is likely to pass as a formality.

Though Tung cited health reasons for his decision, it is widely believed he was given the signal to resign by the central government of the People's Republic of China. 

"I am 68, because of long hours, 16 to 18 hours a day has taken toll on my health. The third quarter of last year, I began to feel very exhausted, and my immunity is not as good as it was before. Doctors told me that my health used to be good, but if I work this particular schedule continuously it won't do. Doctors asked me to change lifestyle, if i don't comply, my health will be in decline and will suffer from more exhaustion." 

When asked whether he was pushed out by Beijing, Tung replied, "That is not the case at all. The central government has repeatedly affirmed the work that I and my colleagues of the SAR government have done, so that is not the case at all." 

Tung had become extremely unpopular in the last few years, culminating in a July 1, 2003, rally when over 500,000 people demonstrated against his handling of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the economy and controversial state security provisions. 

With his resignation, chief secretary for administration Donald Tsang will take over as provided by the Basic Law. A special election is required within 120 days according to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance. 

In his final comments, Tung expressed regret in his inability to complete his term because of his poor health. 

"The sense of attachment... with Hong Kong people is enormous, it's just a very special feeling. Its kind of sad to leave."

Blogshine Sunday, a national effort among webloggers to publicize the importance of open access to government information is scheduled to take place on March 13, 2005. 

On that day, &lt;a href="http%3A//freeculture.org"&gt;FreeCulture.org&lt;/a&gt; will organize web-based writers to relate their experiences and thoughts on open-access to governmental records and freely available public information. Webloggers will be encouraged to highlight the need to have public records available in electronic formats to facilitate easier searching of information and more widespread access. Another goal of Blogshine Sunday is to emphasize that open access to governmental information should be granted to everyone, unpaid reporters and bloggers as well as professional journalists. 

Recently, bloggers have played an important role in shaping public opinion about issues that were initially overlooked by traditional media. Freerepublic.com blogger Harry W. MacDougald was the first to scrutinize documents that suggested that President Bush was derelict in his military service in the 1970s. CBS News reported on the documents as if they were legitimate, but MacDougald discovered that the documents used a typestyle that was not available at the time they were supposedly written. Following MacDougald’s blog posts questioning the documents, CBS said that they regretted reporting on the documents as though they were authentic. Since bloggers are generally unpaid and do not have the editorial restrictions of professional journalists, as the MacDougald example illustrates, they are sometimes better able to research and report on issues not covered by traditional media.

Blogshine Sunday is held in conjunction with Sunshine Sunday, when professional journalists and news media will publish articles and editorials on the importance of the open records. Freeculture.org was started last April by two college students in an effort to show that technology can better facilitate public affairs involvement. More information on Blogshine Sunday can be found at: &lt;a href="http%3A//blogshine.org/"&gt;BlogShine.org&lt;/a&gt;

The &lt;a href="w%3Acommunist"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; guerrilla named Omaira Rojas, or Nayibe Rojas Cabrera, or Nayibe Rojas Valderrama, or Sonia was extradited to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The Colombian President &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe%20Velez"&gt;Alvaro Uribe Velez&lt;/a&gt; authorized the extradition requested by a tribunal court in Washington.

The guerrilla was given to &lt;a href="w%3ADrug%20Enforcement%20Administration"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt; officers Wednesday, March 9, at 3:25 p.m. in the airport of &lt;a href="w%3ABarranquilla"&gt;Barranquilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;.

Colombian and American authorities say that Sonia directly negotiates the delivery of narcotics to drug dealers from &lt;a href="w%3APeru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.

Sonia's lawyers said she could not be extradited to the United States since her real name was not determinated. They demanded a revision to the process. The government of Colombia didn't accept the arguments and Uribe signed the authorization for the extradition.

Helsingin Sanomat reports images circulating over the Internet that purport to show male conscripts being sexually abused and humiliated, which turned out to be a prank. They allegedly show conscripts masked and with gas masks over genitals.

In the images, released through Internet forums, soldiers are humiliated by their officers, being forced to act like dogs with other soliders holding their leashes. The &lt;a href="w%3AFinnish%20Defence%20Forces"&gt;Defence Forces&lt;/a&gt; communications director &lt;a href="w%3AOssi%20Kervinen"&gt;Ossi Kervinen&lt;/a&gt; considers the matter unfortunate.

The images are strikingly similar to those that came out of the Abu Ghraib prison last year.

&lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; has a policy of &lt;a href="w%3Aneutrality"&gt;neutrality&lt;/a&gt;, with a requirement of &lt;a href="w%3Aconscription"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt; for all men between the ages of 18-30 for 180 to 362 days. However, they can opt to do &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20service"&gt;civil service&lt;/a&gt; work instead, which lasts 13 months.

The National Congress of &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; refused the resignation of the Bolivian President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Mesa"&gt;Carlos Mesa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The congress members of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) and the Indian Movement Pachakuti didn't support the decision.

The President of Bolivia Carlos Mesa officially resigned last Sunday, March 6. At the occasion he explained his decision saying:
Mesa's resignation was influenced by the pressures of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , both the leader of coca growers (♡❤cocaleros♡❤) and MAS. Morales caused the resignation of the former Bolivian president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada in October 2003.

The MAS resist the efforts of the Bolivian government to eradicate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acoca"&gt;coca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The use of coca is an old tradition of Bolivian Indians, as tea, medicine, and during social events. The cultivation of coca is a financial resource to Bolívia. Bolivia is considered the world's third-largest cultivator of coca, after Colombia and Peru.

However the coca is also the raw material for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Coca products are exported to drug cartels in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as reported by arrested drug dealers.

The MAS is pressuring the government so the new Hydrocarbons Law can be approved. The law aims to raise the taxes levied on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahydrocarbon"&gt;hydrocarbon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; extraction. Mesa said that the law as stated is not viable.

Mesa has the support of part of Bolivian population. According to the analysts Carlos Valverde and Jorge Lazarte, Morales lost credibility with this crisis.

The opinion of Morales is that his public image has not deteriorated. He says that the Bolivian population will continue to support him. He also accuses Mesa of trying to favor the interests of oil companies, contrary to the interests of Bolivia. He announced that he will continue to organize protests against the government.

Labour unions and indigenous groups continue the blockage of roads in Bolivia to express their dissenting opinion against the government.

<h1>Bulgarian government says U.S. killed Bulgarian soldier in 'friendly fire' incident</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bulgarian%20government%20says%20U.S.%20killed%20Bulgarian%20soldier%20in%20%27friendly%20fire%27%20incident&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to Lieutenant Colonel Sevastian Dobrev, a &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt; defense ministry official, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; forces killed a Bulgarian soldier in what the army calls a 'friendly fire' incident in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on March 4. The official, who has direct knowledge of the investigation, told ♡❤Voice of America News♡❤ on Wednesday that Bulgarian military police in Iraq are convinced that 30-year-old Junior Sergeant Gardi Gardev was killed when several American troops opened fire on his convoy.

Dobrev said the shooting took place at night in a desert area, when Bulgarian troops and U.S. forces at a nearby radio post were not able to recognize each other. He said the trouble began after Bulgarian troops stepped out of their armoured vehicles to fix a problem with their communication equipment, about 160 kilometers southeast of Baghdad.

"At that moment one Iraqi car tried to pass them," he explained. "They tried to stop it, but the car did not want to stop. They shot two times in the north direction in that area. A few seconds after that our coalition partners from the United States from this radio post opened fire."

Lieutenant-Colonel Dobrev said two bullets hit machine gunner Gardi Gardev during the incident. He said colleagues tried to revive Sergeant Gardev, while an American helicopter was called in to take him to a hospital.

However, the helicopter did not land and another emergency vehicle arrived too late to save his life. Mr. Dobrev said the inexperience of American forces at the recently built radio post in the area contributed to what the army calls a "friendly fire incident."

"Our guys know exactly where they are deployed on the ground. They signed this place on their maps," he said. "But there was no contact, any kind of contact, between the Bulgarian battalion and the American radio post there."

Mr. Dobrev said Bulgarian and American military officials will meet in Baghdad Saturday to discuss how to improve coordination and the outcome of investigations by Bulgarians and two American teams.

He denied the incident has increased anti-American sentiment in Bulgaria, which is among several Eastern European countries supporting the US-led efforts in Iraq. Bulgaria has a 460-strong battalion in the Iraqi city of Diwaniya, serving under Polish command, and its mandate expires mid-2005.

Bulgarian soldier Gardev, who was buried Tuesday in his home village of Dolno Sahrane, was posthumously awarded the rank of candidate officer and received a medal for his apparent bravery in Iraq.

He died around the same time that American soldiers shot and killed an Italian intelligence agent, while also wounding an Italian journalist the agent had helped to rescue from insurgents. U.S. officials have expressed their regret over both incidents. On March 7, the Bulgarian government stated that Jr. Sgt. Gardi Gardev was killed by U.S. troops. 

Officials from 1st Corps Support Command of the Multi-national Force Iraq are investigating the incident, and have said that they are committed to working with Bulgarian officials to discover what happened.

<h1>United Nations passes Declaration on human cloning</h1>

A divided &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="UN%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; has voted to approve a nonbinding statement against all forms of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20cloning"&gt;human cloning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The vote, held Tuesday, came after four years of debate and an end to attempts for an international ban.

In the 191-nation assembly, there were 84 votes in favor of a nonbinding statement, 34 against and 37 abstentions. 

Proposed by Honduras, the statement was largely supported by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; countries and opposed by countries with active embryonic stem cell research programs. Many &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic nations abstained.

The ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Declaration%20on%20Human%20Cloning"&gt;UN Declaration on Human Cloning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, as it is named, calls for all member states to adopt a ban on human cloning, which it says is "incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life."

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which has long pushed for a complete ban, voted in favor of the statement while traditional ally &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atherapeutic%20cloning"&gt;therapeutic cloning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is legal and regulated, voted against it.

The statement should have no impact on countries that allow therapeutic cloning, such as Britain and South Korea, as it is not legally binding.

"The foes of therapeutic cloning are trying to portray this as a victory for their ideology," Bernard Siegel, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; attorney who lobbies to defend therapeutic cloning, said in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; report. "But this confusing declaration is an effort to mask their failure last November to impose a treaty on the world banning therapeutic cloning."

The Joint Assessment Mission between the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; released on March 9, 2005, a plan for the development of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; over the six years remaining between January's peace agreement and the vote in 2011, in which southern Sudan will decide whether to break away from the north. The plan, titled "Framework for Sustained Peace, Development and Poverty Eradication in Sudan," describes two phases, the first through 2007, the second through mid-2008. The first phase will focus on emergencies and the repatriation of refugees, while the second will consist of "major infrastructural programs", according to the Sudan Tribune.

While the majority of the $7.8 billion needed for the development described in the plan will come from sources within the country, the plan asks for $2.66 billion from other countries. According to Reuters, the UN's Joint National Transition Team will hold a conference to ask for money in Norway in April.

China's first private airline &lt;a href="w%3AOkay%20Airlines"&gt;Okay Airlines&lt;/a&gt; (奥凯航空 Aòkǎi Hángkōng) took off on its maiden flight today from Tianjin (200km north of Beijing) to Changsha (in Hunan province, central China) to Kunming (in Yunnan province).

The airline tried to start last Saturday, but it had problems with the paperwork from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). The price of a ticket was CNY 1,180 (US$ 143), but customers for the first flight got a 40% discount.

According to China Daily, three more private airlines will exist: Shanghai-based ♡❤Spring International Airlines♡❤, Chengdu-based ♡❤Eagle Airlines♡❤, and Gansu province-based ♡❤Huaxia Airlines♡❤.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC's&lt;/a&gt; political debate show &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time%20%28television%29"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt; aired a special edition from &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. This was the first time that a political show from the West was made in China. The show was broadcast on &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20One"&gt;BBC One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20World"&gt;BBC World&lt;/a&gt;; however, it wasn't shown in China, as a condition of the programme amid fears that it would be inflammatory and present negative views of the government.

The panel contained the Chinese politician &lt;a href="w%3ALiu%20Jianchao"&gt;Liu Jianchao&lt;/a&gt;,who is the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman and &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Yongtu"&gt;Long Yongtu&lt;/a&gt; who is General Secretary for the &lt;a href="w%3ABoao%20Forum"&gt;Boao Forum&lt;/a&gt; for Asia, together with &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Patten"&gt;Chris Patten&lt;/a&gt;, the last Governor of Hong Kong, &lt;a href="w%3AIsobel%20Hilton"&gt;Isobel Hilton&lt;/a&gt;, a writer who has a large knowledge of China &amp; &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Tang"&gt;David Tang&lt;/a&gt;, fashion designer.

The audience contained a mixture of Chinese and Westerners together with people invited by the government. The questions concerned, among other things, the next chief-executive of Hong Kong, China's attitudes toward Taiwan, whether China has growing problems concerning spoilt children, the growing human rights question, and whether China will economically overtake America in 20 years time.

Many members of the audience liked the show and hoped a similar show will be broadcast in China, in a few years time. The program, which was part of a week-long BBC focus on China, was hailed as a sign that China was becoming more liberal and accommodating to Western media presence and involvement in China.

Many infertile American women would choose the sex of their next child if given the option.

A survey of 561 women being treated for infertility has found that 41% would use &lt;a href="w%3Asex%20selection"&gt;sex selection&lt;/a&gt; if it were offered at no cost. 

Contradicting fears that such sex selection would cause gender imbalance, the survey found that women with no children would choose baby girls and boys in approximately equal numbers.

Furthermore, women with only daughters wanted to select a male child while women with only sons wanted to select a female child.

"Sex selection is a topic that's almost taboo for physicians to talk about," says study lead author &lt;a href="http%3A//www.obgyn.uic.edu/staff/tjain/tjain.htm"&gt;Tarun Jain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.uic.edu/"&gt;University of Illinois at Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. "Prior to this study, there has been no data to indicate what the demand might be."

Of 561 survey respondents, 229 would want to select the sex of their future child. 

Among these, 45% had no children and 48% had children of all the same sex. 

Half would choose to select the sex of their next child even if they had to bear the cost. 

About 55% would choose sperm separation, 41% would choose preimplantation genetic diagnosis and 4% would choose neither.

Sex selection is controversial. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.acog.org/"&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; opposes it for nonmedical reasons and so does the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.figo.org/"&gt;International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics&lt;/a&gt;. 

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.asrm.org/"&gt;American Society of Reproductive Medicine&lt;/a&gt; supports it for nonmedical reasons for family gender balancing provided methods used are safe and effective. 

"As the techniques gain more popularity, physicians will have to decide if they will offer the procedure to patients with and without children," says Jain.

The research is reported in the journal ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.asrm.org/Professionals/Fertility%26amp%3BSterility/fspage.html"&gt;Fertility and Sterility&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

An angry Judge Rodney S. Melville threatened to issue a &lt;a href="w%3Abench%20warrant"&gt;bench warrant&lt;/a&gt; for the arrest of world famous pop singer &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; if he failed to appear at the &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Barbara"&gt;Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt; County Superior Court in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; Thursday Jan. 10, 2005. Jackson is under indictment there on seven counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under 14, and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent. Jackson, held briefly under the threat of jail by authorities on Nov. 20, 2003 when charges brought against him were formalized, gained his freedom later that day by posting a $3 million bail.

Judge Melville, apparently frustrated with Jackson who had in two earlier instances caused delays in his court room, issued the warrant just 5 minutes after noting the singer’s conspicuous absence at the scheduled 8:30 a.m. proceedings. Jackson's defense lawyer, Tom Mersereau Jr., advised the judge that Jackson awoke earlier that morning with severe back pain and was under treatment at an area hospital at the time. The judge moved to give the celebrity one hour to appear or face arrest for contempt of court.

As word of the warrant threat traveled to the large news presence gathered outside, a media countdown began. During the countdown, live televised reports recounted how Jackson had arrived for court 20 minutes late on his own arraignment for these charges, only to be met by a stern lecture from Judge Melville for that transgression. There was also another occasion where Jackson, while recovering from &lt;a href="w%3Aflu"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; symptoms, delayed the trial's jury selection for a week until he was well enough to return. The glaringly clear message sent by the judge was: bad back or not, Jackson was to appear in court! And fast! Only the televised scene of Jackson's expectant defense lawyer Mersereau with his assistant Susan Yu, both busy on cells phones while tensely waiting curbside beside the court house for the Jackson motorcade, seemed to undermine a feeling that Jackson would make it in time to avoid having his bail revoked.

As the deadline came and passed without Jackson’s arrival, live reports were busy with speculation on the superstar persona of Michael Jackson then taking on newer aspects of super-bizarre. But Jackson’s flair for tardiness showed itself with an arrival that was a mere 3 minutes after the judge was being forced to make good on his threat. Dressed in a blue blazer over a light weight undershirt, the star's recent departure from the hospital was evident by the pajama bottom pants and open-heeled bedroom slippers he wore into the court room.

Jackson had the assistance of his father and a body guard at each side to keep him steady as he gingerly walked into the Santa Maria court house. He listed slightly to the right and kept a fixed, distant face that was surrounded by uncombed strands of his long hair. The summons issued by the judge forced Jackson from his hospital bed to show the world he was not above the law. 

In private chambers, Judge Melville met with both the prosecution lawyer, Tom Sneddon, and Jackson’s defense lawyer to verify the defendant’s claims of back pain. After re-taking the bench in the court room, the judge announced to the jury they would proceed with the docket as planned. Mr. Jackson narrowly escaped prison, and the trial would continue where it left off on the previous day with direct testimony from the now 15 year old boy who accuses him.

After an unprecedented thirty hour debate in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; between the elected government and the main opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APrevention%20of%20Terrorism%20Bill"&gt;Prevention of Terrorism Bill&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was passed by the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Lords"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;. 

Despite the new legislation being passed, the Conservative leader &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Howard"&gt;Michael Howard&lt;/a&gt; claimed victory, as the Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, made a last minute compromise on several details of the bill.

The lengthy debate was the third longest in the history of the House of Lords. The new bill will replace the current &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-terrorism%2C%20Crime%20and%20Security%20Act%202001"&gt;Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001&lt;/a&gt;

The Italian dailies La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera are reporting that US forces may not have been informed of the operation to rescue kidnapped Italian journalist, Giuliana Sgrena, in which the intelligence agent Nicola Calipari was killed by US troops.

The Italian government disputes this account, and has said that the US was fully aware of the operation on March 4.

La Repubblica is reporting that US forces were aware of Italian intelligence agent Nicola Calipari's presence, but not the specific details of his mission.

Speaking in the La Repubblica newspaper, General Mario Marioli assisted those involved in the operation in Baghdad, by obtaining a special badge for them from coalition forces upon their arrival. 

However, as the deputy commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, Marioli reported that he was unaware of Calipari's purpose in Iraq, so he could not tell coalition troops on the ground the details of the Italian mission.

According to La Repubblica, Marioli reported that he "had no contact with US intelligence officers" prior to the shooting.

Early turnout for the two &lt;a href="w%3ABy-election"&gt;by-elections&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; today was between 20% and 30%.

The two elections in the &lt;a href="w%3AMeath"&gt;Meath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKildare"&gt;Kildare North&lt;/a&gt; constituencies are taking place to elect two new &lt;a href="w%3ATD%20%28parliament%29"&gt;TD's&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ADail"&gt;Dail&lt;/a&gt; after the two former representatives; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Bruton"&gt;John Bruton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20McCreevy"&gt;Charlie McCreevy&lt;/a&gt;, took up posts in the &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;.

A large number of votes was expected in the last hour of voting, as commuters returned home from &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;. Polling started at 9am and ended at 10pm. 

The votes will be counted beginning at 9am in Naas and Navan.

A defendant on trial for &lt;a href="w%3Arape"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; reportedly stole a deputy sheriff's handgun and used it to shoot the judge, court reporter, and two deputies Friday morning. Three people were killed and one was wounded.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge &lt;a href="w%3ARowland%20Barnes"&gt;Rowland W. Barnes&lt;/a&gt; has been confirmed dead along with the court reporter and one of the deputies. After the shootings, the suspect reportedly attempted to carjack several cars in a bid to escape. He attempted to carjack a green Honda Accord with license plate 6584-YN, from a newspaper reporter, but eventually fled by other means. The reporter in question, Don O'Briant from the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Journal-Constitution"&gt;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, was beaten by the suspect but was fortunate to receive only cuts to his face and a broken face from a fall.

The car was listed as being used by the suspect in public alerts across the area before it was realised that the car was in fact still in the garage of the courthouse.

The suspect has been identified as &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Nichols"&gt;Brian Nichols&lt;/a&gt;, 34, who was facing a retrial for rape and kidnapping after the first trial ended with a &lt;a href="w%3Ahung%20jury"&gt;hung jury&lt;/a&gt;. Police are desperately searching for Nichols, as he is considered armed and dangerous.

The suspect reportedly stole the handgun by overpowering a deputy sheriff while he was being taken into the courtroom by the deputy, said Assistant Police Chief &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Dreher"&gt;Alan Dreher&lt;/a&gt;. He then shot and critically wounded the female deputy, went to the courtroom where his trial was due to take place, and held about a dozen people at bay there before killing the judge and court reporter. He later shot and killed another deputy outside.

The deputy from whom Nichols stole the handgun is now sedated and in critical condition after surgery and has a bruise in her brain, according to Jeffrey Salomone, an attending trauma surgeon at Grady Memorial Hospital. Although she was shot in the head, the bullet did not penetrate her skull, said Salomone.

<h1>Garry Kasparov retires from professional chess</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Garry%20Kasparov%20retires%20from%20professional%20chess&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

"&lt;a href="w%3AChess"&gt;Chess&lt;/a&gt; is life in miniature. Chess is battles, chess is struggles." said the longtime world champion &lt;a href="w%3AGarry%20Kasparov"&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/a&gt; at the height of his career. In a surprise announcement Friday, the grandmaster said he will retire. He went public with his intentions from &lt;a href="w%3ALinnares"&gt;Linnares&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; after winning a prestigious tournament there. The news comes as Kasparov, now 41, declared an ambition to devote his energy into the &lt;a href="w%3Apolitics"&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt; of his native &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.

Alternately known as brash, emotional and brilliant, the maverick Kasparov could be a formidable opponent in the realm of politics. He will partner with the Russian group known as the Committee 2008 (Komitet 2008), whose members are attempting to influence the 2008 Russian election that will replace &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt;. The champion said he also wants to write books, with chess being among the subjects, but he will not play any more at the professional level.

Always mercurial in defeat, Kasparov lost his final game in tournament play in a stunning upset by &lt;a href="w%3AVeselin%20Topalov"&gt;Veselin Topalov&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;. The upset did not take away his victory at the tournament, but his announcement came after being bitterly stung in defeat. 

At age 22, Kasparov became the youngest person ever to hold the title of world champion when he won it from fellow Russian, Anatoly Karpov, in 1985. The two players dominated the field until infighting in 1993 caused Kasparov to break away from the &lt;a href="w%3AF%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20des%20%C3%89checs"&gt;w:Fédération Internationale des Échecs&lt;/a&gt; (FIDE) and form the &lt;a href="w%3AProfessional%20Chess%20Association"&gt;Professional Chess Association&lt;/a&gt; (PCA). In this forum he defeated &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; challenger &lt;a href="w%3ANigel%20Short"&gt;Nigel Short&lt;/a&gt;. For a period of time, Kasparov, of the PCA, and Karpov, who reclaimed the top spot of the FIDE, both claimed to be world champions. However, the ratings system developed by FIDE held that Kasparov was the stronger player. The PCA eventually fell apart in 1995.
In 1996, Kasparov was at the top of his game, when a team led by &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; introduced &lt;a href="w%3ADeep%20Blue"&gt;Deep Blue&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest of a new class of chess playing computers. In a highly publicized face-off of man vs. machine, Kasparov won the 6 game match. A year later, against an enhanced version of Deep Blue, he lost. He blamed the loss on a variety of factors, including fatigue against his tireless opponent.

While the machine found a new place in the chess world, and while a new generation of chess players favored ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aspeed%20chess"&gt;speed chess&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, where the fast pace of play does not allow for deep calculation, Kasparov turned his attention to taking on the world.
The Kasparov vs. the World online chess game in &lt;a href="w%3A1999"&gt;June 1999&lt;/a&gt; brought together chess players from around the world in a cooperative effort to beat the reigning world champion. With more than 50,000 individuals submitting move votes, Kasparov vs. the World was one of the largest interactive gaming events in history. Kasparov won this match.

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALockheed-Martin"&gt;Lockheed-Martin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; built &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlas%20%28rocket%29"&gt;Atlas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; V launch vehicle, successfully launched from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral"&gt;Cape Canaveral&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at 21:42 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (4:42 p.m. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Standard%20Time"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). It placed the Inmarsat 4 F-1 communications satellite into orbit. This was Lockheed-Martin's second try to launch the satellite. Yesterday's attempt ended in a scrub when the flight control computer passed a red-line with less than three minutes remaining in the countdown.

This was the fifth launch of the Atlas V vehicle, and the first launch where the rocket used three of the first stage, Aerojet built, solid rocket motors. It also had the narrower 4 meter payload fairing. 

For the first part of the flight, the rocket was powered by a common booster core with two RD-180 rocket engines plus three solid rocket motors. When their fuel was expended the solid rocket motors burned out and were jettisoned. 

The common booster core then continued pushing the payload and upper stage, with its two RD-180 engines producing 806,000lbf of thrust. The common booster core expended its fuel around four and a half minutes into the flight. At this point the first stage common booster core separated from the upper stage and payload.

After the stage separation, the Centaur upper stage started its engine and burned for nearly ten minutes. During this burn, the payload fairing separated from the spacecraft, leaving the satellite exposed on the nose of the rocket in the vacuum of space. When the ten minute burn was up, the Centaur coasted with the satellite for another ten minutes waiting to get to the optimal point for the final burn. At around 24 minutes into the flight, the final burn of the Centaur stage occurred, placing the spacecraft in a super-synchronous transfer orbit. After this burn was complete, the Centaur separated, leaving the spacecraft on its own. 

Now the spacecraft must attempt to open its solar arrays and place itself in the final &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ageostationary%20orbit"&gt;geostationary orbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Because of this special type of orbit, where the spacecraft goes around once every 24 hours, the satellite will appear to sit in one place over the equator. From this location, Inmarsat will use it to provide BGAN (Broadband Global Area Network) which is a 3G compatible, 432kbit/s data service, to much of the world. 

The Atlas vehicle was rolled out of its vertical integration facility 1800 feet from the launch pad early yesterday morning (before the first launch attempt). The reason for this launch day move is because of the clean pad concept. 

Past American rockets (with the exception of the Saturns and Space Shuttles) have always been assembled on the launch pad. In the case of a delay in launching, this would cause delays in all the rockets that needed to be launched after the one that experienced the delay. With the new clean pad concept, rockets can be assembled and checked out before being moved to the pad, saving delays in the schedule. 

The launch tower and rocket move out to the pad along a set of railroad tracks, making the 1800 foot journey in approximately half an hour, topping out around two miles per hour. 

Because of the clean pad concept, none of the launch control electronics or spacecraft environmental systems are on the pad. Instead, they are run along the railroad tracks with the rocket as it moves to the pad on launch day. When they get there, they slide into concrete enclosures so that they are not destroyed during the rocket launch.

During the trial of a man yesterday for rape at an &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; court house, the man on trial allegedly stole the gun of a nearby deputy and shot dead the Judge, a reporter and another deputy. The suspect, &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Nichols"&gt;Brian Nichols&lt;/a&gt; aged 33, was at court for the fourth day of his trial for numerous charges filed by a former girlfriend. Nichols was being tried a second time after his first trial ended in a hung jury (8-4 for acquittal).

After fleeing the court house Atlanta police assumed he drove away in the reporters car and issued a nation wide "look out" for the vehicle. The car was found later parked in the courthouse garage. He is still at large, and a massive police hunt is under way. The prior day to the incident, Mr. Nichols was found to have two handmade knives hidden in his shoes. Georgia prisoners often make "shanks" to try to fend off gang rapes while in custody.

There is a bounty of $60,000 for any information leading to Mr. Nichols' re-capture.

&lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – 
The mother of Brazilian soccer player &lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Fabiano"&gt;Luis Fabiano&lt;/a&gt; has been kidnapped. According to the television channel TV ESPN Brasil, the kidnapping occurred Friday, March 11, by morning in Ponte Preta district, &lt;a href="w%3ACampinas"&gt;Campinas&lt;/a&gt;,   ( mi) of &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;.

The police are not giving too many details, and a great part of local media is not reporting the case, afraid of putting the life of Fabiano's mother at risk.

This is the third kidnapping of a soccer player's mother in four months. On February 23, Ilma de Castro Libânio, 51, the mother of the Brazilian soccer player Edinaldo Batista Libânio, 25, known as &lt;a href="w%3AGrafite"&gt;Grafite&lt;/a&gt; was kidnapped. 

On November 6, 2004, the mother of Robson dos Santos, or &lt;a href="w%3ARobinho"&gt;Robinho&lt;/a&gt;, was kidnapped.

In both cases, the hostages were released and they are well, and the police arrested the suspects.

&lt;a href="w%3AJetsgo"&gt;Jetsgo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada's&lt;/a&gt; third largest airline, has ceased all operations because of spiralling oil prices and a federal safety investigation. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ALow-cost%20carrier"&gt;low-cost carrier&lt;/a&gt; had been expanding rapidly in recent months, having added four new routes in December alone. However, the sharp increase in oil prices has forced the airline to ground all flights. The airline, which has 1,200 employees and 29 planes, lost C$55 million (US$49 million) in the past 8 months alone.

The move has stranded over 17,000 passengers across its routes. A spokesperson from Canada's transport department commented, "They'd grown too fast and it was putting strains on senior management."

No arrangements were made with Air Canada or other airlines to take care of their customers. The Air Canada web site stated that "no arrangements were made by Jetsgo that would enable Air Canada to accept Jetsgo tickets."

<h1>US Senate passes new bankruptcy bill</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Senate%20passes%20new%20bankruptcy%20bill&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In a vote of 74-25 last Thursday, the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; passed a measure that would change &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; laws, making it harder for individuals seeking relief from their debt burden to avoid repayment. Almost twenty &lt;a href="United%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; joined &lt;a href="United%20States%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, who currently hold a majority of the seats in the US Senate, in passing the bill.

Lobbyists for credit card companies and financial services firms have worked for the bill during the last two administrations. A similar measure passed both the Senate and &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; during the previous administration, but then President &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apocket%20veto"&gt;pocket-vetoed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the measure in 2000.

<h3>Amendments defeated</h3>
&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; sought to soften the bill by allowing bankruptcy filers to negotiate directly with lenders for relief, but the amendments were defeated by the Republican-controlled Senate. Proponents of the bill claim the rise of bankruptcy filings to nearly 1.5 million a year shows that abusers of credit use the filings to shield themselves from irresponsible practices.

"There has been an explosion of bankruptcy," said &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; Sen. &lt;a href="Charles%20Grassley"&gt;Charles E. Grassley&lt;/a&gt;, the bill's sponsor. "We preserve the principle of a fresh start, but we also establish a principle that if you have the ability to repay some of your debt, you are not going to get off scot-free." However, &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; Democratic Sen., &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Kennedy"&gt;Edward M. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said, "This legislation makes the bankruptcy courts of the United States the collection agency for the credit-card industry." 

The bill impacts a broad spectrum of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; law, but the most significant impact is on personal bankruptcy filings. Individuals who get behind in repaying credit card debt face high interest charges and stiff late payment fees. By only meeting minimum payment requirements, borrowers remit to the lender over the life of the loan an amount in interest and other fees that can far exceed the value of the principal balance of the loan. This can put consumers who run up high balances on various cards at financial risk of default. Critics of the bill blame these aggressive lending practices as a contributing factor in the rising trend of bankruptcy filings from 1996.

<h3>Debt from medical bills also affected</h3>
The proposed bill doesn't only affect debtors with credit card debt.

It also affects debtors who have run up large medical bills.

Patients with a past medical history that disqualifies them from full medical coverage, can easily find themselves facing insurmountable medical bills after just a short stay in the hospital. These individuals will no longer be able to get a fresh start after these personal disasters, and will be forced to live in poverty until they can pay off their medical bills as part of their Chapter 13 filing. (Prior to this bill, they would have been able to file Chapter 7, completely discharging their debt.)

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChapter%207"&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which accounts for 70% of bankruptcy filings, allows individuals to eliminate most non-secured debts after liquidating assets, with the notable exemption of one's principle residence in most states. The Senate passed bill would change Chapter 7 eligibility by applying a means-test, where those with a median income higher than the state average would be required to file under &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChapter%2013"&gt;Chapter 13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; provisions. Under Chapter 13 protection, an individual's debt is not forgiven; rather it is restructured for payment under more lenient terms.
<h3>Attorney client privilege and insurance affected</h3>
This was the first major overhaul of federal bankruptcy law in many years.

Under the old bankruptcy law, a personal bankruptcy attorney could not be held financially responsible for his clients mendacity. Under the new bankruptcy law, the bankruptcy attorney is responsible for his client's lies to the Court about his assets and the bankruptcy attorney and his insurance carrier can be held responsible by the Bankruptcy Court.

The result is that personal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; attorneys (this does not apply to corporate bankruptcy attorneys) are likely to flee the personal bankruptcy field when the new law takes effect. Their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainsurance"&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; companies will not offer the sort of coverage that they would need to continue to practice. 

So when consumers need to file personal bankruptcy under the new law, they will be unlikely to find a bankruptcy attorney to represent them. Consumers will have to file pro se: such consumers will be likely to fail due to the complexity of the law.

The bottom line is that the field of personal bankruptcy law as a practice area of law will cease to exist when the new bankruptcy law takes effect, and consumers will be unable to secure legal counsel and so consumers will lose what legal protections counsel now affords them.

<h3>Prison population affected</h3>

Under the new bankruptcy law about one half million Americans will be forest to pay for at lest 5 years on longer they will be held in servitude as chattel they will be completely subservient to a dominating influence of the company that holds the loan. Their loan will be put on the market for sale for profit. The people will be forced to work harder. People who fail to go to court will have a arrest warrant made out in their name and people who refuse
to pay. They will be subject to fines and or jail. About fifty thousand Americans will punished by a fine and or about three 
thousand Americans every year will go to jail under the new bankruptcy law. For some people this will be a third strike they will be put in jail for life.

<h3>House vote up next</h3>
The bill has the support of President Bush, and its passage in the House sometime next month seems likely. If enacted into law, lending companies will recover more money on what otherwise would be written off as bad loans. Those persons of median and higher income seeking relief would be required to file under Chapter 13 status and pay up to $100 per month under court imposed conditions. It is expected the proposed changes would cause a sharp increase in filings before the new law could take effect.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; Islamic Commission &amp;mdash; who is the guideline of the Islamic religion in &lt;a href="w%3AIberian%20peninsula"&gt;Iberian&lt;/a&gt; territory &amp;mdash; announced a religious decree (fatwa) against the Saudi terrorist &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20Bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama Bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;, for whom the religion urges the expulsion of the Islamic creed because of his criminal intentions and continuing to hide his violence and terrorist acts behind and within the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; religion. Islam advocates peace and brotherhood.

The Commission Secretary Mansur Escudero says that Bin Laden represents not only a danger for the Spanish society in general, but also for the Umma (Islamic community) for using the message of Muhammed with harmful intentions. The decree also extends to the members of the terrorist network &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. According to the sentence they should not be considered as &lt;a href="w%3AMuslims"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; anymore, but as apostates, according to Sharia (canonical law).

While Spanish Muslims show solidarity with the victims of &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11&lt;/a&gt; during their usual meetings inside mosques, at the same time &lt;a href="w%3A%20Al%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda's&lt;/a&gt; radical arm in Iraq urges to do more terrorist attacks against American targets and against the European countries established in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; since April, 2003. The Islamic group supporting &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20Bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama Bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; is the Wahhabi sect, headquartered in Saudi Arabia and principally funded by Saudi princes. The Wahhabis are found in many other nations.

A British boy has been ordered to be detained for life for the rape of his teacher. He was just twelve years old when he attacked the teacher in County Durham last November.

The Crown Court heard that the boy had attacked the female teacher after a one-to-one session, and then drove the teacher's car away from the scene before abandoning it thirty miles away.

The boy, who also suffers from learning difficulties, admitted to the rape in court.

The defence told the court how the boy had been the victim of sexual abuse since he was very young. At just three and a half, concerns had been raised over his 'sexualised' behaviour. By four, he had been encouraged to experiment with alcohol and cigarettes. 

But judge Mr Justice Grigson told the boy: "Despite your very young age, it is quite clear that you knew what you were doing." 

The judge told the boy that he must serve at least 21 months of his sentence but will most likely be behind bars for much longer. He will also be on Britain's Sex Offender Register for all of his life.

The agencies which should have protected the boy in his early life have launched an enquiry into their failings.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt; federal police arrested Jesse James Hollywood, aged 25, in Saquarema city, &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro%20%28state%29"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;, on March 8.

James had been sought by the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; for more than four years.

According to the police, he was living in Saquarema with a woman who is pregnant. His arrest occurred while they were in a mall.

James was deported to the United States for trial. The two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty.

On Friday, James appeared in a &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Barbara"&gt;Santa Barbara, California&lt;/a&gt; court for arraignment on charges of kidnapping and murdering a 15-year-old boy.

James will plead not guilty, according to his attorney, James E. Blatt.

Blatt also criticized the portrait prosecutors had painted of his client.

"Have you ever seen a 20 year-old mastermind? He was not the shooter. He was not at the scene," said Blatt.

Blatt requested that the trial be continued on April 4.

The suspect in the triple murder at a courthouse in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday surrendered to police after holding a woman hostage in her apartment overnight.

Police believe the suspect, Brian Nichols, may also have killed a &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection"&gt;U.S. Immigration and Customs&lt;/a&gt; agent as he fled to the suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ADuluth%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Duluth&lt;/a&gt; northeast of the city. It is unclear whether the hostage ended her ordeal with Nichols by escaping, or was simply let go, when she reported the incident to the &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt; emergency service.

A multi-agency manhunt for the suspect ended this afternoon with a &lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; team surrounding the apartment of the former hostage. Nichols was able to watch events as they unfolded outside the apartment on the television of his former hostage. Charles Walters, Gwinnett County police chief, said Nichols "literally waved a &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20flag"&gt;white flag&lt;/a&gt; or a T-shirt and came out to our folks."

The body of federal agent David Wilhelm was found shot to death hours earlier about 15 miles from the scene of the arrest. Police have not directly linked Nichols to the murder, but note that the victim’s pickup truck, badge and pistol were missing.

Vernon Keenan, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said of the woman who was held hostage, "It’s my understanding that he had told her, 'If you do what I say, I won’t kill you.'"

Nichols has been taken into federal custody. The ATF announced that they have charged him with possession of a firearm by a person under indictment, while they prepare to file additional charges.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Brazilian plastic artist Alexandre Linhares has written and is producing a 75 minutes play titled ♡❤Jesus pra Cristo♡❤ (Jesus for Christ), containing &lt;a href="w%3Ahomosexual"&gt;homosexual&lt;/a&gt; themes and inspired by the &lt;a href="w%3Arock%20opera"&gt;rock opera&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJesus%20Christ%20Superstar"&gt;Jesus Christ Superstar&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ by &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Rice"&gt;Tim Rice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Lloyd%20Webber"&gt;Andrew Lloyd Webber&lt;/a&gt;. 

In the play, &lt;a href="w%3AMary%2C%20the%20mother%20of%20Jesus"&gt;Mary, the mother of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="w%3Atransexual"&gt;transexual&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJesus"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="w%3Apunk"&gt;punk&lt;/a&gt; revolting against the society, &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Magdalene"&gt;Mary Magdalene&lt;/a&gt; is a drug dealer, prostitute and homosexual, &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20James%20the%20Less"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; positive and homosexual. The cast includes homosexual and transexual actors.

The plot begins with a 15 years old transexual (Mary) who sees a angel announcing she will conceive the Savior of the World. Later, Jesus begins to do miracles during World War III. Followers go after him. Jesus is charged with anarchism and condemned to death. 

Alexandre Linhares, the author, tells how the play idea was born:

The play is scheduled to open March, 18, as part of the Theater Festival of &lt;a href="w%3ACuritiba"&gt;Curitiba&lt;/a&gt;.

A bright object was seen falling over the night sky across the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Northwest"&gt;Pacific Northwest&lt;/a&gt;, at about 7:45 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;Pacific time&lt;/a&gt; March 12. Eyewitnesses from as far south as Northern &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and as far north as &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; reported seeing the object falling in the western sky.

“The object began as a small white dot roughly the brightness of a planet, and quickly became a brilliant blue-green color with a long spark-like tail of yellow specks. From my vantage in &lt;a href="w%3APortland%2C%20Oregon%23Southeast"&gt;Southeast Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt; it moved roughly from south to north and at a 45-degree angle downwards through the sky. I also saw two flashes of white light as the object disappeared behind the hills on the west bank of the &lt;a href="w%3AWillamette%20River"&gt;Willamette River&lt;/a&gt;,” reported Wikinews contributor .

It is not known if the object impacted, but it was witnessed to fall over the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.

The last reported &lt;a href="w%3Ameteor"&gt;meteor&lt;/a&gt; impact in the &lt;a href="w%3AOregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; area happened in May 1981.

After a French dominated first half, Ireland had a glimmer of hope as &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20O%27Driscoll"&gt;Brian O'Driscoll&lt;/a&gt; managed to get a try almost from nothing mid-way through the second half, sadly for the homeside, it wasn't enough as France responded with a second try to take them to 26 ponits.

A rather unimpressive &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; side narrowly beat an even less impressive &lt;a href="w%3AWestmeath"&gt;Westmeath&lt;/a&gt; side last night in front of a capacity (10,000) crowd at Dublin's Parnell Park to bag two points in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaelic%20football"&gt;Allianz NFL Division 1A&lt;/a&gt; match.

The first half included a succession of poor wides by Dublin's forwards, but Westmeath failed to capitalise on the mistakes of their opponents, finishing the half with just three points.

The second half was a slightly better contest with a sudden burst of energy by the Westmeath forwards producing several points to bring the game back to level pegging at 0-8 to 0-8. However with several chances squandered and consistently poor passing, Westmeath fell two points behind in the final few minutes of the game.

The future of grocery shopping has changed in the &lt;a href="w%3APalatinate"&gt;Palatinate&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Last November, the Edeka supermarket chain offered in one of its Rülzheim stores &lt;a href="w%3ABiometrics"&gt;fingerprint identification&lt;/a&gt; as method of payment. Customers can have their fingerprint put on file and begin using the system as an alternative to cash or card. Customers then place their finger on the scanner to complete a purchase.

The supermarket owner Roland Fitterer claims the system shaves 40 seconds off checkout time and plans to introduce it into his other 5 stores.

Internet and biometrics services provider, it-Werke, is the technology company behind the effort. The supermarket is their third client to adopt what it-Werke calls its digiPROOF technology.
There was sufficient interest among store customers that 100 registered to use the system. The chances are one in 220 million that two people have the same fingerprint.

A Russian helicopter crash near &lt;a href="w%3AGrozny"&gt;Grozny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt; killed 15 of the 16 servicemen aboard, leaving one seriously injured. The &lt;a href="w%3AMi-8"&gt;Mi-8&lt;/a&gt; helicopter hit a power line before bursting into flames when it struck the ground on Thurs March 10.

Video footage of the scene was broadcast by NTY television. Early speculation that the crash was the result of hostile fire seems doubtful at this time. Investigators were able to recover the &lt;a href="w%3AFlight%20recorder"&gt;flight recorder&lt;/a&gt; to help establish the cause of the crash. Russia has lost helicopters due to ground fire in the Chehnyan region in the past, but pilot error or malfunctions have also been to blame.

Interfax quoted a source within the Russian military as saying the helicopter was transporting 7 intelligence officers being sent into the region for “anti-terorist activities”.

UN special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen said in a telephone interview Saturday from &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; that Syrian President &lt;a href="w%3ABashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt; made "a firm commitment" for a two-stage pull out of forces in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebenon&lt;/a&gt;. Roed-Larson met with the leader at his &lt;a href="w%3AAleppo"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt; home late last week for talks on Syrian intentions of following the &lt;a href="w%3AUn%20security%20council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; Resolution 1559.

The US and French backed &lt;a href="w%3AResolution"&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; calls for the complete withdrawal of &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; forces from Lebanon and reaffirms Lebanon's sovereignty and independence. It is hoped that the withdrawal will be completed prior to the Lebanese election scheduled for early May.

A complete plan and time table for full withdrawal is not yet known. &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; national security advisor, &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Hadley"&gt;Stephen Hadley&lt;/a&gt;, said the United States is waiting for details of the meeting with the special envoy. According to a report in the Washington Post, the first part of a pull-out calls for one third of the troops to be either removed or relocated into eastern Bekaa Valley and to shut down intelligence headquarters in Beirut by the end of March. Then on April 7, a Lebanese-Syrian military commission will meet to discuss the removal of additional forces.

The Washington administration seems prepared to accept a Syrian withdrawal in phases, but is cautious of al-Assad's pledges. Hadley said on a 'Fox News Sunday' broadcast interview: "In the end of the day, it's going to be deeds, not words, that matter."

The assassination of Lebanese former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 14 galvanized anti-Syrian opposition and foreign pressure that was calling for an end to the Syrian presence. It is estimated their total military force is now 15,000, with an additional 5,000 intelligence assets, down from a high of 40,000 during years of Syrian involvement. Syria occupied Lebanon beginning in 1976 when the country was at civil war. Associated Press and US intelligence reported significant troop movements out of Lebanon beginning in earnest last week amid differing protest groups in Beirut who marched both for, and alternately against, the Syrian involvement.

&lt;a href="Slovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; is on track to meet its target of adopting the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; currency in 2009, claims &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoaqu%C3%ADn%20Almunia"&gt;Joaquín Almunia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;'s Monetary Affairs Commissioner.

The main monetary figures and the fiscal situation "are going in a good direction," Almunia said. "If things continue as they are today, I'm sure the Slovak authorities will meet the target of being a member of the eurozone in 2009."

Slovakia joined the European Union last year along with other &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Europe"&gt;Central European&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaltic"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;a href="Mediterranean"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; states. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEconomic%20growth"&gt;growth rate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGross%20domestic%20product"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been one of the highest in the European Union, recording 5.5% growth in 2004. Almunia said that authorities should use this growth to curb the country's relatively high budget deficit, a necessary prerequisite for joining the euro zone.

Before a country adopts the euro currency, it must dwell in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AERM%20II"&gt;European Exchange Rate Mechanism II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for two years, where its exchange rate relative to the euro, as well as its budget deficit and inflation, are closely monitored. For Slovakia to adopt the euro in 2009, it must join ERM II in 2007. Three new members, &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Estonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Lithuania"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;, have already joined ERM II and are on track to adopt the euro in 2006&amp;ndash;2007.

The Dutch member of parliament &lt;a href="w%3AGeert%20Wilders"&gt;Geert Wilders&lt;/a&gt; has finished his statement of principles, which sets out his political plans for the future. The 20-page statement is referred to as 'Onafhankelijkheidsverklaring' (Declaration of Independence) by Wilders. It is a continuation of a ten-point plan written by Wilders and former colleague, &lt;a href="w%3AGert-Jan%20Oplaat"&gt;Gert-Jan Oplaat&lt;/a&gt;, and proposed to Wilders' former party, the &lt;a href="w%3AVVD"&gt;VVD&lt;/a&gt;.

The ten-point plan caused disagreement between Wilders and the VVD, including a difference of opinion on whether to allow &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; to enter the &lt;a href="w%3AEurpean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;. Wilders left the VVD on September 3rd last year. He started a political party of his own, known as &lt;a href="w%3AGroep%20Wilders"&gt;Groep Wilders&lt;/a&gt; (Group Wilders). Though he did not have enough votes during the last &lt;a href="w%3Aelection"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;, he refused to relinquish his seat in parliament to the VVD.

In his statement, Wilders proposed among others to abolish certain &lt;a href="w%3Aministry"&gt;ministries&lt;/a&gt;. Wilders also proposed outlawing the further creation of &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; schools and closing &lt;a href="w%3Amosque"&gt;mosques&lt;/a&gt; that proclaim extremist views. Furthermore, he proposed that the number of &lt;a href="w%3Aprovinces%20of%20the%20Netherlands"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; be reduced from 12 to 4, the five islands of the Antilles be expelled from the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the number of civil servants be cut by 50%.

Because of his marked views, public opinion of Wilders and his statement is strongly divided. As a result of his criticism of Islamic &lt;a href="w%3Aextremism"&gt;extremism&lt;/a&gt;, Wilders (along with &lt;a href="w%3AAyaan%20Hirsi%20Ali"&gt;Ayaan Hirsi Ali&lt;/a&gt;) received several death threats, which are taken very seriously after the murder on &lt;a href="w%3ATheo%20van%20Gogh%20%28film%20director%29"&gt;Theo van Gogh&lt;/a&gt; by an Islamic extremist last year and the assassination of political icon &lt;a href="w%3APim%20Fortuyn"&gt;Pim Fortuyn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A2002"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;. He is being held in a secure location, where he organises dinners for &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;2000 to raise money for his campaign.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel's&lt;/a&gt; Deputy Chief of Staff Major-General Gabi Ashkenazi has been refused entry to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, where he was due to attend a meeting of the United Israel Appeal in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; last Sunday.

An NZ Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that a visa had been refused, linking the decision to the unresolved diplomatic row over the conviction of two suspected Mossad members, Uri Kelman and Eli Cara, who attempted to fraudulently obtain a New Zealand passport - New Zealand is awaiting an official apology.

Jews in New Zealand are particularly upset, as the Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi visited New Zealand in August for talks with the NZ Government. Iran's stated goals include the destruction of Israel.

A spokesman for General Ashkenazi's office in Tel Aviv perferred to say that the general had decided not to visit New Zealand "for personal reasons", rather than admit to the denied visa.

At age 33, the Irishman defeated the world's second-ranked &lt;a href="w%3AVijay%20Singh"&gt;Vijay Singh&lt;/a&gt; in a playoff on Sunday to claim his first win on the PGA Tour. Harrington had 11 &lt;a href="w%3Agolf%20glossary"&gt;birdies&lt;/a&gt; in the final round alone, putting him 9 under par, enough to secure the playoff against the &lt;a href="w%3AFiji"&gt;Fijian&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition to winning the $990,000 top prize, Harrington became the first Irishman ever to win a PGA Tour event.

Dueling between protest groups continued yesterday in &lt;a href="w%3ABeiruit"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; at Martyrs' Square where hundreds of thousands demonstrated in opposition to &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; forces inside &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. It is estimated the rally consisted of nearly a million people, making it twice the size of the one organized last week by the &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; who call for Syrian forces to remain in Lebanon.

Monday's rally also marks the one month anniversery of the assassination of former anti-Syrian Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt;. Crowds wearing colors of red and white to show their unity fell silent as church bells tolled at 12:55 in observance of his death and the hour it occurred.

Protesters also sought to undermine support for Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Karami"&gt;Omar Karami&lt;/a&gt;, who was reinstated after the opposition movement had succeeded in forcing him out. Karami, and President &lt;a href="w%3AEmile%20Lahoud"&gt;Emile Lahoud&lt;/a&gt; who reinstated him, are both pro-Syrian. The sheer size of the demonstration that shouted chants of "Freedom, sovereignty, independence" puts the momentum of the debate back on the opposition movement's side.

According to the Associated Press, the number of people attending this demonstration makes it one of the biggest anti-government protests in the Arab world. If the police estimate of one million participants is correct, one in four inhabitants of the country attended the rally.
The US State Department has dubbed the movement "&lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20Revolution"&gt;Cedar Revolution&lt;/a&gt;."

<h1>Brazilian President party received money from FARC, say documents</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – 
Documents of the Brazilian Agency of intelligence (Abin) say that the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; received 5 million dollars to be used by political campaign of candidates in 2002 from the Colombian &lt;a href="w%3Acommunist"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; armed group &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (FARC-EP). The information was reported by the Brazilian magazine Veja that circulates this week in a headline story called "FARC's tentacles in Brazil".
According to the magazine, reporters had access to documents of Abin that described the liaisons between the Workers' Party (PT) and the Colombian guerrilla movement FARC.

The Workers' Party (PT) is the party of the Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3A%20Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;. PT is one of the biggest left-wing parties in &lt;a href="w%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; and at this moment the strongest and more organized party from Brazil. It is one of the political Brazilian parties that has the biggest and most active militancy.

Abin's main document, number 0095/3100 of April 25, 2002, says that a meeting occurred on April 13, 2002, in a farm near &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt;. The meeting lasted about 6 hours, there were approximately 30 persons, among them the father Olivério Medina, one of the representatives of the FARC in Brazil, and members of PT. A disguised Abin's agent participated of this meeting and annoted everything.

According to the agent, during the meeting, father Medina announced that he would donate 5 million dollars for politicians' electoral campaign of his choice.

Abin agency has six documents that describe the liaisons between PT and the FARC. Among the six documents, 3 of them say explicitly that 5 million dollars donation for PT's candidates occurred. The money probably came from &lt;a href="w%3ATrinidad%20and%20Tobago"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt; and went to 300 Brazilian businessmen who distributed the quantity among the party's committees.

Another document says that the Brazilian Congress employee and former-militant of the &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Brazilian Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (PCdoB), Maria das Graças organized the meetings with FARC members. She is considered a personal friend of the FARC commander knows as Mauricio. Maria said: "I know him [the commander Mauricio] off course, and so what? I did not organize any meeting."

The militant Antonio Viana who was in the meeting said: "We have talked about everything, except money."

The Colombian Radio Caracol says that, according to a research done by the Colombian government, the FARC invests next to 476 million pesos per years in activities in foreign countries. The official FARC representatives for this work are: &lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/nota.asp%3FId%3D142347"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Luis Alberto Albán, Ovidio Salinas, Ricardo Morantes, Jairo Alfonso Lesmes, father Oliverio Medina, Jesús Carvajalino and Liliana López. Father Olivério Medina is the name of who would be responsible for the intermediation between members of political parties in Brazil and the FARC.

Sometime ago, the Brazilian Deputy Alberto Fraga (PTB) knew about the Abin's investigation and denounced the scheme during a speech on the Brazilian Congress. In addition, he tried to open a commission to investigate the matter. Nevertheless he did not obtain support to open the commission. The PT deputy Luis Eduardo Grenhalg told him that he might be processed by government if he continued on commenting about the subject, says Fraga. Grenhalg says that he only suggested for Fraga not spreading informations that were not real. 

The &lt;a href="w%3APSDB"&gt;PSDB&lt;/a&gt; candidate José Serra tryed to talk about the FARC-PT liaison during the 2002 presidential campaign. However he was punished by the Electoral Court at that time.
The Workers' Party (PT) released an official statement signed by the National President José Genoino repudiating the magazine's article and denying all presented facts. Part of the note tells:

The note says that the article is irresponsible, that it comments on facts without any sustentable evidence. It still says that the magazine denies itself when later in the text it affirms that it did not find any solid indication to proof that 5 million dollars were really sent to PT by the FARC.

The note affirms that this kind of insinuation is not new and the party was already a victim of it before. It says that during the 2002 presidential campaign the candidate José Serra (PSDB) was punished because his denunce was empty. The documents commented by the magazine date of April 25, 2002, epoch in which the Brazilian president was Fernando Henrique Cardoso. At that time there were many spies searching and collecting, like snakes, for situations that could prevent the free desire of the Brazilian people to vote for the changes.

Some members of the National Congress are trying to begin a official investigation.

This is the second time, this year, that a South American government is criticized for alleged supporting relations with the FARC. Last month, Colombia and Venezuela almost entered in a war because of the arrestment of the alleged FARC's chancellor Rodrigo Granda. Colombia accused the government of Venezuela of giving protection and support to FARC's guerrillas. Venezuela accused Colombia of hurting his sovereignty. The two countries only entered an agreement after the intervention of the president of &lt;a href="w%3A%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;.

Also this is the second time, in less than a month, that a political party from South America is accused of implication with the FARC. On February, Paraguayan authorities discovered Cecilia Cubas Gusinky's body, 31 years, daughter kidnapped of the former-president of &lt;a href="w%3AParaguay"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; Raul Cubas in a hole, in Ñemby, 29 km from the capital &lt;a href="w%3AAsuncion"&gt;Asuncion&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the party Pátria Livre were living in that place and they were considered to be the main suspects. Osmar Martínez, that belongs to the party, was arrested. According to the police, some time ago he had communicated by email with the FARC chancellor Rodrigo Granda. In a interview Martinez said that he supports a "brotherhood relation" with the FARC.

<h2>The presence of the FARC in Brazil</h2>

A note from the Workers' Party (PT), of February 16, 2002 called 
&lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www.lula.org.br/noticias/not_int.asp%253Fnot_cod%253D1071%2526cf_cod%253D30%2526sis_cod%253D37%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;"The truth about Colombia and the FARC - and PT"&lt;/a&gt; tries to clarify the relationship between the party and the FARC. A portion of this note says that:

The note also criticizes the decision taken during the previous government, of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, which did not recognized the Colombian guerrillas of the FARC diplomatically. According to the note that would not be a good idea, since the FARC could win the war against Colombia.

The note criticizes the support of the government of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Sates"&gt;United Sates&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and affirms that with it the conflict tends to remain more violent and last more. In relation to the drugs, the note affirms that the PT is emphatic in the combat against the drug traffic. Nevertheless it says that there are credit "contradictory informations" relating to the implication of the FARC with the drug traffic.

The PT refuses to classify the FARC as a terrorist organization. The party justifies the decision saying that it can act as mediator in the conflict, this way.

The FARC is member of &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; since 1990. According to the first forum final resolution, on July 4, 1990, the forum goal is "to improve proposals of united and consensual acctions ".

Raul Reyes, FARC commander described part of the FARC relationship during an interview for the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo on August 24, 2003 &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u62119.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the interview he said that he knew the Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula for the first time in San Salvador during the Foro de São Paulo. The FARC commander affirms that the main contacts in Brazil are the ones in the Worker's Party (PT) and in the &lt;a href="w%3ALandless%20Workers%27%20Movement"&gt;Landless Workers' Movement&lt;/a&gt; (MST). He says that FARC has contacts among intellectuals, Catholic priests, historians and journalists. Among them there are Carlos Alberto Libânio Christo or Frei Betto (former Lula advisor) and Emir Sader (writer). Also he says that the affirmation that the FARC produce cocaine is untrue.

The Brazilian drug dealer Luiz Fernando da Costa, also known as Fernandinho Beira-Mar, was arrested by Colombian army on April, 2001 in the city of Maramduba, in Colombia. With him there was also arrested the FARC leader, Acacio Medina, or Negro Acácio &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/agestado/noticias/2001/abr/21/108.htm"&gt;O Estado de São Paulo, on April 21, 2001&lt;/a&gt;.

In Brasilia, Beira-Mar was interrogated by &lt;a href="w%3ADrug%20Enforcement%20Administration"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt; agents. Beira-Mar talked about his liaisons with the Colombian guerrillas. The recording of this conversation was a key factor so the US government could request later the extradition of three other FARC guerrillas. Some details of this meeting were published by the Colombian magazine Cambio 
&lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/noticias/2002/020506_colombiaro.shtml%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www.revistacambio.com/html/pais/articulos/524/%26amp%3Blp%3Des_en"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Beira-Mar, he was buying 600 kilos of coca, per week, for two million pesos from peasants. He was paying to the FARC a million pesos for every processed kilo. He also said that he was giving weapons to the Colombian guerrillas.

FARC and &lt;a href="w%3AELN"&gt;ELN&lt;/a&gt; delegates act in schools, labour unions and Brazilian universities spreading ideas about the revolutionary movement. &lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www2.uol.com.br/aprendiz/n_noticias/noticias_educacao/id230701.htm%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Some of these meetings are organized by left-wing groups. One of the most
active of these groups is the "Permanent Committee of Solidarity with the People in Fight". The committee organized more than 40 lectures in São Paulo
according to the President of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;USP&lt;/a&gt; Workers Labour Union 
&lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www2.uol.com.br/aprendiz/n_noticias/noticias_educacao/id230701.htm%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

On August, 2001, representatives of the FARC, took part of a meeting with the members of the Socialistic Youth of PDT &lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www.juventudesocialista.org.br/documento/Xcongressonacional.html%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

On March 20, 2002 in &lt;a href="w%3ARibeir%C3%A3o%20Preto"&gt;Ribeirão Preto&lt;/a&gt;, a pro-FARC committee was created by the secretary of sports at that time Leopoldo Paulino (PSB), during the government of Mayor Antônio Palocci Filho (PT). Palocci is the current Minister of the Finance &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/agestado/noticias/2002/mar/20/9.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www.estadao.com.br/agestado/noticias/2002/mar/20/9.htm%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

During a interview to the Brazilian television channel EPTV, yesterday, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.leopoldopaulino.com.br/"&gt;Leopoldo Paulino&lt;/a&gt; said that the comitte did not aim collect founds to the Colombian guerrilla. He said that the committee is of solidarity with Latin American people, engaged and militant. He said that he doesn't think that the FARC need any other extra financial support. Paulino said he has empathy by the guerrilla because they fight against the United States. He also said that he did not take part of the meeting described by the Brazilian magazine and that he don't know father Olivera Medina. &lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//eptv.globo.com/noticias/1203200519071645.asp%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

On 2001, FARC commanders were received by the governor (at that time) of &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Grande%20do%20Sul"&gt;Rio Grande do Sul&lt;/a&gt;, Olivio Dutra (PT) &lt;a href="http%3A//www.noolhar.com/opovo/jornaldoleitor/122018.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www.noolhar.com/opovo/jornaldoleitor/122018.html%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www.al.rs.gov.br/anais/50/Plenario/2001/Atas/ata_26.htm%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. FARC leaders were honored and acclaimed during the World Social Forum in &lt;a href="w%3APorto%20Alegre"&gt;Porto Alegre&lt;/a&gt;. Olívido Dutra is the current Minister of Cities. At that occasion, deputies of Rio Grande do Sul Congress protested against Olivio. &lt;a href="http%3A//babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//www.al.rs.gov.br/anais/50/Plenario/2001/010314.htm%26amp%3Blp%3Dpt_en"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h2>Brazilian press</h2>

The Brazilian press already have published stories about the relationship between the FARC and the Workers' Party (PT). But, none of these previous stories was so emphatic as the recent one published by the magazine Veja, this week.

However the magazine Veja is cautious saying that although all the people and the dates cited by the Abin agents were correct "the magazine did not find solid evidences to proof that PT received money from the FARC". 

In the story, the magazine did not detail the participation of the FARC on the Foro de São Paulo, neither its activities in Brazil. 

FARC and PT have been in contact at least for about 12 years at least, since the FARC joined to the &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; in 1990. Foro de São Paulo was founded after the falling of Berlin wall by Brazilian Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the Cuban President &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;.

America Libre is the name of a magazine published by some participants of the Foro de São Paulo. The America Libre magazine publishing conseaul is formed by PT members and other Brazilian personalities: Luis Eduardo Greenhalgh (PT), Fernando Morais, Emir Sader, Roberto Drummond, Gilberto Carvalho, Leonardo Boff, Rubens Paolucci Jr, João Pedro Stédile (MST leader), Chico Buarque de Hollanda (singer), etc. Also part of the publishing council is the FARC commander Manuel Marulanda Vélez (Tirofijo). &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nodo50.org/americalibre/consejo.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The former-president of the publishing council was Carlos Alberto Libânio Christo, know as Frei Betto, former Lula's personal advisor and journalist.
Activities of the Foro de São Paulo usually are not not mentioned by Brazilian media. Even the story of magazine Veja this week didn't say the name Foro de São Paulo. Instead the magazine preferred to use "a debate with political parties and social organizations of Latin America and of Caribe to discuss the effects of the fall of the wall of Berlin." Rarely the name Foro de São Paulo is mentioned by Brazilian news agencies. 

Some journalists already denied the existence of the Foro de São Paulo. Luiz Felipe de Alencastro already wrote articles for the magazine Veja. He is Brazilian History professor in the University of Paris. In October 30, 2002, during a talk for the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, a participant asked Alencastro about the Foro de São Paulo. Alencastro answered: "It's interesting. You'll see, because I live, I mean, I live now in France. I had been living in Brazil for 12 years. We never heard about this Foro de São Paulo in Brazil."
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.cfr.org/pub5190/cfr/brazil_political_and_economic_challenges_facing_the_presidentein_latin_america.php"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Documents about the Foro de São Paulo can be find in left-wing party websites.
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.pt.org.br/site/secretarias_def/secretarias_int.asp%3FCod%3D2817cod_sis%3D9cat%3D8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.vermelho.org.br/english/text/forum2.asp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href="http%3A//granmai.cubaweb.com/miami5/espanol/0003.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. PT talks about the Foro de São Paulo in its documents 
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.lula.org.br/noticias/not_int.asp%3FNot_cod%3D1071cf_cod%3D30sis_cod%3D37"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
At the website of the Perseu Abramo Foundation, organization founded by PT, there is the speech of the President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva during the meeting of the Foro de São Paulo in &lt;a href="w%3AHavana"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.fpa.org.br/sala_leitura/forosp_cuba.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

An article published in the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Brazil"&gt;Communist Party of Brazil&lt;/a&gt; (PCdoB) official webpage by the journalist and Vice-president of PCdoB José Reinaldo Carvalho called "São Paulo Forum - the convergence point of the Latin-American and Caribbean left" talks about the Foro. PCdoB is an ally and the party participates on the government &lt;a href="http%3A//www.vermelho.org.br/english/text/forum.asp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2004, a group of journalist sent a proposal to the Brazilian president Lula asking for the creation of an inspector organism to control the conduct of the Brazilian press. This organ would have power, according to the proposal, to censure journalistic works considered inappropriate. Journalists could lost their professional licenses. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.portalimprensa.com.br/new_ultimasnoticias_data_view.asp%3Fcode%3D299"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/educando/noticias/2004/ago/06/31.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/agestado/noticias/2004/ago/11/105.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u63040.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
The proposal was considered too authoritarian by other journalists who protested against it emphatically. The law had no support for its creation, in spite of the pressure exercised by the government, and by some journalistic sectors supporting the proposal 
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.estadao.com.br/rss/politica/2004/dez/09/9.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
One of the critics against the proposal was that the journalists who supported the idea (and that would be the ones who would fiscalize the media) were members of PT or PCdoB.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Superior Court Judge Richard A. Kramer struck down two California laws that limited marriage in the state to a union of opposite-sex couples. The ruling came one year after when it opened its &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20City%20Hall"&gt;city hall&lt;/a&gt; to same-sex weddings over Valentine's Day weekend through March 11 2004.

Kramer said the two California laws violated the state's constitutional guarantees of privacy and a legal concept called &lt;a href="w%3Adue%20process"&gt;due process&lt;/a&gt; - which tries to ensure each person is treated equally by the law. "The denial of marriage to same-sex couples appears impermissibly arbitrary," Kramer wrote in the opinion released Monday.

In his decision, Kramer cited &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;United States Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acase%20law"&gt;case law&lt;/a&gt; ranging from ♡❤♡❤ to ♡❤♡❤ in a step-by-step dismantling of legal arguments against same-sex marriage. Including the following excerpts:
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Traditional definition of marriage:♡❤♡ "Same-sex marriage cannot be prohibited solely because California has always done so before."
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡With California's &lt;a href="w%3Adomestic%20partner"&gt;domestic partner&lt;/a&gt; laws, gays don't need marriage:♡❤♡ "That California has granted marriage-like rights to same-sex couples points to the conclusion that there is no rational state interest in denying them the rites of marriage as well."
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡The purpose of marriage is procreation:♡❤♡ "The obvious natural and social reality [is] that one does not have to be married to procreate, nor does one have to procreate in order to be married."

</ul>
Kramer, a Catholic Republican Judge appointed by , California's previous &lt;a href="w%3AConservative"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; governor, issued a "stay" on his order, making it a tentative decision by delaying its implementation for 60 days to allow the same-sex marriage opponents time to file an &lt;a href="w%3Aappeal"&gt;appeal&lt;/a&gt; to his ruling. The case is widely expected to be brought before the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20California"&gt;California Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;.

Less than a year ago, the state's Supreme Court annulled more than 4,000 same-sex marriages which took place in San Francisco County in 2004. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of same-sex marriages, but ruled more narrowly that San Francisco mayor &lt;a href="w%3AGavin%20Newsom"&gt;Gavin Newsom&lt;/a&gt; overstepped his authority by unilaterally deciding not to follow state laws he did not agree with instead of challenging the laws in court, which is the proper legal way to overturn or affirm laws in California and much of the United States.

&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing's&lt;/a&gt; utilities are cracking down on manhole cover thefts by removing the incentive to steal them. A pilot program is using a new material with negligible recycling value in over 2,921 installations of various types.

"We are still looking for the perfect substitutes for the manhole covers," said city spokesman Wang Xin.
Over 240,000 covers were stolen from Beijing's streets in 2004, nearly half of the 600,000 installations scattered throughout the city.

The high recycling value of the metal used to manufacture the previous models led to a crime wave of thefts, driven by illegal scrap metal dealers who purchased them for approximately US$2.4 dollars.

The covers cost between US$145 and US$182 to replace.

Two &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwanese&lt;/a&gt; political parties of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20independence"&gt;independence-leaning&lt;/a&gt; "&lt;a href="w%3APan-Green%20Coalition"&gt;pan-green alliance&lt;/a&gt;" unveiled new bills today in response to the new "anti-secession" law passed earlier this week by the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; is expected to introduce a bill giving the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; the power to take "non-peaceful" action, or other actions, to "safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty and territory". The draft version of the law mandates that the Taiwanese President must report to the &lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Yuan"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt; on any such actions within thirty days.

DPP caucus whip &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Lin"&gt;Peter Lin&lt;/a&gt; said that although the signatures of only thirty lawmakers are required to make the law valid, over fifty have already been gathered.

The seven-article draft law states that the Taiwan issue is not a part of China's internal affairs, but rather that it is an international matter between nations. It goes on to state that it is necessary and urgent to quickly enact counter-legislation to deter Mainland China's annexation efforts. It further calls for increased trust and understanding between the two sides, including greater trade, sporting, and cultural links.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwanese%20Solidarity%20Union"&gt;Taiwanese Solidarity Union&lt;/a&gt; also proposed a new "anti-annexation" law. The eleven article draft states that "Taiwan is already an independent sovereign state and it is not an issue for Taiwan to declare independence or seek separation from China". It goes on to state that the government should call a referendum to amend the Taiwanese constitution to safeguard Taiwanese sovereignty. The draft law would also give the Taiwanese President authorisation to resort to "non-peaceful means" to resist Chinese aggression.

Taiwanese independence has been a thorny issue in recent years, as some Taiwanese politicians insist that the democratic island is a sovereign nation, and Chinese authorities insist that it is a part of the PRC.

By a vote of 2896-0 (with two abstentions), the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20People%27s%20Congress"&gt;National People's Congress&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; has passed an &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Secession%20Law%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;"anti-secession" law&lt;/a&gt; designed to thwart &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20independence"&gt;Taiwan independence&lt;/a&gt;. Chinese President &lt;a href="w%3AHu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; quickly signed a presidential order to bring the law into effect.

The law provides a legal basis for China to use force, or "nonpeaceful means" as the Chinese government has phrased it, against Taiwan, should &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20reunification"&gt;reunification&lt;/a&gt; efforts fail. 

Chinese premier Wen Jiabao stressed that the legislation is aimed at achieving peace in the Taiwan Straits. 

Speaking at a press conference following the law's passage, Wen stated, "This law is meant to strengthen and promote cross-straits relations. This law is for peaceful reunification. It is not targeted against the people of Taiwan, nor is it a war bill."

"This law is to contain and oppose Taiwan separatist forces. Only by containing and opposing Taiwan separatist forces can the Taiwan Straits have peace," he added. 

The vote was broadcast live on state-controlled television and radio. The Chinese &lt;a href="w%3AXinhua"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt; news agency has taken the unusual step of setting up a special section on its Internet site to explain the law and its ramifications from the Chinese perspective.

Chinese officials describe PRC policy as being committed to peace to the maximum extent possible, while acknowledging limits to peaceful negotiation. A Xinhua headline from the days leading up to the law's passage declares, "China Pursues Peace, But Not at Any Price." 

Wang Zhaoguo of the National People's Congress previously stated on March 8, "Using non-peaceful means to stop secession in defense of our sovereignty and territorial integrity would be our last resort, when all our efforts for a peaceful reunification prove futile." Added Wang, "No one is more desirous of achieving a peaceful reunification than we are."

Taiwanese politicians reacted with strongly-worded "anti-invasion" legislation, and vowed to call a one-million strong rally in opposition to the new law. 

The timing of the legislation comes at a delicate moment for &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, who is making her first trip to China in a few days.

"We do view the adoption of the anti-secession law as something that is unfortunate and not helpful to encouraging peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," said &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt;.

Brian Nichols appeared before Cobb County Magistrate Judge Frank Cox on Tuesday, four days after fleeing &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; in a killing spree. The hearing took place inside a &lt;a href="w%3AFulton%20County%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Fulton County&lt;/a&gt; jail. Accompanied by nineteen security officers and shackled at the hands and feet, Nichols only words when asked if he had any questions were, "Not at this time."

The 5 minute hearing was a formality to re-file charges of rape against him. He will be charged with 4 counts of murder and is currently being held with bond.

Nichols allegedly shot the judge presiding over his rape trial along with two others present at the time in an Atlanta courtroom. He then fled to a suburb outside the city. Later that evening, it is allegeded he shot a US customs agent before taking a woman &lt;a href="w%3Ahostage"&gt;hostage&lt;/a&gt; in her own apartment, alluding the massive &lt;a href="w%3AManhunt"&gt;manhunt.&lt;/a&gt;

Nichols ultimately let the hostage, Ashley Smith, go free. He surrendered peacefully to a &lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; team after Smith alerted authorities.

A federal jury found &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Ebbers"&gt;Bernard Ebbers&lt;/a&gt; guilty of all nine counts in the indictment brought against him. The &lt;a href="w%3Averdict"&gt;verdict&lt;/a&gt; was handed down by a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ajury"&gt;jury&lt;/a&gt; after 8 days of deliberation on the former &lt;a href="w%3AWorldcom"&gt;WorldCom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMastermind"&gt;mastermind&lt;/a&gt; behind the accounting scandal that brought down the &lt;a href="w%3ATelecommunication"&gt;telcom&lt;/a&gt; giant. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; writer Erin McClam reports, "Ebbers' face reddened.", as the verdict was read. Sentencing is set for June 13 when he will face up to 85 years in prison.

Ebbers testified in his own defence, saying he left the details of the company's accounting to others and that he had no knowledge of shady practices. But Scott Sullivan, ex-chief financial officer and key prosecution witness, directly linked Ebbers to the fraud. He had agreed to co-operate with prosecutors in the hopes of receiving a lenient sentence for his own involvement in the fraud.

The demise of WordCom sparked a massive &lt;a href="w%3AClass%20action"&gt;class action&lt;/a&gt; law suit by investors. The drastic plunge of WorldCom's stock value cost upwards to $11 billion as the scandal unravelled. Secuities fraud case filings stemming from the suits will probably break new legal ground whereby the actions of &lt;a href="w%3AInvestment%20bank"&gt;investment banks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACPA"&gt;public accounting firms&lt;/a&gt; will be called into legal question.

A federal jury found &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Ebbers"&gt;Bernard Ebbers&lt;/a&gt; guilty on all nine counts in an indictment for fraud, conspiracy and false regulatory filings. The &lt;a href="w%3Averdict"&gt;verdict&lt;/a&gt; was handed down by a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ajury"&gt;jury&lt;/a&gt; after 8 days of deliberation on the former &lt;a href="w%3AWorldcom"&gt;WorldCom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMastermind"&gt;mastermind&lt;/a&gt; behind the accounting scandal that brought down the &lt;a href="w%3ATelecommunication"&gt;telcom&lt;/a&gt; giant.

&lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; recognized that the mother of &lt;a href="w%3AUgueth%20Urbina"&gt;Ugueth Urbina&lt;/a&gt;, Maura Josefina Villareal, was kidnapped by the &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (FARC-EP) commander Alvis Patiño, known as ♡❤El Chiguiro♡❤. Urbina is a Venezuelan and a &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; right-handed closer who plays for the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Tigers"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt;.

Chiguiro has been captured on February 2005. A delegation of authorities from &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Venezuela, so he could be identified. Now, after his identification, Colombian officers expects he can be extradicted to Colombia. In Colombia, Chiguiro is expected to be judged for the alleged crimes of kidnapping and murderer of the American missionaries Sthephen Everet and Thimoty Dike in 1995.

Some Venezuelan baseball players from the Major Leagues said that kidnapping is a new situation they must learn to live with. None of them said that the risk of kidnappings would prevent their return to Venezuela. 

For years, Venezuelan cattlemen near Colombian borders say that they are victims of extorsion by FARC forces. This is the first time that the Venezuelan government recognizes that the FARC is responsible by this kind of crime in Venezuela. 

According to the Colombian authorities, Chiguiro is envolved with the exchange of drugs by weapons with &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt; traffic drug dealers.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt;, the Right Honourable &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; PC MP, in a speech to the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;British House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; today presented his ninth &lt;a href="w%3ABudget"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt;, what is very likely to be his last Budget before &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20general%20election%2C%202005/06"&gt;the next UK General Election&lt;/a&gt;. This opened the parliamentary debate on the 2005 Finance Bill, and was followed by responses from the opposition parties.

In a 48 minute long speech, the Chancellor presented a Budget of "tax cuts that are reasonable, spending that is affordable, and [economic] stability that is paramount", that was "the prudent course for Britain". There were few surprises that had not already been indicated in his 2004 pre-Budget report. The increase in the threshold on &lt;a href="w%3Astamp%20duty"&gt;stamp duty&lt;/a&gt; was greater than that forecast by commentators, as was the amount of the Council Tax rebate to households with pensioners.

<h2>The Budget in detail</h2>
<h3>Duty</h3>
Before the speech, commentators had speculated that the Chancellor would increase the threshold for &lt;a href="w%3Astamp%20duty"&gt;stamp duty&lt;/a&gt; on house purchases from £60,000 to £100,000 (the same increase that the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; had proposed in their Alternative Budget in February 2005), to reflect the increase in house prices over the past few years and to reduce the burden on first-time house buyers; and would not increase the &lt;a href="w%3Aduty"&gt;duty&lt;/a&gt; on petrol.

<h2>Responses from opposition parties</h2>
<h3>Conservative</h3>
In a speech lasting 16 minutes the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, the Right Honourable &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Howard"&gt;Michael Howard&lt;/a&gt; QC MP, repeatedly accused the Chancellor of presenting a "vote now, pay later" Budget. Mr Howard stated that he agreed with the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; that this would be "the last Budget that this Chancellor will ever deliver".

Mr Howard began by welcoming "the Chancellor back to the General Election campaign", and throughout his response made frequent references to the &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Duchy%20of%20Lancaster"&gt;Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;. He stated that the Conservative Party's policy would be to give pensioners a £500 council tax rebate in 2005.

Expanding upon his "vote now, pay later" theme, Mr Howard stated that "this Chancellor has got form", describing Mr Brown's 2001 pre-election Budget as "a vote now Budget" and Mr Brown's 2002 post-election Budget as "a pay later Budget". Mr Howard also questioned the accuracy of the forecasts in the Budget report, accusing it of being a "dodgy Budget based upon dodgy numbers", and pointed to Mr Brown's Budget reports in previous years where the forecast in the Budget report had been for a surplus of £58 billions but where there had actually turned out to be a deficit of £41 billions. Mr Howard accused "the Chancellor's forecasts of surpluses" of being as unreliable as "the Prime Minister's forecasts of Weapons of Mass Destruction".

<h3>Liberal Democrat</h3>
In a speech lasting 15 minutes, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; Party, the Right Honourable &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; MP, emphasized themes of "social justice" and "fairness", and contrasted Liberal Democrat Budgetary policies with those of the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; and of the Conservative Party. 

Mr Kennedy began by pointing to the "favourable backdrop" against which Mr Brown was publishing his Budget, stating that one of the reasons for the favourable economic circumstances was the implementation by the Labour Party of the Liberal Democrat policy of an independent &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20England"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;.

Accusing Mr Howard and Mr Brown of engaging in a "&lt;a href="w%3ADutch%20auction"&gt;Dutch auction&lt;/a&gt;" with respect to Council Tax rebates for pensioners, and of both ignoring the "ticking bomb" of Council Tax revaluation that would markedly affect people's Council Tax bills, Mr Kennedy stated the Liberal Democrat policy of scrapping the Council Tax entirely and of instead bringing in a system of local Income taxation. Mr Kennedy characterized the Council Tax rebates as a "quick fix for this year only", and contrasted this with local Income taxation which he characterized as being one that "pensioners benefit from every year". Mr Kennedy also questioned why the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Audit%20Office"&gt;National Audit Office&lt;/a&gt; would not have "access to Mr Brown's books", for checking the assumptions made in the Budget report, until the end of the year.

Further outlining the Liberal Democrat aims for "social justice" and "fairness", Mr Kennedy accused the State Pension system of being one that is "iniquitous" for women, whom he said both lose National Insurance credit as the result of time taken off work for starting and raising families and who have to rely upon the State Pension more because of their greater life expectancy. Mr Kennedy also stated that the poorest 20% of people in Britain pay more, as a proportion of their income, than do the richest 20% of people.

Mr Kennedy concluded by pointing to the lack of any mention of the environment in Mr Brown's speech, which he termed a glaring "sin of omission", and by describing the Liberal Democrat presentation of its taxation and spending policies as being one of "That's who'll pay it. That's what it will cost. That's who'll benefit.", and accused the Labour Party of, by contrast, making pre-election promises in the past to not raise Income tax, only instead to raise National Insurance contributions after the election.

&lt;a href="w%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt;, the world's largest mobile telephone company, has bought &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; operator &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConnex%20Romania"&gt;Connex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACzechia"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; operator &lt;a href="w%3AOskar"&gt;Oskar&lt;/a&gt; in a deal worth 2.6 billion &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;. Both Connex and Oskar were majortarily owned by Telesystem International Wireless Group, a Canadian corporation. While officials from the companies did not make public the individual value of the two operators, it is expected that most of the 2.6 billion euro was paid for Connex, which has a market value of 1.5 to 2.3 billion euro.

The takeover of Connex is said to be the biggest deal in Romania in 15 years. Before the takeover, Vodafone owned 20.1% of the company, while now it owns 99.1%, the remaining 0.9% being owned by a Cypriot company.

Arun Sarin, the CEO of Vodafone, said "I am delighted that [Connex] and Oskar, both fast growing mobile operators, will become part of Vodafone."

Connex is Romania's second-largest mobile telephony operator, with more than 4.9 million customers at the end of 2004 and nearly 50% market share. It is also one of Romania's most recognised and successful corporations, and one of Europe's fastest growing mobile phone operators. Oskar has 1.83 million customers and is also growing at a fast rate.

Brian Nichols appeared before Cobb County Magistrate Judge Frank Cox on Tuesday, four days after fleeing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a killing spree. The hearing took place inside a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFulton%20County%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Fulton County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; jail. Accompanied by nineteen security officers and shackled at the hands and feet, Nichols only words when asked if he had any questions were, "Not at this time."

The 5 minute hearing was a formality to uphold the rape charges against him. He will be charged with 4 counts of murder and is currently being held with bond.

Nichols allegedly shot the judge at his rape trial along with two others in an Atlanta courtroom. He then fled to a suburb outside the city, where later that evening he shot a US customs agent before taking a woman, Ashley Smith, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Ahostage"&gt;hostage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Smith was held by Nichols in her own apartment for 4 hours while he eluded a massive &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Amanhunt"&gt;manhunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Nichols ultimately let Smith go free. He surrendered peacefully to a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; team after she alerted authorities.

Studies of &lt;a href="Mars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; point to evidence of the presence of &lt;a href="w%3Aliquid%20water"&gt;liquid water&lt;/a&gt; on the planet's surface and a vast amount of underground &lt;a href="w%3Aice%20%28water%29"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href="w%3Aequator"&gt;equator&lt;/a&gt; within the past few million years. Liquid water is believed to be a key ingredient for life, therefore the presence of water on Mars helps support chances of &lt;a href="w%3Aextraterrestrial%20life"&gt;extraterrestrial life&lt;/a&gt;, reported the journal &lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; today. In the studies, strong indications of &lt;a href="w%3Aglacial"&gt;glacial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Avolcano"&gt;volcanic&lt;/a&gt; activity were presented. The combined research on this subject, including a study in December 2004 indicating that five volcanoes were active as recently as two million years ago, justifies further search for signs of life on Mars scientists say.

A few million years is a mere minute on the &lt;a href="w%3Ageological%20timescale"&gt;geological timescale&lt;/a&gt; of Mars which has been around for 4.5 billion years.

The scarred surface of Mars cannot be attributed solely to asteroids. New images of the landscape taken by the &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Resolution%20Stereo%20Camera"&gt;High Resolution Stereo Camera&lt;/a&gt; (HRSC) on the &lt;a href="European%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Express%20Mission"&gt;Mars Express Mission&lt;/a&gt; show that flowing water, large glaciers and active volcanoes have also taken their toll on the face of Mars.

Some evidence collected by two &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20rover"&gt;Mars rovers&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; sent to explore the planet shows that Mars was hotter and more humid millions of years ago than it is today. Also important were active &lt;a href="w%3Avolcano"&gt;volcanoes&lt;/a&gt; that can stimulate the forming of &lt;a href="w%3Amicrobial"&gt;microbial&lt;/a&gt; life as they do here on &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists recently discovered &lt;a href="w%3Abacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; near the mouths of undersea volcanic vents on Earth where bacteria live off &lt;a href="w%3Asulfur"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href="w%3Aoxygen"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; and discharge methane as a by-product of their life cycle. Though controversial, the discovery of signs of &lt;a href="w%3Amethane"&gt;methane gas&lt;/a&gt; in Mars' &lt;a href="w%3Aatmosphere"&gt;atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; also interests researchers who believe it indicates the possibility of subsurface life.

Geologist &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Head"&gt;James Head&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABrown%20University"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt; led a group of researchers who examined landforms thought to be glacial during the &lt;a href="w%3AViking%20program"&gt;Viking program&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s. They found evidence that glaciers moved from the poles to the equator between 3.5 and 4 million years ago, suggesting that Mars is currently in an &lt;a href="w%3AInterglacial%20period"&gt;interglacial period&lt;/a&gt;. 

A third study looked at an area of frozen water roughly the size of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sea"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; that formed near the equator around five million years ago. It is now thought that the ice was once liquid water carried along by &lt;a href="w%3Avolcanic%20eruption"&gt;volcanic eruptions&lt;/a&gt; in a region known as &lt;a href="w%3ACerberus%20Fossae"&gt;Cerberus Fossae&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers have long assumed water on Mars had all evaporated into the Martian atmosphere. A 1991 hypothesis, then considered outrageous by suggesting Mars was no stranger to floods, is now supported by recent findings. The HRSC data suggests water is still present both in liquid form and ice. Mars Express will deploy a special radar instrument in early May which should be able to detect water and ice even several miles beneath the surface.

Should water be found on Mars, the chances of finding life are great. Many &lt;a href="w%3Aextremophiles"&gt;extremophiles&lt;/a&gt;, bacteria living under extreme conditions such as extreme &lt;a href="w%3Asalinity"&gt;salinity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Aheat"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt;, have already been discovered on Earth. In February 2005, scientists announced the discovery of bacteria that survived in a state of &lt;a href="w%3Afrozen%20suspension"&gt;frozen suspension&lt;/a&gt; for 32,000 years. 

Likewise on Mars, a sample of ice could offer great insight into the evolution of the Martian environment and atmosphere. These discoveries may offer a great chance to get objective evidence for Mars research.

♡❤♡London♡❤♡ – The &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Woodcraft%20Folk"&gt;Woodcraft Folk&lt;/a&gt;, a British socialist inspired youth organisation, lost its government subsidy of GBP 52 000. The &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20for%20Education%20and%20Skills"&gt;Department for Education and Skills&lt;/a&gt; said the organisation's claim for a grant lacked detail and that they did not have “sufficiently robust outcome indicators”, meaning that it did not represent a “good value for money”. This is the first time in 40 years the group was denied funding by the department.

Loss of the grant puts the future of the organisation in doubt. The grant money provides a fifth of the funds that helps pay for its full-time staff and headquarters. The rest comes from donations, subscriptions and a grant from the &lt;a href="w%3ACo-operative%20Group"&gt;Co-operative Group&lt;/a&gt;

Some members of Woodcraft Folk have charged that the real reason the funding was stopped is the group's strong support against the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;. It has helped lead some of the anti-war movements. 

It now plans to mount a campaign to get the funding back.

The Woodcraft Folk started in 1925 as a socialist and co-operative alternative to the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Scout%20Association"&gt;Scouts&lt;/a&gt;, who were seen as increasing militaristic in the years immediately after the First World War.

<h1>Mao-style suits fading away in China</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mao-style%20suits%20fading%20away%20in%20China&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The famous "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMao%20suit"&gt;Mao suit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ", prominently worn by &lt;a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; leaders in the decades following that country's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A1949%20Revolution"&gt;1949 revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is on the verge of disappearing from China, as the fashion-conscious younger generation shuns the previously common style in favor of the latest apparel offered by modern designers.

China's President &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; was last seen in a green Mao suit while visiting a military base during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20New%20Year"&gt;Chinese New Year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

During the recent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20People%27s%20Congress"&gt;National People's Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gathering in Beijing, Sun Fucai, manager of the official Red Capital clothing store, reported that Mao suits made up only five percent of his sales.

One shopkeeper near &lt;a href="Beijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, Hu Bixing, sells Mao suits, but hasn't worn his own Mao suit for about ten years. He says they are "...so out of fashion."

In China, the style of dress is still worn by older urban dwellers, and many farmers still wear the hat which typically accompanies the suit, called a "Liberation" cap.

The Mao suit has a long history in China, going back to 1912, when it became known as a "Zhongshan suit", because &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Yat-sen"&gt;Sun Yat-sen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , or Sun Zhongshan as he is more commonly known in Chinese, popularized the style as the president of the Republic of China. It was later made famous by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acommunist"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMao%20Zedong"&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during his reign as the leader of China.

One Mao suit owner remembers purchasing what for him was a very expensive version of the suit when it was more popular several decades ago.

"I haven't worn it in 20 years," said government-employed driver Zhang Xiaotong. "If I put it on today people would look at me like I was a bit odd."

<h1>50 Italian parliamentarians call for global summit for &quot;a new financial architecture&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=50%20Italian%20parliamentarians%20call%20for%20global%20summit%20for%20%26quot%3Ba%20new%20financial%20architecture%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A letter and motion to be debated by Italian Parliament this week calls for action to address speculative bubbles and potential future financial crashes in the global economy. The motion asks for a global summit similar to the 1944 &lt;a href="w%3ABretton%20Woods%20system"&gt;Bretton Woods United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference&lt;/a&gt;, which gave us the IMF and World Bank.

The letter raises questions about the sustainability of current financial trends, based on the highly speculative nature of today's markets. For example, according to the letter, "It is estimated that the entire financial bubble, counting all financial derivatives and all other forms of existing debt, is equal to about $400 trillion, compared to a worldwide &lt;a href="w%3AGross%20domestic%20product"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt; of slightly more than $40 trillion".

Last years collapse of Italian dairy company &lt;a href="w%3AParmalat"&gt;Parmalat&lt;/a&gt;, with "14.3 billion euros that must still be accounted for", is given as evidence for "a lack of effective tools and controls regarding financial operations". &lt;a href="w%3AEnron"&gt;Enron&lt;/a&gt;, which famously collapsed in November 2001 revealing faudulent accounting practices from previously respected accounting firm &lt;a href="w%3AArthur%20Andersen"&gt;Arthur Andersen&lt;/a&gt;, is given as another example.

Oddly, the largest collapse on record, that of &lt;a href="w%3AWorldCom"&gt;WorldCom&lt;/a&gt;, is not mentioned, though the set of examples is not purported to be exhaustive. A number of other crashes are mentioned: the LTCM fund, Argentine bonds, Cirio, and Finmatica.

The motion, linked to supporters of the &lt;a href="w%3ALyndon%20LaRouche"&gt;Lyndon LaRouche&lt;/a&gt; movement, is signed by Parliamentarians Lettieri, Soro, Delbono, Tolotti, Widmann, Villani Miglietta, Rosato, Albertini, Morgando, Diana, Luigi Pepe, Damiani, Ostillio, De Brasi, Maccanico, Carbonella, Paola Mariani, Grandi, Pistone, Giovanni Bianchi, Giacco, Benvenuto, Piscitello, Camo, Realacci, Squeglia, Rocchi, Iannuzzi, Intini, Meduri, Santino Adamo Loddo, Boccia, Villari, Chianale, Siniscalchi, Sandi, Cusumano, Cennamo, Annunziata, Rotundo, Bonito, Buemi, Pennacchi, Fanfani, Tarantino, Rodeghiero, Angioni, Detomas, and Nesi. 

Debate was scheduled for March 14-18.

The government of &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; said that it will give total support to the principle of "&lt;a href="w%3AOne-China%20Policy"&gt;one China&lt;/a&gt;", as expressed by the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; government. 

The statement released on March 14 (Monday) by the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed strong disapproval of any external attempt to obstruct the Chinese objective of reunifying their country. According to Cuba, &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; is an inalienable part of &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and the Cuban government rejects any attempt to consider Taiwan as an independent territory.

The note mentions the principle of territorial integrity established in the UN Charter and in Resolution 2758 passed by the General Assembly of UN in 1971. Resolution 2758 replaced the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; with the People's Republic of China as &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20and%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;China's representative in the UN&lt;/a&gt;.

Roll up displays for use in hand-held gadgets will be available for mass production by March 2007 according to co-developer Philips. Working with US based paper pioneer E-ink, Philips have developed a 13cm wide screen which is just 0.1 millimetres thick and can be rolled up so that it is only 15 millimetres in diameter. 

The screen, which Philips hope to license to makers of in-car satellite navigation systems, mobile web browsers and smart phones, uses no back light and displays a monochrome image in four shades of grey as well as black and white. According to Philips the screen is able to give a “paper-like contrast”.

The screen consists of a backing layer of plastic film which contains a matrix of transistors. This is topped off with layer transparent “electronic ink” capsules and a layer of clear plastic. The capsules are approximately 50 micrometres in diameter and contain polarised black and white particles. Using the transistors, a pattern of positive and negative charge can be applied which manipulates the particles to form monochrome images.

Visibly relieved and sobbing as the verdict was read, &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Blake%20%28actor%29"&gt;Robert Blake&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="w%3AAquit"&gt;acquitted&lt;/a&gt; on all counts and walked out of the courtroom yesterday a free man.

Charged with murdering his wife, the jury acquitted Blake due to lack of evidence. He was also charged with two counts of &lt;a href="w%3ASolicitation"&gt;soliciting&lt;/a&gt; to have his wife Bonnie Lee Bakley killed. The jury acquitted him on one count, and the judge dismissed the second after the jury became deadlocked in an 11-1 vote.
He was greeted by a crowd of cheering supporters outside the courthouse. The star of the television series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABaretta%20%28television%29"&gt;Baretta&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ crushed out one of his trademark cigarettes and spoke to the gathering, thanking his lawyers and private investigators who he described as, "This small band of dedicated warriors that saved my life."

In a speech that lasted 30 minutes, he talked of having to spend $10 million for his defense and said that he was now a poor man who needed a job. The 71 year-old actor also said he was ready to "cowboy it...Get in a motor home or van, feel the wind in my hair and find a little bar in &lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; or someplace."

The prosecution, which did not seek the death penalty, painted Blake as caught in a loveless marriage with Bakley. Tricked into marrying her by his love of their daughter Rosie, now 4, they claimed that he had felt trapped by a woman who had a history of being a low-life grifter. They alleged that Blake, frustrated after trying to find someone to kill his wife for him, killed her himself. They also claimed that he was the trigger man who, after dining with his wife in their favorite restaurant, put two bullets in her head as the two of them sat in their car outside. 

The jury foreman in the trial, Thomas Nicholson, described the prosecution case against Blake as "flimsy." He said "they could never connect all the links in the chain. We couldn’t put the gun in his hand." Blake's defense team was also able to successfully discredit witnesses who testified on the solicitation charges.

&lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;an activists are demanding that the &lt;a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; release Gedhun Choekyi Nyima and his family. Nyima, aged 16, is considered the 11th &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APanchen%20Lama"&gt;Panchen Lama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by Tibetan &lt;a href="Buddhism"&gt;Buddhists&lt;/a&gt;. The Pachen Lama is the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism.

Tibetan activists say that Nyima and his family were kidnapped by Chinese authorities on May 17, 1995, just days after the boy was recognized as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Areincarnation"&gt;reincarnation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the 10th Panchen Lama by the &lt;a href="w%3ADalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;. At that time the boy was 6 years old. Human rights groups claim that he is the youngest political prisoner ever.

The whereabouts of Nyima and his parents are unknown. The Chinese government claims to be protecting them because of death threats they have received and say that the boy is in school and that he and his family are happy.

Tibetans don't believe the government's version of the events and are campaigning for the Panchen Lama to be released. 
After the arrest of the Panchen Lama, China named a rival boy, Gyancain Norbu, the son of a communist, to the office. The new boy is not well supported by most parts of the Tibetan community.

Two dog attacks in a week puts &lt;a href="w%3ASpotsylvania%20County"&gt;Spotsylania County&lt;/a&gt; authorities in the spotlight to take action on pet owners for their dog's behavior. In unrelated incidences, an elderly woman was killed and another woman was bitten. Three dogs have been shot dead by police.

An 82 year old woman was walking her &lt;a href="w%3AShih%20Tzu"&gt;Shih Tzu&lt;/a&gt; breed of dog in her front yard last week when she came under attack by three &lt;a href="w%3APit%20Bull"&gt;Pit Bulls.&lt;/a&gt; She died being transported to the hospital after police responded and shot two of the attacking dogs. They later captured the third dog and &lt;a href="w%3Aeuthanize"&gt;euthanized&lt;/a&gt; it.

More recently, a 31 year old woman was bitten on her hand during a fight that ensued between two Pit Bulls in her back yard. The responding police officer shot the aggressor dog.

Public outcry over the death of the elderly woman stirred procecutors to charge the dogs’ owner, Deeana Large, with &lt;a href="w%3AInvoluntary%20manslaughter"&gt;involuntary manslaughter.&lt;/a&gt; This is a first for the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; where charges that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years are leveled in a case involving a pet's owner. In order to gain an indictment, prosecuters will have to prove the dogs' owner was &lt;a href="w%3Acriminal"&gt;criminally negligent&lt;/a&gt;. In the biting incident, the attacking dog’s owner faces a misdemeanor charge of letting the dog run at large.

Deeana Large, who initially said she owned only 1 of the 3 dogs involved in the mauling case, has not yet been formally charged and awaits indictment. Investigators in the case say there were earlier reports of her dogs allegedly killing a &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20Shepard"&gt;German Shepard&lt;/a&gt; and a kittten in her neighborhood. Complaints by neighbors spurred an animal control officer to be looking for the dogs at the time the woman was killed.

Rodrigo Granda, also known as Ricardo Gonzalez, was arrested by &lt;a href="w%3AColombian"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; forces on December 13, 2004.
The communist group &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (FARC) claims the arrest is illegal, since Granda was in &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; for purposes related to his work as a international FARC delegate. However, the Colombia government does not recognize the FARC as a legitimate political group and accuses the FARC of terrorism and drug trafficking.

According to a note released by the FARC, several communist parties are showing solidarity with the FARC by protesting the arrest of Rodrigo Granda. In addition, they criticize the extradition of the FARC commander Simón Trinidad to the United States of America.

The political parties are:Communist Party of Greece,
Portuguese Communist Party,
Communist Party of the People of Spain,
Communist Party of Spain,
New Communist Party Netherlands,
Communist Party of Ireland,
Workers Party of Ireland,

The late &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20McCartney%20%28murder%20victim%29"&gt;Robert McCartney's&lt;/a&gt; five sisters are visiting the United States in an effort to place pressure on the &lt;a href="w%3AIRA"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt;. They are meeting with &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; and other political leaders to gather support. They are also meeting with President Bush on St. Patrick's day, and will give him a dossier. They accuse IRA members of killing their brother during a brawl in a &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; bar in January. &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt; is also alleged to have attempted to cover up the incident by at least one of the women.

&lt;a href="w%3ACatherine%20McCartney"&gt;Catherine McCartney&lt;/a&gt; said to the BBC, "We have to be very careful that we're not being used by anybody and that includes Sinn Féin and all political parties, we're not stupid women... We get the impression that someone thinks out there that somebody's behind this, pulling our strings. The only person behind this is our Robert and he is the person pulling our strings."

In response to the killing, the IRA expelled three of its members and Sinn Féin expelled seven. Also, the IRA offered to shoot the men responsible for the killing, an offer which the McCartney family declined.

Two Sinn Féin candidates were in the bar on the night of the killing.

The former Argentine soccer player &lt;a href="w%3ADiego%20Armando%20Maradona"&gt;Diego Armando Maradona&lt;/a&gt;, aged 44, was honored with the keys to the &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3ACartagena%2C%20Colombia"&gt;Cartagena&lt;/a&gt;. 

Maradona is in Cartagena recovering from stomach surgery he had to reduce the size of his waist. The surgury was necessary because Maradona is suffering of severe &lt;a href="w%3Aobesity"&gt;obesity problems&lt;/a&gt; which may put his life at risk. He is 5 foot 6 inches (1.67 meters) tall and weighs 267 pounds (121 kg). 

The Argentine was grateful for the homage and showed good humour:
"I want to thank the mayor for giving me the keys to the city. Even though I do not have the keys to my own house, I have a key to the people, like those of Cartagena, and it fills me with pride." 

He added: "I offer my thanks in my own name, in the name of my two daughters and that of my whole family. Thank you Cartagena and thank you Colombia."

<h1>Brazilian Abin director: no proof linking FARC money to PT</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Brazilian%20Abin%20director%3A%20no%20proof%20linking%20FARC%20money%20to%20PT&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Head Minister of the Institutional Security Cabinet of &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;'s General Jorge Felix, and the director-general of the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (&lt;a href="w%3AAg%C3%AAncia%20Brasileira%20de%20Intelig%C3%AAncia"&gt;Abin&lt;/a&gt;), Mauro Marcelo de Lima e Silva say that the documents mentioned by the Brazilian magazine &lt;a href="w%3AVeja%20%28magazine%29"&gt;♡❤Veja♡❤&lt;/a&gt; may be incorrect. Last weekend, ♡❤Veja♡❤ reported that &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Partido dos Trabalhadores&lt;/a&gt; (or PT), the Brazilian ruling party and the party of president &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;, received 5 million dollars from &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt; in its 2002 political campaign. The magazine used documents gotten from Abin itself as a source in their reporting.

Felix testified before a commission of deputies and senators to explain the allegations published by ♡❤Veja♡❤. His statements make the possibility of a congressional investigation commission, as suggested by the deputy Alberto Fraga (PTB), unlikely. The leader of the government, Aloísio Mercadante, said PT will prosecute Fraga for defamation and that he considers the case finished.
The official Abin version &lt;a href="http%3A//www.abin.gov.br/abin/nota_internet_170305.htm"&gt;is stated on its website.&lt;/a&gt; The agency stores and archives all data collected by the intelligence service. Even data that does not fulfill all the Abin criterion for consistency and veracity remain in the Abin archive so they can be re-evaluated in the future. According to Felix, Abin archives may contain data that are not relevant, tendentious or even completely untrue. The documents mentioned by the magazine ♡❤Veja♡❤ are a kind of this material. Since Abin cannot guarantee the veracity of these data, they should not be reported.

The general didn't say whether or not Abin confirmed the meeting between FARC delegates and PT members as stated in the documents. "I can't speak about that in front of the press", he added, explaining that the documents are a state secret.

The magazine ♡❤Veja♡❤ was very cautious when it reported the story. The article says that they did not find solid evidence to prove that PT received money from FARC. ♡❤Veja♡❤ investigated the facts described in the documents and admitted the donation could be untrue: 

Although they found no solid proof relating the money transaction, and although the magazine considered the Abin's documents might be untrue, ♡❤Veja♡❤ said the documents were consistent enough to be sent to the President: 

Some deputies demand further investigations of alleged FARC activities in Brazil.
The Brazilian Deputy Arthur Virgílio (PSDB) said: "These investigations cannot stop... I give to PT the benefit of doubt as an institution. However the ideologic political relationship is evident." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.psdb.org.br/noticias/noticias.asp%3Fid%3D16102"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Brazilian Deputy Antero Paes de Barros (PSDB) said: "There must be more clarifications because the State interest is high in this case". 

The FARC and PT are part of the &lt;a href="w%3AForo%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;Foro de São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; organization created by Cuban President &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; to discuss new strategies for the left in &lt;a href="w%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; after the fall of the &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%20Wall"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt; and collapse of &lt;a href="w%3ACommunism"&gt;Communism&lt;/a&gt; in .

PT admits that some of its members have met FARC members in the past, but maintains the FARC donation are untrue. The party said if evidence showing its members received money from the FARC was found, that member would be expelled from the party. They also said if a donation occurred, it would be confirmed by the Brazilian Central Bank's records, and it has not. PT believes the alleged party relationship with FARC is being used by the political opposition in negative propaganda. 

According to the president of the Joint Congressional Commission for the Control of Intelligence Activities, Senator Cristovam Buarque (PT-DF) the investigation is finished. The senator said that the accusation of the alleged donation of 5 million dollars to the PT was a sad
episode because it affected a party's credibility without anybody seeing any proof.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="w%3AZoe%20%28robot%29"&gt;Zoë&lt;/a&gt;, a four-wheeled robot constructed by &lt;a href="w%3ACarnegie%20Mellon%E2%80%99s%20Robotics%20Institute"&gt;Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute&lt;/a&gt;, is the first rover-based system to discover life. Although the presence of life in the &lt;a href="w%3AChilly"&gt;Chilean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAtacama%20Desert"&gt;Atacama Desert&lt;/a&gt; is no surprise, Zoe is a step forward in an effort to design automated systems to find life on &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;.

Zoë, named after the &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; word for "life", is part of a three-year &lt;a href="w%3ALife%20in%20the%20Atacama%20project"&gt;Life in the Atacama project&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AAstrobiology%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Program%20for%20Exploring%20Planets"&gt;Astrobiology Science and Technology Program for Exploring Planets&lt;/a&gt; (ASTEP). It was specifically designed to be deployed as a remotely-operated or autonomous &lt;a href="w%3Arover%20%28space%29"&gt;rover&lt;/a&gt;.

The life Zoë was able to detect came from four elements. Zoë detected signs of &lt;a href="w%3Achlorophyll"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aprotein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, which are strong indications of life. Scientists then gathered visual evidence from the pictures taken by Zoë. The research was presented this week at the 36th &lt;a href="w%3ALunar%20and%20Planetary%20Science%20Conference"&gt;Lunar and Planetary Science Conference&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The study was led by &lt;a href="w%3ANathalie%20Cabrol"&gt;Nathalie Cabrol&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Aplanetary%20science"&gt;planetary scientist&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="w%3AAmes%20Research%20Center"&gt;Ames Research Center&lt;/a&gt;.

One of the important new features developed for Zoë is a &lt;a href="w%3Afluorescence%20imager"&gt;fluorescence imager&lt;/a&gt; in the shadow under its belly that can be used in daytime. This tool scans for &lt;a href="w%3Achlorophyll-based-life"&gt;chlorophyll-based-life&lt;/a&gt; that would otherwise be rendered undetectable by sunlight. Zoë also carries a &lt;a href="w%3Aspectrometer"&gt;spectrometer&lt;/a&gt; that scans for chlorophyll using &lt;a href="w%3Avisible%20light"&gt;visible&lt;/a&gt; and near-&lt;a href="w%3Ainfrared%20light"&gt;infrared&lt;/a&gt; light.

Zoë searched for signs of life in coastal and inland regions of the Atacama Desert between August and October of 2004. She was remote conrolled from &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; while a ground crew followed her to verify her detections.

With studies suggesting the existence of life on Mars, the new system may soon see implementation.

<h1>Wolfowitz picked for top spot at World Bank</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wolfowitz%20picked%20for%20top%20spot%20at%20World%20Bank&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The announced the selection of &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Wolfowitz"&gt;Paul Wolfowitz&lt;/a&gt; to head the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, replacing &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Wolfensohn"&gt;John Wolfensohn&lt;/a&gt; who retires as acting president after 10 years. The switch is expected to occur sometime in June.

The choice of Wolfowitz is raising controversy in &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adeveloping%20nations"&gt;developing nations&lt;/a&gt;. Known as hawkish and outspoken, Wolfowitz was a &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20in%20Iraq"&gt;pro-Iraqi war&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aneo-conservative"&gt;neo-conservative&lt;/a&gt; in his role as &lt;a href="w%3Adeputy%20Secretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;deputy Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, and a chief architect in the build up to war with Iraq. Some question whether Wolfowitz, who was criticized for brushing aside European and &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; calls for caution before the Iraq war, would use the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; (IMF) as tool to extend &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20foreign%20policy"&gt;U.S. foreign policy&lt;/a&gt; interests. 

Historically, it has been the White House’s prerogative to name the candidate because the U.S. holds a majority on the 24 member board, but board members from nations other than the U.S. are seeking their own interviews to qualify the candidate before a change is made. "The executive directors have agreed to conduct informal meetings over the coming days with the US nominee as part of the consultative process." the IMF said in a statement. "Thereafter, the executive directors will meet in a formal session to select the president at which time an official announcement of the outcome will be made," it said. The vote is set for March 31, the same day Wolfensohn retires.

&lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Nichols"&gt;Rob Nichols&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Treasury"&gt;US Treasury&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson, said Wolfowitz has begun scheduling meetings with board members and that, "Our nominee… looks forward to meeting with and listening to members of the World Bank board." &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported. In the meantime, Wolfowitz has worked to assure those with concerns of him, saying he would come with an open mind and no political program.

Nashville, United States – 
The famous &lt;a href="w%3Asci-fi"&gt;sci-fi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Afantasy"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; writer &lt;a href="w%3AAndre%20Norton"&gt;Andre Norton&lt;/a&gt; dies aged 93 of congestive heart failure at her home in Murfreesboro, a &lt;a href="w%3ANashville"&gt;Nashville&lt;/a&gt; suburb.

Probably one of the first good things to come out of the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;2004 Tsunami&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAsia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, ancient ruins were discovered in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. Fishermen along the shores report seeing the ruins along the shoreline near &lt;a href="w%3AMahabalipuram"&gt;Mahabalipuram&lt;/a&gt; when the waters receded just prior to the arrival of the tsunami. Mahabalipuram is a port city of &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;South India&lt;/a&gt;, dating back to the &lt;a href="w%3A7th%20century"&gt;7th century&lt;/a&gt;, around 60 km south from the city of &lt;a href="w%3AChennai"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATamil%20Nadu"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;.

The fishermen reported a complex consisting of ancient temples. Some mention seeing at least 20 distinct temples, and hundreds of refrigerator-sized blocks. The walls were covered with barnacles, coral and mud. Local folklore tells of an ancient port in the area.

On the shore, three structures consisting of elaborate carvings in the shape of animals were uncovered. The structures appear to have been covered in sand, which had been wiped away by the force of the tsunami. The structures appear to belong to a port city built in the 7th century, said &lt;a href="w%3AT.%20Satyamurthy"&gt;T. Satyamurthy&lt;/a&gt;, a senior archaeologist with the &lt;a href="w%3AArchaeological%20Survey%20of%20India"&gt;Archaeological Survey of India&lt;/a&gt;. The sculptures, representing an elephant, a lion and a flying horse, were commonly used during the &lt;a href="w%3AAncient%20India%23Pallavas"&gt;Pallava dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, which ran from the &lt;a href="w%3A4th%20century"&gt;4th&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3A9th%20century"&gt;9th century&lt;/a&gt;, archeologists say.

The temples along the shores of Mahabalipuram are already a famous feature of the city, and have been declared a &lt;a href="w%3AUNESCO"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Heritage"&gt;World Heritage&lt;/a&gt; site. Legend has it that the city was home to seven &lt;a href="w%3Apagodas"&gt;pagodas&lt;/a&gt;. Underwater excavations of the area by the archaeological society, run by the Indian government and navy divers, began on Thursday.

&lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; secretary &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Murphy%20%28politician%29"&gt;Paul Murphy&lt;/a&gt; said there is "no hope" of political progress on peace talks until all &lt;a href="w%3AProvisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; "criminal activity" has been dealt with.

Mr Murphy praised the courage of the McCartney sisters' campaign for justice for those responsible in the murder of their brother &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20McCartney"&gt;Robert McCartney&lt;/a&gt;. Their brother was stabbed and kicked to death after an altercation in a bar in the center of &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;. The gang which killed him included at least three members of the IRA. 

Mr Murphy's comments came during a visit the sisters made to &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;. They met &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; who is said to have offered support and encouragement for their campaign. &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt;, leader of &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt;, has pointedly not been invited to the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. 

Belfast's self-governing assembly is the product of a peace deal made in &lt;a href="w%3A1998"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;. It collapsed two years ago, leaving the British province to be run directly from &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; ever since. Attempts to restore the assembly have met numerous obstacles in the intervening years, mostly centered on the presence and actions of the IRA. 

In recent weeks the IRA has been linked not only to the murder of Robert McCartney, but also to the widely publicised &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Bank%20robbery"&gt;theft from the Northern Bank of £26 million&lt;/a&gt; in December. 

"As far as the political process is concerned, to all intents and purposes we are not talking about any future negotiations or discussions until the issue about criminal activity on the part of the IRA is addressed," Mr Murphy has said. Until that happens, there "wasn't any hope at all" of progress to restore the institutions of government to Northern Ireland. He added that the McCartney sisters "remarkable campaign" had "personalised the issue of criminal activity" and given a face to individuals suffering from brutality and savagery.

Gerry Adams said the case has become steeped in politics, and the only people that could not be accused of political motivation were the McCartney sisters themselves. 

Reported separately, the controversial 'detention-without-trial orders', brought in last week under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, could be used against members of the IRA. The government has refused to rule out the possibility of control orders being used on members of the group. Home Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Clarke"&gt;Charles Clarke&lt;/a&gt; has said that the orders had been working well in their first few days although there had been some teething problems.

The amount of alcohol people drink may be influenced by their genes.
A new study has found a link between specific &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agenes"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , drinking habits, and possibly alcohol addiction. 

The study, by &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; researchers at the universities of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oxford"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , involved data from nearly 1,000 people who provided detailed information about their drinking habits. 

The researchers focused on a gene that controls chemical signaling in the brain. 

Different versions of the gene may influence the balance and effect of signaling molecules. 

One genetic variant—a version of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene—was strongly linked with alcohol consumption. 

DRD2 appears to affect positive feelings from alcohol, meaning that people without the variant might find drinking less pleasurable. 

The research is reported in ♡❤The Pharmacogenomics Journal♡❤.

According to a quarterly report by &lt;a href="w%3AComReg"&gt;ComReg&lt;/a&gt; (Commission for Communications Regulation) on the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Atelecommunications"&gt;telecommunications&lt;/a&gt; market released today, Irish &lt;a href="w%3Amobile%20phone"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; penetration has hit a new record of 94%. This is an increase of 6% from the same time last year, when penetration rates stood at 88%. The statistic means that there are now 3.78 million mobile phone subscribers in Ireland. The document also indicated that the number of &lt;a href="w%3ABroadband%20Internet%20access"&gt;broadband&lt;/a&gt; customers in Ireland now stands at 131,550.

Among other things the statistics revealed that:

The fireball occurred as scientists conducted experiments involving the smashing of streams of &lt;a href="w%3Agold"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; nuclei together in the RHIC and is reported to have been three hundred times hotter than the &lt;a href="w%3Asun"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;. It absorbed more than ten times the predicted amount of energy and radiated it as heat, a behavior characteristic of black holes.

Scientists have reassured the public that this phenomenon does not pose a threat; the fireball existed for one millionth of one billionth of one billionth of one second (one second divided by 10 septillion &amp;mdash; a 1 followed by 25 zeroes) and was not dominated by &lt;a href="w%3Agravity"&gt;gravity&lt;/a&gt; as previously observed black holes have been, providing the energy for their cataclysmic appetites.

&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; announced that their military conducted a successful test-firing of a &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20weapon"&gt;nuclear-capable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aballistic%20missile"&gt;missile&lt;/a&gt;, with a range of 2,000 km (1,200 miles), earlier today.

"Today, we carried out a successful test-firing of the indigenously developed Shaheen II missile," announced a Pakistani military official.

A statement issued by the Pakistani military noted that Pakistan gave prior notice of the test to nearby countries.

"The test was carried out to verify some of the refined technical parameters," the statement said, "Al Hamd-o-Lillah' (With the grace of God) all parameters were validated."

Pakistani President General &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; congratulated the engineers and scientists who conducted the successful test.
"The capability was here to stay, will continue to go from strength to strength and no harm will ever be allowed to come to it," said Musharraf.

The ♡❤Press Trust of India♡❤ pointed out that the missile, "was capable of hitting targets deep into the Indian territory," and that the missile had been test-fired previously under the name ♡❤Hatf-VI♡❤, as a counterpart to India's ♡❤Agni-II♡❤ missile system.

&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and Pakistan have both conducted a series of missile tests in the region.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASaturn%20%28planet%29"&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt; exploration spacecraft, &lt;a href="w%3ACassini-Huygens"&gt;Cassini&lt;/a&gt;, has discovered an atmosphere about the moon &lt;a href="w%3AEnceladus%20%28moon%29"&gt;Enceladus&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first such discovery by Cassini, other than &lt;a href="w%3ATitan%20%28moon%29"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, of the presence of an atmosphere around a Saturn moon.

Enceladus's gravity is too weak to hold an atmosphere around the planet, leading scientists to believe that volcanism, geysers, or gases escaping from the surface or the interior as a continuous source for the atmosphere.

The atmosphere was detected using a &lt;a href="w%3Amagnetometer"&gt;magnetometer&lt;/a&gt; during two close flybys of Enceladus on February 17 and March 9. The magnetometer is used to measure the magnitude and direction of magnetic fields surrounding Saturn and its moons. The magnetometer detected a bending of Saturn's magnetic field around the moon, indicating the Saturnian &lt;a href="w%3Aplasma"&gt;plasma&lt;/a&gt; is being diverted away from an extended atmosphere. The observations from the Enceladus flybys are believed to be due to ionized water vapor.

"These new results from Cassini may be the first evidence of gases originating either from the surface or possibly from the interior of Enceladus," said Dr. Michele Dougherty, principal investigator for the Cassini magnetometer and professor at Imperial College in London.

Scientists have suspected Enceladus as geologically active and a possible source of Saturn's icy E ring. Enceladus is the most reflective object in the solar system, reflecting about 90 percent of the sunlight that hits it.
Cassini first arrived in Saturn orbit July 1, 2004, releasing the &lt;a href="w%3AHuygens%20probe"&gt;Huygens&lt;/a&gt; Titan probe on December 25, 2004 which landed on Titan January 14, 2005.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the &lt;a href="w%3AESA"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Italian Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;. The Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at the &lt;a href="w%3AJPL"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in Pasadena, California.

It is the Welsh &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arugby"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; team's first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Slam"&gt;Grand Slam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; since 1978.

It was clear from an early stage that Wales was on course for a win, with the score being 16-3 mid-way through the first half. The Irish effort improved in the second half with two &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATry"&gt;trys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; closing the gap - but it was never going to be enough to beat a superb Welsh side.

The result means Wales have remained unbeaten throughout the tournament.

Today, Saturday the 19th of March, thousands across Europe marked the second anniversary of the US-led war on Iraq with protest marches and rallies for peace. 

&lt;a href="Anti-war%20march%20in%20London"&gt;Anti-war march in London&lt;/a&gt;: In &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London, UK&lt;/a&gt;, police said 45,000 people took part in a march following the traditional route; a Hyde Park start, past the US Embassy and finishing in Trafalgar Square. According to organisers, almost 100,000 people took part. There were no reports of violence or unrest at the rally.

In &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul"&gt;Istanbul, Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, about 15,000 people marched to protest against the continued US presence in Iraq.

&lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens, Greece&lt;/a&gt;, was brought to a standstill by more than 5000 trade unionists who marched to the US Embassy.

Meanwhile, more than 400 miles away from London, in the Welsh coastal town of &lt;a href="w%3AAberystwyth"&gt;Aberystwyth&lt;/a&gt;, about two hundred people also took part in a peace rally. The first annual ♡❤All Wales Peace Festival♡❤ (♡❤Gwl heddwch a chyfianwnder Cymru gyfan♡❤) took place on an unseasonably warm and sunny day for mid-March in the coastal town. 

Lasting about an hour, the rally made its way around the streets of the town, making its way to the ruined castle that overlooks the town, where the crowd heard speeches by a number of individuals, including Ken Booth, the head of Aberystwyth University's renowned International Politics department. There was no suggestion of violence at the rally, with a wide variety of people from different backgrounds making up the march.

Police presence at the march was moderately heavy yet restrained, with the police evidently not wishing for a repeat of the scenes two years ago when authorities were taken completely by surprise as protesters brought much of the town to a halt and occupied the council tax offices for two hours.

Attendance at all protests was a mere shadow of that just before the start of the 2003 war, when London saw over a million take to the streets to protest the imminent invasion.

<h1>Texas representative proposes to outlaw 'sexy' cheerleading</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Texas%20representative%20proposes%20to%20outlaw%20%27sexy%27%20cheerleading&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; representative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Edwards"&gt;Al Edwards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; proposed a bill last week to ban "sexually suggestive" &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acheerleading"&gt;cheerleading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Texas &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahigh%20school"&gt;high schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amiddle%20school"&gt;middle schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aelementary%20school"&gt;elementary schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The movements typical to cheerleading are sexual, said Edwards, and send out the wrong message, especially as youth should be encouraged to be more reserved where sex is concerned. The penalty for schools that continue to allow the activity would be a cut in state funding.

Edwards filed the bill after witnessing several performances in his district.

Several others agree with Edwards’ proposal.

"Anything that promotes family-oriented behaviour is a good thing," said Rhonda Roberts, a director for the United Spirit Association.

"I don't think this law would really shake the industry at all. In fact, it would give parents a better feeling, mostly dads and boyfriends, too," said J.M. Farias, who owns Austin Cheer Factory. He pointed out that cheering competitions frown on the movements in question.

Cheerleading is a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arecreation"&gt;recreational&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; activity and sometimes competitive &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asport"&gt;sport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; involving organised routines including elements of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adance"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agymnastics"&gt;gymnastics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to encourage crowds to cheer on sports teams. It is a popular activity practised by millions of American students. In Texas, there are competitions that start at the age of four.

<h1>Lebanese President to skip Arab Summit</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Lebanese%20President%20to%20skip%20Arab%20Summit&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AEmile%20Lahoud"&gt;Emile Lahoud&lt;/a&gt; said he will not be attending the upcoming Arab summit scheduled for Monday. The announcement was made Saturday after a &lt;a href="w%3Acar%20bomb"&gt;car bomb&lt;/a&gt; in the early morning hours wrecked a six-story apartment building, causing injuries, but there have been no reports of deaths.

It is not clear at this time who is responsible for the bombing. Both the Lebanese and &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n governments denied any involvement. There was an accusation, reported by &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; on Sat Mar 19, 2005 12:27 PM ET, made by key opposition leader, &lt;a href="w%3AWalid%20Jumblatt"&gt;Walid Jumblatt&lt;/a&gt;, saying, "The security agencies belong to ♡❤it♡❤ (meaning Syria). There is no other explanation. When security agencies come under Lebanese control it will be another matter." The opposition wants Syrian military and intelligence agents out of the country and opposes the pro-Syrian Lahoud and Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt;. 

The violence threatens efforts by opposition groups and pro-government groups to build consensus and stability before the upcoming national election in May. Mr. Lahoud's office released a statement today that read: "The president affirms the need for such a dialogue meeting starting today in any place they agree on, including the presidential palace, which will keep its doors open."

The president's invitation was dismissed by an opposition legislator. The AP reports Fares Soeid saying, "It's too late. This subject is closed."
