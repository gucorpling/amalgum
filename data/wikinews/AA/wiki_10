&lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; believes it has successfully identified a &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;potential terrorist attack&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Parliament"&gt;British Parliament&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; being planned by an &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qa%27ida"&gt;al-Qa'ida&lt;/a&gt; group. 

The plot was discovered by authorities after utilizing an informant's abilities to decipher &lt;a href="w%3Aencryption"&gt;encrypted&lt;/a&gt; e-mails. British police and MI5 then identified the terrorist cell that had been video recording potential targets.

The reported plan was to involve the release of &lt;a href="w%3Asarin"&gt;sarin&lt;/a&gt; gas, a highly toxic substance that the United Nations has classified as a &lt;a href="w%3Aweapon%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;weapon of mass destruction&lt;/a&gt;. As well as Parliament, the terrorists may also have been targeting the Underground system.

The ability to crack the code the terrorists were using also enabled "several other" plots to be discovered.

Security officials are also said to have stated that Parliament's security is "unacceptable". A special forces team is said to have examined existing security measures and reported that a &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Cab"&gt;Black Cab&lt;/a&gt; could be used by suicide bombers to attack, and that a forthcoming &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Fawkes"&gt;Guy Fawkes&lt;/a&gt; exhibition could present an opportunity for an attack.

The time is 1100 UTC on Monday 22nd August 2005, and this is Audio Wikinews: News Briefs.

&lt;a href="Utah%20dance%20party%20broken%20up%20by%20police"&gt;Utah dance party broken up by police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
About 90 law enforcement officers from multiple agencies broke up what they said was a rave party on public and private property in the Diamond Fork area of Spanish Fork canyon, an hour outside of Salt Lake City, Utah, on Saturday. Armed with assault rifles and tear gas, the police used dogs to sweep the crowd for narcotics. The scale of the police response was apparently due to the ineffectiveness of a smaller force used in the previous "Sequence Five" rave.

&lt;a href="One%20million%20pilgrims%20attend%20open-air%20mass%20with%20Pope"&gt;One million pilgrims attend open-air mass with Pope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Catholic World Youth Day 2005 concluded yesterday with an open-air mass by Pope Benedict XVI at the Marienfeld, about 15 km west of Cologne.
Speaking to some one million pilgrims from about 200 countries the Pope called for a "return to God". In his sermon, he condemned the commercialisation of faith and said that -quote- "Religion constructed on a 'do-it-yourself' basis cannot ultimately help us".
&lt;a href="Space%20shuttle%20Discovery%20back%20in%20Florida"&gt;Space shuttle Discovery back in Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Space Shuttle Discovery has returned to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
The 109 ton vehicle was flown back from Edwards Airforce Base (AFB) in California on top of a modified Boeing 747 known as the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. The 3,591 km journey across the United States took 2 days and cost about one million dollars.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Applications%20Office"&gt;Central Applications Office&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland has released the first round of offers for places on third level courses to over 60,000 Irish &lt;a href="w%3ALeaving%20Certificate"&gt;Leaving Certificate&lt;/a&gt; students (graduating secondary school students). 

The offers are given out based on a highly competitive points system whereby students receive from 
<ul>
BULLET::::- 100 points for an A1 to 45 points for a D3 at higher level.
BULLET::::- 60 points for an A1 to 5 points for a D3 on lower level.

</ul>
Points from a student's best six subjects are added up to make his or her total points. This year 145 students achieved the maximum 600 points. Students achieveing this are generally regarded as the top students academically in the country.

Points required for courses in medicine and nursing have risen again leaving many candidates disappointed. Due to the huge popularity of medicine and the low supply of courses, points for entry into medicine are in the region of 580 points. Points for arts, engineering and commerce have fallen marginally. 

While the points system is often attacked for placing too much pressure on students, it has avoided the problem of grade inflation that has occurred in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. The Leaving Certificate exam has remained largely unchanged since its inception in 1924. It is often joked that the same questions reappear on the papers every 30 or 40 years.

Young &lt;a href="w%3AQuaker"&gt;Quakers&lt;/a&gt; who planned to take part in the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wgyf.org/"&gt;World Gathering of Young Friends&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ALancaster%20University"&gt;Lancaster University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; have been unable to attend after having their visas denied. 

Their absence has been a cause of "hurt" at the meetings. Sara Wolcott of Pacific Yearly Meeting on the Western coast of America wrote in a journal on the WGYF website: "I saw [in a workshop for Friends planning to meet in Kenya] how much the absence of so many Friends was felt; the gathering felt incomplete. We desperately wanted our brothers and sisters to be with us, I know they wanted to be here too."

Most of the denials were for economic reasons, if someone doesn't have a high enough income or a fixed job it can be assumed that they will stay in the country for work. Representatives from the gathering now plan to go to Kenya in October to share some of the programme with those who were unable to come. 

Despite the missing Friends, the gathering has brought together a mix of different Quaker traditions in a positive atmosphere that has been appreciated by participants. Many Quakers worship in silence (unprogrammed meetings) while others, particularly in America and Africa, have ministers like other churches. Quakers also have differences of opinion over theological issues, including even the existence of God, but the young Friends have not found this to be an obstacle to coming together. Unlike many traditional Christian sects, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, encourage each member to explore his or her own relationship with God.

Chrissy Muhr of Northwest Yearly Meeting (Northwest US) wrote: "I've been really impressed by how the mix of worship styles has been handled. Almost all the programmed Friends I've spoken to have some prior experience of unprogrammed worship. For me, the hardest thing has been not falling asleep during long periods of silence - the long week has begun to take its toll."

In San Pasqual a brush fire was dealt with as it burned four acres of wildlands. 

This may have been due to sparks from a vehicle accident. The blaze lasted from 3:30 to 4:30 PM until fire trucks and many other emergency vehicles helped stop the blaze.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20A.%20Moog"&gt;Robert A. Moog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , inventor, founder of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoog%20Music"&gt;Moog Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and musical revolutionary, died Sunday at the age of 71 in his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAshville%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Ashville, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; home. 

Moog was diagnosed with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abrain%20cancer"&gt;brain cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in April and underwent treatment for it. 

Thoug Bob Moog is best knwon for his bringing of synthesizers into popular music and his appreciation for "the magical connection" between musicians and their instruments, Moog had a childhood interest with the &lt;a href="w%3Atheremin"&gt;theremin&lt;/a&gt;, an early electronic musical instrument. He developed his first synthesizer (the Moog Modular Synthesizer) in 1963, while still a Ph.D student at &lt;a href="Cornell%20University"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;. He was recognized with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20Trustees%20Award"&gt;Grammy Trustees Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for lifetime achievement in 1970. 

Moog is survived by his wife and five children who have announced the formation of The Bob Moog Memorial Fund for the advancement of electronic music.

On Monday in Italy at 14:02 Italian local time, an &lt;a href="w%3AEarthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; was registered at 4.5 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20scale"&gt;Richter scale&lt;/a&gt; epicentered in the sea near &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;. Some residents of &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding towns who felt the quake went out into city streets to avoid any possible serious destruction or to discuss the tremor with neighbours.

No serious damage has been reported and due to the relatively small magnitude of the quake minimal structural damage to ancient Roman monuments is believed to have occurred. Structural inspections are being made to ensure safety and stability of the historic landmarks.

Australian media analysis program ♡❤Media Watch♡❤ has accused popular national "current affairs" style program &lt;a href="w%3AToday%20Tonight"&gt;Today Tonight&lt;/a&gt; of deliberately quoting a Muslim youth out of context, with the intention of presenting a negative stereotype of the Muslim community. The allegations were aired during Monday night's episode.

According to Mediawatch, Abdul Elayoubi of the Lebanese Muslim Association was approached by Tim Noonan, a freelance film producer wanting to produce a short documentary to air on the &lt;a href="w%3ASeven%20Network"&gt;Seven Network&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Elayoubi was cautious because of a prior misrepresentation, however was assured that the program would "show Australians from non-Islamic backgrounds the viewpoint of young Muslims and the pressure they face in an often hostile society", according to a letter from Peter Meakin, the Seven Network's head of news and current affairs. Elayoubi said "Tim told us he’d be doing the editing himself and would give it to Channel 7 completed," and was assured that quotes would not be taken out of context to further vilify Australian Muslims.

Three Muslim youths, Khaled, Ahmed and Samir, agreed to participate in the documentary. Despite prior reassurances, Tim Noonan did not produce a completed documentary. The film was subsequently narrated by David Richardson, who had not met the boys and who got Samir's name wrong throughout the piece.

The quote "we will never integrate, the way other communities integrate purely because of the fact that you have to draw a line with what your idea of integration is and what our idea of integration and accepting the practices of other people are," was reduced to "we will never integrate" during editing. Ahmed stated that the full quote itself was made to camera after a discussion including talk of how the Islamic rule prohibiting consumption of alcohol was a barrier to full social integration.

The interviewer, Tim Noonan, dismissed the claims in a statement to Media Watch, saying "I believe the edit was an accurate representation of what they told me and I absolutely deny that anything was taken out of context."

The aired quote was picked up by other media bodies, most noticeably Sydney talk radio &lt;a href="w%3A2UE"&gt;2UE&lt;/a&gt;, where it was allegedly used to incite religious and racial intolerance. The quote was then further publicised by ♡❤Today Tonight♡❤ in a follow-up piece the next evening.

Helen Clark (Prime Minister) and Don Brash (Leader of the Opposition) have gone head-to-head in the first live televised debate between the two leaders in the &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; general election of 2005.

A studio audience contained equal numbers of National and Labour Party supporters.

The debate ran through tax, race relations, foreign affairs, immigration, education and health (all the key policy areas).

Taxes were at the top of the agenda; the debate was just hours after the National Party released their tax policy.

Don Brash said that the nuclear freeze policy of New Zealand (which bans nuclear powered US warships from its ports) and Helen Clark's criticism of the war in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; have both contributed to her failure to secure a free-trade pact with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Helen Clark was confident and aggressive and she often forced Don Brash into defensive explanations of National's policies.

The man known as just the '&lt;a href="w%3APiano%20Man%20%28person%29"&gt;Piano Man&lt;/a&gt;' has left the hospital where he was staying and has returned home to his native &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. He has finally spoken after four months of silence.

It turns out, according to British tabloid ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Mirror"&gt;The Daily Mirror&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, that the man, aged 20, was from Germany but after losing his job in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%20Tunnel"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;. He was going to commit suicide when he was found by police on a Kent beach. 
He refused to talk to authorities due to his distressed state. It appears that he had formerly worked with mental patients and copied what he saw from them to fool the doctors. Also according to the ♡❤Mirror♡❤, the man was only able to tap the same piano key repeatedly, but hospital officials refute this. However, all of this information came from a single, unidentified source.

The man was found soaking wet on a beach in &lt;a href="w%3AKent"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; in an expensive-looking suit from which all the labels had been removed. 

Some people believed he was suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Apost-traumatic%20stress%20disorder"&gt;post-traumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt; or that he was an &lt;a href="w%3Aautistic%20savant"&gt;autistic savant&lt;/a&gt;. Some also believed he was a Canadian eccentric, a French busker, a student from Norway, or Czech concert pianist &lt;a href="w%3ATom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Strnad"&gt;Tomáš Strnad&lt;/a&gt;.

A draft of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Iraqi%20constitution"&gt;proposed constitution&lt;/a&gt; has entered parliament, despite warnings from &lt;a href="Sunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; Arabs that it could begin a civil war. The vote however, has been delayed three more days to try to win the support of the Sunni minority.

Signs indicate little chance of a resolution to the Sunni opposition, however. "If it passes, there will be an uprising in the streets," Saleh al-Mutlak, a Sunni negotiator working on the constitution said. Another negotiator, Soha Allawi, said, "We will campaign ... to tell both Sunnis and &lt;a href="Shi%27ite"&gt;Shi'ites&lt;/a&gt; to reject the constitution, which has elements that will lead to the break-up of Iraq and civil war."

Sunnis are concerned over sections of the constitution that create large "federal" regions in the north and the south under Shi'ite and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKurds"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; control. Sunni negotiators are demanding that all "federalism" be left out. Kurds have pressed for the provisions on federalism, as Kurdish negotiators have sought to retain, largely, their current autonomy in the north.

Other concerns which prevent Sunni support of the draft constitution center on the emphasis given to Islam as a "main source of law" -- a compromise between Islamist and secular Shi'ites and Kurds.

Organisers of a protest march planned to occur in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%2C%20Australia"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; next week are predicting thousands of people will attend. The protest is timed to coincide with the Forbes Global CEO Conference, which starts at the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt; the same day. 

The action is being promoted by various trade unions and peace and social justice groups, and co-ordinated by the 30A Network, which is an informal association of such groups. A number of reasons have been given for the protest, including the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aglobalisation"&gt;globalisation&lt;/a&gt;, and the Australian government's planned industrial relations changes. 

The 30A network website is reporting that the protest has been endorsed by the NSW Fire Brigade Employees' Union, the &lt;a href="w%3AMaritime%20Union%20of%20Australia"&gt;Maritime Union of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Services%20Union"&gt;Australian Services Union&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AConstruction%2C%20Forestry%2C%20Mining%20and%20Energy%20Union"&gt;Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Police"&gt;NSW Police Service&lt;/a&gt; will provide free security for the conference. This is potentially controversial, as other events such as football games have to pay for police to attend. The decision has been criticised by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Police%20Association"&gt;NSW Police Association&lt;/a&gt;, as they claim it will leave inner city stations short-staffed. The opposition police spokesman Mike Gallacher echoed the Association's criticism, saying that the conference organisers should foot the bill themselves. 

"Even though ASIO have identified it as a risk coming to Sydney, they can be guaranteed the best policing resources available in this country to hold their conference in a safe environment, but to do so they should have been asked to pay their way, to pay the bill," he said.

A spokesman for the Police Minister said that frontline policing would not be affected. 

&lt;a href="w%3APremiers%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; defended the use of taxpayers' money on policing the conference. 

"The advice I have is that ASIO have declared this as a medium-security event, which classifies it as warranting security. They do expect up to 2,000 protesters and if the local agricultural show had been subject to the same security assessment with potential protesters, they too would receive the same security response," he said.

Archaeologists say they have found a 1.8 million-year-old ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHomo%20erectus"&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ skull in &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest such skull to be found in Europe. According to &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Lortkipanidze"&gt;David Lortkipanidze&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Georgian National Museum, the skull was found August 6 and excavated on August 21 in &lt;a href="w%3ADmanisi"&gt;Dmanisi&lt;/a&gt;, about 85 km southwest of &lt;a href="w%3ATblisi"&gt;Tblisi&lt;/a&gt;. 

The skull was said to have been found at a site archaeologists have been examining since 1936 along with four other bones and fragments, including a jaw bone found in 1991. "Practically all the remains have been found in one place. This indicates that we have found a place of settlement of primitive people," said Lortkipanidze.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nola.com/newsflash/international/index.ssf%3F/base/international-1/1124754589192140.xml%26amp%3Bstorylist%3Dinternational"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The researchers said their find was more than one million years older than any outside Africa. The skull and other remains have been cited as evidence of ♡❤Homo erectus♡❤♡s migration into Europe at least 500,000 years earlier than has previously been thought.

Previously fossils of the hominid ancestor have been found in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.

Some of Lortkipanidze's earlier findings that had more slender, small features, including a smaller brain relative to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHomo%20sapiens"&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, contradicted anthropological theories that ♡❤Homo erectus♡❤ was large and intelligent even by ♡❤Homo sapiens♡❤ standards.

The French cycling newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AL%27%C3%89quipe"&gt;L'Équipe&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is reporting that a drugs testing laboratory has discovered that Lance Armstrong, seven times winner of the &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;, used the banned substance &lt;a href="w%3AErythropoietin"&gt;EPO&lt;/a&gt; in the 1999 tour - his first victory after defeating testicular cancer. ♡❤L'Equipe♡❤ also points out that the results may tarnish Armstrong's image forever, and cast a shadow of doubt over his six other victories.

Lance Armstrong has responded on his &lt;a href="http%3A//www.lancearmstrong.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, branding ♡❤L'Equipe♡❤♡s reporting of being "nothing short of tabloid journalism." Armstrong says: "I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance[-]enhancing drugs."

The Châtenay-Malabry French national doping screening laboratory, which developed the first EPO tests, says it has been developing new experimental detection techniques and decided to test frozen urine samples taken from Armstrong after several stages of the 1999 tour. The director of the official French anti-doping test laboratory at &lt;a href="Ch%C3%A2tenay-Malabry"&gt;Châtenay-Malabry&lt;/a&gt;, Jacques de Ceaurriz &lt;a href="http%3A//www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme/20050823_121001Dev.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was quoted as saying he had "no doubt about the validity of our results." &lt;a href="http%3A//velonews.com/news/fea/8746.0.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He said that while being kept for long periods can cause EPO proteins to deteriorate, this would possibly result in negative tests for doped athletes, but not false positives. 

It should be pointed out that technically this statement is false. EPO is naturally produced in the body. It is present at low levels in normal human urine, and natural levels in a human doing high-altitude training (a known "trick" of Mr. Armstrong) could be unusually high. Therefore, false positives can be obtained by setting the sensitivity threshold too low. This is especially true if the number of control samples (for calibration purposes) is limited, as is the case with the 1999 urine samples. These calibration issues are a reason EPO wasn't officially tested for earlier. Incidentally, de Ceaurriz stated that his laboratory worked on numbered anonymous samples, and was unaware when he sent his results to WADA/AMA that some of the results concerned Lance Armstrong.

In addition to these accusations, and in response to them, Armstrong has also received open backing from US Cycling &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/4178098.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, individual cycling officials &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/4201482.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from former Tour winners Eddy Merckx and Miguel Indurain &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/4177952.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and other public figures.

Supporters argue numerous irregularities in the doping claim: "' ♡❤Wada (World Anti-Doping Agency) and the US Anti-Doping Agency, they've all defined a process for collecting samples, managing samples, testing the samples, identifying the people who are involved♡❤,' said Johnson. ' ♡❤They have certain rights in the process. None of that has been followed in this case♡❤.' Officials from cycling's ruling body (UCI), Wada, the French sports ministry and the Tour de France all agree normal anti-doping proceedings have not been followed. ' ♡❤This isn't a 'doping positive. This is just a publication in a French tabloid newspaper. That's our perspective♡❤,'" added Johnson.'"--BBC 

These allegations are still under examination by a number of news and anti-doping organizations.

BULLET::::- UCI Statement

</ul>
On September 9, after a period of investigation, the UCI finally released a strongly-worded official statement condemning the WADA, the French laboratory in question, and the paper L'Equipe, for having failed to provide any official communication, and having failed to provide any data, evidence, or background on the allegations. The UCI stated that it was still "awaiting plausible answers" to its requests to WADA and the laboratory, but also indicated "We deplore the fact that the long-established and entrenched confidentiality principle could be violated in such a flagrant way without any respect for fair play and the rider's privacy." &lt;a href="http%3A//sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/more/09/09/bc.cyc.armstrong.doping.ap/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The accusers themselves, in particular the World Anti-Doping Agency, might face an investigation into their own practices, in connection to their allegations against Armstrong. The UCI stated "We have substantial concerns about the impact of this matter on the integrity of the overall drug testing regime of the Olympic movement, and in particular the questions it raises over the trustworthiness of some of the sports and political authorities active in the anti-doping fight." 

On October 5, the UCI announced the appointment of an independent expert to investigate the leaking of doping allegations against Armstrong: "French sports newspaper L'Equipe claims that samples given by the American icon on the 1999 Tour later tested positive. Armstrong has denied the allegations. The International Cycling Union (UCI) has now appointed Dutch lawyer and doping specialist Emile Vrijman to probe how the details were released. The UCI said it 'expects all relevant parties to fully co-operate'. Vrijman is a former director of the National Anti-Doping Agency in the Netherlands (NeCeDo)." &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/cycling/4316382.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Heavy rainfalls have caused massive floods in Southern &lt;a href="w%3ABavaria"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, Western &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and Central &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.

In Southern Bavaria authorities have declared a state of emergency. The city of &lt;a href="w%3AGarmisch-Partenkirchen"&gt;Garmisch-Partenkirchen&lt;/a&gt; is cut off from the outside world. Near &lt;a href="w%3AAugsburg"&gt;Augsburg&lt;/a&gt; a freeway had to be closed because a bridge was on the verge of collapsing after water had damaged the foundation. 

In the Austrian states of &lt;a href="w%3ATyrol%20%28state%29"&gt;Tyrol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVorarlberg"&gt;Vorarlberg&lt;/a&gt; authorities are battling with floods that intensified during the night with record rainfall. In Vorarlberg a &lt;a href="wikt%3Abrook"&gt;brook&lt;/a&gt; broke into a house and caused a gas explosion injuring six people. One person is missing after he and his car were swept away. In the capital of Tyrol, &lt;a href="w%3AInnsbruck"&gt;Innsbruck&lt;/a&gt;, all bridges over the &lt;a href="w%3AInn%20River"&gt;Inn&lt;/a&gt; had to be closed. In Western Tyrol, landslides killed one man and injured another.

In Switzerland the cities of &lt;a href="w%3ABern"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALucerne"&gt;Lucerne&lt;/a&gt; were partially flooded. Mudslides killed two firefighters who were trying to evacuate a farm. In the canton of &lt;a href="w%3ACanton%20of%20Zurich"&gt;Zürich&lt;/a&gt; one man drowned, and a woman in &lt;a href="w%3AGraub%C3%BCnden"&gt;Graubünden&lt;/a&gt; is missing after she too fell into a stream. The Swiss government estimates the floodings caused a damage of at least US$79 million.

<h1>Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson calls for assassination of Venezuela's president</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3APat%20Robertson"&gt;Pat Robertson&lt;/a&gt;, an American &lt;a href="w%3Atelevangelist"&gt;televangelist&lt;/a&gt;, former presidential candidate, and founder of the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Coalition%20of%20America"&gt;Christian Coalition of America&lt;/a&gt;, has called for the assassination of &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;'s president &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;. 

On his popular talk show, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20700%20Club"&gt;The 700 Club&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ broadcast on the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Broadcasting%20Network"&gt;Christian Broadcasting Network&lt;/a&gt;, Robertson said on Monday that Chávez had destroyed the Venezuelan economy and made his country a "launching pad for communist infiltration and Muslim extremism all over the continent". Ninety-eight percent of all Venezuelans are &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AProtestantism"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt;.

Relating to the latest allegations from Chávez that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; is planning to assassinate him, which the U.S. government denies, Robertson said: "You know, I don't know about this doctrine of assassination, but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it."

He added that he did not believe Venezuela would stop exporting oil if that were to happen as Chávez suggested. He again called Chávez a "terrific danger" to the U.S. with the potential to hurt the country "very bad[ly]" and concluded: "We have the ability to take him out, and I think the time has come that we exercise that ability. We don't need another $200 billion war to get rid of one, you know, strong-arm dictator. It's a whole lot easier to have some of the covert operatives do the job and then get it over with."

A spokeswoman for Robertson, Angell Watts, said to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; that he would not give interviews on Tuesday and had no statement elaborating on his remarks. However, he later &lt;a href="US%20televangelist%20Pat%20Robertson%20apologizes%20for%20assassination%20remark"&gt;issued an apology&lt;/a&gt;.

In response, Venezuela's Vice President &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Vicente%20Rangel"&gt;José Vicente Rangel&lt;/a&gt; accused Robertson of making terrorist threats: "It's the height of hypocrisy for the U.S. to continue talking about the war against terrorism when at the same time you have someone making obvious terrorist declarations in the heart of the country."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt; called the remarks "inappropriate" and insisted that they do not reflect official policy and that the U.S. is not now, nor ever was, planning to take "hostile actions" against Venezuela. 

Rev. &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Lynn"&gt;Barry Lynn&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of &lt;a href="w%3AAmericans%20United%20for%20Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State"&gt;Americans United for Separation of Church and State&lt;/a&gt;, reacted to Robertson's remarks: "It's absolutely chilling to hear a religious leader call for the murder of any political leader, no matter how much he disagrees with such a leader's policies or practices."

In an effort to distance themselves from Robertson's statements, many evangelical Christians have publicly condemned his speech. "This kind of statement, by this well known American Christian leader, is in complete contradiction to the teachings of Jesus Christ who evangelical Christians believe and seek to demonstrate," said Geoff Tunnicliffe, International Director of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Evangelical%20Alliance"&gt;World Evangelical Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. "Robertson does not speak for evangelical Christians. We believe in justice and the protection of human rights of all people, including the life of President Chavez."

Robertson is considered to have staunch conservative views. His unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for president in 1988 led to allegations of partisanship. According to White House press secretary &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt;, Robertson met with President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; in November 2002 to discuss the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. He considers himself to be a supporter of Bush. Today he remains a &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Robertson%23A%20controversial%20public%20figure"&gt;controversial public figure&lt;/a&gt;.

Hugo Chávez has led oil-rich Venezuela into an anti-US, pro-Cuba policy, and called for seizing assets of wealthy families in an attempt to convert his nation from capitalism to socialism. He has also worked against regional trade pacts led by the US. These actions have alarmed some in the US, such as Robertson, as well as many in his own country. His policies are against the interests of powerful families in Venezuela, so he may be a target of local assassins.

A similar call from a religious leader for assassination came from the now deceased &lt;a href="w%3AAyatollah%20Khomeini"&gt;Ayatollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; in 1989 against British ex-Muslim writer &lt;a href="w%3ASalman%20Rushdie"&gt;Salman Rushdie&lt;/a&gt; over the content of his book, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Satanic%20Verses%20%28novel%29"&gt;The Satanic Verses&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Iran also offered a multi-million dollar reward to anyone who carries out the killing.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Indiana%20senator%20testing%20waters%20for%202008%20U.S.%20presidential%20bid&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Relatively unknown &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEvan%20Bayh"&gt;Evan Bayh&lt;/a&gt; is taking steps to make a run for U.S. President during the 2008 election cycle. Bayh has formed a &lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20action%20committee"&gt;political action committee&lt;/a&gt; (PAC) and already is a leading money-raiser among Democratic party hopefuls. The &lt;a href="wikt%3AHoosier"&gt;Hoosier&lt;/a&gt; politician also is touting his appeal to traditionally republican voters.

<h3>Popular red state politician</h3>
Among the selling points Bayh points to in his likely 2008 bid is that he is a democrat who consistently wins elections in republican &lt;a href="w%3Ared%20state"&gt;red state&lt;/a&gt;s by appealing to moderate republican and libertarian-leaning voters.

A former leader and key figure in the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Leadership%20Council"&gt;Democratic Leadership Council&lt;/a&gt; moderate movement in the Democratic party that brought &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; to the national stage, Bayh is known as a Democrat who won with landslide margins of victory during both terms as Indiana's governor and two U.S. Senate runs in the traditionally Republican-voting state. 

In an interview with the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATerre%20Haute%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Terre Haute, Indiana&lt;/a&gt; Tribune Star♡❤ newspaper, he noted Democratic former president &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Truman"&gt;Harry Truman&lt;/a&gt; as a role model. In recent news reports he also criticized the national Democratic Party image as being weak on national defense. 

Critics point out this popularity with moderate republicans could be a liability for Bayh in the Democrat Primaries, which are traditionally controlled by left-leaning party activists, also referred to as "Progressives."

<h3>Organized money raiser</h3>
Between January and July 31, 2005, three years before the election, Bayh has raised $1.17 million for a potential 2008 bid--more than most potential 2008 presidential nominees. He out raised fellow democrats &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Edwards"&gt;John Edwards&lt;/a&gt;. Each, unlike Bayh, are well-known household names in the United States. Money-raising results by political action committees are reported to and released by the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Election%20Commission"&gt;Federal Election Commission&lt;/a&gt;.

Clinton is widely considered the front runner, and Democratic money leader. She has focused her attention on reelection in 2006 to her &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; U.S. Senate seat. For that campaign, she has raised $10 million. 

Bayh is being beaten in the money-raising arena by Democratic party chairman &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Dean"&gt;Howard Dean&lt;/a&gt;, who raised $1.77 million in the first six months of the year. Dean has made a name for himself as an effective money-raiser for liberal causes. But Dean has bowed out of the 2008 race according to reports.

Bayh is trailing the top Republican 2008 presidential; hopeful, Sen. &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt;, considered a top Republican candidate for 2008, who collected $1.9 million in the first six months of 2005.

<h1>UK guinea pig farm to close after owner's family grave robbed</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20guinea%20pig%20farm%20to%20close%20after%20owner%27s%20family%20grave%20robbed&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A forty-year-old British &lt;a href="w%3Aguinea%20pig"&gt;guinea pig&lt;/a&gt; farm is to close after a six-year campaign of intimidation by &lt;a href="w%3Aanimal%20rights"&gt;animal rights&lt;/a&gt; extremists culminated in the remains of the family's dead mother being dug up and stolen.
Glady Hammond's sons, who run the farm which breeds the guinea pigs for &lt;a href="w%3Aanimal%20testing"&gt;medical experiments&lt;/a&gt;, have been the victim of bomb threats, hate mail, malicious phone calls, an attempt to brand them as pedophiles, and arson attacks.

However last year's exhumation of their mother was the final straw. The remains of the 87-year-old, who died in 1997, were removed under the cover of darkness from the churchyard they were buried in, and have not been found.

Two men were arrested in connection with the grave robbery, but were later released without charge.

The family hopes that their announcement that the farm will close will lead to the return of their mother's remains.

A close relative of Mrs Hammond, who spoke anonymously to the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, said, "Gladys was a relative of the Halls by marriage only and had no involvement in guinea pig breeding. She was a kind, gentle country lady who loved animals."

Legal peaceful protesters were overjoyed at the news. Johnny Holmes, a spokesman for Stop the Newchurch Guinea Pigs, said: "This is the most fantastic day of my life." The group, which has picketted the farm for several years, says it will remain until all the guinea pigs have gone.

The group's website describes the experiments the guinea pigs were subjected to as being "horrendous", and have accused the farm of keeping tens of thousands of animals in poor conditions leading to many dying of malnutrition and neurosis. Video footage taken by the group inside the farm show many young animals dying and under extreme stress.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.liberation-now.org/who.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

They also say the animals have been used for cosmetics research and for "unscientific" medical experiments.

The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), in an online statement, gave their best wishes to the Hammond family, and described the decision as "regrettable but understandable".&lt;a href="http%3A//www.abpi.org.uk/press/press_releases_05/050823.asp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Their director of Science and Technology said, "Guinea pigs have provided essential information to support biomedical research into respiratory disease resulting in real breakthroughs in the development of new medicines."

The animals from the farm have been used in biomedical research, especially for respiratory diseases such as asthma. The ABPI also said that future animal research may be carried out in countries that do not have the strict welfare controls the UK has.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; has completed its pull-out from the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; settlements.

It had been &lt;a href="Last%20Gaza%20settlement%20cleared%2C%20West%20Bank%20towns%20prepare%20to%20resist"&gt;feared&lt;/a&gt; that the protesters in the two West Bank towns, &lt;a href="w%3ASanur"&gt;Sanur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHomesh"&gt;Homesh&lt;/a&gt;, would put up strong resistance but in the end only made token protests, pelting soldiers with fruit, flour, and paint and burning Israeli flags. The residents of the two other towns went peacefully.

In the synagogues of the settlements Israeli troops had to cut through barricades of iron bars and barbed wire before carrying out protesters, but they did not resist. Around 40 settlers made a last stand on the roof of an old fort before giving themselves up to riot police after being sprayed with water cannons.

The Israeli Chief of Staff said, "There has been less violence than we thought. One of the reasons was because &lt;a href="w%3Arabbi"&gt;rabbis&lt;/a&gt; worked to calm tensions."

Four police officers received minor injuries.

Local &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; looked on as the protesters were cleared, and told reporters that life would be easier for them now. Previously, Israeli settlers had stopped Palestinian farmers from travelling, and had even stopped some of them visiting a village cemetery. 

Israelis will retain responsibility for security in the West Bank settlements, although in the Gaza strip that role has now been handed over to Palestinians.

In the Gaza strip, Israeli forces have already demolished six of the settlements left behind by the evacuation of 8,500 Israeli settlers to make way for new Palestinian construction.

In the West Bank, there remain some 120 Jewish settlements housing more than 230,000.

Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; has seen his poll ratings raise despite the angry scenes. &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;, a radical Palestinian group, has attempted to present the pull-out as a surrender by Israel. "We believe that this unilateral withdrawal is a complete failure for the Israeli enemy, that it deserves no concession from our side whatsoever," said a spokesman.

US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; said the pull-out has "changed the dynamics on the ground and has provided hope for the Palestinian people."

The government of &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; is demanding that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; stop applying duties on Canadian lumber and refund the C$5 billion in duties that has been collected. As &lt;a href="NAFTA%20dismisses%20US%20claims%20of%20Canadian%20violation%20of%20Trade%20Agreement%20rules%20in%20softwood%20lumber%20dispute"&gt;reported earlier&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement"&gt;NAFTA&lt;/a&gt; panel rejected Washington's claims justifying those duties, but the U.S. is not abiding by the NAFTA decision.

Canada had asked the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Organization"&gt;WTO&lt;/a&gt; for permission to retaliate. Jacqueline LaRocque, a spokeswoman for Canadian Trade Minister Jim Peterson, said that Canada is considering imposing C$5 billion in duties on imports from the U.S. in retaliation. "Canada has wanted to make it very clear that we are not happy with the position of the United States to simply ignore what is a clear NAFTA ruling in Canada's favor," Canadian Finance Minister Ralph Goodale was quoted as saying.

The U.S. is still dealing with a 4 billion dollar ruling against it by the WTO relating to its practice of helping large American companies set up "Foreign Sales Corporations" offshore in order to have a competitive edge in Europe. That dispute resulted in the U.S. having to change its laws last year.

A man missing from a camping ground in southern &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AUtah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; in the Western US since July 30 was found in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. His automobile was found in a campground of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ADixie%20National%20Forest"&gt;Dixie National Forest&lt;/a&gt; with a note that he would be back in a few hours. An extensive search and rescue operation was conducted to try to locate this hiker by the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Utah.

Investigators in the Sheriff's Office were able to track him down to Cairns, Queensland. Apparently before he was "missing", he bought a one-way ticket to Australia. Bryan Butas, the missing hiker, apparently had been under a great deal of stress and "got sick of it all", according to a telephone interview by the Associated Press.

Butas has been charged with insurance fraud, a second-degree felony, by Washington County Attorney Brock Belnap. This was because Butas plotted to obtain a $250,000 life insurance policy before faking his own disappearance. He has also been given a bill for $20,000 by the Washington County Sheriff's Office for their search and rescue operations on his behalf.

His wife and children have since his disappearance moved to the wife's parent's home in Ohio. Butas's parents came to Southern Utah to help in the search and were "embarrassed and shocked" to learn their son had merely run away from marital and financial difficulties, Washington County Sheriff Kirk Smith said.

Washington County Sheriff Sgt. Jake Adams said his investigation included tracing an application Butas made for a passport, his purchase of a one-way airline ticket to Australia, and the life insurance policy that names his wife and children as beneficiaries. On August 18, Adams said Butas's mother called him to say her son had called home the evening of August 11, several days after the search was officially called off for the missing man. Butas asked his mother for money and an airline ticket home, which she sent.

Butas has since been checked into the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Brecksville, Ohio, according to Adams, but will shortly return to Utah.

<h1>Jetliner crash-lands in Peru</h1>

A &lt;a href="w%3APeru"&gt;Peruvian&lt;/a&gt; jetliner carrying between 94 and 100 people crashed near &lt;a href="w%3APucallpa%2C%20Peru"&gt;Pucallpa, Peru&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday at 21:20 UTC. Peruvian President &lt;a href="w%3AAlejandro%20Toledo"&gt;Alejandro Toledo&lt;/a&gt; said 70 to 80 had been killed, and other authorities have said at least 40. The &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737-200&lt;/a&gt;, operated by military-run airline &lt;a href="w%3ATans%20Peru"&gt;Tans Peru&lt;/a&gt; had attempted an emergency landing on Federico Basadre road in Peru's central jungle. The crash is said to have been caused by bad weather.
"Until now, there are 40 cadavers that rescue teams are pulling from the wreckage. There could be more deaths, we assume some 60 people in total, since we've rescued 20 injured people," said a police office in the nearby town on &lt;a href="w%3ARPP%20radio"&gt;RPP radio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-peru-plane-crash%2C0%2C2392004.story%3Fcoll%3Dsns-ap-world-headlines"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The pilot contacted the Pucallpa airport saying he could not land because of strong winds and a heavy storm, said Norma Pasquel, an airport receptionist. When the plane crash-landed, its landing gear had not been released, according to firefighter Ilda Pineda.

The plane was on a flight from &lt;a href="w%3ALima"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AIquitos"&gt;Iquitos&lt;/a&gt; via Pucallpa.

Five of the deaths have been confirmed by Berta Garcia, a secretary at Pucallpa's municipal hospital, on RPP radio. She said the bodies of four adults and a small boy had been brought to the hospital.

Tans Peru confirmed the emergency landing, saying several people had been killed or injured.

100 people&amp;mdash;92 passengers and eight crew members&amp;mdash;were on the plane, said Tans spokesman Jorge Belevan on CPN radio, and his figures were echoed by &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking on the same station, Transportation Minister Jose Ortiz said the plane carried 93 passengers and five crew membmers. &lt;a href="w%3AXinhua%20News%20Agency"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt; reported that 94 people were on the plane.

<h1>English FA rescinds red cards, FIFA backlash probable</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=English%20FA%20rescinds%20red%20cards%2C%20FIFA%20backlash%20probable&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Football%20Association"&gt;Football Association&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; risked a backlash and possible disciplinary action from &lt;a href="football%20%28soccer%29"&gt;football's&lt;/a&gt; world governing body &lt;a href="FIFA"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday when it rescinded the suspensions due from &lt;a href="w%3Ared%20card"&gt;red cards&lt;/a&gt; that had been given during the past weekend's matches to &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Premier%20League"&gt;FA Premier League&lt;/a&gt; players &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Welsh"&gt;Andrew Welsh&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASunderland%20A.F.C."&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Konchesky"&gt;Paul Konchesky&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Ham%20United%20F.C."&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;.

The FA's decision permitted Welsh to play for the Black Cats in their 2-1 loss at home to &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City%20F.C."&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday evening. Konchesky will also be available for the Hammers' next game on Saturday when West Ham host &lt;a href="w%3ABolton%20Wanderers%20F.C."&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;. However, the FA's actions contravene FIFA regulations, which demand that any player sent off be suspended for his team's next match, with no right of appeal except for mistaken identity.

FIFA House had already been in contact with Soho Square over the past week after the FA downgraded a red card that had been given to &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United%20F.C."&gt;Newcastle United's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJermaine%20Jenas"&gt;Jermaine Jenas&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="w%3Ayellow%20card"&gt;yellow card&lt;/a&gt; on the advice of referee &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bennett"&gt;Steve Bennett&lt;/a&gt;. The FA had indicated it would eventually issue a reply to FIFA, but the decision to overturn two more cards less than a week after the FIFA communication is likely to displease FIFA president &lt;a href="Sepp%20Blatter"&gt;Sepp Blatter&lt;/a&gt;.

For the past three years especially, Blatter has been adamant that a red card in a football match must result in the player who was sent off missing his team's next game in the same competition. Blatter has clashed with the FA on this issue during that time, going so far as to threaten the English association with expulsion from FIFA. As a result, the FA agreed in 2004 to change their disciplinary process, in particular ensuring the process was expedited so that a player who was sent off did indeed miss his next match. However, it is now apparent that the FA has chosen to also allow for expedited appeals of red cards on grounds other than mistaken identity, which is not provided for in the FIFA regulations.

Although the FA has now permitted Jenas, Welsh and Konchesky to play after being sent off in a previous match, it also extended an automatic three-match ban imposed on &lt;a href="w%3ASouthend%20United%20F.C."&gt;Southend United's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFreddy%20Eastwood"&gt;Freddy Eastwood&lt;/a&gt; by one additional match after its disciplinary panel deemed his appeal of a red card received the previous weekend to be "frivolous." The FA also rejected the appeal of &lt;a href="w%3ALuton%20Town%20F.C."&gt;Luton Town's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Howard"&gt;Steve Howard&lt;/a&gt;, but did not extend his three-match suspension.

Unlike with Jenas, the red cards issued to Welsh and Konchesky will remain on their disciplinary records because the referees involved did not agree that they made mistakes. This means they will still receive an additional one-match ban should they be sent off again this season. Following Tuesday's decisions, half of the six red cards shown in the Premiership this season have been overturned. And in an interesting footnote, it was Jenas who Konchesky was sent off for fouling this past weekend.

On Thursday, it was reported at &lt;a href="U.S.%20Army%20intelligence%20had%20detected%209/11%20terrorists%20year%20before%2C%20says%20officer"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; that "[a] year before the 9/11 attacks, through &lt;a href="w%3Adata%20mining"&gt;data mining&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; intelligence group had identified two terrorist cells, [which included] &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Atta%20al%20Sayed"&gt;Mohammed Atta&lt;/a&gt; and three other 9/11 hijackers." An &lt;a href="w%3AAble%20Danger"&gt;Able Danger&lt;/a&gt; contractor, J.D. Smith, has added that the techniques included examination of data related to mosques and religious ties connected to &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Abdel-Rahman"&gt;Omar Abdel-Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, leader in New York City of a militant Islamic terrorist organization.

Another "Able Danger" operative, Captain Scott Phillpott, gave a statement stating, "I will not discuss this outside of my chain of command. I have briefed the Department of the Army, the Special Operations Command and the office of (Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence) Dr. Cambone as well as the 9/11 Commission. My story has remained consistent. Atta was identified by Able Danger in January/February 2000."

Pentagon spokesman, Larry DiRita, said, "There appear to be more memories than there is information to substantiate those memories. We're reviewing the matter carefully, but thus far have not found what it is these handful of individuals seem to remember." 

Other Fox News sources have said that DiRita is wrong. Since it was a classified project, it would be illegal for project participants to retain documents for personal use.

&lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; today released &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Talk"&gt;Google Talk&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.google.com/talk/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href="w%3ADevelopment%20stage%23Beta"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3AInstant%20Messaging"&gt;Instant Messaging&lt;/a&gt; (IM) and computer-to-computer voice talk product, using the &lt;a href="w%3AJabber"&gt;Jabber&lt;/a&gt; protocol (built from &lt;a href="w%3AXMPP"&gt;XMPP&lt;/a&gt;). 

At this early stage the service is only available to users with a Google Gmail account. The official client, required for the voice functionality, is only available for Windows XP/2000 although existing IM clients such as &lt;a href="w%3AGaim"&gt;Gaim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AiChat"&gt;iChat&lt;/a&gt; on Mac and &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; platforms can be used for text chatting. 

The new service does not offer "&lt;a href="w%3AVoIP"&gt;Voice over IP&lt;/a&gt;" - users cannot call telephones, nor can telephones dial Google Talk users. It also has no voice-mail system, unlike rival Yahoo's offering, which is also no longer in beta. Google Talk also does not log chats, and offers no method of searching conversations. Only the last 20 lines of any conversation are recorded.

This positions Google to compete with the popular service &lt;a href="Skype"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt;. Like Google Talk, Skype's PC-to-PC communications are free. Skype also offers gateways to and from various regional phone services for which it charges. It is not known at this stage if Google intends to enter that market.

The largest search engine on the web, Google receives over 200 million queries each day through its various services. Other recent releases include the Gmail email service and Google Earth, which lets users view satellite photos and other map information.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20government"&gt;Australian government&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales State goverernment&lt;/a&gt; are going to fund the Forbes Global CEO Conference, to be held at the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt; next week. The State government has said that the contract prevents it from revealing how much taxpayers money will be spent.

A spokesman for the Deputy Premier, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Watkins"&gt;John Watkins&lt;/a&gt;, said that they could not divulge the costs "under the contract arrangements". A government source suggested to the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Morning%20Herald"&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt; that the state and federal governments are spending up to $1million each. 

The State government has been criticised for providing free police protection at the conference. Security will require 200 police a day, at an estimated cost of more than $500,000. 

According to the government, the large police presence is required because &lt;a href="w%3AASIO"&gt;ASIO&lt;/a&gt; has assessed the event as "medium risk". A number of &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20justice"&gt;Global justice&lt;/a&gt; and peace groups have pledged to protest at the conference. The number of protestors is currerntly projected to be around 2,000.

Clothes worth millions of euros are being blocked in European warehouses after the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; imposed quotas on ten types of textiles from China.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; agreed to the quotas with China in July and many of them, including jumpers (sweaters) and trousers were quickly exceeded. 

Retailers across Europe are now claiming they face massive losses. The European consumer's organisation, BEUC, has said that most of the clothes were ordered before the agreement was made and that their blockage is "ignoring the basic laws of economics". 

A representative warned: "The new quotas will lead to higher prices and less choice for European consumers when they try to buy trousers, pullovers, women's blouses, brassieres and other textile products in the coming months." 

The Commission is sending a representative to China to try and find a solution to the crisis, but according to the news website Euractive, the quotas are unlikely to be dropped as most EU member countries are in favour of them.

<h1>Broadband users kicked off service for constant questioning</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Broadband%20users%20kicked%20off%20service%20for%20constant%20questioning&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A UK ISP, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APlusnet"&gt;Plusnet&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, terminated the service of two of their broadband service customers for asking too many repeated questions and taking up too much customer support time on their portal discussion forums.

Early last year, ♡❤Plusnet♡❤, an &lt;a href="w%3AISP"&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt; with nearly 200,000 subscribers, cut its prices for all of its broadband products. In doing so, ♡❤Plusnet♡❤ allegedly did not inform its existing customers by e-mail, and instead published new products and prices on their public portal. This manner of notice for the price changes may have resulted in thousands of customers paying almost twice as much for the same service.

Within the last month, ♡❤Plusnet♡❤ began &lt;a href="w%3APacket%20Shaping"&gt;Packet Shaping&lt;/a&gt; peer-to-peer transfers for users of its 'Premier' service, which is sold and described as a 'clean' connection. 

They also recently introduced the throttling [enforcing a maximum limit] of customers using more than 150GB per month of bandwidth. Users whose bandwidth is throttled receive service of 70Kbps, while paying for 2Mbps. This figure is based on the PlusNet network contention of 30:1, being 2mb divided by thirty users. The throttle is in place until the end of the customers current billing period, and is meant to help keep broadband access for all ♡❤Plusnet♡❤ users fast by stopping a small percentage of users from using excessive bandwidth. As a result, the ISP has begun receiving numbers of customer complaints and criticism both privately and through their publicly accessible member discussion forums. Though the vast majority of comments on this new Sustainable Usage Policy have been positive.

Wade Woverly, 20, from &lt;a href="w%3ALeeds"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; (also known as "Wadev1589"), started a thread in the ♡❤Plusnet♡❤ member discussion forums challenging the ISP on a number of customer service issues. One of those was regarding the customers who were paying an unnecessary premium for the same internet connection. In addition, Woverly mentioned he was assisting the &lt;a href="w%3ATrading%20Standards%20Institute"&gt;Trading Standards Institute&lt;/a&gt; with an investigation of the legality of terms and conditions of ♡❤Plusnet♡❤. 

The accusations by Woverly, that customers are being over-charged, are considered speculative. Woverly asked the same questions dozens of times on forum pages, hoping to receive some sort of answer from ♡❤Plusnet♡❤ that he considered satisfactory. Ultimately, he claims the ISP called him on the telephone and said that if he didn't stop posting comments on their forums, they would terminate his &lt;a href="w%3AAsymmetric%20Digital%20Subscriber%20Line"&gt;ADSL&lt;/a&gt; internet connection and forum access. Woverly said ♡❤Plusnet's♡❤ position was that he was using up excessive customer services resources.

After a night of lengthy posts both on ♡❤Plusnet♡❤ boards and at the forums at ♡❤ADSLGuide♡❤, a Customer Services Manager at ♡❤Plusnet♡❤, Carol Axe, allegedly contacted Woverly to inform him that they would be terminating his service, and that he has 30 days to migrate away until his line will be disconnected. Axe refused to allow her conversation to be recorded: "her voice was that of rude arrogance, not listening at all, it was a true ultimatum of a call," according to Woverly. 

Neil Armstrong, the Head of Marketing at ♡❤Plusnet♡❤, commented, "Our comms team is there to serve all our customers, not to be drained by one unreasonably demanding customer."

The ♡❤Plusnet♡❤ forums are led by a team of moderators, also customers, whose job it is to deal with problem posters, amongst other things. Forum Moderator Liam Martin, another stirrer, said "Part of our moderation involves restricting access to those users causing problems... and this is always carried out at our discretion when we believe somebody is causing a nuisance and/or breaking forum rules. 'Wadev1589' didn't come close to being banned, in my book. This has come as a complete shock."

A second user, "pr100" from &lt;a href="w%3AWargrave"&gt;Wargrave&lt;/a&gt;, has since then had his service ended after being given the same ultimatum. He was told that it was "in his best interests". He responded on the ♡❤Plusnet♡❤ forum, "I did suggest to her that perhaps PlusNet should allow me to decide what will be in my best interest whereupon she stopped beating around the bush and said that my account was being terminated because of my anti-PlusNet posts in the forum." Not all ISP's would give you the option of migrating or losing your BB connection, some would just use their right to end your contract forthwith.

Another forum user, "chuffbears", commented, "Carol [Axe] is in a position where she should be taking responsibility for customer service. In my book she should be issuing an apology over this entire situation."

&lt;a href="w%3ATurkmenistan"&gt;Turkmen&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3ASaparmurat%20Niyazov"&gt;Saparmurat Niyazov&lt;/a&gt; has banned the playing of recorded music on television, at public events, and both public and private wedding ceremonies. Turkmenistan's official daily newspaper, &lt;a href="w%3ANeitralny%20Turkmenistan"&gt;Neitralny Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;, quotes President Niyazov as stating that the ban is intended to "protect true culture, including the musical and singing traditions of the Turkmen people." The office of the president said recorded music and lip synching has "a negative effect on the development of singing and musical art." In a cabinet meeting broadcast on national television, Niyazov said "Unfortunately, one can see on television old voiceless singers lip-synching their old songs. Don't kill talents by using lip synching... Create our new culture."

President Niyazov has a history of regulating cultural influences in Turkmenistan. He has outlawed long hair or beards and capped teeth, required video monitors in all public places, and banned car radios and certain performing arts like &lt;a href="w%3Aopera"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; and , deeming them "unnecessary."

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABrampton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Brampton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; woman Wendy Grant, 41, is facing 234 charges of double-doctoring after obtaining &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Aprescription"&gt;prescriptions&lt;/a&gt; for 6000 pills. The &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;Ontario Provincial Police&lt;/a&gt; also charged her with &lt;a href="w%3Afraud"&gt;fraud&lt;/a&gt; charge after allegedly obtaining false prescriptions for a &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Anarcotic"&gt;narcotic&lt;/a&gt;, that were
fraudulently billed to the Ontario Drug Benefits Plan.

From February to May, Grant obtained pills from 28 doctors and 22 pharmacies in Peel and Halton regions.

The Workers' Compensation Board of Nova Scotia defines "double doctoring" "as a situation where a [person] seeks or obtains a prescription for a controlled drug or narcotic from more than one doctor to treat the same condition for the same period of time."

Cell phone owners can send Google their phone number, and are then sent an access code via &lt;a href="w%3ASMS"&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt; that enables them to open an account. Google has stated that the number is only used to "manage the number of accounts created per phone", and that it "will never be sold or shared for marketing purposes" without the user's permission.

The service is not necessarily free &amp;mdash; cell phone service providers may charge for the delivery of the code.

While the system currently only works in the U.S., Google says it has plans to add more countries.

Held Sunday, the first annual Brampton Day at &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AOntario%20Place"&gt;Ontario Place&lt;/a&gt; let hundreds of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABrampton"&gt;Brampton&lt;/a&gt; residents have fun in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, while experiencing some of their own community.

Entertainment on the stage included local rock band Frayed, Cuban singing by Alexis Martinez, blues and folk from Gayle Ackroyd, Carmen Spada's smooth jazz, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Abhangra"&gt;bhangra&lt;/a&gt; dancing by the Koonja and the Punjabi Virsa Art &amp; Culture Academy, and a Brampton Theatre performance of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMan%20of%20La%20Mancha"&gt;Man of La Mancha&lt;/a&gt;.

Many groups and community organizations were at the event, from the Farmers' Market to the Brampton Stallions football team. &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AVisual%20Arts%20Brampton"&gt;Visual Arts Brampton&lt;/a&gt; offered kids the chance to create artwork for their Snail Mail World Postcard Art Show, while the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABrampton%20Arts%20Council"&gt;Brampton Arts Council&lt;/a&gt; gave away pink sand buckets with &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ARegion%20of%20%20Peel"&gt;Region of Peel&lt;/a&gt; water bottles. Young visitors were noticeably enthralled by Sassy the Squirrel, the City's mascot.

People who bought passes to the Brampton Day event through the City were encouraged to wear blue wrist bands around the park, for a chance to get spotted and win a prize. A draw was held for prizes including green fees for four at the Peel Village Golf Course, Heritage Theatre tickets, and restaurant gift certificates.

Festival Square's proximity to &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ALake%20Ontario"&gt;Lake Ontario&lt;/a&gt; caused its share of trouble, particularly for the arts groups displaying in the south. Tents were blown on their sides, becoming veritable wind sails. Luckily no guests or volunteers were injured by the mishaps. One painting infused with a sculpture, at the Beaux-Arts Brampton tent, was destroyed early in the day after catching a gust of wind.

Average windspeed for the Toronto Island Airport area is 12 km/h.

After not having the novel attraction of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Abutter%20sculpture"&gt;butter sculptures&lt;/a&gt; since the mid-1990s, the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACanadian%20National%20Exhibition"&gt;Canadian National Exhibition&lt;/a&gt; has revived the tradition in a limited fashion.

In the past, farming exhibits have displayed elaborate, lifesize sculptures of celebrities, animals, and objects at "the Ex". Many best recall the sculpture of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AThe%20Beatles"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;, created in the 1970s.

For their current exhibit however, the sculptures are relatively small. None of the sculptures created as of Sunday, August 21 were over two feet tall, and cramped sculpting facilities did not appear to encourage such larger endeavours. Sculptures included a caricatured cowboy with large pants, a deer, and a woman's face, neck and shoulders.

The sign promoting the attraction bills the event as ♡❤Butter Sculpture "Artists"♡❤ suggesting the organizers question the artistic merit of unusual mediums. Butter sculpture is a popular attraction at many &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Afairs"&gt;fairs&lt;/a&gt; across North America.

The exhibit continues until the end of the CNE on Labour Day, in the Automotive Building's "Farm, Food and Fun" displays. According to the CNE's official &lt;a href="http%3A//mmi.theex.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, the sculptures are being created by students from the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ocad.on.ca/"&gt;Ontario College of Art&lt;/a&gt;.

The 30A network has said that it wants to create a carnival atmosphere while protesting at the Forbes Global CEO conference. The protest, which starts on August 30, is expected to attract up to 2,000 protesters. Similar events in the past often had instances of violent confrontations between police and some of the activists. The 30A network is a loose affiliation of groups and individuals co-ordinating the protest. 

30A spokesman Bruce Knobloch, of the International Socialist Organisation, made the call for a peaceful protest in a press release last week.

"We want a safe community action showing that people in Sydney oppose Howard¹s plan for a US-style wages system, the war in Iraq and his kow-towing to global corporate chiefs. We pose no threat to the Opera House or the millionaire delegates, or to other users of east Circular Quay," Mr Knobloch said.

The conference will be held at the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt;. The Forbes website says that at the event "senior figures from the world's leading companies and institutions will discuss the best ways to nurture and capitalize on innovation and reveal the latest global trends." It was recently announced that &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush Sr&lt;/a&gt; will be attending the conference, along with former New York mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARudolph%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudolph Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, and former NSW Premier &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Carr"&gt;Bob Carr&lt;/a&gt;. 

Mr Knobloch described the attendees as "a few hundred &lt;a href="w%3Aneo-conservative"&gt;neo-conservative&lt;/a&gt; corporate chiefs".

The protesters have been denied access to the Opera House forecourt for the duration of the conference. Mr Knobloch believes that this decision is unjustified. He also accused the police of deliberately creating the conditions for confrontation.

"The police seem intent on creating chaos and confrontation, which is the last thing we need. We've urged police to build a barrier in front of the Opera House proper and to allow us to use the public space in the forecourt. By pushing us out into the CBD the police are going to create problems for commuters and business owners," he said.

30A protestors this week organised a media conference outside Surry Hills Police Station, requesting a meeting to negotiate an agreement. According to an article on Sydney Indymedia, police at the station were unable to discuss the issue, but told 30a representatives that they would be contacted to organise a meeting. 

"Minimising the protesters right to peacefully rally dramatically increases police powers and strikes at the heart of protesters' democratic right to peaceful assembly," the article said. 

&lt;a href="w%3AASIO"&gt;ASIO&lt;/a&gt; has assessed the conference to be "medium risk", and this has been used by the police and government to justify the increased security.

The deadline for a compromise between &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AToshiba"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; in the battle over the next generation DVD format is drawing closer as studios start planning their Christmas releases. 

Sony, with their &lt;a href="w%3ABlu-ray%20Disc"&gt;Blu-ray Disc&lt;/a&gt; format, has already started embedding the new technology into their next-generation gaming console, the &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%203"&gt;Playstation 3&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Toshiba has secured deals with both &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC Universal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AParamount"&gt;Paramount Pictures&lt;/a&gt; to use their format, &lt;a href="w%3AHD-DVD"&gt;HD-DVD&lt;/a&gt;. Many industry watchers fear that the battle of these two formats will bring some serious consequences. Some think this may repeat another &lt;a href="w%3AVHS"&gt;VHS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABetamax"&gt;Betamax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormat%20war"&gt;format war&lt;/a&gt;, however others fear that because there is no clear winner, consumers will hold off until there is reassurrance that only one format will survive. 

NBC Universal and Paramount Pictures have both withdrawn earlier announcements of releasing movies this year on the next generation formats. Some industry insiders say it would be unlikely that any movies would be released this year based on a unified format of the two sides as it would take a few months to adjust the technologies from both sides and come up with a single format.

It was revealed today that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will be attending the Forbes Global CEO Conference in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; next week. Mr. Bush is a wealthy businessman and member of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASkull%20and%20Bones"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He has also been &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the head of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and is the father of the current &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

The conference will be held at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Forbes website says that at the event "senior figures from the world's leading companies and institutions will discuss the best ways to nurture and capitalize on innovation and reveal the latest global trends." Other attendees will be former New York mayor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARudolph%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudolph Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;NSW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Premier &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Carr"&gt;Bob Carr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and, controversially, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Forbes"&gt;Steve Forbes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , president and chief executive officer of Forbes Inc, and one of the signers of the Statement of Principles of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProject%20for%20the%20New%20American%20Century"&gt;Project for the New American Century&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Mr Knobloch of the 30A network described the attendees as "a few hundred &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aneo-conservative"&gt;neo-conservative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; corporate chiefs". An article written by James Goodman and hosted on the 30A network website alleges a connection between Mr Forbes, the Bush family, and the policies of the administration of George W. Bush. 

"Ironically enough, Forbes now leads the charge in the US business world against the 'Axis of Evil' (which of course includes Iran). Backing the US 'War on Terror' to the hilt, Forbes is one of Bush's key business sponsors. In January 2004 it proudly announced 'Bush is Best'," the article said. 

The 30A network is organising a protest in Sydney to coincide with the conference. It is not yet known if the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AASIO"&gt;ASIO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; risk assessment for the event will change as a result of Mr Bush attending.

The German federal Constitutional Court, the &lt;a href="w%3ABundesverfassungsgericht"&gt;Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/a&gt;, has dismissed the complaints by two Members of the &lt;a href="w%3ABundestag"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt; against the dissolving of the parliament and removed the last obstacle on the road to early elections on September 18th.

Jelena Hoffmann from chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Socialdemocrats&lt;/a&gt; and Werner Schulz from the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20%2790/The%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;, which are also members of the government, claimed that the loss of confidence by &lt;a href="Schr%C3%B6der%20loses%20motion%20of%20confidence"&gt;Schröder on July 1st&lt;/a&gt; was orchestrated and that President Horst Köhler had therefore no right to &lt;a href="German%20president%20dissolves%20parliament%3B%20elections%20in%20September"&gt;dissolve the Bundestag on July 21st&lt;/a&gt;.

The majority of the court, voting 7:1, disagreed with that assessment. It ruled, that Schröder's declaration, saying he does not have a reliable majority in parliament for his reform programme, is "plausible" and added that the Constitution grants the chancellor wide freedom in that matter.

Representatives of all major parties have welcomed the decision.

In &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARTE"&gt;RTÉ's&lt;/a&gt; new ♡❤"Rip Off Republic"♡❤ TV series has attracted a record audience of 667,000 for its second show, making it one of Ireland's top TV programs. The second show broadcast on Monday 15th August captured 50.5% of all TV viewers in Ireland.

The series which contains four shows broadcast from &lt;a href="w%3ADCU"&gt;Dublin City University's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤"Helix"♡❤ centre, aims to expose over pricing and the exploitation of consumers in Ireland. Hosted by financial advisor Eddie Hobbs, the show has attracted huge media commentry, particularly as it has attracted the attention of the governments main party, &lt;a href="w%3AFianna%20Fail"&gt;Fianna Fail&lt;/a&gt;. 

The main argument against the show has been that it generalises issues and makes exaggerated claims - for example it claimed that restaurants make a 300%+ profit on a typical bottle of wine, leading the viewer to believe that all businesses are making such a profit. This claim has since come under attack by restaurant owners nationwide. Other arguments against the show have stated that while &lt;a href="w%3Ainflation"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt; is less than 3%, wage growth is over 6% meaning people are still better off.

The third show will be broadcast on 29th August at 9.30pm on RTÉ One. It will focus on the transport sector in Ireland.

<h2>Red-Green alliance loses majority, yet future government uncertain</h2>

The alliance consisting of chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (SPD) and the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20%2790/The%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; has lost its majority. And while &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (CDU) got the most votes it performed much worse than projected and the SPD is only three seats behind thanks to several &lt;a href="w%3Aoverhang%20seat"&gt;overhang seats&lt;/a&gt;. But that could change slightly, when the &lt;a href="Death%20of%20candidate%20will%20delay%20final%20results%20for%20German%20federal%20election%20by%20weeks"&gt;outstanding by-election in Dresden is over&lt;/a&gt;. So who will govern the country for the next four years is completely uncertain. Both Schröder and Merkel reaffirmed their ambitions for the office of chancellor. But neither the CDU and the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Germany%29"&gt;Free Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (FDP) nor SPD and the Greens have a majority of seats in the Bundestag. A grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD now seems to be the likely option for a future government. But also a SPD-Greens-FDP or a CDU-Greens-FDP coalition seems possible. However FDP chair Guido Westerwelle said this party would not be available for a coalition with the SPD. &lt;a href="w%3ALeft%20Party%20%28Germany%29"&gt;The Left&lt;/a&gt; also doesn't want to form a coalition with any of the parties in Bundestag. They, along with the Free Democrats, are the only real winners of this election. After The Left only had 2 MPs in the last Bundestag, they are now stronger than ever before, getting 54 seats. The Free Democrats also scored one of their best results in their history, gaining 3% and getting 61 seats, which makes them the third biggest party in the Bundestag.

<h2>Background</h2>
About 61,9 million citizens were eligible to participate in this early election to the 16th German &lt;a href="w%3ABundestag"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;. It became necessary because chancellor Schröder deliberately lost a &lt;a href="Schr%C3%B6der%20loses%20motion%20of%20confidence"&gt;motion of confidence on July 1st&lt;/a&gt;. 3648 candidates are competing for the 598 seats (more in case of overhang seats) in the Bundestag. The voters in the constituency of Dresden I are not participating in today's election, the death of a candidate there forced a delayed by-election for the 2nd of October.&lt;br&gt;The all dominating topics of the election campaign were unemployment and the state of the German economy. Other hot issues include a taxation reform and changes to the health insurance system. The race was wide open till the end. Contrary to tradition, all parties concluded their campaigns on Saturday rather than Friday.

<h2>Coalitions</h2>

All parties say the possible coalitions exclude the Left, who might support the minority government of SPD-Greens. The Grand coalition (CDU/SPD) is possible only with Schroeder in power according to Schroeder, and only with Merkel in power according to Merkel.

The traffic light coalition (SPD-Green-FDP) is excluded by FDP. CDU is likely to try to lure the Greens into coalition, the only option that was not excluded. Also possible are the minority governments. It is still not clear who will be the new leader, and both CDU and SPD claim the right to appoint new chancellor. Although the leftists won, it is possible that conservatives will form government if Greens are willing.

<h2>♡❤♡Preliminary Results♡❤♡</h2>
♡❤♡Participation: 77.7% ♡❤♡

A new work has been just added to the list of the works on &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; that have been made in recent years including the genres of &lt;a href="w%3Afolklore"&gt;folklore&lt;/a&gt;, travel, monography and encyclopedia. ♡❤"Encyclopedic Dictionary of Black Sea"♡❤ by &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%96zhan%20%C3%96zt%C3%BCrk"&gt;Özhan Öztürk&lt;/a&gt; is also a first of its field. Etymological explanations are also given for the articles in the encyclopedic dictionary that is a product of work with both original resources and rather rich bibliographies. 

♡❤Encyclopedic Dictionary of Blacksea♡❤, a source for many answers on the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="w%3AAnatolia"&gt;Anatolia&lt;/a&gt;, looks like a work of a great labor. The dictionary is being published by Heyamola Publications and printed only in limited numbers. It can be a scientific resource for those who are interested in the history, culture and folklore of Black Sea. 

The author of the encyclopedia evaluates his work of 1260 pages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I don’t know why no archeological excavations have been made in the Pontic coast of Anatolia. Querying why no excavations have been made in such a region that has a dense settlement as mentioned in &lt;a href="w%3AAnabasis"&gt;Anabasis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AXenophon"&gt;Xenophon&lt;/a&gt; (B.C 401) is not the subject of this book. However, undoubtedly it will not be an optimistic experience to see that less excavations have been made here than in &lt;a href="w%3ACrimea"&gt;Crimea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AColchis"&gt;Colchis&lt;/a&gt;. Another interesting and discuss-worthy issue is why a realistic analysis of the original names of villages and quarters, used by the people even after the changes of the names in Republic era, is not been made in works on the region’s culture and history, including studies in &lt;a href="w%3ATurkish"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;. Limiting myself to cities as &lt;a href="w%3AOrdu"&gt;Ordu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGiresun"&gt;Giresun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATrabzon"&gt;Trabzon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARize"&gt;Rize&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AArtvin"&gt;Artvin&lt;/a&gt;, I worked on original words, idioms and toponyms used by Turkish dialect speakers, independent from their native language. I made comparisons with vernaculars from surrounding cities including &lt;a href="w%3ASamsun"&gt;Samsun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AErzurum"&gt;Erzurum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AG%C3%BCm%C3%BC%C5%9Fhane"&gt;Gümüşhane&lt;/a&gt;, Anatolia, and from some surrounding countries. I hope that the comparison of the original toponyms with equivalents from Anatolia, &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AHellas"&gt;Hellas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AArmenia"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAzerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; and other Turkish states could be useful for those interested in regional history, and influential for researchers."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While some village names in regions do match with the villages names in &lt;a href="w%3ACrete"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEpirus"&gt;Epirus&lt;/a&gt;, no equivalents are found in Anatolia and Northern Hellas. Some village names akin to those in Northern &lt;a href="w%3AAbkhazia"&gt;Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt;, the motherland of &lt;a href="w%3ALaz"&gt;Laz&lt;/a&gt;, show remnants of &lt;a href="w%3APelasgi"&gt;Pelasgi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThracians"&gt;Thracians&lt;/a&gt;, the population of Anatolia and Hellas, prior to the &lt;a href="w%3AIndo-Europeans"&gt;Indo-Europeans&lt;/a&gt;. This requires a re-examination not only of Anatolian and regional history, but also of the history of a wider area, ranging from the &lt;a href="w%3ACaucasus"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ABalkan"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;.

The City of in Ontario, Canada, and &lt;a href="w%3AMarikina%20City%2C%20Philippines"&gt;Marikina&lt;/a&gt; in the Philippines have recently been ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3Atwinned"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤.

Both cities are roughly the same size, both have female mayors, both are near urban destinations (one of &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Toronto,&lt;/a&gt; the other &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;) and feel they can benefit economically with each other.

Mayor Susan Fennell of Brampton commented "This twinning agreement between Brampton and Marikina City will not only provide new and exciting economic possibilities, but it is an excellent chance to recognize and celebrate the Filipino community in Brampton. As one of Canada's most diverse cities, Brampton is home to more than 8,000 Filipino residents with a distinct culture, and I am pleased to be able to celebrate that culture with this agreement."

Brampton is also a twin of &lt;a href="w%3APlano%2C%20Texas"&gt;Plano, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASatellite%20radio"&gt;Satellite radio&lt;/a&gt; provider &lt;a href="w%3ASirius%20Satellite%20Radio"&gt;Sirius Satellite Radio&lt;/a&gt; will soon release a portable player which mixes online radio recording with &lt;a href="w%3AMP3"&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Media%20Audio"&gt;Windows Media Audio&lt;/a&gt; (WMA) file format playback capabilities.

The S50 unit is bundled with the car dock being sold by Sirius. Users record radio programming from 
the car dock and transfer the files to the S50. Users can also opt to 
transfer programming via the home dock, but that device does not come 
bundled with the S50. Sirius notes that the unit can hold up to 50 
hours of satellite programming and MP3/WMA files. The latter is 
transferred to the system via PC. Users also have the option to listen 
to live radio broadcasts through the S50.

Rescuers are searching for the victims of the &lt;a href="w%3ATANS%20Peru"&gt;Tans Peru airliner&lt;/a&gt; crash which occurred earlier this month. Emergency services rescued 5 survivors on Thursday morning.

TANS say that 41 people were killed and a further 57 injured in this, the fifth airliner crash worldwide this month. The &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737-200&lt;/a&gt; airliner crash-landed in heavy jungle near the city of &lt;a href="w%3APucallpa"&gt;Pucallpa&lt;/a&gt;, 840 kilometers (522 miles) northeast of &lt;a href="w%3ALima%2C%20Peru"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city.
Peruvian authorities have ordered an investigation and have shipped the aircraft's two flight data recorders, or "black boxes" to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; for data retrieval.

Jorge Belevan said "We've also found five more survivors and that takes the number (of survivors) to 57. Two people are still missing and there are 41 dead," Local authorities also said that the death toll is likely to rise due to inaccessible location of the crash site. This is the second TANS Peru plane crash in three years, following the January 2003 crash of flight 222 in the Peruvian rainforest. In that plane crash there were no survivors.

Peruvian government lawyer Marco Ochoa said that rescuers are opening the skin of the aircraft to determine whether there are more bodies trapped inside.

Survivors said that the plane was caught in a fierce storm about 10 minutes before the crash. The plane then caught fire and landed in swampland.

After initially denying that he called for the assassination of &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;, the President of &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, he later apologized for the remark:

"Is it right to call for assassination? No, and I apologize for that statement", said Robertson.

On Wednesday, he initially denied having called for Chavez to be killed and said The Associated Press had misinterpreted his remarks.

"I didn't say 'assassination.' I said our special forces should 'take him out,'" Robertson said on his show. "'Take him out' could be a number of things including kidnapping."

The &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Wikipedia"&gt;Swedish language edition&lt;/a&gt; of the multilingual &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; project passed 100,000 articles this evening at 18:11 CEST. Swedish is the fifth language to reach this milestone, joining English, French, German, and Japanese.

The article growth was quite modest when 100 articles remained, but at 18:09, with less than 50 articles left, people started submitting a lot of articles. Most of them were written in advance, according to visitors at the IRC channel. The &lt;a href="w%3Asv%3AJ%C3%B3gvan%20vi%C3%B0%20Keldu"&gt;100,000th article&lt;/a&gt; is believed to be about a minister of the Faroe Islands, ♡❤Jógvan við Keldu♡❤, according to announcement pages on the site minutes after the milestone was passed. Some concerns were raised, however, and a Wikipedian claimed on the village pump that the article ♡❤Epiglottal klusil♡❤ ("linguistic subject") was number 100,000.

The Swedish edition is said to have been started in May 2001, but didn't see much growth until November 2002 when several contributors arrived. The 50,000 mark was passed less than a year ago.

The Swedish Wikipedia operates using the same basic principles as its larger &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20Wikipedia"&gt;English language sister edition&lt;/a&gt;, which include writing from a Neutral Point of View and making content open using the &lt;a href="w%3AGNU%20Free%20Documentation%20License"&gt;GNU Free Documentation License&lt;/a&gt;.

The size is quite large compared to the number of speakers of Swedish worldwide (about 9 million). The Swedish edition is larger than some languages with hundreds of millions of speakers such as Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and Hindi. The reason for this is somewhat obscure, but discussions on the central discussion forum of the site, Bybrunnen (a literal translation of "village pump"), say this is because articles are considerably shorter than on other Wikipedias and that the Internet connectivity is very high in Sweden. Other Wikipedias for languages spoken in Northern Europe (including Norwegian, Danish and Finnish) also have a high number of articles compared to the number of speakers.

An American not-for-profit organisation has released statistics that show that &lt;a href="w%3Aobesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; rates rose last year in all but one state.

According to the ♡❤Trust for America’s Health♡❤ the only state not to see a rise was Oregon, which remained at the same level. In ten states more than a quarter of adults are defined as being obese: Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia,
Louisiana, Tennessee, Texas, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana, and South Carolina. Mississippi is the heaviest state, while Colorado is the lightest.

In total 119 million Americans - some 65% of the population - now have a body weight that rates them as being overweight or heavier. In 2004 24.5% of the population was rated as being obese - up from 23.7% the year before. Even in the military, 16% of personnel are obese.

The U.S. Department of Health has a target of reducing obesity in adults to 15% or less by 2010. Critics say federal programs to combat the issue are too limited and that urban planning is not helping.

In &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, which is suffering its worst drought since 1945, some 1,500 firefighters and 600 soldiers battled forest fires that have raged for six days.They said cooler temperatures and higher air humidity levels helped them to contain more than a dozen fires but the risk of new ones remained high.
Five fires were still burning out of control in the thick-wooded center and north of the country, down from 21 on Tuesday.
The largest fire was raging in a forest near Coimbra, Portugal's third-largest city and forced the evacuation of around 60 people from a village near the central town of Penela but firefighters saw hope.
"The intensity of the fire is diminishing considerably. Let's see if we are a bit luckier today," the fire chief of Penela, Mario Lourenco, told radio TSF.
Neighboring &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, too, has this week battled blazes in the north that have so far destroyed more than 19,000 hectares (46,800 acres) this month.

Refugee groups and protesters in the United Kingdom are concerned over plans to forcibly deport around 20 rejected asylum seekers to Northern Iraq from the detention centres where they are currently being held beginning August 28.

Despite a warning by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees"&gt;UN High Commission for Refugees&lt;/a&gt; that no part of &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; is now safe, the Home Office is reported to be sending the men back as soon as 28 August in an Iraqi military aeroplane. Paul Kessler of UNHCR has said that kidnappings and other security problems are still common in Northern Iraq. 

Returns to Iraq had been voluntary, but according to The Times around 100 rejected asylum seekers have been arrested and are now in detention. 

Demonstrations have been held across the country and are expected outside the Home Office today, 26 August. 

A spokesperson for the Refugee Council said: "It is one thing for people to return voluntarily and accept the risk. But there seems to be no urgent reason to remove people now. Iraq is in a state of turmoil."

The Home Office has not yet commented on the case. They have previously backed down under pressure. Zimbabwean asylum seekers were given amnesty from deportation until October following headlines such as that on the front page of right-wing Daily Mail "For pity's sake, let them stay".

<h1>Montreal lab questions ethics of recent EPO doping claims against Lance Armstrong</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Montreal%20lab%20questions%20ethics%20of%20recent%20EPO%20doping%20claims%20against%20Lance%20Armstrong&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Dr. Christiane Ayotte is Doping Control director at Canada's Institut National de la Recherché Scientifique, which is a &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Anti-doping%20Agency"&gt;World Anti-doping Agency&lt;/a&gt; (WADA) certified lab. Dr. Ayotte said on Tuesday (Aug. 23) that three ethically critical, and important, scientific questions were raised by a four-page &lt;a href="Lance%20Armstrong%20denies%20EPO%20doping%20claim"&gt;doping allegation&lt;/a&gt; in the French cycling daily ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AL%27%C3%89quipe"&gt;L'Équipe&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. ♡❤L'Équipe♡❤ released lab data with a medical identification allegedly finding banned &lt;a href="w%3AErythropoietin"&gt;EPO&lt;/a&gt; in five year old samples of cyclist Lance Armstrong's urine, originally taken after he won the 1999 &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;. 

Ayotte expressed surprise that chemical testing of 1999 urine could have been done in 2004 at the French national anti-doping laboratory at Châtenay-Malabry. She said that she routinely instructs all doping laboratory organizations that EPO deteriorates and disappears after two or three months, even if the urine is frozen. Ayotte does not question whether the new type of analysis is correct; rather she questions the ethics of long-delayed test results. 

The first ethical problem , in her opinion, is that an adverse finding cannot be confirmed with second samples, as required by WADA regulations. She states that there are normally two samples, "A" and "B". The Châtenay-Malabry EPO findings were based on Armstrong's "B" samples. Armstrong's "A" samples were depleted in 1999 for tests that did not include EPO, because no EPO test was available that year. 

French Sports Minister Jean-François Lamour said that without the "A" samples, no disciplinary action could be taken against Armstrong. 

The second ethical problem, in Ayotte's view, is that an athlete charged with doping long after the athletic event has no way to submit to additional testing to disprove an adverse finding. 

The third ethical problem for Ayotte is that ♡❤L'Équipe♡❤ disclosed Armstrong's medical identity. "It seems to me," Ayotte continued, "that this whole thing is breach of the WADA code. We are supposed to work confidentially until such time that we can confirm a result. By no means does this mean that we sweep a result under the carpet, but it has to meet a certain set of requirements." 

Ayotte continued, "I'm worried, because I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues in Paris. I am concerned that they did not cover their backs before being dragged into a very public issue of this kind."

Lance Armstrong has responded on his &lt;a href="http%3A//www.lancearmstrong.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, branding ♡❤L'Équipe's♡❤ reporting as being "nothing short of tabloid journalism." Armstrong says: "I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance[-]enhancing drugs."

Further confusing public understanding of the EPO doping claim is Armstrong's statement in his autobiography, ♡❤It's Not About the Bike♡❤: he said he received EPO during his cancer chemotherapy treatment. "It was the only thing that kept me alive," he wrote.

Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour de France, said that Armstrong owes cycling fans an explanation. Leblanc said; "For the first time&amp;mdash;and these are no longer rumors, or insinuations, these are proven scientific facts&amp;mdash;someone has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a banned substance called EPO in his body."

In a study accepted for publication by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Journal%20of%20Psychology"&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Dr. Paul Irwing (&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20Business%20School"&gt;Manchester Business School&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Lecturer in Organizational Psychology) and Prof. Richard Lynn (&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Ulster"&gt;University of Ulster&lt;/a&gt;, Professor Emeritus) conclude that men are on average five points ahead on IQ tests. The study also found that men outnumbered women in increasing numbers as intelligence levels rise. There were twice as many with IQ scores of 125, a level typical for people with first-class degrees. When scores rose to 155, a level associated with genius, there were 5.5 men for every woman.

Professor Lynn has a number of previous articles arguing that there are differences in intelligence between racial groups. In a 2003 study, he found a correlation between average IQ and prosperity in 60 countries. In a letter to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Psychologist"&gt;The Psychologist&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Professor Lynn claimed “Men have larger brains than women by about 10% and larger brains confer greater brain power, so men must necessarily be on average more intelligent than women.” Most psychologists view brain size as less significant than numerous other gender differences. One reason brain size may not be significant is that the majority of the brain is not involved in "providing intelligence" but rather performs mundane tasks; such as regulating pulse and breathing, processing inputs from the five senses, and providing redundancy in case of brain damage. Larger brains may contain more space devoted to such functions, and the same or even less space devoted to intelligence. Colloquially, elephants and whales have brains many times the size of the human brain, yet do not appear to be more intelligent.

Earlier this year, the president of Harvard University, &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Summers"&gt;Lawrence Summers&lt;/a&gt;, sparked a controversy when he suggested that "intrinsic aptitude" was responsible for the low numbers of women at the top in many fields, especially in science and engineering. In response to Summers comment, &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Pinker"&gt;Stephen Pinker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20Spelke"&gt;Elizabeth Spelke&lt;/a&gt; held a debate on the conclusions which can be drawn from the extensive existing scientific research on gender differences. Spelke held that discrimination remained the primary factor keeping women from going into physics, mathematics, and computer science; while Pinker suggested that life choices were more important today. This debate is considered an exceptionally good introduction to the subject for lay-persons. 

Several subtle points popularized by the Pinker vs. Spelke debate are relevant to the Irwing &amp; Lynn study. First, females benefit significantly from single sex education, but single sex education has little impact upon males. As a consequence, the Irwing &amp; Lynn study can not lay claim to a biological difference in intelligence, unless it restricts itself to women attending all girls schools. Secondly, the process of natural selection leads males of any species to have more variance in most traits. As a result, Stephen Pinker suggests that one should find "more geniuses and more idiots" among human males (see Pinker slide 41). As a consequence, any omission of people at the lower end of the IQ spectrum would bias the average male IQ upward, relative to the average female IQ . 

Neither Pinker nor Spelke suggests brain size is particularly important. However, both agree that men and women have different mental strengths and even handle various mental tasks differently. Both see these differences as an asset to the scientific community.

IQ tests have been criticized for testing how similar a person's thought processes are to the author of the tests, primarily men, rather than how intelligent they are. In particular, some tests have been biased towards thought processes where males are dominant, such as 3D spatial rotation and visualization. Tests devised by females would be more likely to emphasize female strengths, such as computation and communication. Many modern IQ tests attempt to control for gender differences by including more questions targeted at female strengths. However, such efforts are hampered by the lack of a clear definition of intelligence.

Berlin's Neukoellner Opera House is causing a stir with its new production, ♡❤The Yellow Princess♡❤.

The story presented in the French opera, by Camille Saint-Saens, is of an artist "whose life is dictated by a love for drugs and Japan." As a result, the performers smoke cannabis joints on stage, and the theatre itself is encouraging the audience to join in.

Artistic director Bernhard Glocksin says that the theatre is claiming the metaphorical "artistic licence", to excuse the actions of the actors and audience, which are against German law. Glocksin was quoted by Ananova as saying opera would be "improved with a few joints and some appetising lines", noting the production was partly an experiment, to see what they could "get away with."

"&lt;a href="w%3AArtistic%20licence"&gt;Artistic licence&lt;/a&gt;" is at par to an "artistic liberty", where something is exaggerated or changed for the sake of the art itself. For example a visual artist painting a landscape might move a tree to another area of their work, for better balance, or a poet ignoring pentameter when writing a traditional sonnet.

&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; businessman Xiao Li Bei has received permission to keep his deceased friend in an industrial freezer.

Police in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ANovosibirsk"&gt;Novosibirsk&lt;/a&gt; discovered the body during a routine health and safety inspection of Xiao's warehouse. Xiao, of &lt;a href="w%3AChinese"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; ancestry, told police that his friend died of natural causes two years prior.

Challenged in court on the issue, prosecutors allowed Xiao to continue on as he has, unless evidence contrary to the natural death claim arises. There is no Russian law against personally storing human remains.

Xiao commented "I just thought it would be easier to store the body myself. There's so much bureaucracy here I knew the paperwork would be endless otherwise. And I have a large industrial freezer in my warehouse."

A &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) committee comprising of 43 African health ministers has declared a &lt;a href="w%3Atuberculosis"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; emergency on the continent.

The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in African countries per year has quadrupled since 1990, and continues to rise. Now 540,000 people die of the disease in Africa every year.

Worldwide, TB kills two million people a year; the only deadlier disease in the world is HIV/AIDS.

Some African countries such as Tanzania and Malawi pioneered TB control strategies that were later adopted around the globe. But they were not successful - Malawi saw the number of TB cases a year rise by four times over the past 15 years. Poverty, poor health systems and HIV have been blamed by the WHO for this.

Funding is a particularly critical issue. Eight of the nine worst affected African countries reported that, for 2003, they had short-falls in the funding their TB control programmes needed. However the WHO stresses that money alone will not end the crisis - health systems must be improved, and the rate at which health professionals are lost in the region must be reduced.

Africa is the only region in the world to be experiencing an increase in TB cases - in the rest of the world, infection rates are either stable or falling.

A &lt;a href="w%3AMidland%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Midland, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; hotel was temporarily quarantined Thursday night when a letter with suspicious white powder was opened at the Ashman Court Hotel on Main Street.

A hotel employee is said to have opened the letter around 16:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; time on Thursday. Shortly after, the police, &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHAZMAT"&gt;HAZMAT&lt;/a&gt; teams were called to the building. Preliminary results from &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; tests showed that the envelope did not contain the deadly bacteria &lt;a href="w%3Aanthrax"&gt;anthrax&lt;/a&gt;, as first thought.
The letter contained "a threat" according to local reports, however details were not released. It is also unknown as to what substance the white powder is.

This is the second anthrax scare on the city this year, exactly four months ago the ♡❤Midland Daily News♡❤ office, located across the street to the hotel, &lt;a href="Anthrax%20scare%20closes%20Michigan%20newspaper%20office"&gt;was sent a similar envelope&lt;/a&gt; with suspicious powder. It is not known if the two cases are related or not.

<h2>Audio Wikinews transcript – 2005 08 27 – 1100 UTC</h2>

The time is 1100 UTC on Saturday 27th August, and this is Audio Wikinews: News Briefs.
&lt;a href="Hurricane%20Katrina%20strikes%20Florida%2C%20kills%20seven"&gt;Hurricane Katrina strikes Florida, kills seven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As hurricane Katrina moves beyond the Floridian peninsula, death tolls are beginning to surface. On Friday, the official count was seven dead, at least five missing. The forecast for Hurricane Katrina predicts that it will continue on its present northwesterly course and approach the panhandle of Florida and the Mississippi delta region in the next few days.

Katrina was downgraded to a tropical storm as it made landfall on Friday in southern Florida's Miami and Fort Lauderdale metropolitan areas.

Katrina turned back into a hurricane with winds of 100 miles per hour - or 160 kilometres per hour - when it reached the warmer Gulf of Mexico waters.
&lt;a href="World%20Health%20Organization%20declares%20tuberculosis%20emergency%20in%20Africa"&gt;World Health Organization declares tuberculosis emergency in Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A World Health Organization committee comprising 43 African health ministers has declared a tuberculosis emergency in the continent.

The number of Tb cases in African countries per year has quadrupled since 1990, and continues to rise. Now 540,000 people die of the disease in Africa every year.

The only more deadly disease in the world is HIV/AIDS.
&lt;a href="UK%20study%20claims%20men%20more%20intelligent%20than%20women"&gt;UK study claims men more intelligent than women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In a study accepted for publication by the British Journal of Psychology, Dr. Paul Irwing (Senior Lecturer in Organizational Psychology at Manchester Business School) and Prof. Richard Lynn (of the University of Ulster) conclude that men are on average five points ahead of women on IQ tests. The study also found that men outnumbered women in increasing numbers as intelligence levels rise. There were twice as many with IQ scores of 125, a level typical for people with first-class degrees. When scores rose to 155, a level associated with genius, there were 5.5 men for every woman.

Every Wednesday at 6 p.m., writers of any genre meet at an informal writers' workshop at the Ashland Underground, located at 220 W. Main in Ashland, Wisconsin, U.S.A. 

A project of the Chequamegon Bay Word Affiliate, area writers have met each week for almost three years. The group of published and aspiring writers first began meeting at the Black Cat, a local cafe, but recently moved to the Underground, where a member book cooperative has been set-up for affiliate and community readers. 

The Chequamegon Bay Word Affiliate also holds its annual Earth Day Reading each year at the nearby Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center. 

Writers of any and all skill levels can meet at the free workshop, and are encouraged to bring their latest works.

<h1>Two arrests made in Zotob worm attack</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Two%20arrests%20made%20in%20Zotob%20worm%20attack&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Moroccan&lt;/a&gt; authorities arrested two suspects who are believed to be the creators of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZotob"&gt;Zotob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; worm that took down ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACNN%E2%80%99s"&gt;CNN’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ computer network and crippled other computers in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and worldwide earlier this month.
The &lt;a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; traced an electronic trail that led to two men from the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and North Africa. An 18-year old Moroccan, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFarid%20Essebar"&gt;Farid Essebar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is believed to have written the worm in return for a payment from a 21-year old Turk Atilla Ekici. Both were arrested Friday and await prosecution in their respective countries.

It appears that Essebar and Ekici never met personally, and conducted the entire cyber crime through contact with each other over the internet. The online monikers for the two is believed to be "Diabl0" for Essebar and “Coder” for Ekici.

The speedy pace at which investigators made arrests is credited from working closely with the &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, and Moroccan and Turkish authorities, said the FBI assistant director Louis Reigel. "Had we not had those entities involved in this investigation, I suspect it would still be ongoing today."
Microsoft investigators began in March to analyze an e-mail variant called Mytob, which emerged in late February. The two suspects are believed to have authored the predecessor to Mytob, known then as 'Rbot'. These worms could plant in infected computers a backdoor that could be used to gain remote access to the computer and their networks at a later date.

The release of the Zytob worm yielded more evidence of the perpetrators’ identities. The motive for the attacks appears to be financial gain and not terrorist related. The two men allegedly forwarded stolen financial information to a credit-card fraud ring, according to the Moroccan government.

The 5-year-old &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWindows%202000"&gt;Windows 2000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; operating system is most vulnerable to attack. The worm uses a flaw in the Windows Plug and Play service; a flaw for which Microsoft has issued a patch. But an August 23 Microsoft &lt;a href="http%3A//www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/906574.mspx"&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; notes that some non-default configurations of Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems could also be at risk. XP SP2 users are not at risk.

A cork was temporarily used to fix a fuel leak on a British passenger train. The leak was created when the train struck a concrete block that vandals left on the tracks.

Train service on the Paddington to Exeter line was stopped around Bath. This abrupt stop created a hole in the sightglass which helps monitor fuel levels. Worried the incident could cause a fuel leak, staff decided to use the cork of a wine bottle found in the buffet car, to block the hole. An incident that people worried would cause a delay of hours, was cleared up in around 20 minutes.

On August 22, &lt;a href="w%3ATajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt; border guards spotted and shot down a home-made aircraft carrying heroin, on route from &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Tajik officials say that the piloted &lt;a href="w%3APowered%20parachute"&gt;paraplane&lt;/a&gt; was transporting 18 kilograms of heroin above their southeast border. Border guards launched a search operation to find the pilot, believed to be wounded.

The deputy head of Tajik's border troops, Sabza Sarkorov, said to the media that this was actually the first narcotics interception of its kind. Smugglers have used paraplanes to move drugs across the border for three years. Earlier attempts to bring them down have been unsuccessful until now. 

The country is a prime route for illegal drugs from Afghanistan, which is the world's top opium producer.

Accused of &lt;a href="w%3AErythropoietin"&gt;EPO&lt;/a&gt; doping by the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; cycling daily ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AL%27%C3%89quipe"&gt;L'Équipe&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in a four page story on Aug. 23, cyclist Lance Armstrong appeared on CNN's ♡❤Larry King Live♡❤ TV show Aug. 25, saying he did not trust the French testers or the French testing system, and that his urine was manipulated to falsely accuse him of doping.

Dr. Christiane Ayotte, director of a Montreal doping detection laboratory said that ethically critical and important scientific questions were raised by the &lt;a href="Lance%20Armstrong%20denies%20EPO%20doping%20claim"&gt;EPO doping allegation&lt;/a&gt; against seven-time Tour de France winner Armstrong. 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; Cycling official Gerard Bisceglia said these ♡❤L'Équipe♡❤ charges were unfair and lacked credibility. Bisceglia is chief executive of USA Cycling, principal authority over Armstrong for cycling sports in the United States.

♡❤L'Équipe♡❤ released Paris lab data allegedly finding banned EPO in five year old samples of Armstrong's urine, originally taken after he won the 1999 &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;. No official source would confirm medical identification of Armstrong as provider of the anonymously tested urine, and to do so would be a violation of &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Anti-doping%20Agency"&gt;World Anti-doping Agency&lt;/a&gt; (WADA) regulations. 

Armstrong suggested motivation for such manipulation is a French national hatred of all non-French sport winners, and specifically because a French rider has not won the Tour de France for a quarter century. As evidence of malice toward him, Armstrong cited a French newspaper poll in which he was named the third most hated sportsman in France. 

Dr. Ayotte is Doping Control director at Canada's Institut National de la Recherché Scientifique in Montreal, which is a WADA certified lab nearest to WADA's Montreal headquarters. Ayotte is also a world class scientific authority and instructor on sports doping detection. Dr. Ayotte's expert opinion has significant influence on the outcome of WADA regulatory decisions. 

♡❤L'Équipe♡❤ reported that the EPO detection method used was experimental, which raises a scientific question. All experimentally based forensic evidence is subject to the close scrutiny of scientific opinions before it can be used in a disciplinary or legal proceeding. 

Ayotte expressed surprise that chemical testing of 1999 urine could have been done in 2004 at the French national anti-doping laboratory at Châtenay-Malabry. She said that she routinely instructs all doping laboratory organizations, that previously detectable EPO protein deteriorates and disappears after two or three months, even if the urine is frozen. 

Ayotte thinks that a new statistical mathematics model was used to reanalyze numerical data resulting from earlier chemical testing. "My interpretation is that retesting itself must have been conducted in 2000 or in 2001, but the results were reviewed using the new mathematical model that is now being developed in Paris."

Ayotte does not question whether the new type of analysis is correct; rather she questions the ethics of long-delayed test results. 

The first ethical problem is that this adverse finding cannot be confirmed with second samples. There are normally available two urine samples, "A" and "B". The Châtenay-Malabry EPO findings were based on Armstrong's "B" samples. Armstrong's "A" samples were depleted in 1999 for tests that did not include EPO, because no EPO test was available that year. 

Without addressing the ethics problem, Dick Pound, the head of WADA, said. "You can count on the fingers of one hand the times a "B" sample has not confirmed the result of the "A" sample".

Both France and USA officials observed that ♡❤L'Équipe's♡❤ unofficial adverse finding was not consistent with WADA regulations. French Sports Minister Jean-François Lamour said that without the "A" samples, no disciplinary action could be taken against Armstrong. USA official Bisceglia confirmed that WADA regulations require a confirming "A" test to prove guilt.

The second ethical problem, according to Ayotte, is that an athlete charged with doping long after the athletic event, has no way to submit to additional testing to disprove an adverse finding. This same ethical problem was also stated by USA official Bisceglia. 

The third ethical problem for Ayotte is that ♡❤L'Équipe♡❤ disclosed Armstrong's medical identity. "It seems to me," Ayotte continued, "that this whole thing is breach of the WADA code. We are supposed to work confidentially until such time that we can confirm a result. By no means does this mean that we sweep a result under the carpet, but it has to meet a certain set of requirements." 

In a further ethical complication, the medical identification of Armstrong is completely unofficial and is made only by ♡❤L'Équipe♡❤. Ayotte characterized the disclosure as "leaked". 

Châtenay-Malabry's lab refused to confirm ♡❤L'Équipe's♡❤ claim that the urine samples belonged to Armstrong. Nor is it likely that Châtenay-Malabry will ever identify Armstrong, because WADA regulations require that all single "B" samples used for experimental testing must remain permanently anonymous. Ayotte said, "I'm worried, because I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues in Paris. I am concerned that they did not cover their backs before being dragged into a very public issue of this kind." 

Lance Armstrong has responded on his &lt;a href="http%3A//www.lancearmstrong.com/"&gt;LanceArmstrong.com website&lt;/a&gt;, branding ♡❤L'Équipe's♡❤ reporting as being "nothing short of tabloid journalism." Armstrong says: "I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs."

Further confusing public understanding of the EPO doping claim is Armstrong's statement in his autobiography, ♡❤It's Not About the Bike♡❤: he said he received EPO during his cancer chemotherapy treatment. "It was the only thing that kept me alive," he wrote. 

Armstrong last received chemotherapy EPO in late 1996. Apparently speaking from his knowledge of conventional EPO testing, Armstrong agrees that traces of 1996 synthetic EPO should not have been present in his 1999 urine. There are now tests to distinguish natural from synthetic EPO. But it remains an unresearched scientific question whether the sensitivity of the experimental new method could detect use of synthetic EPO from three years previously. By scientific analogy, the &lt;a href="w%3APolymerase%20chain%20reaction"&gt;polymerase chain reaction&lt;/a&gt; process can detect as little as a single molecule of DNA. 

Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour de France, said that Armstrong owes cycling fans an explanation. Armstrong subsequently provided an explanation claiming urine test manipulation.

Leblanc also said; "For the first time&amp;mdash;and these are no longer rumors, or insinuations, these are proven scientific facts&amp;mdash;someone has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a banned substance called EPO in his body." 

"When people start using comments like, 'irrefutable scientific evidence,' that's a pretty strong statement to make," said Bisceglia, "when the person you're making it about has never been given the opportunity to refute the statement. You're making claims about something that took place in 1999. Based on what I've read, it's pretty clear that any opportunity to have a black-and-white resolution to this case has been destroyed."

Bisceglia said that USA Cycling, the governing body in the United States, lacks the officially required evidence, and therefore will not investigate the ♡❤L'Équipe♡❤ report.

Australian Members of Parliament &lt;a href="w%3ABronwyn%20Bishop"&gt;Bronwyn Bishop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASophie%20Panopoulos"&gt;Sophie Panopoulos&lt;/a&gt; have called for a ban on the wearing of Islamic headscarves in Australian public schools, saying it is an "iconic act of defiance." 
They are concerned about Muslim women failing to reveal their faces in photographic identification, and claim that this could be a security risk.

Bishop and Panopoulous are both members of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal Party of Australia&lt;/a&gt; which is the major party in the governing &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Coalition&lt;/a&gt;.
Bishop said there is a clash of cultures occurring in the country: "In an ideal society you don't ban anything," she told a television interviewer.
She indicated she was talking of a ban only in schools, not at home.

Australian Muslims have angrily disagreed, say they should be allowed to comply with their religious doctrine.
The moves to ban the Islamic headscarf - the &lt;a href="w%3Ahijab"&gt;hijab&lt;/a&gt; - began in France where it is banned from government schools.

The Australian Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has responded stating that he is against any ban.

&lt;a href="Mandatory%20evacuation%20declared%20in%20New%20Orleans%2C%20US"&gt;Mandatory evacuation declared in New Orleans, US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With Hurricane Katrina likely to strike the city of New Orleans, its mayor, along with the governor of Louisiana, has officially enforced a mandatory evacuation for the city. All citizens, with the exception of a few individuals essential to the operation of a handful of organizations (such as hotels, the media, etc...), should immediately leave the city and head for higher ground.

For state evacuation information, call United States telephone number 1.800.469.4828

Turkish and Moroccan authorities arrested two suspects who are believed to be the creators of the Zotob worm that took down CNN’s computer network and crippled other computers worldwide earlier this month.

The FBI traced an electronic trail that led to two men from the Middle East and North Africa. An 18-year old Moroccan, Farid Essebar, is believed to have written the worm in return for a payment from a 21-year old Turk Atilla Ekici. Both were arrested Friday and await prosecution in their respective countries.

<h1>Service cutoff extended for unresponsive U.S. VoIP users</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Service%20cutoff%20extended%20for%20unresponsive%20U.S.%20VoIP%20users&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;

A Tuesday service cutoff deadline in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; for tens of thousands of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Voice%20over%20IP"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt; customers who failed to reply to a service limitation notification from their provider was extended by 30 days, to September 28. In an &lt;a href="w%3A%20Federal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; mandate, VoIP providers such as &lt;a href="w%3A%20List%20of%20assets%20owned%20by%20Time%20Warner"&gt;Time Warner Cable&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVonage"&gt;Vonage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVerizon"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, were to send notice to customers asking them acknowledge the possible limitations of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Enhanced%20911"&gt;E911&lt;/a&gt; access and to keep a record of their replies.

Specifically, the FCC mandated that VoIP providers must advise subscribers of the circumstances under which E911 service may not be available, and distribute stickers or other appropriate labels with a warning that E911 service may be limited or not available, and instruct the subscriber to place them on or near the equipment used in conjunction with the service. Lastly, the provider is to obtain and keep a record of affirmative acknowledgement by every subscriber, both new and existing.

A significant number of VoIP customers did not reply to the warning letter. This led the Voice on the Net Coalition, with &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House Representative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABart%20Gordon"&gt;Bart Gordon&lt;/a&gt; (D-TN) and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Nelson%20%28politician%29"&gt;Bill Nelson&lt;/a&gt; (D-FL) and other lawmakers to write FCC Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Martin%20%28FCC%29"&gt;Kevin Martin&lt;/a&gt; with their concerns. For some customers, it was feared that if the VoIP service was ended, they would have no phone service.

The E911 system allows emergency operators to link a caller's physical location with the phone used to dial for help. Conventional phones have had that capability for years, but not all VoIP providers have the technology for such a system in place. Cell phone companies are also struggling to upgrade their products for E911 capability.

VoIP use reported by the TeleGeography Research Group showed strong customer growth during the second quarter of this year. Subscribers increased nearly 40 percent over the first quarter, from roughly 1.9 million to 2.7 million.

Users of VoIP seem far from scared off by concerns over E911 connectivity despite findings that indicate the majority are interested in it as a primary phone line replacement. "To get [VoIP telephony], you’ve got to have a broadband connection, that means you’re a reasonably affluent consumer, you’ve got a cell phone, you’ve got some sort of backup plan in place," said Stephan Beckert, an analyst for TeleGeography. "There was a group that said they would not get it because of the problems with E911. But there was a surprisingly large core group that really didn’t worry about it."

A Palestinian man carrying explosives blew himself up during rush hour in &lt;a href="w%3ABeersheba"&gt;Beersheba&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first act of suicidal bombing since the Israel pull out of the 25 Jewish settlements on the Gaza Strip.

Twelve hours after the blast, two groups jointly claimed responsibility for the attack. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades linked to Fatah and Al-Quds Brigades of Islamic Jihad identified the bomber as Alaa Zaakik, 25, from Beit Omar. Beit Omar is situated between Bethlehem and Hebron in the West Bank.

The Palestinian president, &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, has condemned the bombing. The bombing critically wounded two security guards at the Beersheba bus station and hurt another 46 people.

Shortly after the attack, the Israeli cabinet voted to allow Egypt to patrol the international border with Gaza with 750 armed men. A final vote, which is expected to pass in a special Israeli Parliament session on Wednesday, will allow Israel to pull all its soldiers out of Gaza in the next month.

An Israeli official, Raanan Gissin, aide to prime minister Ariel Sharon, commented on the bombing. He described the attack as "a wake-up call that brings us back to the reality of terrorism after the euphoria of the Gaza disengagement." He later said, "As long as the Palestinians don't take decisive action against terrorism this will continue, and Abbas's strategy of making political deals with terrorist organizations will come back to haunt him." Mr. Gissin concluded his statement by saying. "They smell that he's weak, and they'll keep pressing."

The &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Little%20League%20World%20Series"&gt;2005 edition&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20League%20World%20Series"&gt;Little League World Series&lt;/a&gt; ended in thrilling fashion as Ewa Beach, &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; overcame a three run deficit in the last inning and eventually beat defending champion &lt;a href="w%3ACura%C3%A7ao"&gt;Curacao&lt;/a&gt; 7-6 in extra innings of the international championship game in front of a crowd of over 25,000. It is the first Little League World Series title for an American team since Kentucky beat Japan in 2002.

Going into the sixth and final inning, the team from Ewa Beach was trailing 6-3 to the team from Willemstad, Curacao. However, a couple of key hits and timely bunts closed the gap, and Ewa Beach tied the game after Curacao was unable to complete a potential game-ending double play. Curacao was able to get out of the inning as the Little League championship game was sent into extra innings for the first time in over 30 years. After shutting down Curacao in the top of the seventh, Hawaii came up in the bottom of the seventh with a chance to complete the comeback. Hawaii's Michael Memea would finish what his teammates started by hitting a line drive solo home run with no one out to give Hawaii its first Little League championship.

Curacao was trying to become the first back-to-back champions in Little League since Long Beach, California did it in 1992 and 1993.

The designer of the current 50-star &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States flag&lt;/a&gt;, Robert G. Heft, has put his original creation up for sale on the popular auction website &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;.

Heft originally made the flag for a school project in 1958, in which he received a "B minus" as his grade. When he submitted the design for national consideration in 1959, he beat out over 100,000 other applicants. His design was adopted as the new flag in 1960 and his grade was promptly changed to an "A".

The flag has been flown over all state capitol buildings and over 80 United States embassies. Sixty-three year-old Heft explained that medical bills, as well as tuition costs for his relatives, are becoming an economic burden.

The opening bid on the flag starts at $250,000 &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;, and the auction lasts until September 28th.

Heft has also designed a 51-star US flag, which is currently in possession of Representative Clarence Miller, a &lt;a href="w%3AGOP"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;.

News agency AAP reported last Thursday that &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; would be attending the Forbes Global CEO Conference, which starts this Tuesday. These reports have now been revealed to be a hoax. They were based on a media release and associated website, and &lt;a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush%20to%20attend%20Sydney%20CEO%20conference"&gt;reported in Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a number of print publications in Australia. The president and publisher of Forbes Asia, William Adamopoulos, has confirmed that Mr Bush will not be attending.

"Mr Bush, Sr. is definitely not attending the conference," he said.

Mr Adamopoulos said that he is considering pursuing legal action against the originators of the hoax. According to reports, the media release and website used the Forbes name. 

"While we would not wish to oppose free speech in any way - for free speech is one of the things that unites both Australia and the United States - we are investigating what legal action could be open to us," he said.

Two &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; broadsheets fell for the hoax put out by the 30A protest network. The network sent out a press release purporting to be from the organisers of the Annual Forbes Conference, claiming that former US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; was to attend the conference. Bruce Knobloch of the 30A network indicated that the purpose of the hoax was to show how shallow the media coverage of the conference and the protest is.

The hoax was originally reported by AAP, who checked the claim with a telephone number provided on the press release before publishing it. The hoax was then picked up by several internet news sites, including this one. AAP quickly published a retraction, however that didn't stop the hoax making its way into the paper versions of two of Australia's most respected broadsheets, ♡❤The Sydney Morning Herald♡❤, and ♡❤The Australian♡❤.

The Forbes conference will take place at the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, and will be attended by hundreds of CEOs from around the world, as well as Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, former New York Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARudolph%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudolph Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Forbes"&gt;Steve Forbes&lt;/a&gt; himself.

There is a protest planned to coincide with the conference. Protest organisers have called for people to assemble at Customs Square at Circular Quay at 5pm on Tuesday 30 August. The protest was originally planned for the Opera House forecourt, however police have declared this area to be an exclusion zone.

Organisers of the 30A Protest, planned to coincide with this weeks Forbes Global CEO Conference, have reached an agreement with police about how the protest should proceed. The 30A Network has received permission to use the Customs Square area of Circular Quay.

"After weeks of discussion and stalling, police have now given assurances that, while the Opera House forecourt will remain an exclusion zone between the CEOs and the real world, the 30A carnival protest will be facilitated at Customs Square," said the 30A Network website.

The plans for the mass gathering were thrown into turmoil over the last few weeks when police refused permission for the protest to occur near the Opera House, and declared the entire Opera House forecourt to be off-limits for the duration of the conference.

The protest organisers have said that they are hoping for a "carnival atmosphere", and look forward to working peacefully with the police.

"Assurances have been given that truck, stage, music and speeches - not to mention drumming, dancing and protest - will not be prevented from going ahead as planned in the square directly outside Customs House at Circular Quay," the website said.

"We want a safe community action showing that people in Sydney oppose Howard¹s plan for a US-style wages system, the war in Iraq and his kow-towing to global corporate chiefs. We pose no threat to the Opera House or the millionaire delegates, or to other users of east Circular Quay," said 30A spokesman Bruce Knobloch.

The conference will take place at the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, and will be attended by hundreds of CEOs from around the world, as well as Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, former New York Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARudolph%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudolph Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Forbes"&gt;Steve Forbes&lt;/a&gt; himself.

<h1>CN Health &amp; Safety Plan planned to be cancelled</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=CN%20Health%20%26amp%3B%20Safety%20Plan%20planned%20to%20be%20cancelled&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On July 18, 2005 CN Rail notified the &lt;a href="w%3ACAW"&gt;CAW&lt;/a&gt; that they intend to cancel the CN-CAW previously Negotiated Health &amp; Safety Plan. The CAW will be going to arbitration this fall to address the issue. The CAW has asked that employees notify their Health and Safety Rep about any safety concerns at the work place.

One terminal has lost 5-6 full-time positions. CN Rail used to have part-time positions filled as well, but at this time there are no part-time employees to cover work if a full-time employee is absent. Overtime is necessary to keep the trains running on time. Intermodal traffic goes up, but staff goes down. CN Rail expects the trains to go out on time, and in a safe condition, but staff is overworked, because there are not enough of them. In fact, one worker noticed that most of the rail cars that contained 40 foot overseas containers did not have their loading guides in place. Trains are not allowed to go out without these guides placed into the cars (the guides stop the loads from swaying from side to side in the cars), important for safety with double stacked containers, but it seems that in this case the lack of employees forced the train to leave without them.

<h3>Derailments, Death, and Toxins</h3>

Some recent &lt;a href="w%3Aderailments"&gt;derailments&lt;/a&gt; have come to the attention of the &lt;a href="w%3Amedia"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Apoliticians"&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt;.

On August 3rd 2005 there was a derailment in &lt;a href="w%3AWabamun%20Lake%20Alberta"&gt;Wabamun Lake Alberta&lt;/a&gt; that spilled toxins into the lake. 2 days later there was a derailment in &lt;a href="w%3ACheakamus%20River"&gt;Cheakamus River&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ASquamish%20BC"&gt;Squamish BC&lt;/a&gt;. Both derailments spilled &lt;a href="w%3Ahazardous%20materials"&gt;hazardous materials&lt;/a&gt; into the water. Many are saying that CN took too long to notify people of the toxic spills.

The &lt;a href="w%3AConductor"&gt;Conductor&lt;/a&gt; on each train carries with him the &lt;a href="w%3Ashipping%20manifest"&gt;shipping manifest&lt;/a&gt; with him and has access to that information at all times. Almost any CN terminal that has a clerk working at it with access to the CN Intranet can get this information within minutes.

CTV news has said that this is the 5th derailment for CN this month.

Sydney is today preparing for the Forbes Global CEO Conference and 30A Protest. A major police operation is occurring in the vicinity of the Sydney Opera House, where the conference is scheduled to occur. The Opera House forecourt has been closed to the public, and barricades have been set up down Maquarie St and across the Botanic Gardens. 

Police checkpoints have been set up on Maquarie St and the Circular Quay walk to control access to the Opera House. Police dogs are patrolling the area. 

At 8am this morning Customs Square, where the 30A protest is planning to assemble, was as normal for a Tuesday, with no indication of preparations by activists. The police have 1,000 officers attending, and have said that they are preparing for 10,000 protestors. 

Sharron Burrows, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AACTU"&gt;ACTU&lt;/a&gt;, has criticised the conference, saying that it celebrates corporate greed at the expense of workers. 

"As the global economy grows we should have cause for celebration for the advancement that this should deliver for workers and their families all over the world, but the reality is that corporate greed is driving profit share at the expense of wages, safe workplaces, conditions and entitlements for workers," she said.

<h2>Police crackdown</h2>

Mr Collins said that police will respond promptly to any trouble. He has also stated that schoolchildren who attended the protest will not be immune.

"We will arrest people regardless of age in regard to if they are [unlawful] in their protest," he said.

"I make no apology for the fact that if people are breaking the law and are disrupting the conference, we will deal with it, we will arrest people and deal with them appropriately," he added. 

<h2>Acting Police Commissioner accuses activist groups of 'training to disrupt'</h2>

New South Wales Acting Police Commissioner, Terry Collins, on Monday accused activist groups of training their members to cause disruptions during protests. He was speaking in reference to the protests planned to coincide this week with the Forbes Global CEO Conference at the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt;.

"Activist groups by their very nature are actually trained to go about to disrupt and certainly undermine any attempts by police or any other security forces to actually deal with protest groups," Mr Collins said.

"I make no apology for the fact that, if people are breaking the law and are disrupting the conference, we will deal with it and we will arrest people," he added.

A spokesman for the 30A Network, Bruce Knobloch, has labelled the claims as ridiculous.

"The assistant commissioner has been very pig headed," he said.

"The only training I know about is something called non-violent direct action. This is exactly what it says: non-violent," he added.

Mr Knoblock says that the 30A network has not attempted to hide its plans, and has made every attempt to work with the police.

"The 30A network has no secrets, we have been very open about our intentions: to have a carnival protest. It's amazing the degree of paranoia going on at the heads of the NSW Police Force. We are a bunch of community activists and concerned citizens who have a right to protest against the war profiteers and free-market freaks," he said.

The comment by the Acting Police Commissioner seem to be in contrast to previous statements from the 30A Network, who said in a press release last week that they are hoping for a peaceful, fun protest.

"We want a safe community action showing that people in Sydney oppose Howard¹s plan for a US-style wages system, the war in Iraq and his kow-towing to global corporate chiefs. We pose no threat to the Opera House or the millionaire delegates, or to other users of east Circular Quay," the press release said.

The Herald Sun, a Melbourne newspaper, is reporting that "Radical protesters from Melbourne will send their most 'hard-core' activists to Sydney to protest outside a meeting of the world's top business leaders." The paper is reporting that "leftists" are unable to guarantee that they will obey police exclusion zones.

Socialist Party national organiser Anthony Main said that protestors would not provoke violence, however he suggested that the police may act violently.

"Given the new era of global terrorism and so forth, we wouldn't be surprised if they (police) flexed their muscles," he said.

The 30A Network is a loose association of peace and global justice groups and trade unions. The protest hopes to draw attention to a wide variety of issues, including war, corporate greed, and &lt;a href="w%3ANeo-liberalism"&gt;neoliberalism&lt;/a&gt;.

"The protest is against free-market madness. The conference attendees are people who believe that the free-market can solve all of our problems, e.g privatisation, including things such as water. One of the conference attendees works for a private water company," Mr Knobloch said.

Several groups of farmers in protest have made several blockades with farm equipment on several important road and train lines in the South of Italy yesterday.

The farmers are protesting for the prices being paid to them for their grape harvest this season (about 2 or 2.50 eur for 100 kg) in an effort to obtain more money from the state in the form of subsidies. 

The protest, riot and manifestation are very common in Italy around this time in the grape-growing season. In the past there have even been protests and riots even some soccer teams from the premium league became involved in.

As usual the police were not able to contain the riots and as a result many important transportation roads and train lines have been blocked. Trenitalia, the main Italian train company, suppressed many of it's trains and all the trains from the &lt;a href="w%3APuglia"&gt;Puglia&lt;/a&gt; (the most South East region of Italy) were forced to stop in &lt;a href="w%3ABari"&gt;Bari&lt;/a&gt;. Only one train, with destination to Rome, has been routed to an alternative route.

It is reported that a person, among the manifestant, has been killed trying to stop a van. The driver of the van has been arrested by the police and accused of killing while the other people on the van were beaten by the other manifestants.

The road and train blocks were finally removed, after the Minister of Agriculture have declared that he will do all that is possible to take apart the blockades that rest in government in order to give more economic aid to the farmers.

The wreck of the plane ATR72 that fell into the sea near &lt;a href="w%3ASicily"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; on August 6 has been recovered. One of the two black boxes that contained the communication recording, and the complete set of instruments and commands in the cockpit, was recovered.

One of the three people who were still missing from the accident was found, while there is yet no sign of the other two persons. The identity of the recovered corpse is not yet known (and the identification is expected to be difficult).

A survey published today by the Italian association Intesaconsumatori (Union of Consumers) said that 61% of Italians are afraid to fly, while 41% of population feels less safe about plane safety than they did one month earlier. According to the survey, 20% would be ready to get off the plane, or refuse to get in the plane, if they found that the airline is different from the one they were told when they bought the ticket.

The price of &lt;a href="w%3Apetrol"&gt;petrol&lt;/a&gt; (gasoline) continues to rise in &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. Today, a single&lt;a href="w%3A%20litre"&gt;litre&lt;/a&gt; (0.22 US gallons) of unleaded fuel (called green petrol in Italy) has reached EUR 1.295 (USD 5.98 per gallon; CAD 1.91 per litre; prices in Canada vary from CAD 1.03 to 1.31).

There is constant speculation on the recent price rises, however much of this is the rise in oil prices which has reached USD 68.28 per &lt;a href="w%3ABarrel%23Oil%20Barrel"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt; (1 barrel = 158.97 litres) of US crude. This has been helped by major market speculation, the &lt;a href="w%3Awar%20in%20Iraq"&gt;war in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, the recent &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;hurricane in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; (by stopping production in a major refinery) and the strengthening of the American dollar against the Euro.

&lt;a href="Hurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; is now over the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; mainland and has caused more than US$12 billion of damage. Some estimates are as high as $30 billion.

&lt;a href="New%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; was spared the most intense winds as the hurricane weakened as it made landfall, and its track turned slightly east, away from the city. However, the area was still subjected to sustained winds of more than 100mph, and rainfall as heavy as six inches per hour.

Future prices of crude oil rose above $70/barrel in the U.S. on Monday in the wake of Katrina’s surge through oil and refinery processing facilities in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The storm forced operators to shut down an estimated 1 million barrels of daily refining capacity in the region that accounts for nearly a quarter of total domestic production.

A U.S. spokesman for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; administration said the government will consider releasing crude oil from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrategic%20Petroleum%20Reserve"&gt;Strategic Petroleum Reserve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; if requested by refiners. OPEC has pledged to blunt the impact by increasing production to compensate.

White House spokesman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told reporters that Michael Brown, the director of the &lt;a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; (FEMA), briefed Mr. Bush before he left his Texas ranch for Arizona where he will deliver a speech on Medicare. Brown said it would take time before an assessment is possible for when refineries could resume activity.

President Bush authorized loans from the strategic reserve to help make up for missing supplies when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Ivan"&gt;Hurricane Ivan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; struck in 2004.

US pizza chain giant &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Caesars"&gt;Little Caesars&lt;/a&gt; is to open eight stores in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and has plans to increase that to 45 over the next few years. The company has signed a ten year deal with Doughmaster to support Little Caesars franchisees in Ireland.

&lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; based Doughmaster will open the first eight stores and operate them as its own over the next 18 months. Afterwards it will pursue franchisees.

Little Caesars was founded in &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; in 1959. The firm has franchised over 3,000 restaurants in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; and has revenues of over $1bn.

Little Caesars adds to a highly expansive Irish pizza market - existing players include Apache, Domino's, Godfathers, Fourstarpizza and Pizza Hut. The four largest operators (those mentioned excluding Pizza Hut) now have over 90 outlets in Ireland in total. Apache remains the largest company in store count with 29 outlets.

A high-speed pre-dawn pursuit on 29 August, 2005 ended in a fatal accident. A local resident reported to police at 1:00 am (local time) that two people appeared to be attempting to steal a &lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Civic"&gt;Honda Civic&lt;/a&gt; near West 75th Circle in &lt;a href="w%3AWestminster%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. As the two individuals left the scene in the stolen car, the resident followed in his own vehicle until the passenger stepped out of the Honda and opened fire with a &lt;a href="w%3Ashotgun"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. The police came upon the suspects near West 72nd Avenue &amp; Pierce Street, , Colorado, and began pursuit.

The chase proceeded southbound on Sheridan Boulevard and northeast on , reaching speeds of 120 miles per hour (190 kilometres per hour). When the vehicle attempted to merge onto southeast-bound in , Colorado the suspects lost control and impacted two other vehicles.

The stolen vehicle may have punctured one or more tires, as sparks were observed from the bottom of the car as it began the merge. The stolen car struck the middle of the passenger's side of a &lt;a href="w%3AToyota%204Runner"&gt;Toyota 4Runner&lt;/a&gt; in the left-hand lane and sent it careening across the median into the northwest-bound lanes of traffic, where it rolled several times. The stolen vehicle then bounced off the guardrail on the right shoulder and impacted a &lt;a href="w%3AFord"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; pickup truck before coming to rest. The two suspects then escaped on foot, discarding some of their clothing as they fled. One of the passengers traveling in the Toyota 4Runner, Brian Kapko, 19, of &lt;a href="w%3ACosta%20Mesa"&gt;Costa Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, was killed. 

After eight hours of searching for the perpetrators, the police called off their manhunt. Later in the day, a witness alerted the police about two "suspicious persons" near the scene of the accident. The police arrested a Matthew G. Wartena, 19, and a 16 year old male. Wartena was wearing only boxer shorts, socks and a bloody tank top. The juvenile wore only one sock and tan pants. The pair were charged with suspicion of first-degree &lt;a href="w%3Amurder"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt;, attempted first-degree murder, vehicular eluding, and criminal &lt;a href="w%3Atrespass"&gt;trespass&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the incident Wartena was free on bond, having pleaded guilty the month before to forgery of a government document.

Some 10,000 people remain in the Superdome stadium, despite the electricity supply failing leaving the indoor stadium in darkness. The coverings of the concrete roof of the structure have been stripped away by the wind. 

Electricity supplies to 1.3 million people across the south eastern parts of the US have been damaged, and it could be months before power is restored to all affected.

Two oil rigs have broken free of their moorings in the Gulf of Mexico, and a third drifted into a bridge in Mobile Bay, Alabama.

Katrina has now been downgraded to tropical storm status as it moves northwards across the US, and wind speeds have dropped to 60mph. The current death toll does not include the 11 killed in Florida when Katrina struck there last week.

The 30A protest in Sydney, Australia, occurred on Tuesday night in carnival style. The protest began around 5 p.m. at Customs Square, Circular Quay, with 1,000 to 2,000 people assembling to listen to speeches and music. After about an hour, the protestors marched along the Quay to the concrete and steel barricades preventing public access to the Opera House forecourt; where the carnival continued with music, drums, and dancing. 

There were a wide variety of people present at the protest, including trade unionists, Christian groups, social justice groups, fair trade activists, and peace groups. Many people wore elaborate costumes, beat drums, played music, and sang. 

All speakers emphasised the importance of protesting peacefully, encouraging protestors to avoid violence or confrontation at all costs. A number of speakers thanked the police for their efforts.

At 6 p.m. the protestors marched towards the opera house, where there was a violent confrontation between police and protestors who broke down a temporary wire fence. Music and dancing continued for a few hours after as people drifted away. The area was deserted by 9:30 p.m.. 

It was revealed during the evening that Tuesday evenings conference event was moved to a nearby ferry terminal because of security concerns and as such the targets of the protest were not in the area at the time. 

<h2>Speeches</h2>

The main theme of the speeches was opposition to so-called &lt;a href="w%3Aneo-liberalism"&gt;neo-liberalism&lt;/a&gt;. The conference attendees were described as &lt;a href="w%3Aneo-liberals"&gt;neo-liberals&lt;/a&gt;, or "free market freaks", who support reduction of the minimum wage, reduction of welfare benefits, undermining of unions, and privatisation of essential services such as water.

Greens Senator Kerrie Nettle gave a rousing speech, accusing the conference delegates of failing to protect the environment and planning to privatise government services. 

"The people inside that conference want to sell our public schools and hospitals," she said.

Some speakers also acknowledged that the protest was taking place on Aboriginal land, and there was a moments silence to reflect on past and present crimes against Australian Aborigines. The protestors chanted "Always was, always will be, Aboriginal land."

<h2>Confrontation at barricades</h2>

At about 6 p.m., as the speeches ended, the protestors left Customs Square and marched along Circular Quay to the barrricades that had been erected at Macquarie St, to prevent the public from accessing the Opera House forecourt. A number of protestors began rocking the barricades and attempting to climb over. A flare was also thrown from the crowd over the barricades. After two or three minutes, the protestors were successful in causing one to lean over onto the ground. Police responded by using horses and batons to force the protestors back, and then forming a line of officers along the breached section to prevent anyone entering the exclusion zone. Police proceeded to make a small number of arrests. 

The protestors continued their action in a peaceful manner from that point forward. The entire incident was over in less than five minutes.

Some protestors accused the police of using excessive force while making arrests. "As soon as we reached the fence, a mass of people jumped on the fence and began shaking it. Some smoke bombs flew, police dogs were going crazy and shaking of the fence became more and more intense. The fence was pretty loose at this point. Suddenly the fence went DOWN!!! And the police began grabbing people who went over with it," said an eyewitness report on Sydney Indymedia. One protestor was transported to hospital by ambulance after breaking his collarbone during the incident.

However, others thought the police handled the situation well. 

"I think the police were pretty impressive. They calmed the crowd very quickly and didn't react to the taunts of the protesters. They didn't do anything that I could see to inflame the situation. I think they were cool," said a blog article written by an eyewitness.

Hurricane Katrina has now reportedly caused over fifty deaths in Mississippi. Thirty people were killed in the resort of Biloxi, while twenty more casualties occurred across the rest of the state's Harrison County. Meanwhile, western New Orleans has been severely flooded due to the breaking of a levee on 17th Street.

&lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;'s 2005 Video Music Awards were rather unbalanced this year, with &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Day"&gt;Green Day's&lt;/a&gt; capture of seven of the eight awards for which they were nominated. The awards were for their single "&lt;a href="w%3ABoulevard%20of%20Broken%20Dreams"&gt;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&lt;/a&gt;" off of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idiot"&gt;American Idiot&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ album. Up-and-coming rock bands &lt;a href="w%3AFall%20Out%20Boy"&gt;Fall Out Boy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Killers"&gt;The Killers&lt;/a&gt; also won awards. &lt;a href="w%3AKelly%20Clarkson"&gt;Kelly Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; came out with two awards.

The event was hosted by &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Combs"&gt;Sean "Diddy" Combs&lt;/a&gt; at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida, USA, which was unaffected by the passing of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; through the area or by the shooting of rap producer &lt;a href="w%3ASuge%20Knight"&gt;"Suge" Knight&lt;/a&gt;.

Some notable events was Combs "conducting" a string orchestra in memory of slain rapper &lt;a href="w%3ANotorious%20B.I.G"&gt;Notorious B.I.G&lt;/a&gt; while his song played, fellow rapper &lt;a href="w%3ASnoop%20Dogg"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt; came out to sing the last verse of B.I.G's hit song "Warning".

Green Day arrived at the event in their rusted green convertible from the Holiday and Boulevard of Broken Dreams music videos. They kicked off the show with a performance of Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

&lt;a href="w%3AR.%20Kelly"&gt;R. Kelly&lt;/a&gt; performed a new segment to his soap opera song "Trapped In The Closet". Kelly remains a chart-topper even though the star is awaiting trial for &lt;a href="w%3Achild%20pornography"&gt;child pornography&lt;/a&gt; charges.
Marion "Suge" Knight was shot in the leg at a private party, hosted by Kanye West, at the Shore Club Saturday night, one day before the main event. He was taken to nearby Mount Sinai Hospital where he was treated for the non-lethal gunshot wound.

&lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; investigators have connected sixteen more people to the havoc of the Zotob &lt;a href="internet"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; worm, which has been adversely affecting computers for the last two weeks. These people were found by analysing communications between them and the two hackers arrested four days ago.

By analysing the code of the Zotob worm, as well as its derivative works, law enforcement officials have found that three internet gangs were involved in the creation of the worm. Farid Essebar, aka 'Diab10', the 18 year old who wrote the worm, as well as others, like Mytob, was a member of the gang '0x90-Team'. The other gangs, 'BlackCarder' and 'MetalHit', wrote some of the variants of Zotob and Mytob. 

The other of the two men arrested four days ago was 21 year old Attila Ekici. Turkish officials say that he was paid by Essebar to distribute Zotob. This type of financial relationship confirms theories that writing viruses has become a profit-making enterprise.

A &lt;a href="w%3ARhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; district court has frozen all the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; assets of the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; (PA), prompting Palestinian &lt;a href="w%3Afinance%20minister"&gt;finance minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASalam%20Fayyad"&gt;Salam Fayyad&lt;/a&gt; to request the aid of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;US Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;.

The frozen assets include US holdings in an investment fund worth $1.3 billion, which was used to finance economic development, and $30 million from the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Monetary%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Monetary Authority&lt;/a&gt;.

The ruling was passed upon the PA when they refused to compensate the relatives of a &lt;a href="w%3AJewish"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; couple shot dead by members of &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1996"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;.

US &lt;a href="w%3Acitizen"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AYaron%20Ungar"&gt;Yaron Ungar&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Efrat were killed while returning from a wedding near the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;, when their car was shot at repeatedly, killing the couple. Three Hamas militants were jailed as a result.

A lawsuit was filed in &lt;a href="w%3A2000"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; against the Palestinian Authority, the PLO, Hamas, and &lt;a href="w%3AYasser%20Arafat"&gt;Yasser Arafat&lt;/a&gt; in Rhode Island.

Yasser Arafat hired &lt;a href="w%3Alawyer"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href="w%3Aattorney%20general"&gt;attorney general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARamsey%20Clark"&gt;Ramsey Clark&lt;/a&gt; as his defense. In the case, Clark argued that the PA was a &lt;a href="w%3Asovereign%20state"&gt;sovereign state&lt;/a&gt;, and that it deserved &lt;a href="w%3Aimmunity"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3Aprosecution"&gt;prosecution&lt;/a&gt; accorded to most countries. The court disagreed with this, and in &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; they ruled that &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; is not a state, and ordered them to pay the Ungars $116 million. A federal appeals court upheld the verdict in March.

The head of Washington's PA office, &lt;a href="w%3AHasan%20Abdul%20Rahman"&gt;Hasan Abdul Rahman&lt;/a&gt; said that his office had been "paralysed" by the verdict.

"It paralyzes the function of the office, and I think that is the intention of the plaintiffs." he told Associated Press shortly after the decision, and called upon the US administration to intervene.

&lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20Jaafari"&gt;Ibrahim Jaafari&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Prime Minister of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, has declared that Iraq will hold three days of national mourning following a stampede on a bridge in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; which left nearly a thousand people dead. The railings of a bridge over the &lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20Tigris"&gt;River Tigris&lt;/a&gt; gave way under the weight of the crowd, and many people fell into the waters below. 

CNN now reports the death toll as 965 dead and 465 injured.

The people were walking towards the Kadhimiya mosque, a Shi'ite shrine. They were celebrating the martyrdom of Muslim religious figure &lt;a href="Musa%20Al-Kadhim"&gt;Musa Al-Kadhim&lt;/a&gt;.

Some sources say the rush happened after a rumor of the presence of a &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20bomber"&gt;suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt; passed through the crowd of up to one million.

Earlier, three to six mortar rounds were fired into the crowd, killing as many as 16 - a US &lt;a href="w%3AAH-64%20Apache"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; gunship helicopter returned fire on the attackers.

Shoppers World in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABrampton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Brampton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, Canada asks its visitors to "look up, look way up" this October.

The Highway 10 and Steeles Avenue mall is encouraging Bramptonians to paint a &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Aceiling%20tile"&gt;ceiling tile&lt;/a&gt; for charity this summer, for their upcoming "Looking Up to the Arts" event. The tiles should represent either what Brampton means to you, or the arts in Brampton.

Anyone can paint a tile for the event by buying one at the customer service desk for $5. Once tiles are completed and returned for the event, participants receive a gift certificate for $5. The ceiling tiles must be finished and returned by October 7.

The tiles will be auctioned off at the end of the event, with money going to the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABrampton%20Arts%20Council"&gt;Brampton Arts Council&lt;/a&gt;.

Local dance, music, theatre and visual arts group will perform and promote at the mall's event, which will be held from October 12 to 22.

This isn't Shoppers World's only celebration of the arts. The mall is the permanent home of the Artway Gallery, a community exhibit space on the west side of the mall. Organized by &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AVisual%20Arts%20Brampton"&gt;Visual Arts Brampton&lt;/a&gt;, the space allows anyone in the community to exhibit publicly.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Philippine%20impeachment%20unlikely%20to%20succeed&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A Philippine &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives%20of%20the%20Philippines"&gt;congressional&lt;/a&gt; committee has voted to turn down all impeachment petitions against President &lt;a href="Gloria%20Macapagal%20Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;. The opposition to the president, on boycott, was not present. The vote seems to have greatly undermined any chance of an impeachment of Arroyo.

Arroyo's critics say that she committed fraud during last year's presidential election. She has also been accused of bribing lawmakers in order to stop them from supporting complaints against her.

Edmundo Reyes, a pro-impeachment congressman, revealed that only six more signatures are needed to trigger a trial in the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20Senate"&gt;Philippine Senate&lt;/a&gt;. One-third of the legislative body - 79 members - must consent to the president's impeachment in order for a trial to occur. Currently, 73 lawmakers side with the opposition.

"Is there no one else?" asked an emotional Reyes. "Is there anyone else signing this for truth?"

The opposition has threatened to organize citizen protests demanding the president's removal. But Arroyo's Congress allies appear confident that they have destroyed the impeachment bid.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s defence minister has ruled that the man who shot dead four Israeli Arabs is not a &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorist"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt;, because he is &lt;a href="w%3AJewish"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt;. The decision means that the families do not receive the &lt;a href="w%3Acompensation"&gt;compensation&lt;/a&gt; as family members of people classed as victims of terrorism. The laws governing compensation only recognise terrorism as being perpetrated by "organisations hostile to Israel".

&lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; had previously described the act as "a despicable act by a bloodthirsty terrorist," and The Jerusalem Post described the gunman as a "Jewish far-Right fanatic".

The families will receive a lump sum instead of a lifelong payment. Arab Israeli leaders described the law as racist.

"The decision raises a strong scent of racism, which distinguishes between a Jewish terrorist and an Arab terrorist," one member of parliament said.

The Anti-Defamation League, a US based organisation set up to combat &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Semitism"&gt;anti-semitism&lt;/a&gt;, has also condemned the killing and described it as terrorism.

"We strongly condemn today's terrorist attack by a Jewish gunman in Shiloh. The perpetrator is in police custody and we are confident he will be punished to the fullest extent of the law," said Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, in a statement released on the day of the attack.

Member of the &lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt; Mohammad Barakeh, has demanded an amendment to the current law. He is asking that the law recognise as victims of terror anyone hurt by "hostile activities by a terror organization." According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the Prime Ministers Office has requested that the Attorney General review the issue.

The 19-year old Nathan Zaada shot the four Israeli Arabs in an industrial area of the town of Shfaram on August 4th. He was later killed by a mob.

The Mayor of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Nagin"&gt;Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt;, has ordered most of the local police force to stop rescue efforts and shift their efforts to prevent looting &lt;a href="http%3A//neworleans.indymedia.org/news/2005/09/3863.php"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, FEMA has reportedly been blocking aid shipments into the city on the grounds that it is too dangerous. 

A rescue helicopter attempting to retrieve stranded people from New Orleans' Superdome stadium was reportedly shot at; but this has not yet been confirmed. A member of the National Guard was reportedly shot, but was not seriously injured. Official reports say that one New Orleans police officer was shot in the head, but was expected to survive. Other reports say that police stranded on the roof of a hotel were being fired upon by looters in the streets. Meanwhile, reports from many blogs and grassroots journalists about police officers looting cars and stores have started to filter up to the mainstream media &lt;a href="http%3A//www.google.com/url%3Fsa%3Dt%26amp%3Bct%3Dres%26amp%3Bcd%3D4%26amp%3Burl%3Dhttp%253A//www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/8/31/102233.shtml%26amp%3Bei%3DZ_oXQ5LcJ7jk4AGjk9nuDA"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Food, diapers, and other supplies are the target of most looters. Some are reportedly taking non-essential and luxury items, such as TVs and computers. Reportedly, gun and pawn shops are also a popular target for looting. 

Earlier today, buses were taking the most vulnerable away to the state capital of &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABaton%20Rouge"&gt;Baton Rouge&lt;/a&gt;. Evacuees in the Superdome are also being moved by bus to the &lt;a href="w%3AReliant%20Astrodome"&gt;Astrodome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, in an interview on ABC television, condemned the looting, saying "I think there ought to be zero tolerance of people breaking the law during an emergency such as this."

A hospital in Gretna was evacuated after a supply truck carrying food, water and medical supplies was stopped at gunpoint. Spokesman Stephen Campanini estimated there to be approximately 350 employees in the hospital, along with between 125 and 150 patients. Campanini said, "There are physical threats to safety from roving bands of armed individuals with weapons who are threatening the safety of the hospital." 

Despite this, some of the other rumors of looting have proven to be false. One of the most prevalent was the story that armed looters laid siege to the Children's Hospital. The Times-Picayune reported that this story was false.

Both scientists and politicians are divided over the increase in hurricanes in the last 30 years. The years 1970 to 1994 saw far fewer hurricanes than 1995 to the present. ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ suggests this decrease was a result of generally cooler North Atlantic water driving winds that disrupted potential hurricanes from forming. Some experts say the recent intensification is part of a natural cycle, while others claim that global warming has increased both the destructive power and the frequency of hurricanes. The ♡❤Times♡❤ also pointed out that during 8 recent years the U.S. has been hit by about one-third fewer severe hurricanes than usual.

Britain's chief scientific adviser Sir &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20King"&gt;David King&lt;/a&gt; stated, "We have known since 1987 the intensity of hurricanes is related to surface sea temperature and we know that, over the last 15 to 20 years, surface sea temperatures in these regions have increased by half a degree centigrade. So it is easy to conclude that the increased intensity of hurricanes is associated with global warming." 

&lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;'s Professor &lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Emanuel"&gt;Kerry Emanuel&lt;/a&gt; wrote that rising sea temperatures could account for only part what he claims has been a sharp rise in the destructiveness of tropical cyclones since the 1970s.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.mindfully.org/Air/2005/Cyclone-Increasing-Destructive4aug05.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Eminent hurricane expert, &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20M.%20Gray"&gt;Professor William Gray&lt;/a&gt; said that Emanuel's was “a terrible paper, one of the worst I've ever looked at.” &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mindfully.org/Air/2005/Hurricanes-More-Powerful1aug05.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%BCrgen%20Trittin"&gt;Jürgen Trittin&lt;/a&gt;, Germany's Minister of the Environment was sharply critical of the U.S. Government. He wrote in an editorial: "Greenhouse gases have to be radically reduced worldwide. The US has, up until this point, had its eyes closed to this emergency." 

Carsten Voigt of the German Foreign Ministry said that while he believed that hurricanes were more powerful due to global warming, he did not believe that hurricane Katrina was the fault of America, or the Bush administration. “The main point though is that climate change is an issue that needs to be put on the table.”

With victims of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; moved to shelters and remote locations, their relatives and friends in other parts of the world have turned to the web to try and establish contact and confirm their health. Many families living in the path of Katrina have even been split up as they are rescued and now desperately need to contact each other.

Several web sites have started forums for posting information on missing people. The forums also allow individuals and families in the path of the hurricane who are safe post their information, where they are now located and how their family should contact them.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Red%20Cross"&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; is keeping records of all persons they treat and assist, but those records are not available either by phone or online. They have issued a press release titled &lt;a href="http%3A//www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0%2C1077%2C0_314_4494%2C00.html"&gt;AMERICAN RED CROSS URGENT FAMILY ALERT&lt;/a&gt;. Quoting, in part:

Yesterday, President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; authorized the release of oil from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrategic%20Petroleum%20Reserve"&gt;Strategic Petroleum Reserve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; due to &lt;a href="Hurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;'s effects on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aoil%20refineries"&gt;oil refineries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20Coast"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;.

The decision was made late Tuesday and announcement was made Wednesday.

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve consists of 700 million barrels of oil located in salt caverns along the &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; coast. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is meant to act as a cushion for the oil market during disruptions of energy.

Energy production was interuppted by Katrina as more than 735 oil and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; rigs had to be evacuated. This shut down 95 percent of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acrude%20oil"&gt;crude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; production and 88 percent of natural gas output in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.

Air evacuation of the &lt;a href="w%3ASuperdome"&gt;Superdome&lt;/a&gt; was temporarily halted Thursday after shots were reportedly fired at a military helicopter.

Evacuations by bus continue, despite an early news report to the contrary. Thousands of people taking temporary shelter in the Superdome and nearby areas in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; are being evacuated after Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Nagin"&gt;Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt; ordered a complete evacuation of the city, in the wake of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. Evacuees will be taken to the &lt;a href="w%3AReliant%20Astrodome"&gt;Astrodome&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, Texas.

Looting has become an increasing concern, as looters and gangs are beginning to rob hotels and hospitals. Some looters have even been able to take guns from abandoned shops. Officials say that they are concerned about the increasing number of people with guns. Police officers stranded on the roof of a hotel reported shots fired at them.

President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; plans to visit the affected areas on Friday. Former Presidents &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; are expected to lead a private fund-raising campaign for the victims of the hurricane, similar to the campaign after the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;oceanic earthquake&lt;/a&gt; and resulting tsunami in late &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;n legislature is considering a Bill that would permit the Senate to extradite persons granted asylum by &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; to other nations and organizations, such as the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to face trial for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20crimes"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Under the law, the Senate would have the power to accept or decline applications for asylum as well as remit persons already with asylum to requesting organizations or countries.

If the Bill passes, it would provide the mechanism needed by Nigeria to lawfully extradite indicted war criminal &lt;a href="Charles%20Taylor"&gt;Charles Taylor&lt;/a&gt; to stand trial at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Court%20for%20Sierra%20Leone"&gt;Special Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Sierra%20Leone"&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/a&gt;. To date, Nigeria has resisted repeated claims by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASierra%20Leone"&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the United Nations to extradite Mr. Taylor saying that they will only do so if called upon by a freely elected &lt;a href="Liberia"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt;n government. Liberia has its first national elections since Taylor's regime scheduled for October.

The Bill has significant implications in Liberia, where Taylor was President until ousted by the international community in August 2003, under an asylum deal with Nigeria. The United Nations has maintained a peacekeeping mission in the country ever since. In October, Liberia faces its first national elections since Taylor, and his influence, although against the terms of his asylum, is seen as potentially destabilizing.

The front runners in Liberia's presidential race recently spoke on the Taylor issue at a series of presidential debates held on local radio. Although most candidates agree that the rule of law must be followed none would commit to handing Taylor over to the Special Court if elected.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Caledonia"&gt;New Caledonia&lt;/a&gt; is beginning to prepare for the 2011 &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Pacific%20Games"&gt;South Pacific Games&lt;/a&gt;, hosting duties won after a vote in &lt;a href="w%3APalau"&gt;Palau&lt;/a&gt;.

On July 31, the South Pacific Games Council met to decide on the matter, with the meeting announced to the public by Michael White, NMI chef de mission to the 2005 Palau South Pacific Mini Games. The hosting duties were also bid on by the &lt;a href="w%3ASolomon%20Islands"&gt;Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Samoa"&gt;American Samoa&lt;/a&gt;, which was eliminated in the first round.

The last time that the city of Noumea, New Caledonia hosted the event was 1987.

Any country that sends athletes to participate in the SPG is eligible to host the competition.

The New Caledonia win is the culmination of a six-year bid process that all interested countries must follow. White commented, "The charter lays out the time requirements you have to submit a bid and the charter prescribes what elements have to be covered in your bid proposals. Then at some point, six years before the Games, the SPG council reviews all the bids and hears presentations from the bidding countries and decides which country is going to be awarded the Games."

The Micronesian Games Council is still deciding which city will host the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AMicroneasian%20Games"&gt;Micronesian Games&lt;/a&gt;. Officials from Yap, the original host of the event, say that they won't be ready to host the event due to damage from a recent typhoon. The Republic of the &lt;a href="w%3AMarshall%20Islands"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt; will host the 2010 Micronesian Games.

Yesterday, the &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; said it would take all steps necessary, including the implementation of individual sanctions, in order to ensure that the resolutions of the Security Council were adhered to by both sides of the troubled Ivoiran peace process. The remarks followed a briefing to the Security Council by representatives from the UN Mission in &lt;a href="Ivory%20Coast"&gt;Cote d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt; and African Union-appointed &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n mediators.

"The South African Mediation stated that it will continue its efforts, with the support of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; and the African Union, to ensure the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in Côte d'Ivoire as scheduled, which is the only solution to the crisis," the Security Council said in a statement following the meeting. 

The next round of elections are scheduled for the end of October although it is widely believed this date is unlikely to be met.

The peace process in &lt;a href="Ivory%20Coast"&gt;Cote d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt; has been on shaky ground following the failure of the rebel forces to begin the disarmament process originally scheduled for 31 July. The rebels, led by the Forces Nouvelles, claimed that Ivorian &lt;a href="Laurent%20Gbagbo"&gt;President Gbagbo&lt;/a&gt; had failed to make the necessary legal reforms necessary to begin the disarmament. The international community later ratified the legal changes made by the Ivorian government as being in compliance with the peace deal.

Noted physicist &lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%B3zef%20Rotblat"&gt;Józef Rotblat&lt;/a&gt;, a historic figure who left the &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan%20Project"&gt;Manhattan Project&lt;/a&gt; and later became a prominent figure in the movement against the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Arms%20Race"&gt;Nuclear Arms Race&lt;/a&gt;, has died at the age of 96.

Born in &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1908"&gt;1908&lt;/a&gt;, he graduated from &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw%20University"&gt;Warsaw University&lt;/a&gt;. Rotblat collaborated with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government on the &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan%20Project"&gt;Manhattan Project&lt;/a&gt;, which was attempting to construct the world's first &lt;a href="w%3AAtomic%20bomb"&gt;atomic bombs&lt;/a&gt;. However, Rotblat left the project, the first and only physicist to do so, after realizing that &lt;a href="w%3ANazi%20Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; was unlikely to be developing a nuclear weapon of their own.

Rotblat formed the &lt;a href="w%3APugwash%20Conferences%20on%20Science%20and%20World%20Affairs"&gt;Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs&lt;/a&gt; organization in &lt;a href="w%3A1957"&gt;1957&lt;/a&gt;. The group promoted &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20disarmament"&gt;nuclear disarmament&lt;/a&gt; and greater collaboration between scholars from all over the world to try and prevent major global conflict.

In &lt;a href="w%3A1995"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;, Rotblat and the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs were awarded the &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt;, "for their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms." In his acceptance speech, Rotblat noted that the group's goals were entirely doable, noting the close-knit structure of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, "within which war is inconceivable."

Governor Schwarzenegger is now expected to veto the bill.

The bill sought to provide incentives for businesses and individuals to install rooftop solar panels, in a manner similar to existing programs in Washington and Oregon. Under pressure from the electrician's union, the bill was amended to require that installation be done by licensed electricians and that "prevailing wages" be paid for all commercial solar work done in the state.

Existing solar contractors were originally among the bill's strongest supporters but now oppose it due to the changes. This comes despite the fact that they would be, under a grandfather clause, granted an exception to the new requirements for an electrician's license. Future solar specialists would be required to also be licensed electricians.

A U.S. housewife was convicted on Sept. 1, 2005 of her husband's murder by a &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; high court. On November 2, 2003, she apparently laced his milkshake with sedatives and beat him to death in their apartment while he was unconscious, sources say. Nancy Kissel was handed a unanimous life sentence verdict for murdering her banker husband in this infamous "Milkshake Trial", as it came to be known. 

She sat expressionless and clothed in black throughout the trial, in which prosecutors painted a picture of her as a cold, calculating killer, who murdered her husband because of his desire to divorce her and take custody of their children after learning that she was having an affair with a repairman. His body was found two days after the murder in a rented storage locker, which the prosecution claimed was evidence of her trying to cover up the murder. 

An autopsy found six types of sedatives in his body, which were powerful enough to knock him out, and a search of her computer brought up her Internet searches with keywords such as "drug overdose".

Prosecution lawyer Paul Chapman stated that "These were five fatal blows with murderous intent ... &lt;a href="w%3ASelf%20defense"&gt;Self defense&lt;/a&gt; has no basis in this case." Relatives of Robert were relieved to finally reach a verdict on the case, with his father William saying "It's a 65-day trial and it's unanimous. That's justice."

The defendants claimed that the murder was in self defense. Kissel did admit to killing her husband, but she denied spiking his drink with a mixture of powerful drugs, and stated that she defended herself with a metal statue after he had attacked her with a baseball bat. According to Nancy, she had no recollection of the events after the night of her husband's murder. 

The 65 day long trial was filled with her descriptions of how Robert Kissel, her husband and an American banker, supposedly abused her sexually and physically after using drugs and alcohol. Her lawyer, Alexander King, said that she sought refuge from her cocaine-abusing husband in an affair with the repairman.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aexpatriate"&gt;expatriate&lt;/a&gt; American community in Hong Kong is shocked by the murder.

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; has carried out the first executions since the demise of the &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; regime. Three men convicted of murder were hanged on Thursday morning in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;.

The Iraqi government argues that the death penalty will help to deter criminals but spokesman Laith Kubba admitted that "this is not an easy thing to do". 

Iraqi president &lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt; is personally opposed to &lt;a href="w%3Acapital%20punishment"&gt;capital punishment&lt;/a&gt; and stated that he would never sign a death sentence, not even against Saddam Hussein himself. His deputy Adel Abdel Mehdi signed the warrant instead.

Human rights groups and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; had hoped Iraq would refrain from using the death penalty against its citizens and urged the government not to carry out the sentences.

The three men, named as Bayan Ahmed Said, Ouday Dawood Salman and Dhahar Jasim Hassan were convicted of murdering three policemen in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AKut"&gt;Kut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWasit"&gt;Wasit province&lt;/a&gt;. Additional crimes include kidnapping and rape .

They claim they transmitted a file at the rate of 2.3 megabits per second.

This claim of transmission record has been contested by current record holders (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.wifi-shootout.com/index.html"&gt;Defcon WiFi Shootout Contest&lt;/a&gt;). They question the validation of testing methods and subjectivity. "I suppose it's certainly possible for Microserv to have done what they claim to have done," Dave Moore, founder of the Defcon contest, said in an e-mail. "What sets apart the 125-mile record set at the Defcon WiFi Shootout Contest is that it was subject to a strict verification and certification process administered by four independent judges." 

A technical presentation was presented at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.winog.com/"&gt;WiNOG&lt;/a&gt; conference in Park City, Utah August 15-17, 2005. Technical information and pictures can be found at http://www.wifiworldrecord.net

A Brazilian international footballer, &lt;a href="w%3ARonaldinho"&gt;Ronaldo de Assis Moreira&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Little Ronaldo (Ronaldinho), signed a contract with &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Barcelona"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; until 2010, today, prolonging it for two years. 

It is fairly certain that he will stay in the club for the length of the contract. "Now I'll just carry on doing the same as I have been doing until now, only that now I have a longer term contract, I'll be even more motivated," an official Barcelona website quoted Ronaldinho. According to a new clause in his contract, any club who wants to buy him will have to part with 85 million pounds. One of the most interested teams was Chelsea FC, who were looking to fill their striker position. 

Ronaldinho is happy to stay in Barcelona: "You cannot put a price on the happiness and joy I am feeling right now." He transferred from &lt;a href="w%3AParis%20Saint-Germain"&gt;Paris Saint-Germain&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 for 17 million pounds becoming one of the biggest football starts in Spain. FIFA awarded him the prestigous title of "best football player in the world" in 2005.

<h1>Fats Domino missing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fats%20Domino%20missing%20in%20the%20wake%20of%20Hurricane%20Katrina&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Legendary &lt;a href="w%3AR%26amp%3BB"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; singer &lt;a href="w%3AFats%20Domino"&gt;Fats Domino&lt;/a&gt; is missing, three days after &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; hit in his hometown of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.

The singer told his agent, Al Embry, that he planned to stay at his home with his wife and daughter, rather than evacuate. He has not been heard from since Sunday night. It was reported on Wednesday that his house was flooded, though there were no reports on whether Domino and his family were able to escape.

Domino, 77, lives in the city's 9th Ward, one of the areas hardest hit by Katrina. Attempts to reach Domino by phone proved futile, as phone lines have not been working in the area since the storm hit.

Antoine 'Fats' Domino first gained stardom with one of the first rock n' roll records, "The Fat Man". The record went platinum, selling over a million copies and hitting #2 on the Billboard charts. Of Domino's numerous &lt;a href="w%3ATop%2040"&gt;Top 40&lt;/a&gt; singles, perhaps his most notable were &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Monday"&gt;Blue Monday&lt;/a&gt; and a cover of &lt;a href="w%3ABlueberry%20Hill"&gt;Blueberry Hill&lt;/a&gt;.

Domino retired from touring in the &lt;a href="w%3A1980s"&gt;1980s&lt;/a&gt;, and has not left the city since, citing his dislike of touring, and his love of New Orleans cuisine. Not even his induction to the &lt;a href="w%3ARock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; or an invitation to the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; were able to get Domino to leave the town.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Corp. has acquired voice over Internet protocol (&lt;a href="w%3AVoIP"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt;) provider &lt;a href="w%3ATeleo"&gt;Teleo&lt;/a&gt; Inc., on August 30, for an undisclosed sum. Teleo was founded in 2003, in &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. 

Teleo had been running a public beta test of its VoIP software, but it has now been discontinued. A beta version of the Microsoft/Teleo product is expected later in the year.

Teleo users could call both other PCs and regular telephones. Calls to regular telephones cost US$0.02 per minute to many countries. Teleo’s software also integrates with &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Outlook"&gt;Microsoft Outlook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; to provide a feature called “click to call”. This feature turns any phone number displayed within a website or e-mail into a link that will dial the number.

Teleo Inc website now redirects to a page on &lt;a href="w%3AMSN"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;. This page states: that “Microsoft plans to incorporate and expand upon Teleo’s technologies, integrating them into the MSN services infrastructure, with plans to ultimately deliver new VoIP consumer applications in future releases of MSN services, such as MSN Messenger”.

Many of Microsoft competitors in the instant messaging market already offer VoIP service or are working on providing it in the near future. &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; recently launched Google Talk, an instant messaging program with free PC to PC calling. PC to Phone calling is rumoured to be in the works. &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; has said it plans to add calling to regular telephones from its instant messaging program in the coming months. MSN Messenger is by far the most popular instant messaging program, Yahoo!'s instant messenger is the second most popular as of July.

&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; has aired two video tapes by &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaida"&gt;Al Qaida&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday evening. In one of them, the terror group's second in command &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt; has claimed responsibility for the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;July 7 London bombings&lt;/a&gt; and threatened further attacks. The alleged leader of the London bombers, &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Sidique%20Khan"&gt;Mohammad Sidique Khan&lt;/a&gt;, appeared on a separate recording and outlined his reasons for the bombings.

Speaking in English with a Yorkshire accent, Kahn stated that the Blair government is to blame for the attacks. He claimed that the West is backing governments who commit crimes against humanity. Western citizens should no longer feel safe, he said and threatened similar attacks upon them: "Until you stop the bombing, gassing, imprisonment and torture of my people we will not stop this fight. We are at war and I am a soldier. Now you too will taste the reality of this situation" 

Al-Zawahiri described the 7/7 attacks as "a slap to the policy of British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;" and called the attacks a response to the UK's foreign policy "just as 9/11 was a response to America's".

&lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; said they are "aware of the tape; we will consider it as part of our ongoing investigation". British Foreign secretarcy &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt; said there was "no excuse, no justification for terrorism of any kind".

Gous Ali, a Muslim whose girlfriend was killed in the bombing, condemned the broadcast as being "wrong and all lies". "It's all brainwashing by some wacko scholar who believes his own version of the Koran and has made it his own battle. There is no holy war", he told the BBC.

Muslim Council of Britain spokesman Inayat Bunglawala said that holding the British Public responsible for the war "is just plain wrong - this country was bitterly divided and many millions, perhaps the majority, clearly opposed the war."

Experts are currently investigating the tape for possible clues.

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, which has become one of the internet's most influential companies by selling online advertising, has expanded past cyberspace Wednesday when it began reselling print ads in technology magazines.

In a small-scale experiment, the first print-based venture for the company, Google bought pages of advertising in magazines such as &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pcmag.com"&gt;♡❤PC Magazine♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.macaddict.com/magazine"&gt;♡❤MacAddict♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and sold portions of each page to smaller companies. Undoubtedly, Google expects profits to come from a higher rate of resale.

The first publication to carry such advertising is the September 6th issue of ♡❤PC Magazine♡❤. It contains a single page with five smaller ads, each with the caption "Ads by Google", which is well-known to Internet users.

This page runs near the cover, and some of Google's clients are grateful for the exposure that the program has enabled. Most popular magazines run advertising smaller than a full page closer to the back.

Initial fears that the combination of storm damage and flood waters might produce a "toxic soup" in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; have been downplayed by experts in environmental science. While the threat of &lt;a href="w%3Acholera"&gt;cholera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Atyphoid"&gt;typhoid&lt;/a&gt; and other diseases is certainly increased by the contamination of the flood waters with sewage and corpses, many of the chemical companies located in or near New Orleans survived the storm without spilling dangerous contaminants into the flood waters. Of course, care should be taken to not ingest any of the flood water. People with open wounds wading or swimming through the water may also be at risk of disease.

Experts at Louisiana State University said that sediments in the &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi%20River"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Ponchartrain"&gt;Lake Ponchartrain&lt;/a&gt; are not heavily polluted and that the biggest risk of chemical contamination will come when the flood waters recede, leaving shallow pools where the water can evaporate, concentrating heavier chemical pollutants.

The widespread damage caused by the flooding is actually one of the factors in reducing the contamination, since the large amounts of water have diluted many of the contaminants. Most of the chemical pollutants that were released were of low quantity, including gasoline from underground storage tanks, dry cleaning solvents, and household and small-scale industrial chemicals, such as cleaning agents.

Reports out of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; on September 1 stated that victims of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; were being raped and beaten and that fights and fires were out of control, leaving corpses laying in the open as the city descended into anarchy. 

“We have individuals who are getting raped, we have individuals who are getting beaten,” New Orleans Police Chief Eddie Compass said. Compass said that the 15,000 to 20,000 people who were at the New Orleans convention center awaiting buses grew increasingly hostile and had beat back 88 officers he had sent there to try to keep the peace.

“Tourists are walking in that direction and they are getting preyed upon,” Compass had said.

Reports of rampant violence though may have been overblown, even by New Orleans standards, as many reports of sensational violence have not been verified. "During a week when communications were difficult, rumours have acquired a particular currency. They acquired through repetition the status of established facts." 

Indeed, White House press secretary Scott McClellan told a group of journalists on Wednesday that "martial law has been declared in Mississippi and Louisiana." though this was never the case as such a move would require a situation of lawlessness beyond the scope of local authorities to handle.

Diplomats from &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; met today in &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt; to discuss their continuing peace efforts. Plans were made for Pakistani President &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; and Indian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; to meet in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; on September 14. 

The president and prime minister are expected to attend the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;United Nations General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; during their meetup in New York. Discussion on other items on the New York agenda occurred today and will continue tomorrow in a second day of talks.

Recent talks have also been met with the announcement that an agreement between the two countries regarding missile tests would be signed in October. Although Pakistan and India have informally agreed to inform each other about their missile testing activities, they now seek a formal agreement.

The Asian countries began seeking peace in &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; after fighting two wars over control of &lt;a href="w%3AKashmir"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;.

When Musharraf and Singh met last in April, they called their peace process "irreversible." However, this statement is challenged by continued terrorist activity in Kashmir.

<h1>West African cholera claims more than 500 lives, more deaths feared</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=West%20African%20cholera%20claims%20more%20than%20500%20lives%2C%20more%20deaths%20feared&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
An outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3Acholera"&gt;cholera&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Africa"&gt;West Africa&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people, and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (UN) health officials are concerned that inadequate health services in the region could result in many more deaths.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) said on Thursday that over 31,250 cases of cholera have been reported so far this year in nine West African countries. It has claimed 488 lives at this point. "If we look at this year's trends, the figures are still going up in many countries," said John Mulangu, a senior regional advisor for the WHO. "If cholera is not brought under control in certain regions, we will soon be talking of... 100,000 cases," he said. "And hospitals and health centres will be overwhelmed. Last year we were not on this scale. The problem is getting worse," Mulangu said.

The UN says that the increase could also be related to the fact that due to poverty, many West Africans move around, sometimes out of the country, in order to receive higher wages for their work, and the region has been hit with heavy rains. This helps spread the disease, according to the UN.

"We are about to enter the harvest season where people will be moving around," said Herve Ludovic de Lys, the head of OCHA's West Africa office. "The main goal is to halt the transmission of this disease," he said. "It's not business as usual. This crisis needs a rapid response."

The following West African nations have all been hit by cholera epidemics: &lt;a href="w%3ABurkina%20Faso"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACote%20d%27Ivoire"&gt;Cote d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGuinea"&gt;Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGuinea-Bissau"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALiberia"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMauritania"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMali"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANiger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASenegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;. The WHO issued a statement on Thursday that more countries were at risk. "Outbreaks are likely to spread to Central Africa - &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; - in the next weeks," it said.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Senate"&gt;State Senate&lt;/a&gt; voted on Thursday to allow &lt;a href="w%3Ahomosexual"&gt;homosexuals&lt;/a&gt; to marry, therefore becoming the first legislative body in the United States to embrace the controversial issue.

The Senate approved the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act, which would define marriage as a civil contract between two people rather than a man and a woman. The vote passed by the minimum number of necessary votes, 21-15. All Republicans in the Senate opposed the bill, as did one Democrat, Sen. Dean Florez of &lt;a href="w%3AShafter%2C%20California"&gt;Shafter&lt;/a&gt;. Three Democrats abstained.

The bill's chief sponsor, Assemblyman &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Leno"&gt;Mark Leno&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;) said, "We're looking for three votes, and I can't tell you today who the three will be, but I think the power of the success coming from the floor of the Senate today will give us the necessary momentum and encouragement to do what we all know is the right thing to do."

California Governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;'s spokeswoman, Margita Thompson, stated that the Governor believes the issue should be decided by the court and not the legislature.

"The governor was elected to uphold the laws of California. The people spoke when they voted in Proposition 22. It has subsequently gone to the courts and the governor believes that is where it should be decided. It's an issue for the people and the courts," she said. Prop 22, which is currently being challenged by San Francisco, deals only with the issue of non-Californian marriages.

Because California has a direct democracy, decisions of the legislature can be overturned by a direct vote of the people. A court decision on the matter, however, could not be overturned except by a higher court.

Legendary &lt;a href="w%3AR%26amp%3BB"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; singer &lt;a href="w%3AFats%20Domino"&gt;Fats Domino&lt;/a&gt; has been accounted for, three days after &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; hit in his hometown of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.

Fats Domino was found on Monday by a helicopter searching for residents stranded in floodwaters. He was identified by his daughter from a photo taken Monday by a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%20Times-Picayune"&gt;New Orleans Times-Picayune&lt;/a&gt; photographer. However, while it is known that Domino was rescued, his whereabouts and the whereabouts of his family are not immediately clear.

The singer had told his agent, Al Embry, that he planned to stay at his home with his wife and daughter, rather than evacuate. He had not been heard from since before the storm hit. Domino, 77, lives in the city's 9th Ward, one of the areas hardest hit by Katrina. Attempts to reach Domino by phone proved futile, as phone lines have not been working in the area since the storm hit.

Antoine 'Fats' Domino first gained stardom with one of the first rock n' roll records, "The Fat Man". The record went platinum, selling over a million copies and hitting #2 on the Billboard charts. Of Domino's numerous &lt;a href="w%3ATop%2040"&gt;Top 40&lt;/a&gt; singles, perhaps his most notable were &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Monday"&gt;Blue Monday&lt;/a&gt; and a cover of &lt;a href="w%3ABlueberry%20Hill"&gt;Blueberry Hill&lt;/a&gt;.

Domino retired from touring in the &lt;a href="w%3A1980s"&gt;1980s&lt;/a&gt;, and has not left the city since, citing his dislike of touring, and his love of New Orleans cuisine. Not even his induction to the &lt;a href="w%3ARock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; or an invitation to the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; were able to get Domino to leave the town.

The prisoners, many of whom have been held since the overthrow of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A2001"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, are angered at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States'&lt;/a&gt; refusal to charge them with any crimes, and denying the prisoners legal access.

A previous hunger strike was halted in &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%202005"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt; when Pentagon officials reached a compromise with the prisoners. The compromise included provisions to bring the prison in line with the terms of the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Convention"&gt;Geneva Convention&lt;/a&gt;. The prisoners have since accused the government of not following through on this deal.

The exact number of prisoners is a question of debate. The &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; says that only 76 are striking, while lawyers for the prisoners say that as many as 200 prisoners are refusing to eat. The lawyers also have said that one prisoner has drawn up a will in apparent anticipation of dying.

<h1>Federal response to Katrina a &quot;national disgrace&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Federal%20response%20to%20Katrina%20a%20%26quot%3Bnational%20disgrace%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Onsite commentators are blasting the United States federal government, saying the response to &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; has been too slow and otherwise inadequate.

Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Nagin"&gt;Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt; has repeatedly pleaded for more help. 

The ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ reports that on the Friday after the storm, Louisiana Governor &lt;a href="w%3AKathleen%20Babineaux%20Blanco"&gt;Kathleen Babineaux Blanco&lt;/a&gt; got a proposal from the federal government for her to request a federal takeover of the evacuation of New Orleans. The state rejected that option hours later. Blanco had declared a state of emergency on August 26. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chertoff"&gt;Michael Chertoff&lt;/a&gt; has pointed out "our constitutional system really places the primary authority in each state with the governor." 

The city's police chief warned that storm victims were being raped and beaten on the streets. Even in the Superdome stadium and the city convention center, where tens of thousands had awaited evacuation, fights had broken out, rubbish burned, and dead bodies have been left uncollected. The Superdome evacuation was completed Saturday night. The Superdome had been opened as a refuge of last resort for people who did not participate in the voluntary evacuation of the city before the storm.

Web pundits suggest that &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20D.%20Brown"&gt;Mike Brown&lt;/a&gt;, the head of FEMA, will "be chosen to take the fall" for the poor response. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.metafilter.com/mefi/44764"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A critic at the International Arabian Horse Association, which previously fired Mike Brown, said "He was an unmitigated, total...disaster. I was shocked as hell when captain clueless (♡❤a reference to President G.W. Bush♡❤) put him in charge of FEMA a couple of years ago." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.horsesass.org/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It has also been suggested that the impact of the philosophy of privatization has damaged federal emergency response, but the validity of such claims has not been assessed. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.metafilter.com/mefi/44782"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Not all federal agencies are being blasted for their role in exacerbating the disaster. In particular, the Coast Guard has been lauded for its rescue efforts, which began immediately. There was been widespread criticism of the failure to mobilize &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20National%20Guard"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt; units from other states. Such units have now been deployed, but the debate over their slow deployment will rage for some time. Sunday the ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ reported that Louisiana did not reach out to a multi-state mutual aid compact for assistance until Wednesday.

A significant component of the criticism directed at federal and state governments has been the lack of access given to &lt;a href="Louisiana%20officials%20accused%20of%20blocking%20rescue%20volunteers"&gt;local volunteers&lt;/a&gt; and the Red Cross.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.redcross.org/faq/0%2C1096%2C0_682_4524%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AControversy%20over%20whether%20New%20Orleans%20Mayor%20failed%20to%20follow%20hurricane%20plan"&gt;Local officials&lt;/a&gt;, especially Mayor Nagin, have been harshly criticized for failing to follow existing evacuation plans. In particular, aerial photographs show numerous unused city school buses, which were to have been used in the evacuation.

Over twenty-five nations, some with assets in the area, have offered aid to the city of New Orleans, but the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="Many%20nations%20offer%20material%20aid%20to%20hurricane%20victims%3B%20Bush%20refuses%20to%20accept"&gt;refused all material aid from foreign nations&lt;/a&gt;. Such refusal of aid is not uncommon among nations with coldy hostile relationships, such as between the U.S. and Cuba or Venezuela, but it has created a stir among the European media.

As of September 4th, the US has extended a "wish list" largely duplicating the offer from Germany. German supplies, including an airborne hospital are expected to arrive September 5th. The US has also asked the EU and NATO for assistance. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C1564%2C1700331%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; has cut short their summer recess and has arrived in Washington to approve a $10.5 billion aid bill to victims of Katrina as requested by President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.
The United States &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; is expected to pass a similar bill later today.

Bush has told Congress he will ask for more funds in the coming weeks. Most of the money will go to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the rest will go to the Pentagon which is dispatching ships to the area.

Bush has also asked his father, former President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.W.%20Bush"&gt;George H.W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and former President &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; to help raise private funds for relief like they did for the December 2004 tsunami in Asia.

Over two dozen nations, some with assets in the area, have offered aid to the city of New Orleans, but President George W. Bush has refused any aid from foreign nations which does not take the form of cash.

State Police in &lt;a href="w%3ALafayette%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;Lafayette, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, have been accused of hindering attempts by private citizens to rescue people trapped by floodwaters in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. The accusations were contained in an unconfirmed report received via email by Jason Robideaux, an attorney from Lafayette.

The email was written by a person who claimed to be part of "a group of approximately 1,000 citizens pulling 500 boats" heading into New Orleans to rescue people still stranded in places such as hospitals. The email claimed that the members of the flotilla were ".. experienced boaters, licensed fishermen and hunters, people who have spent their entire adult life and teenage years on the waterways of Louisiana."

The email reports that a Dept. of Wildlife &amp; Fisheries (DWF) agent ordered them to turn around and go home. 

"We then specifically asked the DWF agent that we (and other citizens in the flotilla) be allowed to go to the hospitals and help evacuate the sick and the doctors and nurses stranded there. We offered to bring these people back to Lafayette, in our own vehicles, in order to ensure that they received proper and prompt medical care," the email said. 

"The DWF agent did not want to hear this and ordered us home. We complied with the DWF agent's orders, turned around and headed back to Lafayette along with half of the flotillia. However, two of my friends were pulling my other boat, a smaller 15ft alumaweld with a 25 hp. The DWF agents let them through to proceed to the rescue operation launch site," the email continued. 

The email also reported hundreds of DWF agents who were not being utilised. 

"My two friends were allowed to drive to the launch site where the La. Dept. of Wildlife and Fisheries were launching their rescue operations (via boat). They reported to me that there were over 200 DWF agents just standing around and doing nothing. My friends were kept there for approximately 3 hours. During that time they observed a large number of DWF agents doing nothing. After three hours had passed they were told that they were not needed and should go home. They complied with the DWF's orders and turned around and went home to Lafayette," the email said.

The state of &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; unveiled plans to officially end use of the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Office"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt; suite, instead switching to an open document format currently implemented by many open-source groups. Massachusetts is believed to be the first major public-sector group to implement such a plan in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Target implementation date is &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary%201"&gt;January 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. The task is considered challenging, as most government documents were created in closed-source programs such as Office, &lt;a href="w%3ALotus%20Notes"&gt;Lotus Notes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACorel%20WordPerfect"&gt;Corel WordPerfect&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3AOpenDocument"&gt;OpenDocument&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href="w%3AXML"&gt;XML-based&lt;/a&gt; standard for creating documents, spreadsheets, charts and graphs. The OpenDocument format is supported by many software suites, including &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.Org"&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStarOffice"&gt;StarOffice&lt;/a&gt;. While Microsoft document formats are generally the most commonly used, government officials worried about the proprietary nature of the formats.

<h1>Minnesota 2% biodiesel mandate becomes effective September 29</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Minnesota%202%25%20biodiesel%20mandate%20becomes%20effective%20September%2029&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On September 29, &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; will become the first U.S. state to require &lt;a href="w%3Adiesel"&gt;diesel&lt;/a&gt; fuel sold at filling stations in the state to be blended with 2% &lt;a href="w%3Abiodiesel"&gt;biodiesel&lt;/a&gt;. This follows the statewide mandate requiring &lt;a href="w%3Aalcohol%20fuel"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt; to be mixed into &lt;a href="w%3Agasoline"&gt;gasoline&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;also a first by Minnesota&amp;mdash;which took effect in 1997. The biodiesel mandate was approved by the 2002 state legislature, and was sent to then-Governor &lt;a href="w%3AJesse%20Ventura"&gt;Jesse Ventura&lt;/a&gt;. Ventura allowed the bill to become law without his signature, stating his concern that the increased cost of fuel would affect the trucking industry&amp;mdash;potentially spurring inflation&amp;mdash;though he felt that this was nearly balanced by the positive impact the mandate would have on agriculture in the state.

The law had an initial target date of July 1, 2005, but would only go into effect once production capacity exceeded 8 million gallons (30 millon liters) per year. At the beginning of 2005, the state was only capable of producing three million gallons each year, but two new facilities in &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Lea%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Albert Lea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABrewster%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Brewster&lt;/a&gt; increased state capacity twentyfold when they opened this summer. Each of the two new plants can produce 30 million gallons (113 ML) annually. Agriculture Commissioner Gene Hugoson verified production levels in the August 29 edition of the Minnesota State Register, meaning that the law will become effective following a month-long notification period.

The prices of diesel and biodiesel have equalized, so the negative economic impact initially feared by Ventura are not expected to come to pass and the effect should be pennies more or less per gallon. Despite the dramatic increase in capacity, biodiesel production is not yet a broad solution to shortages or high prices&amp;mdash;in 2001, the state used 14.3 million gallons of petroleum every day.

Tuesday, &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; News posted photographs from the &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; disaster area gathered from various sources.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; photograph of two African-American women was captioned, "Looters carry bags of groceries through floodwaters after taking the merchandise away from a wind damaged convenience store in New Orleans on Monday, Aug. 29, 2005."

A similar &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) photograph of two &lt;a href="w%3Acaucasian"&gt;caucasians&lt;/a&gt; was labeled, "Two residents wade through chest-deep water after finding bread and soda from a local grocery store in New Orleans..."

The vast majority of people who did not evacuate from the famous city were poor and black; many were unable to obtain transportation.

Several news sites have noted that &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; rescue and evacuation efforts have been severely complicated by the presence of these &lt;a href="Widespread%20looting%20blamed%20for%20disrupted%20rescue%20efforts%20in%20New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;looters&lt;/a&gt;. The evacuation of the &lt;a href="w%3ASuperdome"&gt;Superdome&lt;/a&gt; was halted after shots were reported, fired at a National Guard rescue helicopter.
Yahoo! News later released a &lt;a href="http%3A//news.yahoo.com/page/photostatement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on the images, saying, "...we present the photos and their captions as written, edited and distributed by the news services with no additional editing..." Yahoo! agreed to AFP's request to remove AFP-supplied photographs after the controversy began, fueled by articles on the topic by &lt;a href="w%3ASalon.com"&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFlickr"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, and other news sites.

The choice of wording may be chalked up to different policies at the two agencies (AP and AFP); the AP has been labeling several of their photos with the term "looting" if their photographers witness the act, while Getty spokeswoman Bridget Russel said regarding the AFP/Getty photo, "This is obviously a big tragedy down there, so we're being careful with how we credit these photos."

Chris Graythen, who took the AFP picture and wrote the caption, said "I believed in my opinion, that they did simply find them, and not 'looted' them in the definition of the word. The people were swimming in chest deep water, and there were other people in the water, both white and black. I looked for the best picture. there were a million items floating in the water - we were right near a grocery store that had 5+ feet of water in it. it had no doors. the water was moving, and the stuff was floating away. These people were not ducking into a store and busting down windows to get electronics. They picked up bread and cokes that were floating in the water. They would have floated away anyhow."

&lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; State &lt;a href="w%3ACoroner"&gt;Coroner&lt;/a&gt; Graeme Johnstone has ruled that former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHarold%20Holt"&gt;Harold Holt&lt;/a&gt; drowned in the surf at Cheviot Beach on December 17, 1967. Mr Holt was swimming at the beach, known for its dangerous currents, when he disappeared. Numerous theories have circulated since to explain the disappearance, including one that believed he was abducted by a Chinese submarine.

No formal inquiry was held at the time, because the law at the time stated that coroners could not investigate unless there was a body. This law was changed in 1985. Mr. Johnstone said that the lack of inquiry meant that much information was not released to the public, which may have contributed to the development of the conspiracy theories.

"Unfortunately, there was no open inquiry at the time so this detailed material did not become general public knowledge," he said, adding, "A simple reading of the original investigative material provides the real and credible explanation."

Mr. Holt's son said that the family believed all along that Holt had drowned.

"Myself and the other family members have always thought that it was simply a matter of him going for a swim when he shouldn't," he said.

Fires are raging in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; following a series of explosions along the waterfront. The cause of the blasts is not known. A chemical reaction with the rising waters is one possibility. One official has stated that the explosions took place at a chemical storage facility near the riverfront a few miles south of the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Quarter"&gt;French Quarter&lt;/a&gt;.

This news comes as police suspended search-and-rescue operations in order to attempt to halt the rising levels of looting in the city, and after Louisiana Governor &lt;a href="w%3AKathleen%20Blanco"&gt;Kathleen Blanco&lt;/a&gt; ordered National Guard troops to "shoot and kill" rioters and looters. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050902/us_nm/weather_katrina_kill_dc"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Although aid has been promised by the US federal authorities, New Orleans Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Nagin"&gt;Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt; criticised them for what he feels is a slow response.

"They don't have a clue what's going on down there," Mayor Ray Nagin told WWL-AM Thursday night.

"They flew down here one time two days after the doggone event was over with TV cameras, AP reporters, all kind of goddamn — excuse my French, everybody in America, but I am pissed."

On Thursday, the Ivorian rebel group Forces Nouvelles responded to the &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n mediator’s Wednesday testimony to the &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; by saying that South Africa had become “discredited” by taking the side of Ivorian president &lt;a href="Laurent%20Gbagbo"&gt;Laurent Gbagbo&lt;/a&gt;’s government in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbidjan"&gt;Abidjan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

“We categorically do not want the South African mediation continuing here in &lt;a href="Cote%20d%27Ivoire"&gt;Cote d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt;” said the rebel group in a statement. The Forces Nouvelles spokesman further demanded that "the African Union, and especially AU president Olusegun Obasanjo, take his responsibility and find a new way," calling on regional leader &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; to intervene in the crisis.

The statements are the latest in a series of setbacks to Cote d’Ivoire’s beleaguered peace process, which also include the failure of the rebels to meet the July 31st disarmament deadline, and the rejection of October 30 as a feasible date for the national elections.

Special Representative of the Secretary-General to Cote d'Ivoire, Pierre Schori, expressed his support for the continued South African mediation and stated that conducting free and fair elections in Cote d’Ivoire was more important than sticking with the set dates.

<h2>Audio Wikinews transcript – 2005 09 02 – 1100 UTC</h2>

The time is 1100 hours (UTC) on Friday 2nd September 2005, and this is Audio Wikinews: News Briefs.

&lt;a href="Widespread%20looting%20blamed%20for%20disrupted%20rescue%20efforts%20in%20New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;Widespread looting blamed for disrupted rescue efforts in New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, has ordered most of the local police force to stop rescue efforts and shift their efforts to prevent looting. At the same time, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has reportedly been blocking aid shipments into the city on the grounds that it is too dangerous.

Food, nappies (or diapers), and other supplies are the target of most looters. Some are reportedly taking non-essential and luxury items, such as TVs and computers. Reportedly, gun and pawn shops are also a popular target for looting.
&lt;a href="Al-Qaida%20claims%20responsibility%20for%20London%207/7%20bombings"&gt;Al-Qaida claims responsibility for London 7/7 bombings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Al Jazeera aired two video tapes by Al Qaeda on Thursday evening. In one of them, the terror group's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri has claimed responsibility for the July 7 London bombings and threatened further attacks. The alleged leader of the London bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan, appeared on a separate recording and outlined his reasons for the bombings.

Speaking in English with a Yorkshire accent, Khan stated that the Blair government is to blame for the attacks. He said: "Until you stop the bombing, gassing, imprisonment and torture of my people we will not stop this fight."
&lt;a href="Guantanamo%20prisoners%20stage%20hunger%20strike"&gt;Guantanamo prisoners stage hunger strike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A number of prisoners at the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay have staged a hunger strike in protest of their detainment. The prisoners, many of whom have been held since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, are angered at the United States' refusal to charge them with any crimes, and denying the prisoners legal access.

A previous hunger strike was halted in July when Pentagon officials reached a compromise with the prisoners. The compromise included provisions to bring the prison in line with the terms of the Geneva Convention. The prisoners have since accused the government of not following through on this deal.

An explosion today in &lt;a href="Makhachkala"&gt;Makhachkala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; in the Russian region of &lt;a href="Dagestan"&gt;Dagestan&lt;/a&gt; killed one and wounded five others, police say. The bomb detonated in a pile of garbage, where servicemen and a truck had been sent to search for explosives on a street near a military base. When the engineers got out of the truck to search, the bomb went off.

The Dagestani Ministry, reported by the Russian news agency ITAR-Tass, originally stated that the blast killed two servicemen and wounded three others. They later revised this to six servicemen wounded (as well as one civilian), but no fatalities. A police officer told ITAR-Tass news that a brigade had been on patrol when the explosion occurred.

According to RIA-Novosti and Interfax news, medics reported one death and six injuries. RIA-Novosti also reports that the bomb exploded near a trolley bus. 

Police and ambulances were immediately brought to the area of the explosion, which was quickly sealed off by police. 

The alleged planters of the bomb were followed by police, but escaped after firing at the officers. 

This explosion is not surprising, as racial tensions in the Muslim majority region of Dagestan often lead to attacks on officials and police.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Housing%20and%20Urban%20Development"&gt;United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&lt;/a&gt; (HUD) will make many of their marketable housing properties in the southeastern United States and elsewhere available to hurricane refugees. HUD Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AAlphonso%20Jackson"&gt;Alphonso Jackson&lt;/a&gt; said that an "overwhelming" response from government and private officials would make housing available as soon as the middle of next week. HUD housing centers as far away as &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt; would be making properties available. HUD is considering offering these properties to displaced persons regardless of their income and allowing the refugees to use the properties for up to one year.

A man from North London is currently training for an attempt at flying a &lt;a href="w%3Ahang%20glider"&gt;hang glider&lt;/a&gt; across the UK from land's End to John O'Groats.

Shola Ogunlokun a 41 year old married father of 3 who had never flown a hang
glider before taking up this challenge said yesterday "I aim to fulfill a dream of
flying, use the challenge as an opportunity to meet the people of Britain and
encourage people of similar ethnic backgrounds as me to pursue their dreams".

Shola is on stage 2 of a 3 stage training programme, and has flown a glider off
a 2000ft mountain on completion of stage 1 of his training. He is currently
looking for sponsors and in talks with a TV production about making a
documentary of his attempt.

The flight attempt is currently planned for around Autumn next year, should take
between 5-7 days, and Shola would like to spend the night of each flight at the
home of a local in the town he lands. If successful, Shola will be the first
person to have flown a hang glider across the UK over this distance. 

Shola has an online diary charting his progress at http://mbchallenge.blogspot.com

Gas prices have shot up to over &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;3.50 per gallon, late Thursday morning in the Northeast &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;. People are rushing to fill their tanks as some stations are reporting shortages of gasoline, and many oil wells were forced to shut down after Hurricane Katrina.

Meanwhile, gas prices dropped elsewhere and rose elsewhere. Saturday morning California had the highest reported price at GasPriceWatch.com. Another price service reported $3.05 as the U.S. average.

The federal government's weekly petroleum price summary reported U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline decreased by 0.2 cent to 261.0 cents per gallon. But supply shocks are likely as the distribution systems respond to bottlenecks. On Tuesday, August 30, CNN reported the price of U.S. crude oil rose to a record high $70.85 a barrel. However, prices fell $3.28 to $67.57 a barrel on Friday. In contrast, the crude oil in Europe, which is usually more expensive than US oil, was actually cheaper than in America; as London &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Crude"&gt;Brent Crude&lt;/a&gt; oil was down $1.15 to $66.57 a barrel. But as CNN reports, "European allies sprang to the rescue."

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced that its member states will release 60 million &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APetroleum"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; barrels from their strategic reserves next month. "All 26 member countries will take collective action", said the agency in its statement. The announcement was in response to the crude price surge after disruption of oil supply in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Earlier today &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJavier%20Solana"&gt;Javier Solana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , chief of the European Union's foreign policy, said the EU can provide the 
US with reserves of the member states. Also &lt;a href="OPEC"&gt;OPEC&lt;/a&gt; is considering taking action. The United States and Japan already plan to release oil from their reserve stocks.

Oil prices fell slightly today, following the IEA statement, as expected. US light crude fell US$1.57 to US$67.90 a barrel.

HM &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Mswati%20III"&gt;King Mswati III&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASwaziland"&gt;Swaziland&lt;/a&gt; has held a massive ceremony to find his 13th wife. More than 50,000 showed up to the unofficial call for brides. All potential brides who attended the two-day &lt;a href="w%3AReed%20Dance"&gt;Reed Dance&lt;/a&gt;, held annually since 1999, were bare-breasted, wearing short, beaded skirts and were supposedly &lt;a href="w%3Avirgin"&gt;virgins&lt;/a&gt;.

As his country's 37-year-old Ngwenyama (king), Mswati is the last &lt;a href="w%3Aabsolute%20monarch"&gt;absolute monarch&lt;/a&gt; in sub-Saharan Africa.

&lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Masuku"&gt;Mario Masuku&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the banned opposition party, said that "The Reed Dance has been abused for one man's personal satisfaction. The king has a passion for young women and opulence." Masuku's comments were based on the fact that the Reed Dance traditionally celebrated virginity and womanliness.

"The king takes a wife whenever he wants, and that's the way it is. This is our culture, and we will never change," says Tsandzile Ndluva, 21, one of the dancers at the event.

&lt;a href="w%3ALudzidzini%20Royal%20Village"&gt;Ludzidzini Royal Village&lt;/a&gt; also hosted the Great She-Elephant, their name for the country's &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20mother"&gt;queen mother&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANtombi%20Thwala"&gt;Ntombi Thwala&lt;/a&gt;. She was greeted by 50,000 people, which is 5% of the nation's population. Their traditional ceremony for the She-Elephant includes dancing and building a wind-break for her out of reeds.

The King's current wives include Inkhosikati LaMatsebula, Inkhosikati LaMotsa, Inkhosikati LaMbikiza, Inkhosikati LaNgangaza, Inkhosikati LaHwala, Inkhosikati LaMagwaza, Inkhosikati LaMasango, Inkhosikati LaGija, Inkhosikati LaMagongo, and Inkhosikati LaMahlangu. LaMbikiza has a Master's Degree in Law.

He has 27 children from his first 13 wives and wives-to-be, and over 200 brothers and sisters, a result of his late father King Sobhuza II's 70 wives. Mswati must look after all of these relatives with funds from the royal-owned company, &lt;a href="w%3ATibiyo%20TakaNgwane"&gt;Tibiyo TakaNgwane&lt;/a&gt;.

At the Reed Dance, Mswati repealed the law prohibiting sexual activity for girls younger than 18. This law was first enacted in 2001, to help in the fight against &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, which was, and still is, at crisis levels. The ban was set to end in 2006. The law was actually a revival of the ancient "umchwasho" rite, a Swazi tradition. In the first weeks this law was enacted, Mswati broke it himself, marrying Inkhosikati LaMagongo. This forced him to pay a fine of one cow.

Forty-percent of Swazis are &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV positive&lt;/a&gt;, including 42% of pregnant women, a matter that the King was taken to heart, to some extent. He has travelled internationally to try and raise money, increase awareness, and seek solutions to the epidemic. World-renowned musicians like &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; have signed on to record an album, to raise funds for orphans in the country. However, the young king does not seem to have realised the importance of leadership by personal example, and the Swaziland Ministry of Health website &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gov.sz/home.asp%3Fpid%3D4569"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows little evidence of his government's commitment to address the issue.

The King says he is suffering from stress, finding it difficult to cope with the pressure of work. He told BBC News "I find very little time with my family most of the time. I normally work until 11pm... and this makes me feel stressed because I'm being overworked, but I have to do everything possible to satisfy my people."

&lt;a href="w%3ABovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;Bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt;, better known as BSE or "mad cow" disease, may have been caused by human remains ingested by British cattle, two scientists said today.

Alan Colchester and his daughter Nancy Colchester, from the University of Kent and University of Edinburgh, respectively, suggested that the remains of humans cast into the Ganges in an Indian funeral rite contaminated Indian animal feed that was imported to the U.K. If some of the humans died of &lt;a href="w%3ACreutzfeldt-Jakob%20disease"&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&lt;/a&gt;, bone meal infected with CJD would have entered the British food chain, causing the similar BSE in cattle. 

Admitting the evidence was not solid, the two scientists still argued that this new theory merited further review. The current theory of the origin of BSE involves the transmission of &lt;a href="w%3Ascrapie"&gt;scrapie&lt;/a&gt;, a similar disease that affects sheep, to cattle. &lt;a href="w%3APrions"&gt;Prions&lt;/a&gt;, infectious proteins that would be the only disease-causing agents without nucleic acid, are thought to be the cause of all of these diseases.

Due to the damage by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent flooding, a number of colleges and universities in the New Orleans metropolitan area will not be able to hold classes for the fall 2005 semester. It is estimated that 75,000 to 100,000 students have been displaced. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm%3FSection%3DPresident2President"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In response, institutions across the United States and Canada are offering late registration for displaced students so that their academic progress is not unduly delayed. Some are offering free or reduced admission to displaced students. At some universities, especially state universities, this offer is limited to residents of the area.

A woman has destroyed her family's home in an attempt to kill the &lt;a href="w%3Aspiders"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; in its garage.

&lt;a href="w%3AZuelpich"&gt;Zuelpich&lt;/a&gt; police report that when spraying them with &lt;a href="w%3Ahairspray"&gt;hairspray&lt;/a&gt; failed to kill them, the spiders were then subjected to being burned with a &lt;a href="w%3Acigarette%20lighter"&gt;cigarette lighter&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were probably still covered with hairspray, which set alight the floor of the garage. The fire then spread to a hedge, and then to the house, which the woman failed to save with a &lt;a href="w%3Agarden%20hose"&gt;garden hose&lt;/a&gt;. It is reported to be uninhabitable, but the neighbouring semi-detached house was spared, suffering only broken windows and exterior charring.

The damage is estimated at around €100,000 (£70,000 or $125,000.)

A policeman stated, "The family have had to look for somewhere else to stay. The spiders are gone though - that problem was solved."

Over twenty five nations have offered aid in the wake of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, France has offered the use of its resources in the &lt;a href="w%3ACaribbean%20sea"&gt;Caribbean sea&lt;/a&gt;, including 2 navy ships, 1 navy hospital, 8 planes, 600 tents, 1000 beds, and rescuers. &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has refused such material aid to the hurricane's victims, although cash donations will be accepted. He explained his reasons to ABC News:

A few of these nations, such as Venezuela and Cuba, are disliked by the administration, but the majority are considered allies of the United States. Venezuela's Citgo Petroleum Corp. pledged a $1 million donation for hurricane aid. Cuba refused U.S. aid following &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Dennis"&gt;Hurricane Dennis&lt;/a&gt;. In order to reduce the side effects of hurricane Katrina, Japan, Venezuela, and most EU countries offer to provide oil reserves to the U.S.

<h1>Rapper Kanye West denounces Bush response, American media at hurricane relief telethon</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rapper%20Kanye%20West%20denounces%20Bush%20response%2C%20American%20media%20at%20hurricane%20relief%20telethon&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AGrammy"&gt;Grammy&lt;/a&gt; award-winning rapper/producer &lt;a href="w%3AKanye%20West"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt; appeared on a live on-air telethon simulcast on &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACNBC"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AI%20%28TV%20network%29"&gt;PAX&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; victims. Live on air, West said "George Bush doesn't care about black people," after saying "America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off as slow as possible." He also said "the Red Cross is doing everything they can," and stated that he was going to see what the maximum amount of money he can donate is. West criticized government authorities and stated that "They've given them permission to go down and shoot us."

West first deviated from the script he and comedian &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Myers%20%28actor%29"&gt;Mike Myers&lt;/a&gt; were using by commenting on the recent uproar over differently captioned photos for black and white people in the aftermath of the hurricane: "I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says they're looting. See a white family, it says they're looking for food."

Though a several-second delay was in place, the comments were let through uncensored on the EST live broadcast as the person in charge "was instructed to listen for a curse word, and didn't realize he had gone off-script," according to an NBC spokeswoman.

NBC has released a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nbc6.net/news/4931967/detail.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; after the broadcast: "Tonight's telecast was a live television event wrought with emotion. Kanye West departed from the scripted comments that were prepared for him, and his opinions in no way represent the views of the networks. It would be most unfortunate if the efforts of the artists who participated tonight and the generosity of millions of Americans who are helping those in need are overshadowed by one person's opinion."

The sponsor of the event, the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Red%20Cross"&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;, also issued a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0%2C1077%2C0_314_4527%2C00.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on the telethon, stating: "During the telecast, a controversial comment was made by one of the celebrities. We would like the American public to know that our support is unwavering, regardless of political circumstances. We are a neutral and impartial organization, and support disaster victims across the country regardless of race, class, color or creed."

In &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, southeast of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, two storage tanks estimated to be filled with up to 160,000 barrels (6.7 million gallons) of oil are reported to be leaking into the &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi%20River"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;. It was first noticed on September 1, 2005 by an aircraft flying overhead. Officials are not certain whether the tanks are the cause of the leak or how full the tanks are. Inspection of the storage tanks from the ground is impossible due to flooding in the area.

In comparison, the &lt;a href="w%3AExxon%20Valdez"&gt;Exxon Valdez&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aoil%20spill"&gt;oil spill&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href="w%3AAlaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; leaked between 11 and 35 million gallons of oil.

Due to massive efforts directed toward search and rescue in New Orleans, the Coast Guard has not been able to look into the matter.

<h1>Blizzard Entertainment's victory over bnetd sealed in Appeals Court</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Blizzard%20Entertainment%27s%20victory%20over%20bnetd%20sealed%20in%20Appeals%20Court&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ABlizzard%20Entertainment"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; has won a federal ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals against the programmers of &lt;a href="w%3Abnetd"&gt;bnetd&lt;/a&gt;, a software package that emulates Blizzard's &lt;a href="w%3ABattle.net"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; service. The court reaffirmed the original judgement, given in October, that the &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt; and click-through &lt;a href="w%3AEULA"&gt;EULA&lt;/a&gt;'s prohibited the reverse engineering of Blizzard's software in order to improve their playability. This was the first real test of the DMCA's applicability.

Bnetd, released under the &lt;a href="w%3AGNU%20General%20Public%20License"&gt;GNU General Public License&lt;/a&gt;, was created to enable users to play multiplayer games, bypassing Blizzard's freely accessible Battle.net servers, which have sometimes been unreliable or slow for gamers. The software also disabled the CD-Key check which is present in Battle.net to prevent users of pirated copies from being able to connect to Blizzard's servers. Offers by bnetd developers to incorporate Blizzard's CD-Check system were declined.

The CD-Check system itself has faced controversy, with some users complaining it borders on breaching privacy in the same way as &lt;a href="w%3AAdware"&gt;adware&lt;/a&gt; and other malevolent software. This is not confined to Blizzard: controversy occurred when &lt;a href="w%3ASony%20Online%20Entertainment"&gt;Sony Online Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AEverquest"&gt;EverQuest&lt;/a&gt; had a similar system which was later disabled due to complaints. Other games designed for network play are also known to have similar systems in place, the most prominent perhaps being &lt;a href="w%3AValve%20Software"&gt;Valve Software&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASteam%20%28content%20delivery%29"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; system developed for &lt;a href="w%3AHalf-Life%202"&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/a&gt;.

Blizzard has produced many popular titles such as &lt;a href="w%3AStarCraft"&gt;Starcraft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20of%20Warcraft"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ADiablo"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; series.

&lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;President of France&lt;/a&gt;, entered the military hospital of the &lt;a href="w%3AVal%20de%20Gr%C3%A2ce"&gt;Val de Grâce&lt;/a&gt; in central &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; yesterday evening. According to the communiqué of the hospital, he suffers from some troubles of vision following from a vascular accident and these problems should be over in a few days. Hospitalization should last one week, and meetings are being rescheduled accordingly.

Today, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; visited the president and discussed a number of urgent matters, such as the help proposed to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; following from the disastrous &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20International%20Relations"&gt;U.S. House Committee on International Relations&lt;/a&gt; voted Wednesday on a Resolution of Inquiry that would have required the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; to "transmit all information relating to communication with officials of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; between January 1, 2002, and October 16, 2002, relating to the policy of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; with respect to &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;." The resolution comes in response to questions that have been raised by senior intelligence officials and information revealed in leaked U.K. documents such as the &lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street%20Memo"&gt;Downing Street Memo&lt;/a&gt;, regarding the handling of pre-war intelligence by the &lt;a href="w%3ABush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;, and the planning and execution of the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt;.

Originally proposed by Congresswoman &lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Lee"&gt;Barbara Lee&lt;/a&gt; (D-Calif.), the Resolution of Inquiry had 83 co-sponsors at the time of voting, including one member of the International Relations Committee, &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Leach"&gt;Jim Leach&lt;/a&gt;, who was the only Republican voting in favor of the resolution. 

Some members of the committee from each party were absent.

<h1>Tempers flare over New Orleans tragedy</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tempers%20flare%20over%20New%20Orleans%20tragedy&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The handling of the devastation left by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, considered by many to be inadequate, has prompted scathing criticism of American politicians. &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; was criticized for verbally "pandering" to public opinion, while little is done about the tragedy. In a WWL radio interview, New Orleans Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Nagin"&gt;Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt; called for a "moratorium on press conferences" and said, "[The government is] feeding the public a line of bull, and they are spinning, and people are dying." The mayor has since apologised for these remarks. However, the mayor did not address his own alleged failure to evacuate his citizens when &lt;a href="Controversy%20over%20whether%20New%20Orleans%20Mayor%20failed%20to%20follow%20hurricane%20plan"&gt;he reportedly left hundreds of city-controlled buses idle&lt;/a&gt;.

Malik Rahim, a recent &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate for New Orleans City Council, describes the poor organization as criminal, and called for his party to come help when the federal government would permit it. &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy"&gt;Grammy&lt;/a&gt; award-winning rapper &lt;a href="w%3AKanye%20West"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt; created controversy when he said "George Bush doesn't care about black people" and that "America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off as slow as possible" in a telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina.

Onsite television news reporters have also levied very harsh criticism against the politicians whom they were interviewing. Anderson Cooper (CNN) took Sen. Mary Landrieu (D., Louisiana) to task for her detachment (&lt;a href="http%3A//demo.ripside.com/fark/Anderson-Cooper-Landrieu-Katrina.wmv"&gt;WMV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0509/01/acd.01.html"&gt;trancsript&lt;/a&gt;). Andrea Mitchell (MSNBC), Bill O'Reilly (FOX), Geraldo Rivera (FOX), Scarborough (MSNBC), Shepard Smith (FOX), Robert Siegel (NPR), and Paula Zahn (CNN) have also harshly criticized their interviewees (&lt;a href="http%3A//movies.crooksandliars.com/Hannity-Colmes-Smith-Rivera-freak-in-NO.wmv"&gt;WMV&lt;/a&gt;). One broadcaster bitterly exclaimed "The only difference between the chaos of New Orleans and a Third World disaster operation, was that a foreign dictator would have responded better."

In a &lt;a href="http%3A//landrieu.senate.gov/releases/05/2005903E12.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; issued September 3rd, 2005, Democratic Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana claims that &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; staged a photo opportunity by having rescue equipment quickly moved into the background during the event. Senator Landrieu claims the equipment was dispersed elsewhere the next day. Landrieu says in her press release, " ... we witnessed a hastily prepared stage set for a Presidential photo opportunity; and the desperately needed resources we saw were this morning reduced to a single, lonely piece of equipment. The good and decent people of southeast Louisiana and the Gulf Coast -- black and white, rich and poor, young and old -- deserve far better from their national government ..." The breached levee was closed on Monday by a sequence of dump trucks building a narrow pathway across the gap toward helicopter-dropped sandbags. 

Some responses, however, have concerned themselves not with criticizing the response, but praising the hurricane itself. The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Family%20Association"&gt;American Family Association's&lt;/a&gt; Agape Press published praise for the hurricane's destruction as an instrument of God's mercy, in that it "wiped out rampant sin". Rev. Bill Shanks, pastor of New Covenant Fellowship of New Orleans, said "God simply, I believe, in His mercy purged all of that stuff out of there -- and now we're going to start over again." "New Orleans now is abortion free. New Orleans now is Mardi Gras free. New Orleans now is free of &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Decadence"&gt;Southern Decadence&lt;/a&gt; and the sodomites, the witchcraft workers, false religion -- it's free of all of those things now," Shanks says.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Labor"&gt;Department of Labor&lt;/a&gt; announced that the country's &lt;a href="w%3Aunemployment"&gt;unemployment&lt;/a&gt; rate fell to a four-year low of 4.9%. American employers created about 169,000 new jobs in August. However, this trend is projected to end due to &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; (the data was collected prior to the hurricane).

Economists expect the number of jobless to grow by more than 500,000 in September and the unemployment rate to drive up over 5% again, but they are unsure of the effect an of upcoming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Some sources believe the Fed will make no change, while others say the rates will likely be increased to prevent the economy from overheating, causing inflation, which also may be caused by the surge in crude oil and gasoline prices.

The markets fell despite the unemployment data. The &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones"&gt;Dow Jones&lt;/a&gt; industrial average fell 12.26 points to 10,447.37 while &lt;a href="w%3ANasdaq"&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; fell 6.83 points to 2,141.07. The US dollar declined slightly against most world currencies.

A daughter of HM &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Mswati%20III"&gt;King Mswati III&lt;/a&gt;, 17-year-old Princess Sikhanyiso was throwing a party with loud music and alcohol. The party was to celebrate the end of the chastity decree.

"It was within the traditional overseer's right to discipline anyone — including princesses — who wanted to spoil the important [Reed Dance] ceremony," claimed Jim Gama, governor of the queen mother's residence. The Reed Dance ceremony is an annual ritual in the culture.

Princess Sikhanyiso had already caused ire around Swaziland, as she broke traditions by wearing Western-style short skirts and jeans.

In a last minute change of position, the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL) has reversed its decision not to allow the Liberian National football team, The Lone Star, to attend Sunday's World Cup qualifier against Togo. The NTGL had announced on Wednesday that the squad would not be able to travel to Lome, Togo because of a lack of funds to pay for the team's travel.

In a statement explaining its decision not to fund the team's travel, the NTGL highlighted more pressing financial obligations such as the country's upcoming national elections and the demobilization of the nation's defunct armed forces. "As a result of the huge expenditure, the National Transitional Government of Liberia has decided it is unfeasible to underwrite the Lone Star's travel to Togo," said the Minister of Information, Dr. C. William Allen.

The decision to allow The Lone Star to travel to Lome was made after the price of the team's travel decreased from US$31,000 to US$18,000. The team now plans to fly to Accra and take a bus to Lome versus fly the entire way. Had Liberia failed to take the field on Sunday, the country would have faced fines of US$31,895 and possible prohibition from participating in the 2010 World Cup to be held in South Africa. Incidentally, the fines would have been slightly more than the team's original travel budget.

When &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; flooded most of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; in up to thirty feet of water, an engineering nightmare was created. Now, the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers"&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&lt;/a&gt; seems to have found a solution.
The problem was caused by three breaches in a levee system not designed to withstand a powerful Category 4 hurricane. These breaks allowed water to flow into New Orleans from massive Lake Pontchartrain.

It will take between 36 and 80 days according to Brig. Gen. Robert Crear, but engineers believe they've found a way to get water out of the city.

The first step was to stop the rising level of water, which the Corps and a team of private contractors accomplished yesterday.

Currently, the 17th Street Canal is being closed using a combination of steel sheets, 300-lb. and 3,000-lb. sandbags, and the construction of a rock dyke. The London Avenue breach will be closed off as well while the break at the Inner Harbor Lock will be left open to allow drainage.

In St. Bernard Parish, one of the hardest-hit areas of the city, a levee is being opened to allow water to drain out. 

Once the water finally drains out of New Orleans, some areas will still be up to seven feet deep due to the city's location under sea level. This will have to be pumped out, possible only when electricity returns.

To help launch &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Verde"&gt;Cape Verde&lt;/a&gt;'s first public university, the &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt; government has made the promise to provide organizational advice and to train professors.

According to Fernando Haddad, Brazilian Minister of Education, Brazil will send its professors to the small nation off the African coast to train them in lecturing, marking, and other important skills involved in the profession.

Filomena Martins, Cape Verdean Minister of Education and Human Resource Enhancement, met with Haddad on August 22 to work out the details of the plan, which was first launched by Brazil's President, &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;, in July 2004.

Cape Verde also hopes to increase the level of education for the university professors themselves. Of the 300 professors at the planned institution, only 3% have doctorates and only 21% have master's degrees.

Brazil also helps Cape Verde reduce its debt through the Post-Graduate Student Agreement Program. PEC-PG encourages Cape Verdeans to become foreign exchange students in Brazil. In 2005-06, 20 students will participate, with the level increasing to 50 students in the next calendar year.

Yesterday, September 2, &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; announced the retirement of the &lt;a href="w%3ASISSL"&gt;Sun Industry Standard Source License (SISSL)&lt;/a&gt; scheme. The &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Source%20Initiative"&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt; had been discussing ways of reducing the quantity of Open Source licenses to make it easier for developers and companies to chose a license. Dropping the SISSL takes them one step closer to this goal. Sun's decision to drop the SISSL comes a few months after &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;'s similar decision to drop its Open Source License in March. 

Simon Phipps, the director of Sun's Open Source Office, said in his &lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; that he will ask the OSI to put the SISSL on the "not recommended" list. He also said “I'd encourage any project that's currently using it to make other plans at the time of their next major release”.

No future Sun open-source projects will use the SISSL, and current Sun projects using a dual-license scheme will drop the SISSL “as soon as the development cycle allows”. One of Sun's most popular open-source projects, OpenOffice.org, is licensed under both the &lt;a href="w%3ALGPL"&gt;LGPL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASISSL"&gt;SISSL&lt;/a&gt;. As of September 2, all OpenOffice.org 2.0 code is now licensed exclusively under the LGPL. 

Sun prefers the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunity%20Development%20and%20Distribution%20License"&gt;Community Development and Distribution License&lt;/a&gt;, a variant of the &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Public%20License"&gt;Mozilla Public License&lt;/a&gt;. Sun released OpenSolaris and the Glassfish Java server under the Community Development and Distribution License.

The fire that broke out in a &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Parisian&lt;/a&gt; building that housed black immigrants may have been caused by criminals who committed arson, authorities announced. Activist groups denounce housing and immigration policies.

In the night of August 25 to August 26, a fire broke out a run-down apartment building located at 20, Bd Vincent Auriol in Paris, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. The building housed a number of immigrant families from Africa. These families had squatted the building illegally, until the building was bought by the local government and ran through some charity; even then, the building did not respect applicable safety norms.

Experts have examined the situation. While no &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrocarbon"&gt;hydrocarbon&lt;/a&gt;s (fuel etc.) were found on the scene, the speed of the fire seems to indicate a criminal origin. For this reason, the prosecution service of Paris (♡❤parquet♡❤) opened a criminal investigation for "arson resulting in death". An &lt;a href="w%3Ainvestigating%20magistrate"&gt;investigating magistrate&lt;/a&gt; has been named. Criminals face a maximal penalty of life imprisonment, though lesser criminal qualifications may be retained during the course of the enquiry.

On Saturday 4, protests were staged denouncing the recent fires that killed black immigrant families housed in unsafe buildings. Left-wing groups such as the &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Communist%20League%20%28France%29"&gt;Revolutionary Communist League&lt;/a&gt; denounced the immigration, workforce and housing policies of the center-right government, as well as its center-left predecessor, as regressive and promoting racism.

A new study in the &lt;a href="w%3AJournal%20of%20Pediatrics"&gt;Journal of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; indicates that childhood ibuprofen-triggered asthma attacks is a health concern for many children. Although the rate of ibuprofen-sensitive asthma is low, it is a concern due to the number of children who use ibuprofen and have asthma. According to Dr. Jason Debley, more than 100,000 asthmatic children are at risk for asthma attacks brought on by ibuprofen. Debley emphasized that parents and doctors of children with asthma should be careful when administering ibuprofen.

Ibuprofen-sensitive asthma attacks have been known of for quite some time, but a study has never before measured its risks and effects. According to Debley: "Although it has been recognized for some time that (drugs like ibuprofen) can trigger...an asthma attack in some people, the prevalence of ibuprofen-sensitive asthma in children had previously not been studied in a rigorous manner."

The study was conducted in Children's Hospital in Seattle to try to determine how many asthmatic children are sensitive to ibuprofen. It was run using 100 children who have mild to moderate asthma. 

The child subjects were given either ibuprofen or a placebo in the trial. Within two hours of ibuprofen administration, four percent of the subjects exhibited decreased lung function by more than 15 percent; none of the placebo group children experienced this decrease.

Debley notes that ibuprofen should be given to children with asthma cautiously. He also warns that there may be a higher risk of decreased lung function after ibuprofen has been given to kids with more severe asthma. Parents and doctors should be aware of this and act accordingly.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Government&lt;/a&gt;'s plan for the full privatization of &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra"&gt;Telstra&lt;/a&gt;, Australia's dominant telecommunications company, received criticism leveled at the government and company by executives. The government owns 51.8%, with the remaining 48.2% of Telstra stock held by shareholders, having been partially floated in the 1990s.

&lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Burgess"&gt;Phil Burgess&lt;/a&gt;, senior executive, made comments that Telstra was "a loser" hindered by excessive regulations and that he would not recommend purchasing the shares to his mother. The government responded, with &lt;a href="w%3ATreasurer%20of%20Australia"&gt;Treasurer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; telling the Telstra management to manage the company and leave industry regulation to the government. &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; repeated those sentiments, saying Telstra's problem was government ownership over government regulation.

There are plans for introducing legislation next week which will approve the sale of the remainder of the government's share. This is the first time such legislation will have gone through the Senate with the Coalition, consisting of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; parties, controlling both the Senate and the House of Representatives. This may allow the predominantly Liberal-backed proposal to be passed. However, members of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt; have spoken out against full privatisation, citing concerns over the future of less profitable rural services. A major base of support for the National Party is in rural areas.

Two major financial institutions divested their Telstra stock as shares dropped to their lowest point since mid last year.

Over 400 have died in an outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3Aencephalitis"&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s northern state of &lt;a href="w%3AUttar%20Pradesh"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; and nearby regions, including neighbouring &lt;a href="w%3ANepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;. The actual figures are estimated to be much higher, as the current toll only takes into account those that have died at public hospitals, excluding any deaths in villages and private hospitals. A further 1500 or more are estimated to currently be hospitalised with the disease. The majority of the dead and infected are reported to be under 15.

The first cases of the disease this season were reported in late July. The disease is carried by &lt;a href="w%3Apig"&gt;pigs&lt;/a&gt;, which then migrates to humans through &lt;a href="w%3Amosquitos"&gt;mosquitos&lt;/a&gt;. The outbreak has prompted the Indian government to undertake such measures as deployment of pig catchers in seriously affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito curtains and spraying pesticides. Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine have also been promised by the government, which will help prepare health agencies for next year. Plans for vaccines to be delivered to the historically most affected areas this year were delayed due to lack of funds and low prioritisation relative to other diseases.

This is not the first time such an event has occurred. Thousands have died of the disease over the past three decades in the region. The most common period for the disease is during the monsoon season (July-September).

He was 80. Rehnquist died surrounded by friends and family in his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArlington%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Arlington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; home.

"&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Mrs. Bush&lt;/span&gt; are deeply saddened by the news," said White House counselor Dan Bartlett. "It's a tremendous loss for our nation."

Hearings for nominee &lt;a href="John%20G.%20Roberts%2C%20Jr."&gt;John G. Roberts, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; are set to begin on Tuesday, September 6, 2005.

Rehnquist first joined the Supreme Court, the highest court in the U.S., as an Associate Justice in 1972. He was elevated to the leading position of Chief Justice in 1986 and presided over the court for the next 19 years.

New Orleans' Mayor Ray Nagin is facing criticism over the evacuation of citizens before Hurricane Katrina struck.

In the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina, hundreds of buses were sitting in bus yards, some less than a mile from the Superdome. Louisiana &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Louisiana"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKathleen%20Babineaux%20Blanco"&gt;Kathleen Babineaux Blanco&lt;/a&gt; commented, "The buses could have saved an estimated 20,000 people if they had been used for emergency evacuations which President Bush had declared two days before Katrina hit.", however the evacuation was ordered by Mayor Nagin, President Bush having no direct authority to order evacuations. Thursday, after the storm, Blanco by executive order used school buses for evacuation. 

The 2000 edition of the southeast Louisiana evacuation plan on page 13, paragraph 5 states:
There were however alternative emergency plans, including ones held by state Homeland Security offices, and it is unclear which one was being operated to.

The Superdome had been opened shortly before the storm as a shelter of last resort for those who had not evacuated. As FEMA observed at that time: "Most residents have evacuated the city and those left behind do not have transportation or have special needs." Roughly 150,000 people were not evacuated from the city. During the Hurricane Ivan evacuation 600,000 people failed to evacute the city.

According to WWLTV, during a news conference on Sunday before the hurricane struck, Mayor Nagin claimed he "could and would commandeer any property or vehicle it deemed necessary to provide safe shelter or transport for those in need". However photos circulated appear to show unused school and privately owned busses left stranded in flood waters. 

It is unclear whether Mayor Nagin knew these particular buses existed, since the Orleans Parish School Board is not under his jurisdiction and his office would not normally know the location of OPSB bus yards or be able to contact the drivers of those buses to place them into service. Normally it is the job of FEMA to coordinate between the various local jurisdictions such as the OPSB and the City of New Orleans in this case. That is, under the rules of prior hurricane responses, FEMA would ask all local jurisdictions for a list of resources under their control. Then FEMA would have taken a request from Nagin for buses, relayed it to the Orleans Parish School Board or other local jurisdictions which had buses, and at that point the OPSB would have provided the buses to Nagin. That coordination did not happen here, but it is unclear whether Nagin ever made such a request prior to the hurricane and after the hurricane they were underwater and useless. 

However, if he had known about them, the declaration of a state of emergency on August 26 gave him the right under Louisiana law to commandeer them for the duration of the emergency. The failure to issue a timely evacuation order in effect made it physically impossible to evacuate the nursing homes, hospitals, and those without automobiles.
In a radio interview on WWL-AM shortly after the hurricane, Mayor Nagin said, " I need 500 buses, man. We ain't talking about -- you know, one of the briefings we had, they were talking about getting public school bus drivers to come down here and bus people out here. I'm like, "You got to be kidding me. This is a national disaster. Get every doggone Greyhound bus line in the country and get their asses moving to New Orleans." "

The death toll has risen to 16 confirmed dead and an unconfirmed number of people are injured in another fire south of &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. Investigators say the fire was caused by arson. 4 people have arrested, 3 are teenage girls (18 to 16 years old).

The fire occurred early Sunday morning in an apartment building in the southern suburb of &lt;a href="w%3Al%27Ha%C3%BF-les-Roses"&gt;l'Haÿ-les-Roses&lt;/a&gt;.

It is known that 13 people were taken to hospital with injuries. One woman was in labor and gave birth at the scene. She was then taken to hospital with her baby.

The blaze reportedly originated in the entrance hall mailboxes. The flames were put out quickly, but people died by inhaling the fumes. The problem with the fumes seems to have been compounded by a panic movement, whereby inhabitants opened doors leading to staircases &amp;mdash; enabling the fumes to fill some upper parts of the building. 

Earlier this year there were several well-publicized deadly fires in central Paris. This fire is the fourth in five months.

Since last Thursday’s surprise meeting between Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Kasuri in Istanbul, Turkey, both the governments of Israel and Pakistan at various times played up and played down the impression that full diplomatic relations, while not on the immediate horizon, were certainly on their way to development. 

Officials at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem stated that there was cautious optimism following the meeting and officials in Islamabad reiterated that any diplomatic relations with Israel were contingent on the reaching of a settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with further Israeli withdrawals from disputed territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. 

Pakistani officials, speaking on behalf of President Pervez Musharraf, have noted that Pakistan has no formal dispute with Israel and that Pakistan’s relations with the Arab world would not necessarily deteriorate should Israel-Pakistan ties develop, citing the example that the Arab world has not given Pakistan much support in the country’s dispute with India over the region of Kashmir. 

Observers note that it is in Pakistan’s interest to develop formal ties with Israel in order to improve the Pakistan’s image in Washington as well as to counter-balance Israel’s strong diplomatic and defense ties with Pakistan’s neighbor India. For its part, Israel wishes to develop and/or improve relations with Arab and Islamic countries, though Israel itself must tread carefully so as to not damage relations with New Delhi.

Pakistani passports still have the disclaimer, "Valid in all countries, except Israel".

Online money transfer company ♡❤&lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is reportedly blocking over $20,000 in donations from the website ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASomething%20Awful"&gt;Something Awful&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, donations intended for the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Red%20Cross"&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; hurricane Katrina relief efforts. &lt;a href="w%3ARich%20Kyanka"&gt;Rich Kyanka&lt;/a&gt;, founder of ♡❤Something Awful♡❤, reports that the account he set up for Red Cross donations has been suspended by the ♡❤&lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;♡❤-owned subsidiary due to "suspicious behavior". 

According to Kyanka, ♡❤PayPal♡❤ is requesting "proof of delivery", even though there is no item being purchased and the account was set up to accept donations. The account remains frozen. Kyanka is attempting to solve the problem by faxing various documents to ♡❤PayPal♡❤ in order to prove the legitimacy of the drive. 

According to recent updates posted on the ♡❤Something Awful♡❤ website, Kyanka was requesting that refunds were issued for all donations that were sent. According to Kyanka, the account was frozen because ♡❤PayPal♡❤ has no link with the Red Cross. 

A solution proposed by ♡❤PayPal♡❤ was to have all donations go to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Way"&gt;United Way&lt;/a&gt;. While initially accepting offer, Kyanka reconsidered when ♡❤Something Awful♡❤ readers objected to having their donation sent to the United Way &amp;mdash; partly due to the organizations troubled past. Instead of the ♡❤PayPal♡❤ donation setup, Kyanka has requested that readers send any donations directly to the Red Cross.

♡❤Something Awful♡❤, despite being a humor website, has a history of running donation drives for certain causes, including purchasing ballistic chest plates and body armor for a platoon in the US Army's 25th Infantry Division during the 2003 &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;. The ♡❤Something Awful♡❤ webservers are located in New Orleans where Hurricane Katrina hit.

Tropical storm Maria intensified and became the season's fifth &lt;a href="hurricane"&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, September 4. The hurricane is currently growing stronger in the warm waters of the open &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

According to ♡❤MSNBC News♡❤, at 5 AM EDT the hurricane had a maximum sustained wind of 75 MPH, which barely qualifies for category 1 hurricane status, and was centered 256 miles southeast of &lt;a href="Bermuda"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;. Currently it is moving north-northwest and is predicted to turn northward late Sunday or early Monday. Hurricane specialist Stacy Stewart believes that should the hurricane continue on its predicted route, "Maria should remain well to the east of Bermuda and only pose a threat to shipping interests.”

This hurricane does not appear to pose a threat comparable to the current major &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; disaster, &lt;a href="Hurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, as it is expected to move soon into cooler Atlantic waters, which will sap much of its strength.

Maria is the 13th named storm of the hurricane season, far surpassing the typical 4 or 5 named storms at this time of year. The season runs from June 1 to November 30.

&lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; continued his hospital stay Tuesday in what a government spokesperson describes as favorable conditions. Chirac was admitted on Friday to a military hospital in central Paris, where doctors called his condition a "small vascular incident" that hindered his vision. 

Doctors report such a problem as he was having could range from a ruptured blood vessel to a stroke, since more than 80% of strokes are caused by blockage in an artery carrying blood to the brain. The problem reddened and bothered the eyesight of the 72-year-old Chirac.

Chirac was scheduled to meet with &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, but was forced to cancel. Anne Robert, a military physician speaking on behalf of the military health services, said the president was resting and expects to leave the hospital in a few days.

The head of the President's political party claims that nobody would stop Chirac in his quest for the presidency two years from now.

Chirac's wife was spotted leaving the &lt;a href="w%3AVal-de-Gr%C3%A2ce"&gt;Val-de-Grâce&lt;/a&gt; hospital where Chirac is being treated, but she refused to speak with reporters. It has been heard from French radio reports that she had just returned from a holiday in southeast France, trying to hide the fact that she was terribly concerned about her husband's current condition.

Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin reports upon spending about an hour visiting Chirac, he was in "good form." The Prime Minister also reports "he can't wait to leave," to reporters afterward visiting the French president.

Controversy has erupted in the French press about the initial secrecy surrounding this hospital visit, and whether the health bulletins published are reliable information. It is in particular suggested that the health bulletins are written by the president's staff, then signed by medical staff --- if only because French law prevents physicians from discussing the state of their patients except with these patients or their close family.

On Sunday, the country of &lt;a href="w%3AKuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt; pledged US$500 million in oil products and other aid to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; relief efforts. It is the single largest donation given to help the victims of hurricane Katrina. 

Energy Minister Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah explained, "The humanitarian aid is oil products that the devastated (U.S.) states need in these circumstances, plus other humanitarian aid to lessen the devastation these three states have been subjected to."

Al Sabah also stated that "It's our duty as Kuwaitis to stand by our friends to lighten the humanitarian misery and as a payback for the many situations during which Washington helped us through the significant relations between the two friendly countries." Kuwait is in fact one of the U.S.'s strongest allies in the Middle East, due to the U.S. protection of Kuwait in 1991 during the &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20war"&gt;Gulf War&lt;/a&gt;.

Kuwait's donation was followed by a $100 million donation from &lt;a href="w%3AQatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, a small, U.S. friendly peninsula jutting out into the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20sea"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt;. 

These donations were brought on as the 22 members of &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20league"&gt;Arab League&lt;/a&gt; (based in Egypt) asked Arab countries to donate to the Katrina relief efforts, and sent their deepest condolences to the U.S.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The Post Office and Vote Buying parliamentary commissions of investigation unanimously approved on Thursday (1) their first joint preliminary report of activities. The text was prepared by their redactors, Osmar Serraglio (&lt;a href="w%3A/Party%20of%20the%20Brazilian%20Democratic%20Movement"&gt;PMDB&lt;/a&gt;) and Ibrahim Abi-Ackel (&lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;PP&lt;/a&gt;), from Post Office and Vote Buying commissions respectively.

The deputies cited in the report are: Carlos Rodrigues (&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;PL&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro%20%28state%29"&gt;RJ&lt;/a&gt;), José Janene (PP-&lt;a href="w%3AParan%C3%A1"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;), Pedro Correia (PP-&lt;a href="w%3APernambuco"&gt;PE&lt;/a&gt;), Pedro Henry (PP-&lt;a href="w%3AMato%20Grosso%20do%20Sul"&gt;MS&lt;/a&gt;), Sandro Mabel (PL-&lt;a href="w%3AGoi%C3%A1s"&gt;GO&lt;/a&gt;), João Magno (&lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;PT&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMinas%20Gerais"&gt;MG&lt;/a&gt;), João Paulo Cunha (PT-&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;SP&lt;/a&gt;), José Borba (PMDB-PR), Josias Gomes da Silva (PT-&lt;a href="w%3ABahia"&gt;BA&lt;/a&gt;), Paulo Rocha (PT-BA), Professor Luizinho (PT-SP), Romeu Queiroz (&lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Labour%20Party"&gt;PTB&lt;/a&gt;-MG), Vadão Gomes (PP-SP), Vanderval Santos (PL-SP), José Mentor (PT-SP), Roberto Brant (&lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20the%20Liberal%20Front%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;PFL&lt;/a&gt;-MG), José Dirceu (PT-SP) and Roberto Jefferson (PTB-RJ).

The report indicts 18 Brazilian deputies and the former deputy Valdemar Costa Neto [who resigned on August 1]. They are accused of illegal campaign finance activities, of placing cronies in strategic positions in government enterprises and getting kickbacks from them, and of receiving cash payments in exchange for voting in line with the government in the Brazilian Congress.

The redactors called the allegation made by some parliamentarians that the resources were used to settle debts with electoral campaigns a "lame excuse". According to them it is "perfectly plausible" that the loans taken by the businessman Marcos Valerio at the Banco Rural and the BMG for the ruling &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (PT) were false and created to make the illegal funds seem legal. 

In regards to the denunciations done by deputy &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Jefferson"&gt;Roberto Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; (PTB) the report says:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Everything which he said that could be investigated showed to be true, including confessions against himself .
BULLET::::- Everything that must be compared to other testimonies showed a great degree of truth. As a matter of fact, all of who, hurriedly, questioned him, saw their defenses collapse, before the successive discoveries.

</ul>
According to the report, the businessman Marcos Valério is a not reliable person because of his contraditory testmonies.

The report says that several documents were identified and reviewed proving that large sums of money were withdrawn from agencies of the Rural Bank, in &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABelo%20Horizonte"&gt;Belo Horizonte&lt;/a&gt;, as well as from bank accounts of the enterprises SMPB and DNA Propaganda. According to the documents the beneficiaries were federal deputies who received the money in person or through relatives, advisers, or persons nominated by Marcos Valério.

The report affirms that it is possible that some payments were made on a monthly basis, and others more or less frequently. Nevertheless, according to the report the periodicity of the payments is the less important fact.

At least 200 New Orleans law officers have left the force following the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina. Some had notified their superiors, but others did not. A few officers simply threw their badges out the window and attempted to drive a squad car to northern Louisiana after the storm. 

Some of the reasons given were because of lack of support from the local government in dealing with the crisis, others such as psychological problems with being in armed confrontation with people foraging for food and water in a desperate situation, where they were left alone but called looters and thugs by the authorities if they helped themselves, and losing their own families might have driven at least two officers to commit suicide. 

Reports are that some officers resorted to using their own personal firearms because of the severe equipment shortage, even before the coastal region was devastated by the hurricane. The morale of the police force, which has dealt with the highest number of murders per capita in the United States, is not a new issue. This natural disaster may have exacerbated long-standing tensions in the force that were already present.

German chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ASPD"&gt;SPD&lt;/a&gt;) and the Chair of the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (CDU), &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;, faced each other on Sunday evening in the first and only debate between them in this &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20federal%20election%2C%202005"&gt;election campaign&lt;/a&gt;.

The 90-minute long program, simulcasted on Germany's four major TV stations, focused on employment, taxation and social reforms. 

Merkel stated that she wants to reduce the taxation on gasoline to ease the high price Germans have to pay at the pump. Schröder responded that the &lt;a href="w%3AVAT"&gt;VAT&lt;/a&gt;-increase that the CDU is planning would neutralize that effect and that his government hadn't increased gasoline taxes since 2003.

The chancellor went on to blast Merkel's designate Finance minister &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Kirchhof"&gt;Paul Kirchhof&lt;/a&gt;, a proponent of a &lt;a href="w%3Aflat%20tax"&gt;flat tax&lt;/a&gt; on income. He said that Kirchhof's suggestions would turn Germans into "guinea pigs". But Merkel called Kirchhof a "visionary" and said her party would make taxation "easier and more just". 

Speaking of employment, Schröder stated that his reforms are beginning to work and that he is on the right track. Merkel referred to five million unemployed Germans and said that seven years of Schröder government were "bad years for Germany".

Polls conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3AARD"&gt;ARD&lt;/a&gt; after the debate show that 49% of Germans believe that Schröder was "more convincing" while 33% think that Merkel was. The &lt;a href="w%3AZDF"&gt;ZDF&lt;/a&gt; said that 48% of the population think Schröder performed better, while 28% say the same about Merkel.
However, overall polls conducted by the ARD as well, say that Schröder's SPD can expect 32% in the upcoming federal election, his current coalition partner, &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20%2790/The%20Greens"&gt;the Greens&lt;/a&gt;, 7%. Merkel's CDU, along with its bavarian sister party &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Social%20Union%20in%20Bavaria"&gt;CSU&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand is projected to get 43%, which would enable them to form a coalition government with the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Germany%29"&gt;FDP&lt;/a&gt;, which stands at 6%. Their majority however is slim, because the newly formed Party of the Left can expect 9%.

<h1>U.S. classifies record number of documents in 2004</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20classifies%20record%20number%20of%20documents%20in%202004&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="http%3A//Openthegovernment.org"&gt;OpenTheGovernment.Org&lt;/a&gt;, a coalition of conservative and liberal nonprofit groups, released a 2005 report (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.openthegovernment.org/otg/SRC2005_embargoed.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;, 12 pages) saying that all branches of the U.S. Federal Government are being significantly more secretive, and spending significantly more money on document secrecy. In 2004, federal officials &lt;a href="w%3AClassified%20information"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; 15.6 million new documents, which is 81 percent more than in 2001. Over the same period, the cost of classifying those new documents rose from $4.7 billion to $7.2 billion. These figures do not include documents classified by the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;, as that agency's information is itself secret.

The report is also critical of the fact that only $48.3 million was spent on declassifying old documents in 2004. They concluded that for every dollar spent on declassification, the federal officials spent $148 creating and storing new secrets, more than in any previous year. It is estimated to cost $460 to classify one document.

The state secrets privilege allows the executive branch to classify federal court hearings and documents. On average, the Bush administration has used this privilege 33 times more per year than cold war administrations (1953-1976), and nearly three times the 1977-2001 average. The report sees other measures of government secrecy, such as the number of secret patents on the rise as well.

The report does not explore the larger economic impact of the increase in secrecy per se. However, it observes that taxpayer savings due to &lt;a href="w%3Awhistleblower"&gt;whistleblower&lt;/a&gt; activity is on the rise despite the elimination of traditional whistleblower protections.

It also notes that 64% of advisory meetings were closed to the public. Such meetings provide lawmakers with advice on scientific and technical matters which are supposed to be free of special interest. Legislation covering such meetings states or assumes that they are open to the public, but some agencies, like the Department of Defense, have traditionally been permitted to hold closed meetings. Once such agencies are excluded, the report finds a threefold increase in closed meetings since 2001.

The report is critical of poor funding for processing &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt; (FOIA) requests, with which the majority of federal agencies surveyed can not keep up. There is concern that more of the financial burden for such requests may be being born by those organizations making the requests, instead of the agencies holding the classified documents. FOIA requests increased by 25% between 2003 and 2004, to 4 million, while funding for processing such requests increased by only 5%. 

How much of this secrecy directly relates to various current events, such as the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20in%20Iraq"&gt;War in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, is unclear. In 2004, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Foreign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Court"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court&lt;/a&gt; approved 1,754 requests from law enforcement officials last year to conduct surveillance on foreign nationals within the United States, double the number issued four years ago.

The report is also critical of the rise of "sensitive but unclassified" information, as well as new state based secrecy initiatives.

Talks between the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Trade%20and%20Industry"&gt;Trade Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Mandelson"&gt;Peter Mandelson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; Commerce Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABo%20Xilai"&gt;Bo Xilai&lt;/a&gt;, held today in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, brought no compromise on unblocking 80 milion pieces of Chinese textiles impounded in the EU.

The clothing is held in European warehouses due to overshoot of the China-to-the-EU export &lt;a href="w%3Aquotas"&gt;quotas&lt;/a&gt;. In June, the EU member states agreed to raise the limit by approximately 10%, but EU importers and Chinese producers continue to push for a greater amount of trade.

Concerns on textiles imported from Asia have split the EU countries: those with strong retail sector support increasing the quotas, while others, which have large clothing industries (&lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;) want to keep, or even reduce, limits in the future.

A similar dispute exists between China and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. On Friday, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s administration announced new quotas on imports of Chinese bras and synthetic fabric, after negotiations between both countries broke down.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s Federal Minister for Health, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt;, has made a number of comments about the previous New South Wales &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Australian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Brogden"&gt;John Brogden&lt;/a&gt;, who recently &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Liberal%20leader%20attempts%20suicide"&gt;attempted suicide&lt;/a&gt;, which have been widely thought to be inappropriate.

Abbott is reported to have made comments such as "If we did that, we would be as dead as the former Liberal leader's political prospects" and "Whenever you hear that David Clarke is doing bad things, you know he is really doing a great job", referring to the factional leader claimed to have led the campaign against Brogden. The comments were made at a party function approximately twelve hours after Brogden's suicide attempt. Abbott is also reported to have said "I just want to make it clear I have never told an inappropriate joke, I've never pinched a woman on the backside and I never make inappropriate gestures to women" at a Kenthurst Liberal Party branch meeting, in reference to Brogden's reported behaviour at a function approximately two months ago.

There have been calls for Abbott to resign or be sacked by Prime Minister John Howard from some sectors, such as persons involved in mental health care, as well as the Federal Opposition. They claim that the comments show that Abbott is not mindful of mental health issues when they should be foremost in his mind.

The comments were first raised with Abbott by the ABC ♡❤Insiders♡❤ program yesterday. He confirmed that he had made the remarks and offered to apologize "if anyone is upset", and later that day made such an apology. The extent of the apology was criticised in the House of Representatives in Federal Parliament that day, with Julia Gillard, the Shadow Health Minister, calling it "half-arsed" during debate on a motion to censure the minister for his comments. The motion was rejected as the Liberal/National coalition form Government federally.

There is suspicion that the tipoff about Abbott's comments was made by a member of the left-wing faction of the Liberal party, of which Brogden was a member, as a form of payback against members of the right-wing faction, of which Tony Abbott is a member. The Liberal right are said to have been involved in the campaign against Brogden.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Brogden"&gt;John Brogden&lt;/a&gt; was found to have attempted suicide in his electoral office late on the night of August 30, after he resigned due to heavy media criticism of comments he had made against the previous Government premier &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Carr"&gt;Bob Carr&lt;/a&gt;'s wife, &lt;a href="w%3AHelena%20Carr"&gt;Helena Carr&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Brogden called her a "mail-order bride". 

He was rushed to a North Shore hospital. Carr, who originally had stated he did not accept Brogden's earlier apology, later capitulated, stating that his wife had asked to forgive him. 

It was also argued whether &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph%20%28Australia%29"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, which was aiming to release new allegations of sexual harassment after Brogden had resigned, played any part in the suicide attempt. Many in the community, such as Rod Tiffen of the University of Sydney, on ABC Radio National's ♡❤The Media Report♡❤ had decried tabloid journalism and the ♡❤Telegraph♡❤ for "only wait[ing] till the man's down before they start kicking" with allegations that were found to be unsourced, whilst the editor of the ♡❤Telegraph♡❤, David Penberthy, claimed that they were only acting in their duty to publish what they had discovered, and said that "to say that [Brogden's attempt] is our fault off the basis of one story is I think, just fatuous."

One political editor, Andrew West, for ♡❤The Australian♡❤, a publication produced by the same company that owns ♡❤The Daily Telegraph♡❤, resigned over the placement of his byline on a story where he said he only produced a memo noting the unreliability of the sources for a similar story that the ♡❤Telegraph♡❤ were to publish.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; police shot eight armed gunmen on the &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3Dnew%2Borleans%26amp%3Bll%3D30.008147%2C-90.027058%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.005852%2C0.010131%26amp%3Bt%3De%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;Danziger Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, according to a police statement, after contractors crossing the bridge came under fire. The police claim they shot at eight people carrying guns on the bridge. This comes as Mayor Robin Nagin began to turn the city over to state and federal control.

The fourteen contractors were en route to launch barges into &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Pontchartrain"&gt;Lake Pontchartrain&lt;/a&gt; in order to fix the break in the 17th Street Canal when, according to police, the gunmen opened fire on the group.

Deputy Police Chief W.J. Riley said police shot at eight people carrying guns, killing five or six. None of the contractors were killed.

However, according to foreign sources, the five killed were contractors for the Army.

In a unreleated incident, a civilian helicopter crashed near the Danziger Bridge. The two passengers on board escaped with only minor cuts and scrapes.

The Danziger Bridge spans a canal which connects Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Energy%20Board"&gt;Alberta Energy and Utilities Board&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, will increase oil output by between 18,000 and 30,000 barrels a day to help the U.S. in the wake of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. This is being done by temporarily suspending limits on oil production. The increase was requested by &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta's&lt;/a&gt; Premier, &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Klein"&gt;Ralph Klein&lt;/a&gt;.

The comparatively small size of the increase has led industry analyst Peter Linder to call the increase "more of a token gesture" and a "drop in the bucket" by comparison to normal production levels.

The increase in production levels is temporary, but no date has been set for when the output levels might again be capped. Analysts say that 10% of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20States%20%28US%29"&gt;Gulf States&lt;/a&gt;' oil production was affected by the hurricane.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKnoxville%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Knoxville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
About 140 mostly weak or ailing victims of the hurricane ravaged city of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; were flown here Saturday by a volunteer crew on a flight chartered by former United States Vice President &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Gore"&gt;Albert Gore&lt;/a&gt;.

The victims were greeted by Knoxville's mayor, many medical professionals, and other volunteers helping them board buses destined to area hospitals. There they were to be assessed and sent to a local &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; shelter.

Although Gore was present on the flight and assisted moving the passengers to the waiting buses, he "declined to take credit for the airlift, fearing it would be 'politicized.'"&lt;a href="http%3A//www.knoxnews.com/kns/local_news/article/0%2C1406%2CKNS_347_4054083%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; An associate of Gore who assisted in the project, Dr. Anderson Spickard, said that although Gore chartered the flight, "we'll decide who pays for it later."

Spickard also remarked that originally the plane was to take two flights that day, but flight delays forestalled that plan. The plane will leave Knoxville Saturday evening, he said, to make another aid flight on Sunday.

A &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt; jetliner operated by low-cost airline &lt;a href="w%3AMandala%20Airlines"&gt;Mandala&lt;/a&gt; crashed approximately one minute after taking off from &lt;a href="w%3A%20Polonia%20International%20Airport"&gt;Polonia International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in the Indonesian city of &lt;a href="w%3AMedan%2C%20Indonesia"&gt;Medan&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. 

The airport is surrounded by a very densely-populated residential area. Local TV showed images of dozens of homes and cars destroyed by the impact.

Reports are still varying on the number of fatalities within the plane. 14-16 people sitting in the rear of the plane survived. 47 people on the ground and 101-103 of the 117 people aboard were killed.

The Boeing 737 plane was nearly 25 years old, but was not due to be retired for another 11 years. It received a full service in June this year.

It has been reported that the flight, bound for Jakarta, was carrying several local politicians, including Rizal Nurdin, the governor of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sumatra"&gt;North Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, and one of his predecessors.

After &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; passed across the United States, various artists and &lt;a href="w%3ACelebrity"&gt;media stars&lt;/a&gt; have leapt at a call to action.

&lt;a href="John%20Travolta"&gt;John Travolta&lt;/a&gt; and wife &lt;a href="w%3AKelly%20Preston"&gt;Kelly Preston&lt;/a&gt; flew his private plane to deliver a load of supplies and tetanus vaccine to Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Part of a &lt;a href="Scientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; project which has been using their non-massage "assists", in an interview Preston mentioned that "auditing" had also been performed on victims.

&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Smith"&gt;Kevin Smith&lt;/a&gt; is holding an online auction on his Web site.

&lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Penn"&gt;Sean Penn&lt;/a&gt; actually went to Louisiana. After loading down a small boat with his entourage, it was discovered one of them had neglected to seal a hole in the bottom. Penn was wearing a white vest rather than a life vest while bailing. After the motor wouldn't start, the crew paddled down a flooded New Orleans street. Bystanders jeered at whether any victims could fit aboard the crowded craft. No report on rescue stunts. Local authorities had previously been criticized for not allowing volunteer boaters in to help.

&lt;a href="w%3AMorgan%20Freeman"&gt;Morgan Freeman&lt;/a&gt;, whose home fared well, is organizing an online auction of celebrity items at charityfolks.com, to benefit the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Red%20Cross"&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; Disaster Relief Fund.

&lt;a href="w%3ACurt%20Schilling"&gt;Curt Schilling&lt;/a&gt; opened his home to a family of nine driven out of their New Orleans home. The Schilling family will provide housing for the Fields for a year while their home in New Orleans is rebuilt and repaired.

Some celebrities "graced" disaster zones with their presence in the days following Katrina.

Singer &lt;a href="w%3AMacy%20Gray"&gt;Macy Gray&lt;/a&gt; and television personality &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20McGraw"&gt;Phil McGraw&lt;/a&gt; visited Houston's Astrodome.

Celebrities visiting New Orleans include &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Moore"&gt;Michael Moore&lt;/a&gt; (opposite side of lake), singer &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Connick%2C%20Jr."&gt;Harry Connick, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, CNN's &lt;a href="w%3AAnderson%20Cooper"&gt;Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, actor &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Foxx"&gt;Jamie Foxx&lt;/a&gt;, singer &lt;a href="w%3AFaith%20Hill"&gt;Faith Hill&lt;/a&gt;, actor &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20McConaughey"&gt;Matthew McConaughey&lt;/a&gt;, singer &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20Marie%20Presley"&gt;Lisa Marie Presley&lt;/a&gt;, comedian &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Rock"&gt;Chris Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and ♡❤The Oprah Winfrey Show♡❤ contributor &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20Ling"&gt;Lisa Ling&lt;/a&gt; and interior decorator &lt;a href="w%3ANate%20Berkus"&gt;Nate Berkus&lt;/a&gt;.

A retired United States Army Special Forces soldier, Michael Barnett (known on the Internet as ♡❤♡Interdictor♡❤♡), has been blogging the way of Katrina since 27 August 2005, when he threw out the single tongue-in-cheek line, "This could actually be a nasty storm." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.livejournal.com/users/interdictor/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Barnett apparently gathered a team of unknown size -- between five and ten persons, based upon his blog material -- to "hole up" in the tenth and eleventh floors of 650 Poydras, where he worked as the head crisis manager for DirectNIC, an information technology company.

With primary sources such as cellular telephone conversations with civilians from the convention centre and an in-person conversation with a cop they took in, Outpost Crystal (the group is being run with an efficient military mindset and the base is named after Inderdictor's fiancee) is rapidly becoming a prime source for information at less than an arm's distance.

&lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; has relieved from power Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the head of the Russian navy. This comes a month after an incident where 7 Russian sailors became trapped in a submarine, and had to be rescued with help from abroad.

No reason was given for Kuroyedov's dismissal, although Admiral Eduard Baltin speculated on Moscow Radio that it may be because of the navy chief's poor health. According to Reuters, he told Ekho Moskvy: "He has been lying in hospital for two months, he had a complicated operation."

Admiral Kuroyedov was in charge of the navy during the Kursk disaster of 2000, in which 118 sailors died when their submarine sank. Kuroyedov is being replaced by Vladimir Masorin, who was previously serving as the Chief of staff for the Russian Navy.

In remarks Putin made about this leadership change and referring to Masorin, he said "The recent exercises, including those I have attended, show that the navy is developing and that is certainly your merit to a large extent." Putin also added "at the same time, there were difficult events, tragedies, but I would like to underline once again that with all these problems, all these tragedies, the main thing is that the Navy is undergoing a revival."

Masorin added while in a hall at the Admiralty, "One thing is clear — to continue in the condition which we are in and do nothing is simply not possible. I have been given the task of stopping the navy shaking public opinion. I am not experiencing euphoria at being appointed head of the navy. I understand the level of responsibility on my shoulders."

&lt;a href="w%3ASharman%20Networks"&gt;Sharman Networks&lt;/a&gt;, owner of the popular &lt;a href="w%3AKazaa"&gt;Kazaa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apeer-to-peer"&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;/a&gt; software, lost against a coalition of record labels in an &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Court%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian federal court&lt;/a&gt;. The court ruled that Kazaa infringed on artists' copyright and facilitated piracy. The list of plaintiffs included &lt;a href="w%3AEMI"&gt;EMI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASony%20BMG"&gt;Sony BMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWarner"&gt;Warner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFestival%20Mushroom"&gt;Festival Mushroom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal"&gt;Universal&lt;/a&gt;. 

The court has ordered Sharman to modify the software within two months to prevent further piracy. While this order is only valid in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Sharman is incorporated in the country and thus the effect of the ruling will be felt in the peer to peer community worldwide. Sharman was also ordered to pay 90% of the plaintiff's legal fees, with damages to be considered at a later date. Sharman has said it will appeal.

It is unclear whether this will have a significant effect on preventing piracy in the music industry. Surveys have shown that users have already abandoned Kazaa, which used to be the dominant peer to peer program used for sharing files, in favour of newer networks such as &lt;a href="w%3AEDonkey%20Network"&gt;eDonkey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt;. This trend amongst users was also observed to happen with &lt;a href="w%3AGrokster"&gt;Grokster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANapster"&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt;, two legacy peer-to-peer networks which faced similar suits.

This is not the first case in which Sharman has had to defend itself: in a related case in the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; which concluded two months ago, the court ruled that file sharing networks could be held responsible for the actions of their users in some circumstances. This may have influenced this most recent case, where the court found the Kazaa website encouraged visitors to feel 'cool' about breaking copyright law and downloading illegal music.

Kazaa, or other versions of it, has been estimated to be installed on up to 300 million computers worldwide.

<h1>Islamic political party seeks registration in Australia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Islamic%20political%20party%20seeks%20registration%20in%20Australia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A political party has formed in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; to represent &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt;. The Best Party of Allah issued a press release on September 5 announcing that they would seek registration in the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt;. The president and founder of the party, Mr Kurt Kennedy, said that the party will respect the laws of Australia, but will also be seeking to implement laws that are consistent with the teachings of Allah. 

"We acknowledge that as Australian citizens, we will abide by its civil laws and the rule of law. And as Believers in Allah we also have a commitment to the rule of Allah's laws in our personal lives," Mr Kennedy said.

"These laws are found in the Noble Qur'an and on the whole are not inconsistent with the best laws that Australian parliaments has to offer," he added. 

The party is seeking registration in the ACT, however Mr Kennedy said that its goal is to be registered at the national level. The press release said that Australia's 500,000 Muslims were enough to elect four members to the Federal Parliament. 

Mr Kennedy said that he was inspired to form the new party after the emergence of Christian parties such as &lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20First"&gt;Family First&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr Kennedy explicitly rejected extremism. 

"We totally reject people who would kill people indiscriminately, you know, as violence for its own sake and that's the story, that's the end of it," he said.

The party's &lt;a href="http%3A//freedom.homemail.com.au/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; reveals that it is opposed to the invasion and occupation of &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, of which Australia took part. 

"See how Iraq and Afghanistan were invaded and occupied because they were weak countries with substantial resources? The invaders gave the reason for invasion based on a fear of emerging Islamic militancy but were actually based on greed for oil and greed for markets," the website said. 

The registration has been reported as far away as Iran, appearing on the Iranian Quran News Agency website.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=President%20Bush%20nominates%20John%20Roberts%20as%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20U.S.&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In a statement made at approximately 12:00 UTC Monday, U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; nominated &lt;a href="John%20G.%20Roberts"&gt;Judge John G. Roberts, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Chief Justice of the United States&lt;/a&gt; to succeed the late &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20H.%20Rehnquist"&gt;William H. Rehnquist&lt;/a&gt;.

Bush said that it is in the best interest of the nation that Roberts will be confirmed by the U.S. Senate within one month, before the Supreme Court reconvenes. He said "It is fitting that a great chief justice be followed in office by a person who shared his deep reverence for the Constitution, his profound respect for the Supreme Court and his complete devotion to the cause of justice."
Roberts went on to reply, saying, "I am honored and humbled by the confidence that the president had shown in me, and I'm very much aware that, if I am confirmed, I would succeed a man that I deeply respect and admire, a man who has been very kind to me for 25 years." Roberts had been a law clerk in the U.S. Supreme Court working directly for William Rehnquist during 1980 and 1981.

Before this nomination Roberts was due to fill the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociate%20Justice"&gt;Associate Justice&lt;/a&gt; slot left vacant by &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;'s retirement. Bush now must consider other candidates for nomination as Associate Justice.

Roberts is considered to have largely conservative views and faced resistance during his nomination to succeed O'Connor from Civil rights groups like the &lt;a href="w%3AACLU"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANAACP"&gt;NAACP&lt;/a&gt; and pro-choice organizations like &lt;a href="w%3ANARAL"&gt;NARAL&lt;/a&gt;, which sponsored an ad against his nomination and had to retract it due to the liability for some of the claims they were making of him supporting terrorists.

Roberts' confirmation is set to begin next Monday.

It is suspected that with the Republican Senate, the Democrats will need an extensive &lt;a href="w%3AFilibuster"&gt;filibuster&lt;/a&gt; if they want to prevent Roberts' confirmation.

&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; has been lashed relentlessly by &lt;a href="w%3ATyphoon%20Nabi"&gt;Typhoon Nabi&lt;/a&gt;, with nine meter high waves and torrential downpours. It had been classified as a &lt;a href="w%3ASaffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale"&gt;Category 4&lt;/a&gt; storm, the same strength as the recent &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, but was later downgraded to Category 3.

Flood warnings were issued from north &lt;a href="w%3AOkinawa"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. Rain amounts were predicted to be greater than 19 inches (483 millimeters) for &lt;a href="w%3AKyushu"&gt;Kyushu&lt;/a&gt;, Japan's third largest island, and some areas may receive as much as 1 to 2 inches of rain per hour. "Water was almost reaching the second floor. I was really frightened," said a woman in her 50s. 

The typhoon knocked power and water out for thousands of homes and has so far claimed two lives, including one man struck by &lt;a href="w%3Alightning"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;. Over 500 people were evacuated on the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Mariana%20Islands"&gt;Northern Mariana Islands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASaipan"&gt;Saipan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATinian"&gt;Tinian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARota%20%28island%29"&gt;Rota&lt;/a&gt;.

Nabi is expected to swerve eastward over the next 24 hours and is likely to continue battering much of Japan and the southern and eastern parts of South Korea.

On Monday, a helicopter accidentally dropped a concrete block weighing nearly 1,500 pounds when it was flying it up to an &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n mountain for a "ski resort construction project". The concrete block struck a cable holding a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agondola%20lift"&gt;gondola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the one that suffered all of the casualties, although other gondolas reported people suffering injuries from the jolt. The car that was hit fell quite some distance to the ground, up to hundreds of meters. Two more cars started tilting as some people were flung out from these cars. 

A least nine people are reported to be killed in the incidents. There are also many injured, some of them seriously. Up to a dozen rescue helicopters immediately rushed to the scene from all over the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASwiss%20alps"&gt;Swiss alps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The work was made to make the infrastructure more secure after an incident that happened when a low-flying US marine plane cut through a cable killing 20 people in 1998. This incident will bring into question if those policies saved lives or need to be recast in light of this tragedy.

The nations hard hit by last year's devastating &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; are now lending advice to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on how to cope with the &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt; crisis. 

Nopadol Somboonsub, the head of tsunami corpse identification in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; noted that the U.S. needs to "...examine the bodies slowly and put all the data into a computer," and added that "It's very important to get it right. You cannot assume that this or that body is the right body simply because a relative identified it." 

Somboonsub noted that life insurance and identity theft fraud are all matters to consider when dealing with body identification. Somboonsub speaks from a position of experience, his team having dealt with the identities of 5,395 corpses of various ethnicities in Thailand.

In &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; too, experts have advice for the U.S. For instance, one unnamed Indian official said that nations should not be arrogant when it comes to handling disasters. He also stated that "In India, for all its vastness, we have a very easily operable contingency plan for disasters at the grassroots level. It is not a highly complicated national response system."

He emphasized that relief is most important on the local level: "A person at the grassroots level knows that sandbags have to be organized, identifies likely places of breaches, plans clearing debris and setting up relief camps and cooking centers."

In &lt;a href="w%3AAceh"&gt;Aceh&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, Budi Atmadi, head of relief operations, said that humanitarian concerns must come first.

"In that period, the blame game is rampant because one person will always say the relief has been slow while another says there are so many limitations. The blame game will always be there so your ears need to be thick," Atmadi stated, along with "The important thing is to stay committed and put humanitarian concerns at the top."

The United States has so far only accepted help from other countries in the form of monetary aid and oil.

Seven paratroopers accused of beating three Iraqis&amp;mdash;one to death&amp;mdash;are now standing trial in &lt;a href="w%3AEssex"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

On May 11, 2003 a part of a platoon of the 3rd Battalion Parachute Regiment visited a "small southern Iraqi village". They pursued and stopped a white Toyota truck driven by Athar Finnjan Saddam who, along with 18-year-old Nadhem Abdullah, was taken out of the truck and thrown to the ground. It is at this time that the paratroopers allegedly began beating both men brutally without provocation.

Dalal Sadaam, a female relative who had just given birth, attempted to stop the violence only to be assaulted herself by the butt of a rifle to the mouth. A woman who was pregnant at the time in the vehicle shouted for the soldiers to stop. After the soldiers left, the other victims took Abdullah to a doctor. The doctor sent him to a hospital, but he died en route.

Only two of the paratroopers even recalled the incident months later, but evidence of the victim's blood has been found on at least one of the soldier's guns. Eyewitnesses were mostly illiterate &lt;a href="w%3AMarsh%20Arab"&gt;Marsh Arab&lt;/a&gt;s who have had trouble understanding the interviewer's questions but have been cooperating fully. 

A price of about £2 million is currently being attached to the cost of the trial in the UK; however, the family of the victim may be able to extract civil damages from the UK in the emerging Iraqi judicial system.

Over the summer a customized distribution of the &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="w%3AGNU/Linux%20naming%20controversy"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt;) operating system was installed on 2,460 desktops in the &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Tyrol"&gt;South Tyrol&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href="w%3ATrentino-Alto%20Adige"&gt;Bolzano&lt;/a&gt;. This deployment included all 70 of the province's private and public schools and affects more than 16,000 students.

The distribution installed, FUSS Soledad GNU/Linux, is a customized version of the popular &lt;a href="w%3ADebian%20GNU/Linux"&gt;Debian GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; distribution. FUSS Soledad GNU/Linux has multi-language support and uses the &lt;a href="w%3AGNOME"&gt;GNOME desktop environment&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition to the desktops in the schools, more than 20,000 &lt;a href="w%3ALiveCD"&gt;LiveCDs&lt;/a&gt; are scheduled to be created and given free of charge to the students and their families. These LiveCDs allow students to use the same software on their home computers that they are going to use at school.

Project co-director Antonio Russo said, "With the participation of all the public and private schools, this will give to all the students, families, teachers, and operators from the educational world the opportunity to use a entirely free operating system, both at school and at home."

The switch was funded by the province of Bolzano, the European Social Fund, and the Center for Professional Formation in Italian Language.

&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; agreed to unblock 80 million pieces of Chinese textiles impounded at European ports. The deal was announced during a one-day EU&amp;ndash;China summit in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, prime minister of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently holds the EU presidency, and Chinese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the agreement, 50% of the impounded clothing will be allowed into the EU unconditionally, while the rest will be counted against 2006 quotas.

Today's deal ended the so-called European&amp;ndash;Chinese "bra wars", which have split the EU member states: those with a strong retail sector support the agreement, while those with large clothing industries want to set up a protectionist policy against China.

The agreement now must be approved by the 25 EU members.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%2C%20Japan"&gt;Tokyo, Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Eleven university hospitals in &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; have been threatened with bombings, within 45 days, unless they double admissions quotas to their medical schools for the next academic year. The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, and Keio University Hospital are among the threatened institutions.

Police said that the letters all appear to come from the same source but they have not released the actual letters yet. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department is investigating, but nothing suspicious has been found at the hospitals.

Security has increased ahead of an upcoming September 11 general election.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20British%20Prime%20Minister%20Tony%20Blair"&gt;British Prime Minister Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; has apologised to &lt;a href="w%3ABriton"&gt;Briton&lt;/a&gt;s affected by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;.

British nationals living and vacationing in New Orleans reported that U.S. authorities had refused to evacuate them as &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; approached the city, leaving them stranded in their hotels. &lt;a href="w%3A%20President%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George W.

In a &lt;a href="http%3A//landrieu.senate.gov/releases/05/2005903E12.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; issued Saturday, September 3rd, 2005, Democratic &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Landrieu"&gt;Senator Mary L. Landrieu&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; claims that &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; staged a photo opportunity, at the breached 17th Street levee, by having equipment quickly moved into the background during the event. Senator Landrieu says the equipment was dispersed elsewhere the next day, but did not provide details. 

Landrieu says in her press release, " ... we witnessed a hastily prepared stage set for a Presidential photo opportunity; and the desperately needed resources we saw were this morning reduced to a single, lonely piece of equipment. The good and decent people of southeast Louisiana and the Gulf Coast -- black and white, rich and poor, young and old -- deserve far better from their national government ..."

The President and Senator Landrieu toured the 17th Street levee on Friday, and held the photo-op. Senator Landrieu said she believed the repair effort was legitimate, at that time. Less than 24 hours later, she discovered only "one lonely crane" working on the site, while giving an aerial tour for ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos. A video of her tearful comments, during that tour, has been circulating around the internet (&lt;a href="http%3A//movies.crooksandliars.com/This-Week-Landrieu-puch-Bush.wmv"&gt;WMV&lt;/a&gt;). 
Senator Landrieu made no specific accusations about the photo-op during the ABC tour. However, neither does her press release describe any measures taken to verify that equipment was in-fact pulled from other projects for the purpose of the photo-op, nor where the equipment is now. The canal wall breach, near Hammond Highway, was later shown Sunday on CBS' ♡❤60 Minutes♡❤ with dump trucks and a power shovel building a single-lane pathway across the gap. The breach was closed Monday.

Senator Landrieu was herself criticized by Anderson Cooper (CNN) on Thursday, after she responded to a question by rattling off a list of "thank yous" to other politicians (&lt;a href="http%3A//demo.ripside.com/fark/Anderson-Cooper-Landrieu-Katrina.wmv"&gt;WMV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0509/01/acd.01.html"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;). Democratic pundits have excused such detachment as an attempt to gain more federal assistance during the tragedy. Senator Landrieu's press release partially confirms this interpretation by attempting to simultaneously ask the president for more aid, while accusing him of misusing existing resources. 

<h3>17th Street Canal engineering</h3>
Although press reports mentioned the 17th Street Canal breach was blocked by the use of metal sheets, sandbags, and dumped fill, details were not available. On Wednesday September 7 it was reported that earlier metal girders, often used for retaining walls, had been hung down from the north side of the Hammond Highway bridge so as to form a metal wall which blocked the canal from the lake. After the breach had been closed, by sandbags and fill delivered by dump truck, the metal wall was opened to allow draining of the city through the canal.

Obviously placing the metal wall required an assortment of equipment which was no longer needed after it was in place. The wall was only visible from the bridge and most dry land as a few feet of metal along the bridge railing. It is not known if Senator Landrieu noticed this work of engineering, nor if she had been briefed as to what was being done.

However, photos of work at the site were later found which showed a lot of activity Sept 4, after Landrieu said the equipment was not there. However, the sheet piling wall in the photo was reported to have been completed September 2. Information of the schedule of similar work at the London Avenue breach has not been found.

<h2>Biloxi event</h2>
In related news, Germany's ZDF News &lt;a href="http%3A//www.heute.de/ZDFheute/inhalt/23/0%2C3672%2C2370967%2C00.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the president's visit to &lt;a href="w%3ABiloxi%2C%20Mississippi"&gt;Biloxi&lt;/a&gt; was largely a staged event(&lt;a href="http%3A//www.heute.de/ZDFmediathek/inhalt/23/0%2C4070%2C2370903-5%2C00.html"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;). Their onsite crew claimed that an "open air food distribution point Bush visited in front of the cameras was torn down immediately after the president and the herd of news people had left", and alleges that others being set up were abandoned at the same time. Christine Adelhardt of Germany's ARD Tagesschau said "the extent of the staging is shocking me [as much as the disaster.]" She also claimed that, for the purpose of such photo-ops, heavy equipment was being moved to areas which would not require it (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.tagesschau.de/video/0%2C1315%2COID4700936_RESreal256_PLYinternal_NAV_BAB%2C00.html"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;). Senator Landrieu has not complained about any other staged photo-ops, nor has the American press accused the president's press team off any impropriety.

A group of 19 people, including local aborigines and Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) staff, were sprayed by a &lt;a href="w%3Acrop%20duster"&gt;crop duster&lt;/a&gt; in rural Australia today. They were walking the proposed route of a freeway bypass, looking for sites that may have significance to Aboriginal people. 

The freeway bypass will be part of the &lt;a href="w%3AHume%20Highway"&gt;Hume Highway&lt;/a&gt;, near Coolac in south-west &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. 

Police are yet to rule out that the dusting was deliberate. A police spokeswoman made a public appeal for information. 

"We don't know whether they knew the people were there or not so we're appealing for anyone who might have witnessed the incident or knows anything about a low-flying crop-duster in the area to contact police," she said.

News available via the web does not (as of this writing) detail the effects of the spraying. It is assumed that there were no fatalities. 

ABC Online reports that the pilot of the plane may face charges.

A 75 year old wheelchair-bound Australian man has been rescued from his home in New Orleans. Keith Faulkner was rescued by a neighbour after floodwaters stranded him in his home for five days. Mr Faulkner is suffering from cancer. He was left behind by his family as floodwaters rose. 

"When the flooding started his family had no choice but to leave themselves, and he was left in the house as best they could manage," the Australian ambassador to the United States said. 

The man was eventually moved by neighbours to a nursing home in Lafayette. 

"He was rescued by a neighbour after five days stranded in his house and he's been in a nursing home in &lt;a href="w%3ALafayette%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;Lafayette, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;," said &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;, Minister for Foreign Affairs. 

The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs has been criticised for the lack of support provided to Australian victims of the disaster. The Labor Party has been particularly scathing in its attacks. 

"The bottom line is this: when it comes to helping Australians on the ground, the Australian Government has failed miserably to persuade its closest friend and ally - the United States Government - to allow Australian consular officials access to help our own people," said opposition defence spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Rudd was referring to the US governments refusal of a request by Australian consular officials to enter New Orleans and search for Australians. 

"You need a few days to allow people to assess the situation and to deploy personnel. But a week later, we have one official go in and can only stay there until night-time and then has to skedaddle out of there. I mean, what's happening here? It's just not good enough," he added. 

Some people have been critical of the Australians caught in the disaster. Former Federal Liberal Pary Minister &lt;a href="w%3AWilson%20Tuckey"&gt;Wilson Tuckey&lt;/a&gt; attacked the victims, suggesting that they should have left New Orleans earlier. 

"Why was the woman quoted by the Leader of the Opposition today so insistent, not that the Prime Minister get her out of her problems, but the Australian taxpayer get her out of her problems, when in fact all the warnings we heard here in Australia [said it] was unwise to stay," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAstronomer"&gt;Astronomer&lt;/a&gt;s have discovered that &lt;a href="w%3ASaturn"&gt;Saturn's&lt;/a&gt; D ring, the innermost of &lt;a href="w%3ARings%20of%20Saturn"&gt;Saturn's 15 rings&lt;/a&gt;, has grown dimmer in the past 25 years and sections have moved up to 125 miles inward toward the &lt;a href="w%3Aplanet"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt;. This discovery was made after astronomers compiled results predominantly from the &lt;a href="w%3AVoyager%202"&gt;Voyager 2 spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;, which passed Saturn in 1981, and the &lt;a href="w%3ACassini-Huygens"&gt;Cassini-Huygens&lt;/a&gt; probe which entered Saturn's orbit last year. 

Other rings were found to be rotating slower than had previously been estimated with computer models. It was also discovered that the matter composing the rings is of far more widely varying temperatures than had been expected. Sections of Saturn's F ring were also recognised as breaking apart and reforming, depending on the location of one of Saturn's moons.

The rings, which are now iconic to Saturn, and known to be common to all &lt;a href="w%3AJovian"&gt;Jovian planets&lt;/a&gt; in general, were first observed in 1610 by &lt;a href="w%3AGalileo%20Galilei"&gt;Galileo&lt;/a&gt;. The rings have recently become a subject of scientific interest to modern astronomers who believe they are similar in structure to the dust which orbited the Sun, in a similar pattern, and formed the planets some 4.5 billion years ago.

This, and other Cassini-related discoveries, were discussed at a meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Astronomical%20Society"&gt;American Astronomical Society&lt;/a&gt;'s division of planetary sciences on Monday.

A fire Monday night in a theatre in &lt;a href="w%3ABeni%20Suef"&gt;Beni Suef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, has killed at least 32 and injured a similar number. The fire was started during a performance when a candle on the set was knocked over by an actor and the curtains were set alight. The blaze spread to the stage, which was covered in paper, and then quickly engulfed the rest of the building.

There was a stampede as the panicking audience of at least 100 rushed for the only available exit door, which was blocked at one point by falling supports as the building slowly burnt. The other exit was covered in paper and caught fire before it could be used. Firefighters brought the fire under control after several hours, but not before the building was destroyed.

It is believed the deaths were caused by burns, smoke inhalation and injuries from the stampede. The remaining injured were reported by hospital director Ahmed el-Sharqawi to have burns covering between 30% and 90% of their bodies. A medical team specialising in burns and related care has been flown in from &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, and Cairo hospitals have indicated that they are ready to accept patients if necessary. The fire occurred on the third day of a nine-day theatre festival in the farming community, 120 km from Cairo, which featured groups from all over Egypt.

Sgt. Paul Accardo was found dead last Saturday, in an unmarked police car. The officer, who served as a chief spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; Police Department, committed suicide sometime last week.

"Paul was a stellar guy. A perfectionist. Everything had to be just right," said Sgt. Joe Narcisse, who worked with Sgt. Accardo. Working 20-hour days after &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; rolled through, seeing the dead and injured, hearing the cries of helpless families, and being unable to help them got to Accardo, said Capt. Marlon Defillo.

The New Orleans Police Department has suffered heavy losses in personnel. As many as 400 to 500 officers were unaccounted for, likely to be searching for their families, or attempting to return to what is left of their homes. But Accardo is the second suicide death to hit the force since the storm. Officials say that officers were being cycled off-duty, and received vacations, as well as counseling, to help reduce the grief and anguish that many officers are experiencing.

Funeral services are planned for Wednesday. Accardo is survived by his wife, Anne, his mother, a brother and a sister, and eight nieces and nephews.

At a global leadership forum in &lt;a href="Kuala%20Lumpur"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, astronaut &lt;a href="Neil%20Armstrong"&gt;Neil Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; said that a manned mission to &lt;a href="Mars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; is at least 20 years away, but that such a mission will be easier to accomplish than the Apollo missions.

"It will certainly be 20 years or more before that [a manned Mars mission] happens," the former astronaut said.

"It will be expensive, it will take a lot of energy and a complex spacecraft. But I suspect that, even though the various questions are difficult and many, they are not as difficult and many as those we faced when we started the &lt;a href="Apollo%20program"&gt;Apollo Program&lt;/a&gt; in 1961," he continued.

Armstrong, who is 75, is known for seldom appearing at public events and for not granting interviews. He commanded the Apollo 11 moon mission in 1969, and was the first man to set foot upon the . He left the space program in 1971 to teach aeronautical engineering at the in &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. 

The current United States space programme plans to send astronauts back to the moon in 15 years, and then to Mars some time after that. It is expected to cost hundreds of billions of dollars.

The German city of &lt;a href="w%3AMunich"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; has delayed the start of its planed migration to &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; till 2006. The migration was originally due to start this year, three years after the decision to migrate to Linux was made. Peter Hofmann, the project leader of the migration said the delay was because the "pilot was more important than we first thought and should last longer." Once the pilot is completed all the departments will eventually be migrated to Linux and &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt;.

On May 28, 2003 Germany's third-largest city, voted to move to open source software. Munich made the decision to switch after &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; discontinued support for their current OS, &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20NT%204"&gt;Windows NT 4&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href="w%3ASUSE"&gt;Suse&lt;/a&gt; was very involved in the early phases, &lt;a href="w%3ADebian"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; was ultimately selected to replace Windows on 14,000 desktops. The migration is estimated to cost between 30 and 34 million euros, once complete would affect approximately 16,000 users.

The first department to migrate to Linux and OpenOffice.org will be the office of the Lord Mayor planed for the middle of 2006, though not all of the department's computers will be immediately migrated. Peter Hofmann said "Some departments will start with OpenOffice on Windows, others will start with OpenOffice on Linux," he said. "It depends on their infrastructure, for example, if a department has a small number of simple [Office] macros and templates but a large number of complex applications, it is easier to do OpenOffice on Windows first."

One year ago today, September 7, 2004, the ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ project was presented to the public. ♡❤Wikimedia Commons♡❤, or simply ♡❤Commons♡❤, is a repository for multimedia files that include images, videos, computer animations, and music as well as spoken texts. They currently count more than 232,000 such files. 

All of ♡❤Commons♡❤ content is published under a free licence, so the use of its files is permitted outside the project itself. Its main mission is to provide the international ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Wikipedias&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ with images. Like ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤, the ♡❤Commons♡❤ is based on a simple &lt;a href="w%3Awiki"&gt;wiki principle&lt;/a&gt; that permits every user to contribute and change content. The project is organized into so-called gallery pages, and/or by adding files into categories organized in multiple topics that help facilitate the speedy location of desired files. Often it exists already a direct link from the ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ page to the corresponding page in the Commons.

The ♡❤Wikimedia Commons♡❤ proposal was originated by the German Erik Möller, (&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AEloquence"&gt;Eloquence&lt;/a&gt;), in March 2004. Eloquence was until recently the Chief Research Officer of the ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Up until the launch of ♡❤Commons♡❤, it was time consuming to use material from one ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ language project in a sister project of a different language. Each file had to be uploaded into each language edition of ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤, and be described and licensed again. The goal was to reduce this redundant effort into one upload, which it can be said that this was successful. 

The language in use on the project's Main Page is English because it is an international project, but many information pages exist in multiple languages. Judging by the experience of other ♡❤Wikimedia Foundation♡❤ projects, it is only a question of time before further localization occurs at ♡❤Commons♡❤. This will make it easier for users with fewer skills in foreign languages to also contribute files.

The content in the ♡❤Commons♡❤ is growing at a rapid pace. Within the last month alone, the number of images and other files has grown by more than 43,000. This represents a 22,7 % increase in relation to the prior month. While the ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ projects usually compare themselves with the more widely known encyclopedias like &lt;a href="w%3AEncyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica"&gt;Britannica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABrockhaus%20encyclopedia"&gt;Brockhaus&lt;/a&gt;, a competitor ♡❤Commons♡❤ would likely be considered the huge commercial photo archives like &lt;a href="w%3AGetty%20Images"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACorbis"&gt;Corbis&lt;/a&gt;, who possess more than 70 million images each. In relation to them, the ♡❤Commons♡❤ is very small at the moment. However, most of the important buildings and landmarks world wide are already featured in its database. 

Like other ♡❤Wikimedia Foundation♡❤ projects, the ♡❤Commons♡❤ face certain challenges and problems. Sometimes people upload offensive images. The community has had to establish clear criteria about which content is acceptable, and which is not. There should not be unfair censorship. Obvious transgressions can be pointed out by anybody, and they are usually deleted rapidly by the administrators.

A sensitive topic is copyrights, and the rights of the owner of the pictured images. International rules have not yet been made compatible. In certain ways, the ♡❤Wikimedia Foundation♡❤ opens new territory in the area of intellectual property. Before ♡❤Commons♡❤, it was almost exclusively a domain of professionals to publish images who were well aware of the legal issues. Now it is possible for huge numbers of photo amateurs to publish. Like with offensive content, obvious violations of copyright are deleted the moment they are brought to notice of the administrators. However, it is quite possible there will be an upcoming international debate if the free publication of certain content, e.g. images of national heritage objects, is in the overwhelming public interest. In cases such as this, private interests which might prevent publication are of lesser importance.

The contribution of ♡❤Wikimedia Commons♡❤ to a wide array of issues in research, reporting, education, tourism or others, at a global scale, is difficult to fathom at the moment. Most likely though the impact will be gigantic.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s Office of Fair Trading accused the credit card association &lt;a href="w%3AMasterCard"&gt;MasterCard&lt;/a&gt; UK, which includes most major British banks, of overcharging customers between March 2000 and November 2004.

The OFT found that an agreement between MasterCard UK members, setting the so-called 'interchange fee' - a charge paid to banks by retailers - caused high cost for UK consumers and was against competition regulations. The British watchdog said that the interchange fee was too high and forced the UK retail sector to raise prices.

MasterCard UK disagreed with the OFT and announced that it would appeal the decision. The company said that British consumers benefit from the agreement, as more retail stores accepted credit cards.

MasterCard has changed its fee policy last November, but the change has not satisfied the OFT. If the company cannot prove the new fees do not violate competition rules, it may be found guilty and fined up to 10% of its annual worldwide turnover.

The OFT is also investigating MasterCard's biggest rival, &lt;a href="w%3AVISA%20%28credit%20card%29"&gt;Visa&lt;/a&gt;, in the same case.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%20Portable"&gt;PlayStation Portable&lt;/a&gt; went on sale in the &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, September 1. In the three days following the release, more than 185,000 PlayStation Portables were sold. This sets a new sales record on game consoles. The record was previously held by &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;, who sold 87,000 Nintendo DS handhelds the first three days after its release. The PlayStation Portable is being sold for £179 in the UK.

Twenty of the 24 games launched with PlayStation Portable are in the top 40. PlayStation Portable games also occupy nine of the top 10 slots on the sales charts. The game Ridge Racer was the most popular, with one in every five people buying both the PlayStation Portable and Ridge Racer at the same time.

Sony's main competitors in the handheld gaming console market are Nintendo with the &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo%20DS"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANokia"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3AN-Gage"&gt;nGage&lt;/a&gt;. Like Nintendo and Nokia, Sony is marketing the device as being able to do more then just play games. The PlayStation Portable can play specially created versions of poular movies and surf the Internet wirelessly. Sony expects to sell a million PlayStation Portables in the UK before Christmas.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;Australian Broadcasting Company&lt;/a&gt; (ABC) television head, Sandra Levy, has quit to become the director of development for "Channel Nine." Her new role is expected to focus on drama.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; managing director Russell Balding said that Ms Levy had lifted audiences to "historically unprecedented" levels. However, Ms Levy came under fire during her ABC tenure for an overly conservative programming approach to major news stories - notably a sluggish response to coverage of the December 2004 South Asian Tsunami. She was criticised for refusing to interrupt regular programming to go to breaking news reports. 

The Channel Nine network, that she now joins, is in a rebuilding phase after coming under heavy ratings pressure in the past 12 months. Long the dominant commercial network in Australia, in 2005 it has seen numerous changes in its executive ranks, including the sudden resignation of CEO David Gyngell. 

Channel Nine's interim CEO, television veteran Sam Chisholm, has launched cost-cutting at the network.

Actor &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Denver"&gt;Bob Denver&lt;/a&gt;, best known for his roles as "Gilligan" on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGilligan%27s%20Island"&gt;Gilligan's Island&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1964-1967) and "&lt;a href="w%3AMaynard%20G.%20Krebs"&gt;Maynard G. Krebs&lt;/a&gt;" on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Many%20Loves%20of%20Dobie%20Gillis"&gt;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1959-1963), died Friday at the age of 70.

Denver gained popularity on ♡❤Dobie Gillis♡❤, playing the title character's best friend, a &lt;a href="w%3Abeatnik"&gt;beatnik&lt;/a&gt;. The show, which ran for four years, was Denver's first major acting role. It is said that the popular cartoon ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AScooby-Doo%2C%20Where%20Are%20You%21"&gt;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was based on the show, and Denver's role of Krebs was the inspiration for the character "Shaggy".

Denver's real fame, however, came with the role of "Gilligan", a kind but naive and incompetent bumbler stuck on an island with six other castaways. Nearly every episode involved a plot to get off the island; however, Gilligan always ended up causing the plot to fail, in one way or another. The show, which ran for three years, gained popularity through perpetual reruns. "It was the mid-'70s when I realized it wasn't going off the air," Denver said in 2001.

After the cancellation of ♡❤Gilligan's Island♡❤, Bob Denver starred in ♡❤Dusty's Trail♡❤, a clone of ♡❤Gilligan's Island♡❤, set in a wagon train in the old American West. It was also created by &lt;a href="w%3ASherwood%20Schwartz"&gt;Sherwood Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of ♡❤Gilligan's Island♡❤ and other sitcoms like &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Brady%20Bunch"&gt;♡❤The Brady Bunch♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Dusty's Trail♡❤ featured a one-to-one match with ♡❤Gilligan's Island♡❤ characters (Gilligan became Dusty, while the actress, Ginger, became the dance hall girl, and the farm girl, Maryanne, became the school marm, and the rich Howells became a rich rail baron and wife, etc.). Bob Denver was the only actor in common. The show never caught on and was quickly canceled.

In May, Denver underwent &lt;a href="w%3ACoronary%20artery%20bypass%20surgery"&gt;quadruple bypass surgery&lt;/a&gt;, and was subsequently diagnosed with &lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. He died of complications from his cancer treatment at Wake Forest University Baptist Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.

Denver is survived by his wife and four children.

The current Iraqi president, &lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt;, said that former president &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; confessed to various crimes and killings which were committed during his regime. Some of these cases are currently under investigation.

Mr. Talabani stated that a judge had told him of these alleged confessions, which he revealed he knew about on Iraqi national television. Details are few, but one example of a confessed crime is the mass killing of the Kurds in the late 1980s, which resulted in the deaths of thousands of Kurds. 

Talabani says that Saddam deserves to be hanged "20 times a day," although he does not wish to sign his death warrant; he wants his vice president, &lt;a href="w%3AAdel%20Abdel%20Mehdi"&gt;Adel Abdel Mehdi&lt;/a&gt;, to do so. According to Talabani, this gesture is not meant to gain power over the courts, "My not signing does not mean that I will block the decision of the court." Talabani is morally opposed to all capital punishment.

Talabani also stated that "There are 100 reasons to sentence Saddam to death."

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; seems to be starting a general trend of cracking down on criminals – three were hanged just last week, with possibly more to come.

Saddam's first trial comes October 19, where he will be tried for the mass killings of &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; civilians in a town in northern &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; in 1982. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.

Actress &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3APortia%20de%20Rossi"&gt;Portia de Rossi&lt;/a&gt; of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AArrested%20Development%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Arrested Development&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ recently had her "first-ever interview with the gay press", namely ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AThe%20Advocate"&gt;The Advocate&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. In the interview, she talks about her sexuality and romance with comedienne and talk show host &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEllen%20DeGeneres"&gt;Ellen DeGeneres&lt;/a&gt;.

The 32-year-old Australian reveals she recently told her 98-year-old grandmother that she was a lesbian, when visiting back home. Supposedly her grandmother had a change of heart after two minutes, accepting De Rossi's sexuality.

DeGeneres and De Rossi met at an awards show in December 2004, and both immediately broke up with their respective partners. In the May issue of ♡❤Allure♡❤ magazine, DeGeneres said she hopes that she and De Rossi "are together for the rest of our lives."

The interview also reveals she turned down lesbian roles, including one opposite &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAngelina%20Jolie"&gt;Angelina Jolie&lt;/a&gt; in a movie called ♡❤Gia♡❤. De Rossi says she is now fine playing gay characters, but will not do sex-scenes, gay or straight.

On why she suddenly feels comfortable on publicly speaking on the topic, "I was thinking, well, the people who need to know I'm gay know, and I'm somehow living by example by continuing on with my career and having a full, rich life, and I am incidentally gay, but it's not a big political platform. I justified it in so many ways."

Another probable reason she consented to the interview is its timing, right before the upcoming season debut of ♡❤Arrested Development♡❤.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20of%20Massachusetts"&gt;US state of Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; is turning a portion of Camp Edwards, an active &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Cod"&gt;Cape Cod&lt;/a&gt; military base, into a "village" for 2,500 evacuees of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, as part of Operation Helping Hand.

The temporary shelter on the Massachusetts Military Reservation will have a population the size of &lt;a href="w%3ATruro%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Truro, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and will include an active mayor and a &lt;a href="w%3Asystem%20of%20government"&gt;system of government&lt;/a&gt; that will be like a &lt;a href="w%3Atown%20council"&gt;town council&lt;/a&gt; 

However, the shelter will face security demands different from the fifteen Cape towns because Cape Edwards is an active base used for training exercises. Security will be overseen by the Massachusetts National Guard, with help from the Massachusetts State Police and the County Sheriff's office. Massachusetts Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; stressed that he wanted to give it a comfortable, non-hostile atmosphere.

Upon touching down at Otis Air National Guard Base, &lt;a href="w%3AMassport"&gt;Massport&lt;/a&gt; officials will issue identification cards, create case files for them and ask the evacuees to provide personal information which will go into to a database to be shared with other states that are taking evacuees.

The agencies that will be on hand are, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Red%20Cross"&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASalvation%20Army"&gt;Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt;. These agencies will coordinate volunteers, who must commit themselves to five days of volunteer efforts, and they must be able to transport themselves to the camp. Romney has asked for donations from the community. 

Evacuees will be assigned housing by groups. There could be barracks for single men, another for single women, and then space for elderly and families with children. Visitors will not be allowed.

The school superintendent for the township of Bourne, Ed LaFleur, will work on enrolling the children of evacuees into Cape Cod schools. Romney met yesterday with leaders of the Blake Churches Alliance who will make available chaplains and counselors for the evacuees.

Romney spent Monday night asking for the State House to pass a $25 million emergency spending bill to pay the initial costs of the facility.

The arrival time of the evacuees has been postponed, for unknown reasons.

British pop group &lt;a href="w%3AGirls%20Aloud"&gt;Girls Aloud&lt;/a&gt; have won the 2005 &lt;a href="w%3APopjustice%20%C2%A320%20Music%20Prize"&gt;Popjustice £20 Music Prize&lt;/a&gt; with their single "Wake Me Up". The award, organised by music journalist Peter Robinson, is given annually to the best British pop single of the previous 12 months and is a tongue-in-cheek response to the &lt;a href="w%3AMercury%20Music%20Prize"&gt;Mercury Music Prize&lt;/a&gt;, the winner of which was &lt;a href="Antony%20%26amp%3B%20The%20Johnsons%20win%20Mercury%20Music%20Prize"&gt;announced earlier in the evening&lt;/a&gt;.

This year's shortlist included Basement Jaxx, Robbie Williams and Charlotte Church.

This is the second time Girls Aloud have won the award - they won the inaugural prize in 2003 for "No Good Advice".

Also announced was the winner of the £20 Invoice Prize for the worst British single of the previous 12 months. The winner, charity single Band Aid 20's "Do They Know It's Christmas?", was the UK's Christmas number one in 2004.

The Primetime &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEmmy%20Awards"&gt;Emmy Awards&lt;/a&gt; will have a unique twist for 2005, as television celebrities will sing the themes of classic series. Similar to the format of reality shows like ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAmerican%20Idol"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ARock%20Star%3A%20INXS"&gt;Rock Star: INXS&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the audience will be able to vote on their favorite performance during the initial broadcast of the show.

The ceremony's executive producer, Ken Ehrlich, said to the press that "There are certain television theme songs that are nearly as memorable as the shows connected to them."

Billionaire American business executive &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ADonald%20Trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, of reality show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AThe%20Apprentice"&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, will accompany the high-pitched voice of actress &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMegan%20Mullally"&gt;Megan Mullally&lt;/a&gt;, singing the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGreen%20Acres"&gt;Green Acres&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ theme. R&amp;B singer &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMacy%20Gray"&gt;Macy Gray&lt;/a&gt; will be joined by &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGary%20Dourdan"&gt;Gary Dourdan&lt;/a&gt; of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACSI%3A%20Crime%20Scene%20Investigation"&gt;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, as they sing "Movin' On Up", the theme to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAll%20in%20the%20Family"&gt;All in the Family&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ spin-off sitcom ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AThe%20Jeffersons"&gt;The Jeffersons&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWilliam%20Shatner"&gt;William Shatner&lt;/a&gt; of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AStar%20Trek%3A%20The%20Original%20Series"&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and opera singer &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AFrederica%20von%20Stade"&gt;Frederica von Stade&lt;/a&gt; will perform the theme from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AStar%20Trek"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Shatner is notorious for &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWilliam%20Shatner%27s%20musical%20career"&gt;his musical recordings&lt;/a&gt;, which many criticize, as he typically speaks the lyrics instead of singing them, typically as an exaggerated interpretive reading. However, the ♡❤Star Trek♡❤ theme does not require any singing other than that of the female opera singer.

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AKristen%20Bell"&gt;Kristen Bell&lt;/a&gt; of the series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AVeronica%20Mars"&gt;Veronica Mars&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ will perform the theme to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AFame%20%281982%20TV%20series%29"&gt;Fame&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, solo.

The show will be again hosted by talk show host and comedienne &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEllen%20DeGeneres"&gt;Ellen DeGeneres&lt;/a&gt;. In honor of the victims of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, all Emmy presenters and performers will be given magnolias, the state flower of both Louisiana and Mississippi. Information will be given out during the broadcast on how viewers can donate to relief efforts.

The Emmys will be broadcast September 18th, 2005.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Senate"&gt;California State Senate&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Aupper%20house"&gt;upper house&lt;/a&gt;, had already &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accede"&gt;acceded&lt;/a&gt; to this.

A critical swing vote came from &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Umberg"&gt;Tom Umberg&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Ana%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Ana&lt;/a&gt;) of &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20County"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;, the second largest California county, which is &lt;a href="http%3A//encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx%3Frefid%3D1861737340"&gt;predominantly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aconservative"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;.

The offices of DirectNIC, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; based webhost and services provider, were visited by armed members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A82nd%20Airborne%20Division"&gt;82nd Airborne Division&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during an interview with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reporters Tuesday evening. DirectNIC has been the home of "Outpost Crystal" &amp;mdash; an information dissemination effort involving hundreds of volunteers throughout the world &amp;mdash; since &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wracked the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/span&gt; last Monday.

Armed police and military are currently patrolling the devastated city to protect residents and property. While New Orleans Mayor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AC.%20Ray%20Nagin"&gt;C. Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has ordered a "forced" evacuation of the city, it is not apparent yet whether these orders are being executed by law enforcement agencies. DirectNIC personnel indicate that they will be allowed to stay as they constitute part of the recovery effort of the city.

<h1>Palestinian gunmen assassinate ex-security chief</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Palestinian%20gunmen%20assassinate%20ex-security%20chief&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Former &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; security chief &lt;a href="w%3AMoussa%20Arafat"&gt;Moussa Arafat&lt;/a&gt;, cousin of the late Palestinian leader &lt;a href="w%3AYasser%20Arafat"&gt;Yasser Arafat&lt;/a&gt;, was assassinated at his home in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; after a half-hour shootout between a number of militants and Arafat's bodyguards. The force, estimated to be up to a hundred men, overpowered Arafat's numerous bodyguards, using assault rifles and grenades, before directly assaulting the house. They dragged Arafat into the street, while still in his pajamas, where he was shot. He was declared dead on arrival to hospital.

The &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Resistance%20Committees"&gt;Popular Resistance Committees&lt;/a&gt;, or PRC, claimed responsibility for the attack, as well as the kidnapping of Moussa Arafat's son &lt;a href="w%3AManhal%20Arafat"&gt;Manhal&lt;/a&gt; during the fighting. Manhal Arafat is a senior security official who has been described as one of his father's closest aides. The PRC explained the killing of Arafat as punishment for corruption after normal Palestinian security forces would not take action, describing it as "executing the will of God".

While holding no official position, Arafat had been retained as a military advisor to current President of the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;PNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, after being removed from his position as security chief. Palestinian officials have condemned the attack, describing it as an attack on the authority of the government.

There is no indication that this incident will affect the withdrawal of &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; settlers from the Gaza Strip and parts of the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;, scheduled to be completed in the next few weeks.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has been criticised for refusing to cut the fuel excise tax as &lt;a href="w%3Apetrol"&gt;petrol&lt;/a&gt; prices reach up to $1.40 &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; per litre in parts of the country. The criticism by &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APremier"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; has been particularly vocal, claiming that the government simply does not want to lose the revenue the excise generates. The Queensland government subsidises fuel in the state with &lt;a href="w%3AGoods%20and%20Services%20Tax%20%28Australia%29"&gt;GST&lt;/a&gt; revenue.

"The reality is they cream off a huge amount every day. He can do something about it if he really wants to," Mr Beattie said.

Mr Howard responded by explaining the steep rise in petrol prices was due to current market trends and short-term repercussions of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. This was consistent with the statements by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Competition%20and%20Consumer%20Commission"&gt;Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&lt;/a&gt;, which explained the major reasons for the increase were Katrina and China's recent embargo on refined petrol exports.

The Prime Minister also estimated that the Federal government would lose billions in a cut of significant size. He estimated the government would lose at least $380 million for every one cent reduction, which would increase as drivers demanded a five to ten cent cut.

Investigation of the crash into sea of a Tunisian airplane ATR-72 near Sicily on August 6, 2005 has arrived at an astonishing conclusion. The wrong type of fuel gauge was installed in the aircraft. The gauge was designed for another type of aircraft, the much smaller ATR-42.

The level indicated by the gauge was wrong, causing the pilot to think that the plane needed less fuel that it did. Then, when fueling at the airport, less fuel than was needed was loaded in the airport of &lt;a href="w%3ABari"&gt;Bari&lt;/a&gt;. While in flight the airplane ran out of fuel, although the gauge still showed fuel available.

After this conclusion by the Italian National Security Flight Agency (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ansv.it"&gt;ANSV&lt;/a&gt;) the Italian National Agency for Civil Aviation (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.enac-italia.it/"&gt;ENAC&lt;/a&gt;) has suspended Tunisian airline Tuninter's authorization to operate commercial flights in Italy. A warning was also send to European Authority about what has happened asking that all fuel gauges installed on ATR-42 amd ATR-72 be checked.

&lt;a href="w%3AHalliburton"&gt;Halliburton Co.'s&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary &lt;a href="w%3AKellogg%2C%20Brown%20and%20Root"&gt;Kellogg, Brown and Root&lt;/a&gt; (KBR) has been awarded a half billion dollar repair contract for &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Navy"&gt;U.S. Navy&lt;/a&gt; facilities damaged by natural disasters, including &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. KBR won the competitive-bidding in July 2005. 

The Bush administration has been criticized for awarding KBR a five-year, no-bid contract to restore Iraqi oil fields, shortly before the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. Congressional Democrats have asked &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20Defense%20Donald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; to investigate last month's demotion of &lt;a href="w%3ABunnatine%20Greenhouse"&gt;Bunnatine Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt; after she &lt;a href="w%3ACivilians%20testify%20to%20Halliburton%20fraud%2C%20coercion"&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; to improprieties in the no-bid procedure and other KBR improprieties. Bunnatine Greenhouse was Chief Contracting Officer of the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers"&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&lt;/a&gt; since 1997.

Halliburton reported being paid $10.7 billion for Iraq-related government work during 2003 and 2004. Pentagon auditors have questioned tens of millions of dollars of Halliburton charges.

&lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; today unveiled its latest addition to the &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; line, the &lt;a href="w%3AiPod%20nano"&gt;iPod nano&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement came today at a special music event hosted by Apple, held in the &lt;a href="w%3AMoscone%20West%20Convention%20Center"&gt;Moscone West Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;.

The iPod Nano comes in two colors, white and black, as well as two sizes, a 2GB and a 4GB, capable of holding 500 and 1,000 songs and will cost $199 and $249 USD respectively. The iPod nano is the second model of the iPod family to utilize &lt;a href="w%3AFlash%20memory"&gt;flash memory&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href="w%3AiPod%20Shuffle"&gt;Shuffle&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in January.

The iPod nano replaces the similar &lt;a href="w%3AiPod%20Mini"&gt;iPod Mini&lt;/a&gt; in the iPod family. The iPod nano's maximum capacity is 2GB smaller than that of the last version of the iPod Mini, which held 6GB for the same price of $249.
Apple also announced an &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;-compatible &lt;a href="w%3Acellular%20phone"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AMotorola"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; ROKR E1, which will be available exclusively from &lt;a href="w%3ACingular%20Wireless"&gt;Cingular Wireless&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Mobile"&gt;Virgin&lt;/a&gt; will be in the UK. The ROKR has a color display for viewing album art and features built-in stereo speakers, as well as stereo headphones that also serve as a mobile headset with microphone. Users can randomly autofill or manually fill the mobile phone with playlists of music, audiobooks and Podcasts from their iTunes library via a &lt;a href="w%3AUSB"&gt;USB 1.1&lt;/a&gt; connection. The Motorola ROKR pauses music automatically when users take a call and offers the ability to listen to music while messaging or taking a photo. It will cost $250 with a two-year cell service contract.

A new version of iTunes was also announced at the event, bringing it to version 5. Along with a new look, it also features a customizable randomization, improved search for the Library and &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes%20Music%20Store"&gt;Music Store&lt;/a&gt;, and greater parental controls on songs with explicit lyrics in the &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes%20Music%20Store"&gt;iTunes Music Store&lt;/a&gt; as well as controlling content of &lt;a href="w%3APodcasts"&gt;Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;.

This list is taken from &lt;a href="Colleges%20offering%20admission%20to%20displaced%20New%20Orleans%20students"&gt;Colleges offering admission to displaced New Orleans students&lt;/a&gt;, and is intended to make searching easier for faculty, graduate, and professional students.

In addition to the list below, the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociation%20of%20American%20Law%20Schools"&gt;Association of American Law Schools&lt;/a&gt; has compiled a list of &lt;a href="w%3Alaw%20school"&gt;law schools&lt;/a&gt; offering assistance to displaced students. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.aals.org/neworleans/schoolsbystate.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As conditions vary by college, interested parties should contact the Office of Admissions at the school in question for specific requirements and up-to-date details.

<h1>Controversy erupts over German Anarchist Pogo Party's campaign ad</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Controversy%20erupts%20over%20German%20Anarchist%20Pogo%20Party%27s%20campaign%20ad&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAnarchist%20Pogo%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;German Anarchist Pogo Party&lt;/a&gt; ran a campaign ad (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.appd.de/wahlspot/wahlspot.php"&gt;Download here&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;a href="w%3ANSFW"&gt;NSFW&lt;/a&gt;) which, instead of discussing the party's politics, featured various party scenes set to a heavy metal soundtrack. The spot included revellers smashing furniture, pouring beer down each other's throats, and women dancing topless. The spot ends with the proclamation: "My vote for the rubbish".

The &lt;a href="w%3AARD%20%28TV%29"&gt;ARD&lt;/a&gt; refused to air the ad because it "violates the human dignity" and showed only a heavily censored version at an earlier airtime. The Party then sued the station and got an injuction by an appeal court in &lt;a href="w%3AM%C3%BCnster"&gt;Münster&lt;/a&gt; only minutes before the next ad was due, forcing the ARD to air the spot uncensored, right before their evening news flagship.

The ad has offended a number of people, but has likely gained the party nationwide attention among its younger demographics who could access campaign websites online (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.appd.de/"&gt;appd.de&lt;/a&gt;). The Hamburg-based APPD and every other party is entitled by law to free television airtime on Germany's public TV Station ARD and &lt;a href="w%3AZDF"&gt;ZDF&lt;/a&gt; for its advertisements because it is an officially registered political party competing for the upcoming federal elections. Its next ad is scheduled for Monday night, although broadcasting authorities may again censor the ad.

The party has a membership of approximately 750 -- German newspapers posit that the ads will have little impact on the upcoming election.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20carrier%20Delta%20Air%20Lines%20cuts%20jobs%2C%20sells%20planes&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' third-largest airline operator, &lt;a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines"&gt;Delta Air Lines&lt;/a&gt;, will cut 1,000 jobs due to a planned service reduction at their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACincinnati/Northern%20Kentucky%20International%20Airport"&gt;Cincinnati hub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The carrier also announced they will sell 11 of their &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20767"&gt;767-200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; planes to an air-cargo company, ABX Air Inc., since they are the least fuel-efficient aircraft in the fleet.

Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport lost 9 destinations, but the carrier said there would be no inconvenience to passengers. Delta will fly to 20 new "business destinations" from &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , instead. Also 41 international connections are to be maintained or expanded.

The changes took place due to the difficult financial situation of the company, which suffered $10 billion in losses since 2001, and warned that they would file for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; if unsuccessful in lowering costs.

In order to find P-2 level officers for the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretariat"&gt;Secretariat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the international organization is holding competitive recruitment competitions in 42 countries. The examinations will take place in February, 2006.

Six occupational groups are being sought: Architecture, Demography, Library, Security, Science and Technology, and Statistics. There will be a written examination (both a general paper and a specialised paper) and an interview.

The written examination questions are given in English and French, the two working languages of the Secretariat. Candidates must write their answers for the general paper in English or French. However, they may write their answers for the specialized paper in English, French, or any of the other four official languages of the Secretariat, i.e., Arabic, Chinese, Russian, or Spanish.

The examinations will take place on February 28, 2006 in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndorra%20La%20Vella"&gt;Andorra La Vella&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Bangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Beirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Monaco"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Santiago"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVaduz"&gt;Vaduz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AValletta"&gt;Valletta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

According to the UN, applicants "should hold at least a first-level &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auniversity%20degree"&gt;university degree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; relevant to the occupational group in which they would like to take the examination. Furthermore, applicants should not be more than 32 years old on 31 December, 2006 ... Fluency in either English or French is required."

The following countries have been selected for the 2006 competition: &lt;a href="Andorra"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Angola"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda"&gt;Antigua and Barbuda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Barbados"&gt;Barbados&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Botswana"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brunei%20Darussalam"&gt;Brunei Darussalam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cabo%20Verde"&gt;Cabo Verde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Comoros"&gt;Comores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;Republic of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Gambia"&gt;Gambia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Grenada"&gt;Grenada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Guatemala"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Equatorial%20Guinea"&gt;Equatorial Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kiribati"&gt;Kiribati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Lao%20People%27s%20Democratic%20Republic"&gt;Lao People's Democratic Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Liechtenstein"&gt;Liechtenstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Maldives"&gt;Maldives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Malta"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="San%20Marino"&gt;San Marino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Marshall%20Islands"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mauritius"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Federated%20States%20of%20Micronesia"&gt;Micronesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Moldova"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Monaco"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oman"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Panama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Saint%20Lucia"&gt;Saint Lucia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Samoa"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Solomon%20Islands"&gt;Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tuvalu"&gt;Tuvalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.

The practice of scouting under-represented nations for highly-qualified employees is an annual occurrence.

The United Nations Secretariat is one of the principal organs of the United Nations and it is headed by the United Nations Secretary General and assisted by a staff of international civil servants worldwide. It provides studies, information, and facilities needed by United Nations bodies for their meetings. It also carries out tasks as directed by the &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="UN%20General%20Assembly"&gt;UN General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, the UN Economic and Social Council, and other UN bodies. The United Nations Charter provides that the staff be chosen by application of the "highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity," with due regard for the importance of recruiting on a wide geographical basis.

<h1>UN inquiry finds mismanagement and failure of oversight</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UN%20inquiry%20finds%20mismanagement%20and%20failure%20of%20oversight&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Independent Inquiry Committee's report on the overall management and oversight of the UN's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOil-for-Food%20Programme"&gt;Oil-for-Food Programme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has concluded that the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; requires stronger executive leadership, thorough administrative reform, and more reliable controls and auditing.

The Programme included more than $103 billion in transactions (over $64 billion in oil sales and almost $39 billion for food). 

Responsibility for what went wrong with the Programme is assigned to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Secretariat"&gt;UN Secretariat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , members of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, its 661 Committee, and the Iraqi regime. In a change from past practice, the Security Council had retained substantial elements of administrative control through its 661 Committee. This caused neither the Secretariat leadership nor the Security Council to be in overall control.
There was reluctance of both the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the Deputy Secretary-General to recognize their own responsibility for the Programme's shortcomings and they failed to ensure that critical evidence was brought to the attention of the Security Council and the 661 Committee. They only made minimal efforts to address sanctions violations with Iraqi officials, and both failed to provide oversight of the Programme's Executive Director, Benon Sevan.

As the Programme expanded and continued, &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; found ways and means of turning it to his own advantage, primarily through demands for surcharges and kickbacks from companies doing business with the Programme. For UN agencies, the work went beyond their core competencies of overseeing the distribution of humanitarian goods—from monitoring, planning, and consulting—to infrastructure rebuilding, thus multiplying problems. Nor was there much success in coordinating so large a program among UN Agencies accustomed to zealously defending their institutional autonomy.

There were Iraqi attempts to pass money to former Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, principally through an Iraqi-American businessman, Samir Vincent, and a Korean lobbyist, Tongsun Park. The Committee has determined that well over $1 million was paid to Mr. Vincent and Mr. Park. However, the Committee has not found evidence that Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali received or agreed to receive monies from Mr. Park and Mr. Vincent.

The report recommended better oversight and management, financial disclosure by more UN staff, and that UN agencies should return up to $50 million in excess compensation secured as a result of work performed under Security Council Resolution 1483.

The Committee's Chairman, Paul A Volcker, stated, "The inescapable conclusion from the Committee's work is that the United Nations Organization needs thoroughgoing reform—and it needs it urgently. What is important—what has been recognized by one investigation after another—is that real change must take place, and change over a wide area. Clear benchmarks for measuring progress must be set. The General Assembly should insist, in its forthcoming meeting, that key reforms be put in place no later than the time of its regular meeting in 2006. To settle for less, to permit delay and dilution, would be to invite failure. It would, in reality, further erode public support, undercut effectiveness, and dishonor the ideals upon which the United Nations is built."

He added, "Before concluding its work, the Committee also intends a more comprehensive listing of firms participating in the Programme, either in the purchase of oil or the sale of humanitarian goods, as well as a more detailed analysis of the manner in which Iraq and its vendors and oil purchasers unlawfully manipulated the Programme."
