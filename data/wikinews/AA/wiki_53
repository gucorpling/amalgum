<h1>Sir Paul Stephenson to head London's police</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sir%20Paul%20Stephenson%20to%20head%20London%27s%20police&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; government has announced the appointment of Sir &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Stephenson%20%28police%20officer%29"&gt;Paul Stephenson&lt;/a&gt; to head &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan Police Service&lt;/a&gt;.

Stephenson said his priorities as Commissioner would be knife crime and teenage murders. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ quoted him as telling reporters that his agenda "is about solving crime, securing our streets, convincing all our communities that we are on their side and delivering the policing they want and being intolerant of violence in any form".

The vacancy at the Met arose when the then-new Mayor of London, &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Johnson"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, expressed a lack of confidence in Sir &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Blair"&gt;Ian Blair&lt;/a&gt;. While Johnson has no direct say in who acts as Commissioner, the lack of confidence made Blair's position untenable and he announced his resignation in October 2008 to take effect in December. The media has assumed there was a two-horse race to succeed Blair, between his deputy Stephenson and Northern Ireland's police chief &lt;a href="w%3AHugh%20Orde"&gt;Hugh Orde&lt;/a&gt;. Some elements of the media had assumed that Stephenson was out of the running following the arrest of &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Tory&lt;/a&gt; MP &lt;a href="w%3ADamien%20Green"&gt;Damien Green&lt;/a&gt; as part of a leak enquiry. Stephenson had authorised the arrest.

Stephenson joined Lancashire police in 1975. He rose to become assistant Chief Constable of Merseyside police, then returned to Lancashire and became Chief Constable in 2002. He joined the Met as Deputy Commissioner in 2005 and has been filling the Commissioner's role since December of last year.

<h1>Global economy could lose up to 51 million jobs this year, says UN agency</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Global%20economy%20could%20lose%20up%20to%2051%20million%20jobs%20this%20year%2C%20says%20UN%20agency&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Labor%20Organization"&gt;International Labor Organization&lt;/a&gt; (ILO), a branch of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; concerned with &lt;a href="w%3Alabour%20economics"&gt;labor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aworkers%27%20rights"&gt;workers' rights&lt;/a&gt; issues, issued a report Wednesday explaining how the &lt;a href="w%3ALate%202000s%20recession"&gt;global economic crisis&lt;/a&gt; could create a global employment crisis by the end of the year.

"By the end of 2008 &lt;a href="w%3Aworking%20poor"&gt;working poverty&lt;/a&gt;, vulnerable employment and &lt;a href="w%3Aunemployment"&gt;unemployment&lt;/a&gt; were beginning to rise as the effects of the slowdown spread," the report states. "If the recession deepens in 2009, as many forecasters expect, the global jobs crisis will worsen sharply." Even for those who keep their jobs, the report predicts that "earnings and other conditions of employment will deteriorate."

In a worst-case scenario, the ILO says 51 million jobs could be lost in 2009, meaning that 7.1% of the world's working population would be out of a job. In a more realistic scenario, the report foresees a loss of 30 million jobs, with a global unemployment rate of 6.5%. The unemployment rate has increased in recent years, from 5.7% in 2007 to an estimated 6% in 2008.

Even the report's most optimistic scenario for this year, a loss of 18 million jobs at an unemployment rate of 6.1%, is not much different than the ILO's October 2008 prediction of 20 million jobs lost this year due to the financial crisis. 

The report warns that &lt;a href="w%3Adeveloping%20countries"&gt;developing countries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Asia"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASubsaharan%20Africa"&gt;Subsaharan Africa&lt;/a&gt; will be harshly affected by the economic crisis. Although working poverty - defined as having daily wages of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;2 or less - is on an overall decline, these regions are still characterized by poor working conditions, low salaries, and an insecure job market. This will only worsen in 2009, according to the ILO.

"Taking into account that a wage and salary job in poor regions may still not ensure all the components of a decent job, it becomes understandable that only a minority of working people have a job that is well paid, respects their fundamental rights and ensures some security in case of job loss, personal or family illnesses, or other difficulties." The report says that by the end of 2008, nearly 53% of workers around the world could be in "vulnerable employment".

In terms of actual unemployment, however, &lt;a href="w%3Adeveloped%20countries"&gt;developed countries&lt;/a&gt; are the ones most likely to be affected by the downturn, as they are more tied to the global financial system. The unemployment rate in the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and other developed economies increased by 0.7 percentage points in 2008, the largest increase of all regions. "&lt;a href="w%3AGlobalization"&gt;Globalization&lt;/a&gt; combined with rapid technological advances is another challenge for labour markets in the region," the ILO says. "It is important for workers and employers to be ready and able to adjust quickly to change and to stiffer competition."
Still, the unemployment rate of 6.4% in these developed countries is far less than in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Africa"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, which had unemployment rates of 10.3% and 9.4% respectively. &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Asia"&gt;East Asia&lt;/a&gt; had the lowest unemployment rate of the regions at 3.8%. 
The report urged global economies to take cooperative measures, including working with the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, in order to stem the economic crisis. It also asks governments to address the "negative social consequences of globalization" by placing on emphasis an &lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20justice"&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt;-based programs targeted toward women, youth, and other "vulnerable groups".

In particular, the ILO says governments should establish &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20works"&gt;public infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; projects such as road construction, expand &lt;a href="w%3Ahealth%20insurance"&gt;health insurance&lt;/a&gt; and unemployment benefits, and focus on the creation of &lt;a href="w%3Agreen%20jobs"&gt;green jobs&lt;/a&gt; when devising their &lt;a href="w%3Aeconomic%20stimulus"&gt;stimulus&lt;/a&gt; plans. "When governments design fiscal stimulus packages, it is important that they consider employment-related goals, including explicit employment growth targets," the report concluded.

"In the world, there remains a huge untapped labour potential, and economic growth and development could be much higher if everyone was given the chance of a decent job."

The two federal &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;senators&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; are not sure if they will be backing &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;President Barack Obama's&lt;/a&gt; $819 billion dollar stimulus plan, in spite of approval of the bill given by the House of Representatives on Wednesday. The bill will support Nebraska with around $378 million to help the state budget for the next two years, and will also give the state an extra $230 million to be spent on infrastructure construction and repair.

Nebraskan Sen. &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Nelson"&gt;Ben Nelson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;) said allotting $1.1 billion for medical research was troublesome. Nelson wants to see more jobs created for Nebraskans, and believes the bill is not truly stimulus, but rather constitutes additional spending. &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Johanns"&gt;Sen. Mike Johanns&lt;/a&gt; agreed mostly with Nelson, but also pointed out the stimulus money for the National Endowment for the Arts as a form of job creation.

Nelson stated that Nebraska will receive around $250 million dollars for highway construction from the stimulus plan, with no need for the state to match the funding. Around 27 billion dollars in highway funds are found in stimulus appropriations, which Nelson said he supported as a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Appropriations"&gt;Senate Appropriations Committee&lt;/a&gt;. The package is also said to set aside money to help build hospitals in rural areas, as well as community health centers. Money for the construction and repair of veterans medical facilities, and funding to help drinking and wastewater infrastructure are also included.

Sen. Johanns commented that he thinks none of it will be paid for, but instead will be funded by floating debt.

These attacks come after a rocket was fired at Israel from inside &lt;a href="Gaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;. Another rocket was fired into Israel after the attacks. An armed faction of the group &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks. 

The rockets were fired after Israel carried out raids on &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; tunnels which Israelis say smuggle weapons into Gaza. Gazans maintain that the tunnels are their only source of food and water because of crippling economic blockades enforced by Israel. The attack on the tunnels was carried out after a roadside bomb killed one Israeli soldier and wounded three others. 

Both Hamas and Israel have claimed separate ceasefires after one of the bloodiest strings of violence in the history of Gaza that left 1,400 &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; dead including as many as 400 children and 100 women. 12 Israeli soldiers and 3 civilians were also killed during the violence that began on December 27th, and ended just two days before the inauguration of &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;President Obama&lt;/a&gt; on January 18th when Israel declared a &lt;a href="w%3Aunilateral"&gt;unilateral&lt;/a&gt; ceasefire.

Sources indicate that Israeli prime minister &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; is calling a meeting of security advisors to discuss how to respond to rocket fire stemming from Gaza.

Today the newly appointed &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;U.S ambassador to the UN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Rice"&gt;Susan Rice&lt;/a&gt;, said she supported the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;UN general assembly's&lt;/a&gt; insistence that Israel must investigate possible &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20crime"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt; committed in Gaza. War crimes that members of the UN have charged Israel with include the bombing of multiple UN schools killing refugees, and the use of white phosphorus in densely populated civilian areas. 

&lt;a href="w%3ASecretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;UN secretary-general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; has said that there will also be a separate UN investigation into the attacks on UN schools which killed scores of refugees that had been taking shelter there.

During the message, Cartwright states that "This is a special message" and announces a Scientology conference this coming weekend at the grand ballroom of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHollywood%20and%20Highland"&gt;Hollywood &amp; Highland Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; where she has a speaking engagement. The message ends with a toll free number to call to RSVP. ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has obtained audio of the message, which is displayed near the end of this report.
Cartwright, who also voices the roles of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Muntz"&gt;Nelson Muntz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20Flanders"&gt;Todd Flanders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKearney%20%28Simpsons%29"&gt;Kearney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Wiggum"&gt;Ralph Wiggum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has been following the Church of Scientology since 1989. She has donated millions of dollars to the Scientology organization, founded by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In 2007, she gave a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 10 million donation to the organization, surpassing donations from actors &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKirstie%20Alley"&gt;Kirstie Alley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="John%20Travolta"&gt;John Travolta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Tom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;. Cartwright earns approximately $400,000 per episode.
♡❤The Simpsons♡❤ executives did not authorize this usage of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aintellectual%20property"&gt;intellectual property&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in this manner. Executive producer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jean"&gt;Al Jean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hollywood%20Reporter"&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, "This is not authorized by us. The Simpsons does not, and never has, endorsed any religion, philosophy or system of beliefs any more profound than Butterfinger bars," referencing the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AList_of_The_Simpsons_media%23Butterfinger_.281990_.E2.80.93_2001.29"&gt;advertisements featuring the Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AButterfinger"&gt;Butterfinger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; candy bar. 

♡❤The Simpsons♡❤ creator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Groening"&gt;Matt Groening&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has not yet issued a statement about Cartwright's recorded message. According to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFOX%20News"&gt;FOX News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Twentieth Century Fox television would not comment on whether or not Cartwright would face disciplinary actions in response to the usage of Bart Simpson's voice in this capacity.

Cartwright begins the message with, "Hey, what's happening man, this is Bart Simpson...", and then says she is kidding and identifies herself as the voice actress. Cartwright proceeds to use her own voice and Bart's voice throughout the message. 

She states, "I'm now auditing on new OT [&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOperating%20Thetan"&gt;Operating Thetan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ] Seven," referring to a level of spiritual state as used within Scientology. Operating Thetan level seven is one of the higher levels in Scientology. Cartwright uses Scientology &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ajargon"&gt;jargon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; while speaking in Bart's voice, saying she will share her "many wins" as an "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAuditing%20%28Scientology%29"&gt;Auditor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " at the Hollywood Scientology event. She invites the listener to the Scientology organization's "Flag World Tour" event on January 31 in Hollywood, California, where she is planned to attend as a speaker.
The message has since been removed from YouTube. Visitors of the link, which appears in several press articles, are now left with a message saying "this video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Twentieth Century Fox." ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ sent an e-mail to FOX regarding the incident, but as of this report, they have not replied.
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReligion%20in%20The%20Simpsons"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been a major theme in ♡❤The Simpsons♡❤. In the episode "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Joy%20of%20Sect"&gt;The Joy of Sect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ", the commentators said that Movementarians were largely inspired by Scientology, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Jones"&gt;Jim Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acult"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeoples%20Temple"&gt;Peoples Temple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHeaven%27s%20Gate%20Cult"&gt;Heaven's Gate Cult&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARajneesh%20movement"&gt;Rajneesh movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARaelians"&gt;Raelians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOneida%20Society"&gt;Oneida Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Tao"&gt;Chen Tao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="w%3AStarbucks%20Coffee"&gt;Starbucks Coffee&lt;/a&gt; is set to close 300 stores and lay off around 6,700 employees. The announcement came after a 69% drop in quarterly profits. 

The company made a profit of $64.3 million in the 13 trading weeks ending in December, down from $208.1 million last year. 

Starbucks chairman &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Schultz"&gt;Howard Schultz&lt;/a&gt; sent a letter to employees explaining the difficulties the company is having in the current economic climate. He placed some of the blame of the loss in sales on other companies such as &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonalds"&gt;McDonalds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADunkin%E2%80%99%20Donuts"&gt;Dunkin’ Donuts&lt;/a&gt;, which have been improving the quality of their coffee.

"These decisions have been made to ensure the company is leaner and prepared to endure a worsening economic climate," said Schultz in the letter.

Two-thirds of the store closures are to take place in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Schultz's salary would also be reduced to $10,000 a year according to the &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;. The closures are on top of the already 600 stores the company announced they would be closing.

Starbucks has approximately 16,000 stores internationally with around 11,000 in the U.S. There are about 172,000 employees in all areas of the company.

DS4SEQ is a single issue party which, as its name suggests, advocates the implementation of &lt;a href="w%3Adaylight%20saving"&gt;daylight saving&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20East%20Queensland"&gt;South East Queensland&lt;/a&gt;. Currently Queensland runs on &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;Australian Eastern Standard Time&lt;/a&gt; (UTC+10).

&lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Queensland"&gt;Queensland's unicameral parliament&lt;/a&gt; is due for election in September, but may be held earlier. The election, like all Australian elections, must be held on a Saturday. The election campaign will run for a minimum of twenty six (26) days and a maximum of fifty six following the issue of the writs.

♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ held an exclusive interview with the DS4SEQ. Answering on behalf of the party was leader Jason Furze.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡Why do you want to form government?♡❤♡

♡❤♡♡❤Jason Furze:♡❤♡♡❤ DS4SEQ would like to gain a sizeable percentage of the primary vote and win a number of seats. As we are a single issue party, voting for us will send a clear message to the major parties and that is: when it comes to the issue of daylight saving, the people of South East Queensland have ben ♡❤[sic]♡❤ ignored for too long, and a dual time zone arrangement must be implemented.

♡❤♡What are the three main policies you will take into this election?♡❤♡

♡❤♡♡❤Jason Furze:♡❤♡♡❤ DS4SEQ is a single issue political party, with the sole policy being: to have Daylight Saving Time introduced into the South East Queensland region, under a dual time zone arrangement aligned to Australian Eastern Daylight Time.

Daylight Saving is a lifestyle and business choice and one that the majority of South East Queenslanders would like to have.

We acknowledge that there are many important issues facing the State of Queensland, however, DS4SEQ do not believe that this is a valid reason to ignore the majority voice who support daylight saving.

♡❤♡How will you address these policies?♡❤♡

♡❤♡♡❤Jason Furze:♡❤♡♡❤ The dual time zone concept that DS4SEQ is proposing is a well thought out compromise to the current situation that obviously does not work. The dual time zone boundary is formed by the inclusion of 15 local council areas and provides a respectful view towards regional and rural Queenslanders, whilst also giving consideration to the view of the majority of residents in South East Queensland. This will allow regional and rural Queensland to continue to operate on Australian Eastern Standard time, whilst the South East Queensland region adopts Daylight Saving Time for 6 months of the year.

♡❤♡If you can't form government, who would you like to see do so?♡❤♡

♡❤♡♡❤Jason Furze:♡❤♡♡❤ DS4SEQ do not offer an opinion of which Party may form the next State Government. However, what we would like to see, is for both major parties to change their thinking about Daylight Saving in Queensland, and seriously consider a dual time zone arrangement for 6 months of the year.

♡❤♡What should Queenslanders keep in mind, when heading to the polls?♡❤♡

♡❤♡♡❤Jason Furze:♡❤♡♡❤ Vote # 1 DS4SEQ and number 2 whicher [♡❤sic♡❤] party you would like to govern the state. Voting DS4SEQ number 1, will not be a wasted vote, because if the Party gains a sizeable percentage of the primary vote, winning a few seats along the way, this will allow us to convince the major parties to change their thinking on the issue of daylight saving.

As demonstrated by the 2007 Queensland Government research, about 70% of constituents within South East Queensland are in favour of daylight saving. State-wide, those who are against are now the minority, and mostly reside in the regional and rural districts outside of the DS4SEQ proposed daylight saving region. It has been 17 years since the people of Queensland have had a say on daylight saving, and in this time there has been a major shift in community attitudes demonstrating an increase in support.

"It's About Time!" that the people of South East Queensland had a voice on this issue. South East Queensland we are your voice, and "It's About Time!"

&lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Victory"&gt;Melbourne Victory&lt;/a&gt; has won the A-League Grand Final against &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide%20United"&gt;Adelaide United&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra%20Dome"&gt;Telstra Dome&lt;/a&gt;. Melbourne came into the match with a in their two legged semi final. Adelaide United came into the match with a win against .

The A-League uses the &lt;a href="w%3APage%20playoff%20system"&gt;Page playoff system&lt;/a&gt; where the winner of the major semi final (1st vs. 2nd) qualifies for the grand final, while the loser plays the winner of the minor semi final (3rd vs. 4th) for the remaining place.
Melbourne midfielder Tom Pondeljak scored the only goal for the match with a long range strike on sixty minutes.

Adelaide were reduced to ten men after ten minutes when Cristiano landed a clumsy elbow to the head of an opposing player. Melbourne was reduced to ten men twenty minutes from time when Danny Allsopp was sent off due to a late fracas.

"It was a great performance. Adelaide were great, they pushed us right to the death but I think we deserved it," Melbourne captain Kevin Muscat said. "Down to 10 men it was a very difficult game for us but the amount of courage and heart the boys showed tonight to get through the game and keep fighting to the end was fantastic. I couldn't ask any more."

"It's one of those things I guess, it changed the game, but what can you do about it now?" Adelaide Captain Travis Dodd told Fox Sports after the match. "We worked hard to keep it scoreless until half-time, to keep our discipline and keep our shape and keep doing what we were doing."

In what the &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; is characterizing as one of the largest recalls in recent history, numerous types of products containing &lt;a href="w%3APeanut"&gt;peanuts&lt;/a&gt; are being recalled in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The FDA issued a recall on Wednesday on food items with peanut paste and other peanut products made after January 1, 2007 at a Peanut Corp. of America (PCA) center in &lt;a href="w%3ABlakely%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Blakely, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. The recall affects over 430 products containing peanut paste or peanut butter from the PCA plant.

U.S. federal inspectors stated &lt;a href="w%3Asalmonella"&gt;salmonella&lt;/a&gt; was found in 12 instances at the plant. So far the incident has been linked to eight deaths, with over 500 individuals sickened from the tainted products.

U.S. Congressman &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Waxman"&gt;Henry Waxman&lt;/a&gt; (D-CA) has announced he will hold a Congressional hearing February 11 before the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20Energy%20and%20Commerce%20Committee"&gt;House Energy and Commerce Committee&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the matter. According to an FDA report, peanut products from the Georgia plant returned to the United States after being exported were prevented from reentering the country in September due to containing "filthy, putrid or decomposed substance, or is otherwise unfit for food," but the products were not tested by federal inspectors. 

According to the FDA, peanut products were shipped from the PCA facility though the company knew they were contaminated. PCA asserted it was unaware products were contaminated before being shipped, and released a statement saying it had "taken extraordinary measures to identify and recall all products that have been identified as presenting a potential risk". The PCA plant has since been shut down after state and federal inspectors discovered mold, roaches, a leaky roof, and other issues at the facility.
Multiple members of Congress have made critical statements about the FDA regarding the incident. "The FDA failing to follow up after this incident, does that mean that products that are not good enough for a foreign country are still good enough for the USA?" said Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Harkin"&gt;Tom Harkin&lt;/a&gt; (D-IA), Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. 

"If the FDA discovered that there was an issue with this product inspection, why didn't they follow up on it? Why didn't they take a closer look at this facility?" asked Representative &lt;a href="w%3ARosa%20DeLauro"&gt;Rosa DeLauro&lt;/a&gt; (D-CT). Representative DeLauro called the actions of PCA "reprehensible and criminal".

Beth Falwell, daughter of PCA's founder Hugh Parnell, told &lt;a href="w%3AWSLS-TV"&gt;WSLS-TV&lt;/a&gt;, the NBC affiliate in &lt;a href="w%3ARoanoke%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Roanoke, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, in a statement Thursday that her brother Stewart Parnell who currently runs the company would not knowingly harm his customers. She believes the FDA report documenting poor conditions at the PCA facility contains inaccuracies. Stewart Parnell did not respond to repeated attempts by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20News%20%26amp%3B%20Advance"&gt;The News &amp; Advance&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ for a comment.

Consumers can find out more information at the website of the FDA, www.fda.gov, which lists the peanut products affected. The FDA list of items containing recalled peanut products is 35 pages long. Individuals can also find out more information about the incident by calling the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, at 1-800-CDC-INFO.

The usually inhibited &lt;a href="w%3ADesert%20Locust"&gt;desert locust&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤Schistocerca gregaria♡❤, which wiles away the months as a solitary, insignificant &lt;a href="w%3Agrasshopper"&gt;grasshopper&lt;/a&gt; can shift into horrifying swarms due to a chemical commonly found in people’s brain, a research showed. 

The solitary and gregarious phases of locusts are so different that they were considered distinct species until 1921. Scientists have known for several years that touching a solitary desert locust on the hind legs, or allowing it to see or smell other locusts, is enough to transform it into the gregarious phase. This week, &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20%28journal%29"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; magazine published strong scientific evidence that the behavioural and physical makeover is effected by &lt;a href="w%3ASerotonin"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt;, a carrier of nerve signals in virtually all animals.

Researchers from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Sydney"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oxford"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Cambridge"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; have pinpointed a single &lt;a href="w%3ANeurochemical"&gt;neurochemical&lt;/a&gt; - serotonin - as the cause of an instinctive behavioural change from the locusts' solitarious phase to become gregarious and form disastrous swarms of millions. 

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) is a &lt;a href="w%3Amonoamine"&gt;monoamine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANeurotransmitter"&gt;neurotransmitter&lt;/a&gt; synthesized in serotonergic &lt;a href="w%3ANeuron"&gt;neuron&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20nervous%20system"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt; (CNS) and &lt;a href="w%3AEnterochromaffin%20cell"&gt;enterochromaffin cell&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href="w%3AGastrointestinal%20tract"&gt;gastrointestinal tract&lt;/a&gt; of animals including humans. Serotonin is also found in many mushrooms and plants, including fruits and vegetables.

In the central nervous system, serotonin plays an important role as a neurotransmitter in the modulation of anger, aggression, &lt;a href="w%3AThermoregulation"&gt;body temperature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMood%20%28psychology%29"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt;, sleep, human sexuality, appetite, metabolism, as well as stimulating vomiting. Keeping serotonin levels high is the aim of many anti-depressant drugs. "Serotonin profoundly influences how we humans behave and interact," said co-author Dr Swidbert Ott, from Cambridge University. "So to find that the same chemical is what causes a normally shy, antisocial insect to gang up in huge groups is amazing," he explained.

Prior to swarming, the locusts undergo a series of physical changes - their body colour darkens and their muscles grow stronger. The 'Phase change' is at the heart of the locust pest problem, for locusts are one of the world's most destructive insect pests, affecting the livelihoods of 1 in 10 people on the planet. "To effectively control locust swarms, we must first understand exactly how it is that a single shy locust becomes a highly social animal that swarms," said University of Sydney Professor Steve Simpson who led the research for almost 20 years.

The 'phase change' was caused by stimulation of sensory hairs on the hind leg of locusts. Professor Simpson's team began to investigate the neurological and neurochemical basis of this effect. Dr Michael L. Anstey, of the University of Oxford, supervised by Professor Simpson, and Dr Stephen M. Rogers, part of &lt;a href="w%3AProfessor%20of%20Zoology%2C%20Cambridge%20University"&gt;Professor Malcolm Burrows&lt;/a&gt;' team at Cambridge, led the research investigating this novel field. "Here we have a solitary and lonely creature, the desert locust. But just give them a little serotonin, and they go and join a gang," said Malcolm Burrows.

Of 13 neurochemicals in locusts that were gregarious (swarming form) and solitarious (non-swarming), the only neurochemical that showed a relationship with social behaviour was serotonin. "It was clear that as locusts switched from solitarious to gregarious, the amount of serotonin in their central nervous systems also increased," explained Professor Simpson. "The next step was to determine if this relationship actually meant that serotonin was the cause of gregarious, and thus swarming, behaviour in locusts," he added.

To do this, the researchers either added serotonin or prevented the production of serotonin in locusts. The results show unequivocally that serotonin is responsible for the behavioural transformation of locusts from solitarious to gregarious. Serotonin was also found to be involved in social behaviour of species across the animal kingdom, including &lt;a href="w%3ACrustacean"&gt;crustaceans&lt;/a&gt;, rats, and humans. 

The team has found that swarm-mode locusts had approximately three times more serotonin in their &lt;a href="w%3AThoracic%20ganglia"&gt;thoracic ganglia&lt;/a&gt;, part of the central nervous system, than their calm, solitary peers. "The question of how locusts transform their behaviour in this way has puzzled scientists for almost 90 years," said co-author Dr Michael L. Anstey, from Oxford University. "We knew the [physical] stimuli that cause locusts' amazing Jekyll and Hyde-style transformation. But nobody had been able to identify the changes in the nervous system that turn antisocial locusts into monstrous swarms. Now we finally have the evidence to provide an answer," he added. 

"The fact that serotonin causes the transition from a shy, antisocial animal into a party animal means that pharmacologically, gregarious locusts are on &lt;a href="w%3AMethylenedioxymethamphetamine"&gt;Ecstasy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AProzac"&gt;Prozac&lt;/a&gt;," said Professor Simpson, who also explained that "(whilst a very good idea, in reality) it would be difficult to create a locust control agent that interferes with serotonin."

Professor Simpson's team has significantly discovered that "locusts offer an exemplar of the how to span molecules to ecosystems - one of the greatest challenges in modern science." He also offered an explanation on the problem of using a locust control agent: "Because social behaviour in so many animals depends on serotonin, if we used unspecific serotonin antagonists in the environment, we run the risk of affecting other processes in locusts, as well as severely impacting animals other than locusts. We would need to be sure that locusts have a unique serotonin receptor that causes phase change, which we haven't identified yet. Any locust control agent would have to be specific for this serotonin receptor in locusts."

&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Valentine%20Riley"&gt;Charles Valentine Riley&lt;/a&gt;, Norman Criddle, and Sir Boris Petrovich Uvarov were also involved in the understanding and destructive control of the locust. Research at &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20University"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; has earlier identified that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. 

This causes the locust to change color, eat much more, and breed much more easily. Green locusts turn bright yellow and gain large muscles. The transformation of the locust to the swarming variety is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. It is estimated that the largest swarms have covered hundreds of square miles and consisted of many billions of locusts.

"&lt;a href="w%3ALocust"&gt;Locust&lt;/a&gt;" is the &lt;a href="w%3Aswarm"&gt;swarming&lt;/a&gt; phase of short-horned &lt;a href="w%3Agrasshopper"&gt;grasshoppers&lt;/a&gt; of the family &lt;a href="w%3AAcrididae"&gt;Acrididae&lt;/a&gt;. The origin and apparent extinction of certain species of locust&amp;mdash;some of which reached 6 inches (15 cm) in length&amp;mdash;are unclear. These are species that can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory. They form bands as &lt;a href="w%3Anymph%20%28biology%29"&gt;nymphs&lt;/a&gt; and swarms as adults — both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly &lt;a href="w%3Apest%20%28organism%29"&gt;damaging crops&lt;/a&gt;. Though there are about 8,000 currently known species of grasshoppers, only 12 form locust swarms. 

In the history of the insect Desert locust (♡❤Schistocerca gregaria♡❤) is probably the most important because of its wide distribution (North Africa, &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20subcontinent"&gt;Indian subcontinent&lt;/a&gt;) and its ability to migrate widely. Adult Desert Locusts grow to between 2-2.5 inches in length, can weigh 0.05-0.07 oz, and are excellent fliers. In religious mythology, the eighth &lt;a href="w%3APlagues%20of%20Egypt%23%20Locusts%20%2810%3A1%20-%2010%3A20%29%20%D7%90%D6%B7%D7%A8%D6%B0%D7%91%D6%B6%D6%BC%D7%94"&gt;Plague of Egypt&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ABible"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATorah"&gt;Torah&lt;/a&gt;, a swarm of locusts ate all the crops of &lt;a href="w%3AAncient%20Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. "The gregarious phase is a strategy born of desperation and driven by hunger, and swarming is a response to find pastures new," Steve Rogers from Cambridge University emphasises.

The extinction of the &lt;a href="w%3ARocky%20Mountain%20locust"&gt;Rocky Mountain locust&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Melanoplus spretus♡❤) in the late 19th century has been a source of puzzlement. Recent research suggests that the breeding grounds of this insect in the valleys of the &lt;a href="w%3ARocky%20Mountains"&gt;Rocky Mountains&lt;/a&gt; came under sustained agricultural development during the large influx of &lt;a href="w%3Agold%20mining"&gt;gold miners&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the underground eggs of the locust. That species of locust had some of the largest recorded swarms.

In the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20locust%20outbreak"&gt;2004 locust outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, the largest infestation of &lt;a href="w%3ADesert%20Locust"&gt;Desert Locust&lt;/a&gt; happened in &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Africa"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Africa"&gt;Northern Africa&lt;/a&gt;, affected a number of countries in the fertile northern regions of &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. These infestations covered hundreds of square miles and involve billions of vegetation-munching insects, which repeatedly devastated agriculture, and cost huge amounts of money to control.

In November, a locusts swarm 3.7 miles (6km) long devastated parts of Australia. Along the process of their active phases, these insects can eat their own bodyweight daily, and can fly swiftly, in swarms of billions covering 60 miles in five to eight hours in search of food. Researchers are now considering the development of sprays that convert swarming locusts back into solitary insects. 

“We hope that this greater understanding of the mechanisms causing such a big change in behaviour will help in the control of this pest, and more broadly help in understanding the widespread changes in behavioural traits of animals.” Malcolm Burrows said. However, according to Paul Anthony Stevenson of Germany's &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Leipzig"&gt;University of Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery will not likely to a short-term pest control solution. 

"To be effective, antiserotonin-like chemicals would need to be applied when the animals are solitary locusts and scarce targets in vast expanses of desert -- about three locusts per 100 square meters (1,076 sq ft)," Stevenson explained. "Current serotonergic drugs are not designed for passing through the insect cuticle and sheath encasing the nervous system, nor are they insect-selective, hence their use is ecologically unjustifiable," he added.

Democrats in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; have sent a letter to new Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, asking her to release funds to reconstruct agencies in the &lt;a href="Gaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;.

The letter also said she should try to reason with &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; to allow people in Gaza in need of medical attention and emergency transportation between the Israel and Gaza border. 

The letter, released to the &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt; news agency, says "[w]e... urge you to express this concern directly to Israeli government officials". The letter says the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Relief%20and%20Works%20Agency%20for%20Palestine%20Refugees%20in%20the%20Near%20East"&gt;United Nations Relief and Works Agency&lt;/a&gt; (UNRWA) need an estimated &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;350 million dollars for rebuilding of Gaza and to provide relief to residents. "Failure to address this humanitarian emergency has the potential to produce a crisis of even more unspeakable proportions," the letter added, "we therefore respectfully request that the State Department release emergency funds to UNRWA for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance".

They also urged Clinton and her team to make a list of "actions taken to date and the strategy you will pursue to address the humanitarian crisis", saying "[w]ith the ceasefire now in effect, it is critical that the United States play a leading role in alleviating the suffering of civilians in Gaza and we respectfully urge your assistance in this task". 

Israel began a ceasefire on January 18 after a &lt;a href="w%3A2008%E2%80%932009%20Israel%E2%80%93Gaza%20conflict"&gt;23 day offensive&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to stop rocket fire into Israel by &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; militants, but has warned that they reserve the right to resume action if the shelling of Israel did not stop.

A court in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; has sentenced a would-be suicide bomber to life imprisonment.

Nicky Reilly, 22, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; convert with learning difficulties and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAsperger%20syndrome"&gt;Asperger syndrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , took the components for three bombs &amp;mdash; glass bottles containing nails, caustic soda and kerosene &amp;mdash; to the Giraffe restaurant in Exeter, south west &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, in May 2008. One bottle exploded as Reilly attempted to assemble the device in the restaurant's toilets, causing him facial and hand injuries. He was arrested outside the establishment.

Reilly entered a plea of guilty to attempted murder and engaging in preparation for terrorism when he appeared in court last year. The judge at the Central Criminal Court in London (known as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Bailey"&gt;Old Bailey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), Mr Justice Calvert-Smith, told him he would serve a minimum of 18 years, saying that it was "sheer luck or chance that [it] did not succeed in its objectives" and that "[t]he offence of attempted murder is aggravated by the fact that it was long-planned, that it had multiple intended victims and was intended to terrorise the population of this country".

Reilly, also known as Mohammad Rashid Saeed Alim, was recruited via an online forum. He is believed to have a mental age of 10 and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADevon%20and%20Cornwall%20Police"&gt;Devon and Cornwall Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said he had been "preyed on, radicalised and taken advantage of" by the members of the forum.

The &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIllinois%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has voted unanimously to remove disgraced Governor &lt;a href="Rod%20Blagojevich"&gt;Rod Blagojevich&lt;/a&gt; from office. He has been replaced by Lt Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APat%20Quinn%20%28politician%29"&gt;Pat Quinn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The 59-0 vote also bars him from holding public office in Illinois ever again.

Blagojevich has been accused of attempting to sell the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Senate seat vacated by &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; when he won the presidency. He has repeatedly denied the charge. Investigators have released secretly recorded tapes of conversations which allegedly feature him talking of how much he could make from the deal.

Officials in the state capital, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpringfield%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Springfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , have immediately removed the ex-governor's name and face from public buildings, including the name plate on his office door. Official portraits have been changed to that of Quinn.

Democratic senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Durbin"&gt;Dick Durbin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; released a statement saying, "It is now time to close this chapter in Illinois history. The state of Illinois is in need of a fresh start".

<h1>Franco-Belgian bank Dexia to restructure, lose 900 jobs</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Franco-Belgian%20bank%20Dexia%20to%20restructure%2C%20lose%20900%20jobs&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="France"&gt;Franco&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; bank &lt;a href="w%3ADexia"&gt;Dexia&lt;/a&gt; has announced it will restructure and cut 3% of its staff after posting a &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;3 billion full-year loss. 

Dexia says it will close operations in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, eastern &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and Scandinavia and reduce business in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Dexia specialises in finance to local governments but also runs standard retail banking outlets in Belgium and France. It will cease proprietary trading as part of the restructuring.

The bank will sell its U.S. bond insurance arm Financial Security Assurance to Assured Guaranty. Dexia Banka Slovensko in &lt;a href="Slovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; will be retained, as will the company's &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; public finance operations. In total, some 900 jobs will be lost.

Dexia will not pay a dividend or management bonuses this year, whilst board members have taken a 50% pay cut. The bank ran into trouble last year as a result of the failure of &lt;a href="w%3ALehman%20Brothers"&gt;Lehman Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent collapse of confidence in the banking system worldwide. The governments of France, Belgium and &lt;a href="Luxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to guarantee the bank's survival, although the bank was not nationalized, and the previous executive management was removed. The bank's current chairman is &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Luc%20Dehaene"&gt;Jean-Luc Dehaene&lt;/a&gt;, a former prime minister of Belgium.

A bishop who denied the deaths of 6 million Jewish people in the Nazi &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Holocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; has apologized to the Pope.

Bishop &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Williamson%20%28bishop%29"&gt;Richard Williamson&lt;/a&gt; was excommunicated by &lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; in 1988 due to his membership of the &lt;a href="w%3ASociety%20of%20St.%20Pius%20X"&gt;Society of St. Pius X&lt;/a&gt;, which did not accept the &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Vatican%20Council"&gt;Vatican II&lt;/a&gt; reforms of the mid-1960s. &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; allowed Williamson back into the Roman Catholic church last Saturday. A few days before that, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; state television, &lt;a href="w%3ASveriges%20Television"&gt;SVT&lt;/a&gt; broadcast an interview in which Williamson said, "I believe there were no gas chambers, yes. I don’t think 6 million Jews were gassed", according to &lt;a href="w%3Aeuronews"&gt;euronews&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; gives the quote as "I believe that the historical evidence is strongly against — is hugely against — 6 million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler".

Williamson has now written to Cardinal &lt;a href="w%3ACastrillon%20Hoyos"&gt;Castrillon Hoyos&lt;/a&gt;, who handles the reintegration of excommunicated Society of Saint Pius X members, to apologize for the distress and problems he caused with his statement. He wrote: "Amidst this tremendous media storm stirred up by imprudent remarks of mine on Swedish television, I beg of you to accept, only as is properly respectful, my sincere regrets for having caused to yourself and to the Holy Father so much unnecessary distress and problems," CNN reports.

The apology was followed by further problems when a fellow member of the Society was quoted in an Italian newspaper as saying he did not know if anyone had died in Nazi gas chambers. &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Associated%20Press"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; say that Father Floriano Abrahamowicz confirmed that the remarks, made to ♡❤La Tribuna di Treviso♡❤, were his.

Last Wednesday, the Pope included a reference to &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust%20denial"&gt;Holocaust denial&lt;/a&gt; at the end of his weekly audience. Recently returned from a trip to the site of one of the camps, he said remembering the Holocaust "induces humanity to reflect on the unpredictability of evil when it conquers the heart of man. The &lt;a href="w%3AShoah"&gt;Shoah&lt;/a&gt; be for all a warning against oblivion, against denial or reductionism, because the violence done against one human being is violence done against all."

Prosecutors claim that the Church is engaged in illicit practices in attempts to sell their alleged self-help material. The Church also faces charges of illegally operating as a pharmacy by illegally treating individuals with prescription medications.

The charges come from an unnamed woman, who in 1998 purchased nearly 140,000&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20franc"&gt;₣&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;30,000) worth of Scientology self-help material which allegedly included prescription drugs. After a few months passed, the woman said she felt like she was being scammed. 

Following several complaints from other unnamed individuals and an investigation, judge Jean-Christophe Hullin ordered the Church's 'Celebrity Center', and the seven managers to be put on trial for fraud and "illegally practicing as pharmacists."
On September 8, 2008 the Church released a statement following the order to stand trial saying that they felt "stigmatized" by the French judicial system. 

"The special treatment reserved for the Church of Scientology Celebrity Center raises questions about the equality of the justice system and the presumption of innocence," the Church said in a statement to the press.

This is not the first time the Church has been accused of fraud in France. They have also been convicted of it several times, including the Church's founder, &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt; who was convicted of fraud in 1978. In 1997 the Church was convicted of fraud in &lt;a href="w%3ALyon"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; and 1999 in &lt;a href="w%3AMarseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt;. The 1978 convictions included Hubbard and his wife at the time, Mary Sue, both now deceased, and two other Scientologists. 
The 1978 convictions included Hubbard and four Scientologists after a seven year investigation into the Church by the French authorities. The court ruled that Hubbard and the others were using Scientology by making fraudulent claims that it was curing people from diseases to "increase the financial revenue" of the Church, and the ruling ordered Hubbard and the Scientologists to serve four years in prison. 

However, Hubbard, along with the four Scientologists fled France, never to return, and never served a prison term.

<h1>Iraqi provincial elections relatively peaceful</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iraqi%20provincial%20elections%20relatively%20peaceful&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Voters in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; have gone to the polls today, the first time in four years, to elect provincial councils.

There have been few reports of the violence or intimidation that have marred previous polls, although there has been violence in the run up to the election. A curfew is in place and airports and borders are closed. Security is tight, with the army guarding polling stations. Three mortar shells (or four flash bombs) are reported to have fallen near a polling station in &lt;a href="w%3ATikrit"&gt;Tikrit&lt;/a&gt;, but without causing injuries. A civilian and six policemen were injured by a bomb in Tuz Khurmatu, north of the capital &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;.

There are more than 14,000 people standing in 14 of Iraq's 18 provinces, with 440 seats up for election. The three &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Kurdistan"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt;-controlled provinces are not voting and the election in &lt;a href="w%3AKirkuk"&gt;Kirkuk&lt;/a&gt; province has been postponed. Provincial councils in the country have a large workforce, meaning that changes of control lead to changes in workforce. This gives winning candidates a lot of power in their local area. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; estimated that unemployment rates in the country were between 18% and 30% in 2006.

Analysts have said that voters are likely to turn away from religious parties and focus instead on nationalist and secular issues. In previous elections, the &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Islam"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; minority in the country had boycotted the polls. Reports say that they are turning out this time, with high turnouts in Sunni-dominated provinces like &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Anbar%20Governorate"&gt;Anbar&lt;/a&gt;, and voting has been extended by an hour to allow more time.

Iraq was a one-party state following a revolution in 1968. Former dictator &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; came to power in an internal coup in 1979. He was removed from power in 2003 following the controversial American-led &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;invasion of the country&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;After the invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the economy and civil structure of the country collapsed but now appears to be stabilising, with more areas being returned to local control and plans by new U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; for American troops to withdraw.

<h1>US Republicans elect first African-American chairman</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Republicans%20elect%20first%20African-American%20chairman&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Committee"&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/a&gt; has elected &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20S.%20Steele"&gt;Michael S. Steele&lt;/a&gt; as its chairman.

Steele, 50, a former &lt;a href="w%3ALieutenant%20Governor"&gt;Lieutenant Governor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, won after the sixth round of voting against &lt;a href="w%3AKaton%20Dawson"&gt;Katon Dawson&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Steele's candidacy was controversial as he was seen as being on the left of his party's base and had been a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Leadership%20Council"&gt;Republican Leadership Council&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-&lt;a href="w%3Asocialconservatism"&gt;social-conservatism&lt;/a&gt; movement. He had denied being a moderate, telling &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;: "I'm proud to say I'm a conservative, have been, always will be."

Steele has an agenda of reform for his party. In addition to the election of &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; of the opposing &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;presidential election of 2008&lt;/a&gt;, the Democrats gained eight seats in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; and 21 seats in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt;. He told the media that the Republicans have an image problem, being thought of as a party that is "insensitive, a party that is unconcerned about minorities, a party that is unconcerned about the lives and the expectations and dreams of average Americans."

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, the Republicans are aware of not being able to reach the country's non-white population, a job made tougher by the Democrats having a very visible mixed-race leader in the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;.

When campaigning for the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, Steele had been a vocal critic of then-President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. In an off-the-record press lunch, which within 24 hours had his name attached to it, he had loudly criticized Bush's handling of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; rescue effort. He told reporters that standing as a Republican at that time was like being branded, saying "I've got an R here, a scarlet letter."

The Republican National Committee develops and promotes the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;'s political platform and coordinates fundraising and election strategy. Steele spent more than $200,000 on his Convention election campaign.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡For our readers who are unaware of your site, could you briefly explain what wikiHow is?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Jack Herrick:♡❤♡ Sure. wikiHow is a collaborative effort to build the world's largest, highest quality how-to manual. Our long term goal is to produce practical instructions on almost every topic in every language. We're quite far from our goals currently, but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger. We currently have just under 50,000 articles [Note: The interview took place just before the 50,000 milestone was met] and over 1,000 featured articles. We hope that in time, we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status. That said, we are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve. However, in terms of readership, we are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia. We get over 14 million unique visitors per month (source:Google Analytics), which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast. 

Like Wikipedia, wikiHow is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software. Our community is full of volunteers from all over the world. That said, we are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects:
<ul>
BULLET::::- We are much smaller. The English wikiHow has only 60 admins, compared to the 1000+ on English Wikipedia. As a result, wikiHow is still at the size that every editor eventually gets to know other editors.
BULLET::::- We are run as a Hybrid Organization - a for-profit company focused on achieving a social good. This has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the non-profit structure at the Wikimedia Foundation. We show opt-out advertising to anonymous visitors rather than ask for donations. Our advertising revenue funds community meetups and has even allowed us to donate over $60,000 to charities such as the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons. (http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Contributions-to-Charity). In addition, we've used our revenue on things like buying carbon offsets to become carbon neutral. (http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Carbon-Neutral)
BULLET::::- Our community culture is focused on wikiLove and civility. As a result some folks believe wikiHow is a more humane and enjoyable place to work than other places online.

</ul>
♡❤Why did you decide to create wikiHow?♡❤♡

♡❤♡JH:♡❤♡ I think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person. Imagine having detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do any activity you could imagine. How much more could you accomplish as an individual if you could learn any activity? I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world. Knowledge is power and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful.

I've been interested in building a comprehensive how-to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow. My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow. eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world. eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software. When I ran eHow, the content was professionally produced and edited. This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets. However, paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices. You either 1) sacrifice on breadth and don't produce the topics that won't interest advertisers, or 2) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that doesn't cost much to write. I wasn't interested in making either of these sacrifices, as I think the world's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive. So ultimately I decided that eHow's model would not build the resource I envisioned. When I discovered Wikipedia, I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs. So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow.

♡❤♡Why did you decide to use a Creative Commons license?♡❤♡

♡❤♡JH:♡❤♡ We use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork (http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork). In my opinion, people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the "right to leave." If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction, they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere. This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license. This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow, the company, will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community. I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far. My hope is that over time, internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others.

That said, when we started out I didn't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver's license. As a result, we made some mistakes along the path. In retrospect, I think we probably should have selected the CC BY-SA license instead of CC-BY-SA-NC. At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects.

♡❤♡wikiHow now has millions of visitors per month. How did you grow the site to the size it is today?♡❤♡

♡❤♡JH:♡❤♡ In December 2008, wikiHow had over 14 million unique visitors according to Google Analytics (Full data: http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics). Quantcast ranks wikiHow as the 135th most popular site in the US. (http://www.quantcast.com/wikihow.com). wikiHow achieved this popularity for a few reasons. First, people around the world are desperate for high quality how-to information. People want to learn more practical skills, and for the most part the internet doesn't provide enough quality information yet. Second, we attracted millions of readers via the virtuous circle of wiki editing: We had some articles of mixed quality, and editors joined to improve those articles, which in turn attracted more readers. We continue to depend on this same virtuous cycle: More readers, means more editors, which creates better instructions, leading again to more readers. It is the same virtuous circle that Wikipedia has enjoyed.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADiscworld"&gt;Discworld&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ author Sir &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Pratchett"&gt;Terry Pratchett&lt;/a&gt; is to appear in a &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; documentary covering a year of his struggle with the brain disorder &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.

Pratchett, 60, asked the BBC to spend a year documenting any decline in his condition and seeing him experiment with various supposed cures. One alleged cure involved firing infrared light at his brain via a helmet invented by a general practitioner doctor. Pratchett also examines the serious research into &lt;a href="w%3Adementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and its cure.

The author has donated £500,000 to the &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20Research%20Trust"&gt;Alzheimer's Research Trust&lt;/a&gt; and his campaigning has raised another £200,000. Pratchett has &lt;a href="w%3APosterior%20cortical%20atrophy"&gt;posterior cortical atrophy&lt;/a&gt;, a rare form of the disease which affects vision, causes him to forget words and makes dressing confusing. He has written 36 ♡❤Discworld♡❤ novels amongst other works and was knighted in the 2009 New Years Honours.

Posterior cortical atrophy is also known as Benson's syndrome. It is the progressive shrinking of the back of the brain. It is a form of Alzheimer's disease, and the wider disease affects some 26.6 million people worldwide.

The documentary - ♡❤Terry Pratchett: Living with Alzheimer's♡❤ - will air on &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Two"&gt;BBC Two&lt;/a&gt; on February 4 at 21:00.

One of the world’s largest media conglomerates &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; has announced that its net profits have plummeted by 95% in the months of October and December quarter. Sony also stated that its revenue fell too by 25%, from $31.64 billion to $23.78 billion.

Sony’s most popular products: TV, digital cameras, mobile phones, and computers were hit by the crisis with a loss of $175.9 million as sales drop. This is a big difference to Sony’s last year profit of $2.2 billion. 

The Chief Financial Officer Nobuyuki Oneda said, "From the second half of September last year, there has been a sudden deterioration in the economy, and with the effects of foreign exchange it has had severe consequences on our business." 

Analyst David Gibson stated that its TV’s sales really dragged them down this quarter.

<h1>DS4SEQ discusses daylight savings in Queensland with Wikinews</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=DS4SEQ%20discusses%20daylight%20savings%20in%20Queensland%20with%20Wikinews&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Wikinews recently held an interview with the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party about the upcoming &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20State%20Election%2C%202009"&gt;Queensland state election&lt;/a&gt;.

DS4SEQ is a single issue party which, as its name suggests, advocates the implementation of daylight saving in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20East%20Queensland"&gt;South East Queensland&lt;/a&gt;. Currently Queensland runs on &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Eastern%20Standard%20Time"&gt;Australian Eastern Standard Time&lt;/a&gt; (UTC+10).
__NoTOC__
<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡Why have daylight saving in only part of the state instead of the whole state?♡❤♡

Daylight Saving in Queensland appears to be a geographical issue. The results of the 1992 Referendum show that the concept was favoured by 51 (out of 89) electorates, all of which were located in the South East Queensland Region. In 2007, the Queensland Government commissioned AC Nielsen to undertake research. The results of this research indicated that 69% of respondants in the South East Queensland region were in favour of Daylight Saving, with only 20% opposed. This research also indicated that 59% of respondants outside of the South East region were opposed to Daylight Saving being introduced into their region. Overall those opposed to daylight saving in Queensland has decreased from 54.5% in 1992 to only 34% against, according to the Nielsen findings. South East Queensland businesses are also overwhelmingly in favour of having Daylight Saving introduced into the region.

As Daylight Saving is not favoured outside of the South East Queensland region, DS4SEQ believe that a dual time zone is a compromise that respects the needs of regional and rural Queenslanders, while also giving fair consideration to the view of the majority of residents in South East Queensland. 

♡❤♡What benefits would daylight saving have for South East Queensland?♡❤♡

By moving the time of the clock against the natural occurring solar movement, Daylight Saving provides allowance for an hour less sunlight in the very early morning, when about 80% of people are sleeping, and provide an hour more sunlight in the evening, which can the be utilised. Benefits that can be gained from the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Promotes more of an outdoor lifestyle
BULLET::::- Allows more time for outdoor family activities
BULLET::::- Allows more time to perform outdoor garden activities e.g. mowing the lawn
BULLET::::- Provides a positive effect on health
BULLET::::- Improved safety and security for evening leisure activities and public transport
BULLET::::- Promotes tourism
BULLET::::- Increases economic efficiences for majority of business dealings from South East Queensland
BULLET::::- Studies have suggested that, in the long term, Daylight Saving can reduce traffic accidents and road fatalities.

</ul>
♡❤♡How soon would you like to see a referendum on the issue of daylight saving?♡❤♡

DS4SEQ are not advocating a referendum. DS4SEQ's political goal is to convince the major parties to change their thinking about Daylight Saving in Queensland, to adapt to Queensland's changing landscape and "It's About Time!" that serious consideration was given to our dual time zone concept.

♡❤♡What questions would you like see on the ballot paper for said referendum?♡❤♡

As per the previous question, DS4SEQ are not advocating a referendum, but seeking a revised policy on Daylight Saving in Queensland, by both major parties, to seriously consider a dual time zone arrangement for 6 months of the year.

♡❤♡Will DS4SEQ keep campaigning for daylight saving in South East Queensland if you don't get any seats in parliament?♡❤♡

The current stance taken by both major parties, in relation to Daylight Saving in Queensland, is outdated, out of touch and inflexible. South East Queenslanders are frustrated that neither major party is currently prepared to explore options on the issue of Daylight Saving.

Whilst DS4SEQ is aiming to win seats in the Queensland Parliament, we believe that gaining a sizeable percentage of the primary vote will send the key message to the major parties that they can no longer ignore: When it comes to the issue of Daylight Saving, the people of South East Queensland have been ignored for too long, and a dual time zone arrangement must be implemented.

With a sizeable percentage of the vote achieved, DS4SEQ will be able to lobby the Government and Opposition, with evidence that constituents are demanding Daylight Saving to be implemented within the South East Queensland region.

A six-pound infant born in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; has six perfectly formed and functional fingers and toes on his hands and feet, so that it isn't considered a disability or &lt;a href="w%3ADeformity"&gt;deformity&lt;/a&gt;, say doctors at &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Luke%27s%20Hospital%20%28San%20Francisco%29"&gt;Saint Luke's Hospital&lt;/a&gt; who were amazed by the oddity.

In a medical rarity, super baby Kamani Hubbard was born two weeks ago with 24 working digits. He is healthy and home with his parents in &lt;a href="w%3ADaly%20City"&gt;Daly City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3APolydactyly"&gt;Polydactyly&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ACongenital%20disorder"&gt;congenital disorder&lt;/a&gt; is not uncommon in humans and animals, including &lt;a href="w%3APolydactyl%20cat"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt;, but to happen on both hands and feet is a rare hereditary condition. 

"Nurses and doctors, looked so normal they couldn't tell, they told me he was six pounds in good health, that was all they said," said Miryoki Gross, Hubbard’s mother. Her baby's specialness didn't even show up on prenatal ultrasounds. "I heard nothing before I gave birth so I'm still in shock, kinda," Gross added. Despite the mother's shock, Kamani's father, Kris, was the first to notice the condition.

Polydactyly (from &lt;a href="w%3AAncient%20Greek%20language"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; means 'πολύς' (polus) or "many" + 'δάκτυλος' (daktulos) "finger[s]"), also known as polydactylism, sexdactyly, hexadactyly, or hexadactylism, is a &lt;a href="w%3Acongenital%20disorder"&gt;congenital physical disorder&lt;/a&gt; consisting of &lt;a href="w%3Asupernumerary%20body%20part"&gt;supernumerary&lt;/a&gt; fingers or toes.

In Kamani's case, however, all of the digits are perfectly formed and function or work normally. "I was in amazement, it took a little time for me to take it all in," said Kris, a postal worker, who has a family history of polydactylism, but none of his relatives can remember it happening on both hands and feet. 

Mostly, cases of polydactyly are surgically corrected. Kris himself had nubs of sixth digits, which were removed during his early childhood, for having been non-functional. "My son has six fingers then I saw toes, and I thought, this is quite unique. Some family members have had six fingers, not completely developed. But not the toes," Kris noted.

"I would be tempted to leave those fingers in place. I realize children would tease each other over the slightest things, and having extra digits on each hand is more than slight. But imagine what sort of a pianist a 12-fingered person would be imagine what sort of a flamenco guitarist, if nothing else think of their typing skills," Dr. Treece remarked.

"I just want him to see what greatness will be in store for him," said Kris. 

Fully developed and functional extra digits on both hands and feet are considered very rare as a genetic trait in medical history, amid some partial development of an extra digit occurs about twice in every 1,000 white male births. Ordinarily, polydactylism appears as an extra piece of non-functional tissue, typically occurring as an extra finger, sometimes with a bone, but no joint.

"It's merely an interesting and beautiful variation rather than a worrisome thing," said Dr. Michael Treece, a St. Luke's Hospital &lt;a href="w%3APediatrics"&gt;pediatrician&lt;/a&gt;, and the OBGYN who delivered Kamani. He has postaxial polydactyly, which is 10 times more likely to occur in black children, and also more likely to appear in boys.

&lt;a href="w%3AGoliath"&gt;Goliath&lt;/a&gt;, a figure in &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Testament"&gt;Old Testament&lt;/a&gt;, was depicted as having had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. 

Blues guitarist &lt;a href="w%3AHound%20Dog%20Taylor"&gt;Hound Dog Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGet%20Carter"&gt;Get Carter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Tich"&gt;Little Tich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AToyotomi%20Hideyoshi"&gt;Toyotomi Hideyoshi&lt;/a&gt; and several other figures in history have had polydactyly. &lt;a href="w%3ASid%20Wilson"&gt;Sid Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, a turntablist of Slipknot, had been born with an extra finger and toe on his hands and feet which were removed shortly after his birth as doctors considered them to be dead.

&lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asymphonic%20rock"&gt;symphonic rock&lt;/a&gt;er &lt;a href="w%3ATarja%20Turunen"&gt;Tarja Turunen&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that the working title for her new album is ♡❤What Lies Beneath♡❤. The album follows on from 2007's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMy%20Winter%20Storm"&gt;My Winter Storm&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

"With ♡❤My Winter Storm♡❤, I chose the name of the album in the early stages and that helped me to create the concept for the album. With the new album, I decided to do it the same way, so I searched for an inspiring title and all the songs are one way or another related to it," Tarja explained.

♡❤My Winter Storm♡❤ was Tarja's first album after she left the Finnish &lt;a href="w%3Asymphonic%20power%20metal"&gt;symphonic power metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Nightwish"&gt;Nightwish&lt;/a&gt;, which she fronted. On the day of the album's release - November 14, 2007 - it was certified gold in Finland for sales in excess of 15,000 copies. On January 2, the album was rereleased in a 2-CD format with 32 tracks, including a guest appearence by &lt;a href="w%3ADoro%20Pesch"&gt;Doro Pesch&lt;/a&gt; and an unreleased song recorded in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; that features the &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing%20Philharmonic"&gt;Beijing Philharmonic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AQingdao%20Symphony%20Orchestra"&gt;Qingdao Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;.

Regarding her next effort, she said "In the last months I've been writing a lot of music for my new album. Songwriting is always an amazing learning experience, and it has been a pleasure to discuss music with different people.
"The album process is still going on and I have more songs that are in the working. It is sounding very promising. The songs are absolutely more mature, wild, and emotional and they sound more me, if I can say so."

The album is tentatively scheduled for release in September, but Tarja has commented that this is not set in stone. "The biggest difference in preparing this new album is that I will be taking the time that I need until the songs are in a shape that I am happy with," she said "No matter how long it takes. I want it to be perfect for me. No hurry; no pressure."

<h1>British PM condemns walkouts</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20PM%20condemns%20walkouts&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; has condemned the workers who staged mass walkout across the country on Friday.

Speaking to the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Economic%20Forum"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; skiing resort of &lt;a href="w%3ADavos"&gt;Davos&lt;/a&gt;, he said that the walkouts were "not the right thing to do". Workers on industrial sites in &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACheshire"&gt;Cheshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHampshire"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATeesside"&gt;Teesside&lt;/a&gt; had left their plants and staged protests outside in sympathy with staff at &lt;a href="w%3ALindsey%20Oil%20Refinery"&gt;Lindsey Oil Refinery&lt;/a&gt; in Lincolnshire, after &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; owner &lt;a href="w%3ATotal%20S.A."&gt;Total&lt;/a&gt; had given a contract to an &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; firm. The firm brought 300 Italian and &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portuguese staff&lt;/a&gt; into the plant.

Brown had made a speech in 2007 where he called for "British jobs for British workers". He explained to the BBC's Politics Show that "when I talked about British jobs, I was taking about giving people in Britain the skills, so that they have the ability to get jobs which were at present going to people from abroad". The government says that &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU) law makes it impossible for them to provide British jobs for British workers in the EU common market. Earlier, the Secretary of State for Health, &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Johnson"&gt;Alan Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, told the BBC that recent &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;European Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; judgments had undermined employment rights but that the government would be pushing the EU to take action if it finds that the foreign workers are 'undercutting' UK citizens. He described the walkouts as "unhelpful", but said he understood the anger over EU workers coming to the UK "on worse terms and conditions to actually get jobs in front of British workers on the basis of dumbing down the terms and conditions." 

The walkouts were also condemned by the opposition &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;. Foreign affairs spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Hague"&gt;William Hague&lt;/a&gt; said that "strikes are never the way forward" and that his party strongly supported the free market in labour in the EU. He said that it was "so unbelievably ridiculous and silly" for Brown to have made the promise on British jobs in the first place.

The government has asked the &lt;a href="w%3AAdvisory%2C%20Conciliation%20and%20Arbitration%20Service"&gt;Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service&lt;/a&gt; (ACAS) to examine the circumstances behind the strikes and see if British workers are being unlawfully excluded, as the GMB union has claimed.

Secondary or sympathetic industrial action has been illegal in the UK since the 1980s. However, the penalties apply only to unions organizing secondary action and not to individual workers walking out.

&lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AArmy%20National%20Guard"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt; have been mobilized in the aftermath of what the governor called "the biggest natural disaster that this state has ever experienced".

An ice storm hit the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state on Tuesday 27 January, bringing down power lines, freezing mains water supplies, bringing down trees and killing at least seven. More than 500,000 homes and business in the state remain without power, with utilities warning that it may take two weeks to restore supplies. State officials and the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; (FEMA) have been issuing generators to the most vulnerable.

The National Guard are visiting homes in Kentucky to check that residents are well. At &lt;a href="w%3AMurray%20State%20University"&gt;Murray State University&lt;/a&gt; the campus lost power and the water was turned off to stop pipes bursting. Students were moved to shelters. The state of &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; was also affected, with 265 people staying in shelters.

States of emergency have been declared in 92 of Kentucky's 120 counties, leading Governor &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Beshear"&gt;Steve Beshear&lt;/a&gt; to call FEMA for assistance. FEMA aid is available to states that have suffered for damages and extraordinary costs above &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;7.4 million.

&lt;a href="w%3AIce%20storms"&gt;Ice storms&lt;/a&gt; are caused when a layer of warm air is caught between two layers of cold air. Water in the frozen layer is melted by the warmer layer but is then reduced to below freezing by the second cold layer. It falls as water, but freezes on contact with the ground, power lines and trees, leading to a build up of ice.

&lt;a href="Yahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;'s Briefcase service is to be closed after ten years.

The directory-cum-internet portal's Briefcase, which offers 30mb of online storage of files up to 5mb, is to be shut down on March 30. Data not retrieved before then will be deleted.

Usage of the service has declined in recent years and has been superseded by other companies' offers. &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has plans for a GDrive service, whilst &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s Live Mesh is now in beta. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21%20Mail"&gt;Yahoo! Mail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; now has unlimited storage, as do paid accounts with the Yahoo!-owned photo- and video-sharing site &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlickr"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A spokesperson for Yahoo! said that "[d]iscontinuing the service will allow us to focus our efforts on more broadly used products".

Yahoo has been losing market value since Microsoft's deal to buy the company fell through in May 2008 and the company has reduced staff. Yahoo! still dominates the market for display adverts but this market is shrinking against targeted search adverts, where Google dominates.

<h1>Supercross: Stewart wins 4th consecutive Monster Energy event in San Francisco, California</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Supercross%3A%20Stewart%20wins%204th%20consecutive%20Monster%20Energy%20event%20in%20San%20Francisco%2C%20California&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AYamaha"&gt;Yamaha&lt;/a&gt; rider &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Stewart%20Jr."&gt;James Stewart&lt;/a&gt; led from start to finish to win his fourth consecutive &lt;a href="w%3AMonster%20Energy"&gt;Monster Energy&lt;/a&gt; series &lt;a href="w%3ASupercross"&gt;Supercross&lt;/a&gt; race at &lt;a href="w%3AAT%26amp%3BT%20Park"&gt;AT&amp;T Park&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco in front of an almost capacity crowd. Australian &lt;a href="w%3AChad%20Reed"&gt;Chad Reed&lt;/a&gt;, despite a slow start, managed second whilst &lt;a href="w%3AKawasaki%20Motors%20Racing"&gt;Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt; rider, &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Villopoto"&gt;Ryan Villopoto&lt;/a&gt;, took third place. 

Having earlier set the fastest time in qualifying, Stewart look determined to win and was a clear winner in his heat race and continued the aggressive approach into the final. Commenting on his win Stewart said ““We are working really hard this year. I felt good tonight and the track was tough. It was an awesome night for me.”

For series championship leader Chad Reed, it was a much tougher story. Seemingly down on speed throughout the night Reed had to battle in the final starting from fourth and moved into second place on lap three. Despite having seventeen laps to catch Stewart the 2008 champion was unable to make any ground on Stewart. Commenting on his disappointment for the night Reed said “Right now that is important and we go back to &lt;a href="w%3AAnaheim"&gt;Anaheim&lt;/a&gt; next weekend, so we will work to get better.”

The win brings Stewart closer to Reed in the championship points table and now only trails by 6 points with more than half the series still remaining. Yamaha rider Josh Grant remains in third place despite failing to make the podium in San Francisco.

The Supercross Lites provided an entertaining battle between James Weimer, &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Dungey"&gt;Ryan Dungey&lt;/a&gt; and Trey Canard. Leading for the first eleven laps Weimer held his line as Dungey tried an aggressive pass that saw him loose control and crash. Canard took advantage to move into second. Managing to restart the race, Dungey eventually caught and passed Canard to finish second behind race winner Weimer.

During the intermission the crowd was thrilled by the &lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%A4germeister%23Sponsorship"&gt;Jägermeister&lt;/a&gt; stunt team which included the rare feat of four riders performing reverse summersaults of the same ramp in sequence. 

The next round of the series takes place in Anaheim California on the 7th February.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=American%20swimmer%20Michael%20Phelps%20laments%20%26quot%3Bbad%20judgment%26quot%3B%20in%20marijuana%20controversy&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Olympic swimmer &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Phelps"&gt;Michael Phelps&lt;/a&gt; has apologized to fans following tabloid pictures of him smoking a &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; pipe.

The 23-year-old multiple gold medalist was pictured yesterday in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Sunday newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20News%20of%20the%20World"&gt;The News of the World&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ apparently using a "&lt;a href="w%3Abong"&gt;bong&lt;/a&gt;" at a &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20South%20Carolina"&gt;University of South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; party he attended whilst visiting a friend on November 6, 2008. He released a statement on his &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; wall, saying "I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment."

The statement said "I'm 23 years old, and despite the successes I have had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner that people have come to expect from me. For this, I am sorry. I promise my fans and the public - it will not happen again."

Marijuana is banned by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Anti-Doping%20Agency"&gt;World Anti-Doping Agency&lt;/a&gt; (WADA) when athletes are actually competing, but not outside of that. Phelps therefore is unlikely to face sanctions from WADA because of the incident. However, US swimming officials and &lt;a href="w%3AF%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20Natation"&gt;Fédération Internationale de Natation&lt;/a&gt; (FINA), the international swimming federation, will comment later on their thoughts about the incident. FINA banned &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Hall%2C%20Jr."&gt;Gary Hall&lt;/a&gt; for three months in 1998 for marijuana use.

Phelps has never failed a drugs test in his career and has previously volunteered for extra testing as part of the sport's campaign against performance enhancing drugs. He does, however, have a conviction for drunken driving gained when he was 19. Phelps was named as the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;U.S. Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt;'s male athlete of the year last week and was also &lt;a href="w%3ASports%20Illustrated"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt; magazine's "Sportsman of the Year" in 2008. He has endorsement contracts with Speedo, Visa, Guitar Hero and Frosted Flakes.

A new historic &lt;a href="w%3APhysics"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt; record has been set by scientists for exceedingly small writing, opening a new door to &lt;a href="w%3AComputing"&gt;computing&lt;/a&gt;'s future. &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APhysics"&gt;physicists&lt;/a&gt; have claimed to have written the letters "SU" at &lt;a href="w%3ASubatomic%20particle"&gt;sub-atomic&lt;/a&gt; size.

Graduate students Christopher Moon, Laila Mattos, Brian Foster and Gabriel Zeltzer, under the direction of assistant professor of physics Hari Manoharan, have produced the world's smallest lettering, which is approximately 1.5 &lt;a href="w%3ANanometre"&gt;nanometres&lt;/a&gt; tall, using a molecular projector, called &lt;a href="w%3AScanning%20tunneling%20microscope"&gt;Scanning Tunneling Microscope&lt;/a&gt; (STM) to push individual &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20monoxide"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; molecules on a copper or silver sheet surface, based on interference of electron energy states. 

A &lt;a href="w%3ANanometre"&gt;nanometre&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AGreek%20language"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;: νάνος, nanos, ♡❤dwarf♡❤; μετρώ, metrό, ♡❤count♡❤) is a &lt;a href="w%3AUnits%20of%20measurement"&gt;unit&lt;/a&gt; of length in the &lt;a href="w%3AMetric%20system"&gt;metric system&lt;/a&gt;, equal to one billionth of a &lt;a href="w%3Ametre"&gt;metre&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., 10 m or one millionth of a millimetre), and also equals ten &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%85ngstr%C3%B6m"&gt;Ångström&lt;/a&gt;, an internationally recognized non-SI unit of length. It is often associated with the field of &lt;a href="w%3ANanotechnology"&gt;nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt;.

"We miniaturised their size so drastically that we ended up with the smallest writing in history," said Manoharan. "S" and "U," the two letters in honor of their employer have been reduced so tiny in &lt;a href="w%3ANanoimprint%20lithography"&gt;nanoimprint&lt;/a&gt; that if used to print out 32 volumes of an Encyclopedia, 2,000 times, the contents would easily fit on a &lt;a href="w%3APinhead"&gt;pinhead&lt;/a&gt;.

In the world of downsizing, &lt;a href="w%3ANanoengineering"&gt;nanoscribes&lt;/a&gt; Manoharan and Moon have proven that information, if reduced in size smaller than an &lt;a href="w%3AAtom"&gt;atom&lt;/a&gt;, can be stored in more compact form than previously thought. In computing jargon, small sizing results to &lt;a href="w%3AX%20%28writing%20speed%29"&gt;greater speed&lt;/a&gt; and better &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20data%20storage"&gt;computer data storage&lt;/a&gt;. 

"Writing really small has a long history. We wondered: What are the limits? How far can you go? Because materials are made of atoms, it was always believed that if you continue scaling down, you'd end up at that fundamental limit. You'd hit a wall," said Manoharan.
In writing the letters, the Stanford team utilized an &lt;a href="w%3AElectron"&gt;electron&lt;/a&gt;'s unique feature of "pinball table for electrons" — its ability to bounce between different &lt;a href="w%3AQuantum%20state"&gt;quantum states&lt;/a&gt;. In the vibration-proof basement lab of Stanford's &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University%20School%20of%20Engineering"&gt;Varian Physics Building&lt;/a&gt;, the physicists used a &lt;a href="w%3AScanning%20tunneling%20microscope"&gt;Scanning tunneling microscope&lt;/a&gt; in encoding the "S" and "U" within the patterns formed by the electron's activity, called &lt;a href="w%3AWave%20function"&gt;wave function&lt;/a&gt;, arranging &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20monoxide"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; molecules in a very specific pattern on a copper or silver sheet surface. 

"Imagine [the copper as] a very shallow pool of water into which we put some rocks [the carbon monoxide molecules]. The water waves scatter and interfere off the rocks, making well defined standing wave patterns," Manoharan noted. If the "rocks" are placed just right, then the shapes of the waves will form any letters in the alphabet, the researchers said. They used the quantum properties of electrons, rather than &lt;a href="w%3APhotons"&gt;photons&lt;/a&gt;, as their source of illumination. 

According to the study, the atoms were ordered in a circular fashion, with a hole in the middle. A flow of electrons was thereafter fired at the copper support, which resulted into a ripple effect in between the existing atoms. These were pushed aside, and a holographic projection of the letters "SU" became visible in the space between them. "What we did is show that the atom is not the limit — that you can go below that," Manoharan said. 

"It's difficult to properly express the size of their stacked S and U, but the equivalent would be 0.3 &lt;a href="w%3ANanometre"&gt;nanometres&lt;/a&gt;. This is sufficiently small that you could copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica on the head of a pin not just once, but thousands of times over," Manoharan and his nanohologram collaborator Christopher Moon explained.

The team has also shown the salient features of the &lt;a href="w%3AHolographic%20principle"&gt;holographic principle&lt;/a&gt;, a property of &lt;a href="w%3AQuantum%20gravity"&gt;quantum gravity&lt;/a&gt; theories which resolves the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20hole%20information%20paradox"&gt;black hole information paradox&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href="w%3AString%20theory"&gt;string theory&lt;/a&gt;. They stacked "S" and the "U" - two layers, or pages, of information — within the hologram. 

The team stressed their discovery was concentrating electrons in space, in essence, a wire, hoping such a structure could be used to wire together a super-fast &lt;a href="w%3AQuantum%20computer"&gt;quantum computer&lt;/a&gt; in the future. In essence, "these electron patterns can act as holograms, that pack information into subatomic spaces, which could one day lead to unlimited information storage," the study states.

The "Conclusion" of the Stanford article goes as follows:

The team is not the first to design or print small letters, as attempts have been made since as early as 1960. In December 1959, &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Prize-winning&lt;/a&gt; physicist &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Feynman"&gt;Richard Feynman&lt;/a&gt;, who delivered his now-legendary lecture entitled "&lt;a href="w%3AThere%27s%20Plenty%20of%20Room%20at%20the%20Bottom"&gt;There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom&lt;/a&gt;," promised new opportunities for those who "thought small." 

Feynman was an American physicist known for the &lt;a href="w%3APath%20integral%20formulation"&gt;path integral formulation&lt;/a&gt; of quantum mechanics, the theory of &lt;a href="w%3AQuantum%20electrodynamics"&gt;quantum electrodynamics&lt;/a&gt; and the physics of the &lt;a href="w%3ASuperfluidity"&gt;superfluidity&lt;/a&gt; of supercooled &lt;a href="w%3ALiquid%20helium"&gt;liquid helium&lt;/a&gt;, as well as work in &lt;a href="w%3AParticle%20physics"&gt;particle physics&lt;/a&gt; (he proposed the &lt;a href="w%3AParton%20%28particle%20physics%29"&gt;parton&lt;/a&gt; model).
Feynman offered two challenges at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society, held that year in &lt;a href="w%3ACaltech"&gt;Caltech&lt;/a&gt;, offering a $1000 prize to the first person to solve each of them. Both challenges involved &lt;a href="w%3ANanotechnology"&gt;nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt;, and the first prize was won by &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20McLellan%20%28nanotechnology%29"&gt;William McLellan&lt;/a&gt;, who solved the first. The first problem required someone to build a working electric motor that would fit inside a cube / inches on each side. McLellan achieved this feat by November 1960 with his 250-microgram 2000-rpm motor consisting of 13 separate parts.

In 1985, the prize for the second challenge was claimed by Stanford &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Newman%20%28scientist%29"&gt;Tom Newman&lt;/a&gt;, who, working with electrical engineering professor Fabian Pease, used &lt;a href="w%3AElectron%20beam%20lithography"&gt;electron lithography&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote or engraved the first page of &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Dickens"&gt;Charles Dickens'&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Cities"&gt;A Tale of Two Cities&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, at the required scale, on the head of a pin, with a beam of &lt;a href="w%3AElectrons"&gt;electrons&lt;/a&gt;. The main problem he had before he could claim the prize was finding the text after he had written it; the head of the pin was a huge empty space compared with the text inscribed on it. Such small print could only be read with an &lt;a href="w%3AElectron%20microscope"&gt;electron microscope&lt;/a&gt;. 

In 1989, however, Stanford lost its record, when &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Eigler"&gt;Donald Eigler&lt;/a&gt; and Erhard Schweizer, scientists at &lt;a href="w%3AIBM%20Almaden%20Research%20Center"&gt;IBM's Almaden Research Center&lt;/a&gt; in San Jose were the first to position or manipulate 35 individual atoms of &lt;a href="w%3AXenon"&gt;xenon&lt;/a&gt; one at a time to form the letters I, B and M using a STM. The atoms were pushed on the surface of the nickel to create letters 5nm tall.

In 1991, Japanese researchers managed to chisel 1.5 nm-tall characters onto a &lt;a href="w%3AMolybdenum%20disulfide"&gt;molybdenum disulphide&lt;/a&gt; crystal, using the same STM method. &lt;a href="w%3AHitachi%2C%20Ltd."&gt;Hitachi&lt;/a&gt;, at that time, set the record for the smallest microscopic &lt;a href="w%3Acalligraphy"&gt;calligraphy&lt;/a&gt; ever designed. The Stanford effort failed to surpass the feat, but it, however, introduced a novel technique. Having equaled Hitachi's record, the Stanford team went a step further. They used a holographic variation on the IBM technique, for instead of fixing the letters onto a support, the new method created them &lt;a href="w%3AHolography"&gt;holographically&lt;/a&gt;. 

In the scientific breakthrough, the Stanford team has now claimed they have written the smallest letters ever - assembled from subatomic-sized bits as small as 0.3 nanometers, or roughly one third of a billionth of a meter. The new super-mini letters created are 40 times smaller than the original effort and more than four times smaller than the IBM initials, states the paper ♡❤Quantum holographic encoding in a two-dimensional electron gas,♡❤ published online in the journal &lt;a href="w%3ANature%20Nanotechnology"&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt;. The new sub-atomic size letters are around a third of the size of the atomic ones created by Eigler and Schweizer at IBM.
A &lt;a href="w%3ASubatomic%20particle"&gt;subatomic particle&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href="w%3AElementary%20particle"&gt;elementary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AComposite%20particle"&gt;composite&lt;/a&gt; particle smaller than an &lt;a href="w%3AAtom"&gt;atom&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AParticle%20physics"&gt;Particle physics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20physics"&gt;nuclear physics&lt;/a&gt; are concerned with the study of these particles, their interactions, and non-atomic &lt;a href="w%3AQCD%20matter"&gt;matter&lt;/a&gt;. Subatomic particles include the atomic constituents &lt;a href="w%3AElectron"&gt;electron&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="w%3AProton"&gt;proton&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href="w%3ANeutron"&gt;neutron&lt;/a&gt;s. Protons and neutrons are &lt;a href="w%3AComposite%20particle"&gt;composite particle&lt;/a&gt;s, consisting of &lt;a href="w%3AQuark"&gt;quark&lt;/a&gt;s.

"Everyone can look around and see the growing amount of information we deal with on a daily basis. All that knowledge is out there. For society to move forward, we need a better way to process it, and store it more densely," Manoharan said. "Although these projections are stable — they'll last as long as none of the carbon dioxide molecules move — this technique is unlikely to revolutionize storage, as it's currently a bit too challenging to determine and create the appropriate pattern of molecules to create a desired hologram," the authors cautioned. Nevertheless, they suggest that "the practical limits of both the technique and the data density it enables merit further research." 

In 2000, it was Hari Manoharan, Christopher Lutz and &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Eigler"&gt;Donald Eigler&lt;/a&gt; who first experimentally observed &lt;a href="w%3Aquantum%20mirage"&gt;quantum mirage&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AIBM_Research"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAlmaden%20Research%20Center"&gt;Almaden Research Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="w%3APhysics"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Aquantum%20mirage"&gt;quantum mirage&lt;/a&gt; is a peculiar result in &lt;a href="w%3AQuantum%20chaos"&gt;quantum chaos&lt;/a&gt;. Their study in a paper published in &lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, states they demonstrated that the Kondo resonance signature of a magnetic adatom located at one focus of an elliptically shaped quantum corral could be projected to, and made large at the other focus of the corral.

<h1>Barclays Bank credit rating cut by Moody's</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Barclays%20Bank%20credit%20rating%20cut%20by%20Moody%27s&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
An international credit ratings agency has downgraded the creditworthiness of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; bank &lt;a href="w%3ABarclays"&gt;Barclays&lt;/a&gt; 

The bank's shares fell on the news that &lt;a href="w%3AMoody%27s"&gt;Moody's&lt;/a&gt; had cut long-term debt ratings from "Aa1" to "Aa3" on the back of fears of &lt;a href="w%3Anationalization"&gt;nationalization&lt;/a&gt;, significant losses and write downs of more bad loans as the recession bites. The bank's financial strength was also downgraded from "C" to "B". Last week, another agency, &lt;a href="w%3AFitch%20Group"&gt;Fitch&lt;/a&gt;, downgraded the bank one step to "AA-minus".

Barclays is one of the few major "High Street" banks in the UK not to have taken any government capital support. The support is given in return for shares, giving the government significant - sometimes even controlling - stakes in other banks, such as &lt;a href="w%3ALloyds%20Banking%20Group"&gt;Lloyds Banking Group&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Bank%20of%20Scotland%20Group"&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group&lt;/a&gt;.

Moody's said that the downgrades "reflect [our] expectation of potentially significant further losses at Barclays as a result of write-downs on credit market exposures as well as an increase in impairments in the UK, which could weaken profitability and capital ratios... [we consider] the systemic importance of the bank and the likelihood of receiving government support in case of need to be high."

The bank has forecast a pre-tax profit of &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;5.3 billion for 2008. It has £36 billion in committed capital equity and expects gross write downs of £8 billion. The bank has recently been referred to the UK's &lt;a href="w%3ASerious%20Fraud%20Office%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;Serious Fraud Office&lt;/a&gt; over allegations of breaching &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s foreign exchange controls, something the bank denies.

It has been nearly 27 years since &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANicole%20%28German%20singer%29"&gt;Nicole&lt;/a&gt;, then a high school student from the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASaarland"&gt;Saarland&lt;/a&gt; in extreme western &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, sang a heartfelt plea for world peace on the stage at the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%201982"&gt;Eurovision Song Contest&lt;/a&gt; held in Harrogate, North Yorkshire in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. That simple message was wrapped with success; she became the first &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; in Contest history to take home the grand prize. The song was a brainchild of her former record producer, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARalph%20Siegel"&gt;Ralph Siegel&lt;/a&gt;, and would be their greatest achievement in their nearly three-decade partnership.

Afterward, she was propelled to stardom across &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; by recording versions of her winning song, "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEin%20bi%C3%9Fchen%20Frieden"&gt;Ein bißchen Frieden&lt;/a&gt;" (♡❤A little peace♡❤), in many European languages. To this day, it was the last winning Eurovision song to top the charts in the United Kingdom; it also has the distinction of being the 500th #1 single on the British charts.

This newfound fame brought her music to audiences across Europe, and in time, into &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; as well. By the end of the 1980s, however, her fame subsided somewhat and she refocused her career domestically. Since 1980, she has released over 30 albums in Germany; her most recent offering, ♡❤Mitten ins Herz♡❤ (♡❤Right into your heart♡❤), was accompanied by a three-month "unplugged" tour that ended in the third week of January.

Now off the road, Nicole spoke with ♡❤Wikinews&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;♡❤ about her past success, her life and career today, and her overall impressions of the Eurovision Song Contest, both past and present. This is the first in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202009"&gt;next contest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.

Workers at two nuclear facilities in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; walked out today in the continuing row about foreign workers.

Contract staff at the &lt;a href="w%3ASellafield"&gt;Sellafield&lt;/a&gt; nuclear recycling facility in &lt;a href="w%3ACumbria"&gt;Cumbria&lt;/a&gt; walked out this morning. They were joined by staff at &lt;a href="w%3AHeysham%20Power%20Station"&gt;Heysham nuclear power station&lt;/a&gt; in neighbouring &lt;a href="w%3ALancashire"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;. Workers at sites affected by industrial action last week walked out again today, with 200 leaving the &lt;a href="w%3AFiddlers%20Ferry%20Power%20Station"&gt;Fiddlers Ferry Power Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACheshire"&gt;Cheshire&lt;/a&gt; and a further 1,000 at &lt;a href="w%3AGrangemouth%20Refinery"&gt;Grangemouth oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALongannet%20power%20station"&gt;Longannet power station&lt;/a&gt;.

The UK Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; had condemned the wildcat action on Sunday, calling it "counterproductive". This drew criticism from unions and opposition parties as he had previously promised "British jobs for British workers" at the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;'s conference in 2008. Brown has insisted that clarification of &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; law and &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;European Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; decisions will allow people to see that discrimination doesn't take place in future.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Business%2C%20Enterprise%20and%20Regulatory%20Reform"&gt;Secretary of State for Business&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Mandelson"&gt;Lord Mandelson&lt;/a&gt; has backed the site's owners &lt;a href="w%3ATotal%20S.A."&gt;Total S.A.&lt;/a&gt;, telling the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that the company had "very strongly refuted" the allegations and that he believed them to be right. He added that the media was "feeding this xenophobia". He added that he hoped the rebuttal would calm the situation, saying "I hope in the light of that people will be reassured and call off these unofficial disputes".

This drew an angry reaction from the &lt;a href="w%3AGMB%20%28trade%20union%29"&gt;GMB union&lt;/a&gt;. General Secretary &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Kenny"&gt;Paul Kenny&lt;/a&gt; said "Peter Mandelson is in denial about the nature of the problem that has given rise to the dispute. Overseas companies are refusing to employ UK nationals on projects in the UK. That is not right".

Lord Mandelson's &lt;a href="w%3AOfficial%20Opposition%20Shadow%20Cabinet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKenneth%20Clarke"&gt;Kenneth Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, also condemned the strikes on behalf of the opposition &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, saying "I understand people being worried about their jobs. I don't think this is the right way to demonstrate it". Some Labour MPs, however, have expressed more sympathy with the strikers. Health Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Johnson"&gt;Alan Johnson&lt;/a&gt; called for EU law to be changed to stop global companies undercutting local wage rates, while former minister &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Field%20%28politician%29"&gt;Frank Field&lt;/a&gt; said "This form of contract clearly cannot go on, where contracts are awarded and there's free movement of companies but those companies then restrict who can apply for those jobs". Another former minister, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hain"&gt;Peter Hain&lt;/a&gt;, also sided with the strikers, blaming the government for "gold plating" EU law (making EU-derived laws stronger or stricter than the original directive) and telling them to "stick up for British workers". The leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Clegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt; sounded a warning note about changing British or EU law, saying that "any attempt to ban EU citizens from jobs in Britain would be a massive own goal. If every EU country followed suit, we would have to cope with a massive influx of British people who work overseas".

The unofficial protests began on Friday, when workers in industrial plants across the country walked out in sympathy with the staff at &lt;a href="w%3ALindsey%20Oil%20Refinery"&gt;Lindsey Oil Refinery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Lincolnshire"&gt;North Lincolnshire&lt;/a&gt;. The refinery are striking over the awarding of a contract by the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;-owned site to an &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; company. This led to 200-300 Italian and &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; workers arriving at the plant. Unions allege that British workers were actively prevented from applying for the jobs.

Protests have continued today outside the refinery.

An &lt;a href="India"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; man has been arrested after threatening to hijack the domestic flight on which he was traveling on Sunday February 1. The flight was traveling between &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGoa"&gt;Goa&lt;/a&gt; in India. The &lt;a href="w%3AIndiGo%20Airlines"&gt;IndiGo Airlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A320"&gt;Airbus A320&lt;/a&gt; was coming in to land at the time.

Jitendra Kumar has been charged with criminal intimidation and endangering life and personal safety. Another man and a woman were also detained but not charged. The jet moved to a quiet area of &lt;a href="w%3AGandhi%20International%20Airport"&gt;Gandhi International Airport&lt;/a&gt; where armed security forces surrounded it, arresting Kumar, who was unarmed.

The jet was carrying 160 people when Kumar, who stood up and refused to sit down when asked by flight attendants. He instead threatened to blow the aircraft up. It was suspected he may be drunk, but he was instead found to have &lt;a href="w%3Alow%20blood%20pressure"&gt;low blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. The other two were arrested as they had been seen speaking to Kumar earlier.

All passengers disembarked safely after about three hours. If convicted, Kumar faces up to seven years in prison. Indian airports and security remain on high alert after terrorist attacks in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; saw gunmen kill 164 people on November 26.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20teenager%20sentenced%20to%20three%20months%20in%20jail%20for%20graffiti&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
On January 11, 2009, an 18-year-old teenager was arrested for writing her nickname, "2shie", on a wall in a café near &lt;a href="w%3AHyde%20Park%2C%20Sydney"&gt;Hyde Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. After the arrest, the teenager, Cheyene Back, pleaded guilty to intentionally or recklessly damaging property.

Cheyene Back had been captured on a &lt;a href="w%3Aclosed-circuit%20television"&gt;closed-circuit security camera&lt;/a&gt; at the "Hyde Park Cafe" on &lt;a href="w%3AMacquarie%20Street%2C%20Sydney"&gt;Macquarie Street&lt;/a&gt;, when she and friends wrote on the wall. Robert Napoli, a co-defendant, has had his case adjourned. They were arrested by police outside the café.

On Tuesday, &lt;a href="w%3AMagistrate%23State_Magistrate"&gt;Magistrate&lt;/a&gt; Ian McRae sentenced Back to three months in jail for her offences, even though Back is a first-time offender in the eyes of the court. Back, who is from &lt;a href="w%3ADaceyville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Daceyville&lt;/a&gt;, immediately lodged an appeal and has been freed on unconditional bail until the appeal is heard.

The owner of the café, Song Wang, is seeking &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;200 in compensation for the damages, however, she does not believe the jail sentence is appropriate.

"Give them more education, provide more education, and let them do some community service," she said. Nevertheless, Back and her friends are habitual offenders, according to Wang.

"This group did came [sic] to my cafe every week around Wednesday or Thursday, once a week," she said. "One day the girl made [graffiti] just inside the toilet and all over the walls and smashed my mirror. They even got on the roof, I don't know how they did that, it was all over."

"You know it was really frustrating when she did it, but the whole group did it, not just her," Wang said. "I think it's a little bit harsh ... Maybe she can do some community work or something, such as letting her clean all the graffiti off, let her know how hard the work is she makes [sic]."

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;a href="w%3ANathan%20Rees"&gt;Nathan Rees&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the jail term. He says everywhere he goes, &lt;a href="w%3Agraffiti"&gt;graffiti&lt;/a&gt; is a problem.
"This sends a message that it's not something that the community regards as a frivolous offence," Rees said. "It is something that affects not only the aesthetic but people's sense of safety around the place if they see graffiti around and they think there is other anti-social behaviour going with it. I think a three-month jail term is absolutely appropriate."

Professor Chris Cunneen, a criminologist at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;University of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; says the jail sentence does not match the scale of the crime.

"In the adult courts, a normal sort of penalty in relation to that offence would be a fine of some sort and some form of restitution for the property owner," Cunneen said.

According to anti-vandalism group "Graffiti Hurts", graffiti costs Australian taxpayers A$500 million each year.

An unnamed 27-year-old man has been arrested and charged with "public order offenses" after he threw a shoe at the &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt; while he was giving a speech at &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%20University"&gt;Cambridge University&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; on Monday February 2. The speech was related to China's and the world economy titled ♡❤See China in the Light of Her Development♡❤. Wen was on a seven day tour of &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, his final stop being the University.

The man yelled "dictator" and asked the crowd, "how can this university prostitute itself with this dictator here, how can you listen...to him unchallenged," as he threw the shoe at the prime minister. Wen called the incident "despicable". The shoe did not hit Wen, but landed a few feet from where he was standing.

"His [the man's] behavior met strong opposition of the entire audience. He was booed and taken away. The whole audience gave long and warm applause to Premier Wen for his excellent speech. The facts demonstrate that the despicable conduct of this troublemaker will win no sympathy, and will not hold back the tide of friendly cooperation between China and Britain," said the Chinese government in a statement posted on their website.

The University has also apologized for the incident saying, "[we] are very sorry that the incident happened and the person will be dealt with according to law. The university is a place for discussion, debate and considered argument, not for shoe throwing". According to authorities, there was never any real threat to the prime minister. The man will appear before a judge on February 10.

On Sunday December 14, 2008, an &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; journalist for an &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper named Muntazer al-Zaidi was tackled by authorities after he threw his shoes at former &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; during a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. Bush had made a surprise last visit to Iraq to sign a new security pact brokered by Iraq and the U.S. Bush ducked as the flying shoes zipped past him, barely missing the now former U.S. president.

In Arabic culture, hitting or throwing shoes at someone so the soles hit them is considered a great insult. In 2003, when Iraqi citizens tore down the statue of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Baghdad, they began to smack it with the soles of their shoes.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; (GM) and &lt;a href="w%3AChrysler"&gt;Chrysler&lt;/a&gt; have both begun to offer &lt;a href="w%3Alayoff"&gt;layoff&lt;/a&gt; packages to their workforces.

The automobile manufacturers have been hard hit in the recent economic downturn and have been forced to seek federal aid from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; government. Reports say that GM's package includes a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;20,000 cash payment and a $25,000 new vehicle voucher. Chrysler will offer a $25,000 vehicle voucher and $50,000 with healthcare and $75,000 without. Both will offer the deal to most &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Auto%20Workers"&gt;United Auto Workers&lt;/a&gt; (UAW) union members - 62,000 at GM, which is seeking to cut 31,500 jobs by 2012.

The two companies have received $13.4 billion in federal loans to keep them operating, but &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; required them to produce viability plans to demonstrate they were making significant cost cuts and labor concessions in return for the money. UAW workers in &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt; earn $28 an hour; their replacements will earn about half that. The UAW's "jobs bank", a system where workers without duties are still paid, has stopped at both companies.

GM is also attempting to engineer a &lt;a href="w%3ADebt%20restructuring"&gt;debt-for-equity&lt;/a&gt; swap, reducing its liabilities from $27.5 billion in unsecured debt to $9.2 billion. It is also seeking to sell a truck manufacturer, the &lt;a href="w%3ADelco%20Electronics"&gt;Delco Electronics&lt;/a&gt; parts group and the &lt;a href="w%3AHummer"&gt;Hummer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASaab%20Automobile"&gt;Saab Automobile&lt;/a&gt; vehicle brands.

The entire motor manufacturing sector has suffered under the economic downturn, with the &lt;a href="w%3AFord%20Motor%20Company"&gt;Ford Motor Company&lt;/a&gt; announcing a $14.6 billion annual loss, although it has not sought federal aid. GM and Chrysler both ran out of operating funds in December, leading to the federal bailout.

On Tuesday, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; saw two of his cabinet nominations withdraw from consideration after issues with their taxes became public knowledge.
Former Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Daschle"&gt;Tom Daschle&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="South%20Dakota"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; withdrew after it was revealed he failed to pay &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;128,203 in taxes. He has since made the payment including a $11,964 interest payment. Obama had nominated him as the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services"&gt;Secretary of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Killefer"&gt;Nancy Killefer&lt;/a&gt;, whom Obama had appointed to the newly created position of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Chief%20Performance%20Officer"&gt;Chief Performance Officer&lt;/a&gt;, withdrew her nomination because she had failed to pay payroll taxes on a household employee. 

"I think I screwed up," Obama said in an interview with CNN. "And, I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again."

Last week, &lt;a href="w%3ATimothy%20F.%20Geithner"&gt;Timothy F. Geithner&lt;/a&gt; survived his nomination and was confirmed as &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;Secretary of the Treasury&lt;/a&gt;, even though it was revealed that he had failed to pay $34,000 in taxes on income earned while working for the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ACompetition%20Commission"&gt;Competition Commission&lt;/a&gt; has decided not to allow a &lt;a href="w%3AVideo%20on%20demand"&gt;video-on-demand&lt;/a&gt; (VOD) service backed by the country's major broadcasters.

&lt;a href="w%3AKangaroo%20%28video%20on%20demand%29"&gt;Kangaroo&lt;/a&gt; would have provided &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AITV"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt; (C4) television programmes for download and streaming to UK internet users from a single interface. At present, each broadcaster has its own system. The Commission said that free-to-view Kangaroo would prevent other VOD providers entering the market because the three broadcasters control the vast majority of original programming in the UK.

Commission chairman Peter Freeman said "Without this venture, &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Worldwide"&gt;BBC Worldwide&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤[the BBC's commercial arm]♡❤, ITV and Channel 4 would be close competitors of each other. We thought that viewers would benefit from better VOD services if the parties... competed with each other".

The Kangaroo consortium issued a statement saying that "the real losers from this decision are British consumers. This is a disproportionate remedy and a missed opportunity in the further development of British broadcasting". &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Grade"&gt;Michael Grade&lt;/a&gt;, executive chairman at &lt;a href="w%3AITV%20plc"&gt;ITV plc&lt;/a&gt;, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ "We are surprised by this decision because we believed that the Kangaroo joint venture, competing in a crowded online world against dominant global brands, was an attractive UK consumer proposition, free at the point of use".

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ says that Kangaroo had been expected to gain approval, albeit with provisos including BBC and C4 programmes being made available elsewhere.

The broadcasters already have their own existing internet download or streaming services with different funding models. The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20iPlayer"&gt;BBC iPlayer&lt;/a&gt; is free to use and carries no advertising; C4's 4oD charges 99p to rent a programme for 48 hours; and the &lt;a href="w%3AITV%20Player"&gt;ITV Player&lt;/a&gt; is supported by advertising.

&lt;a href="w%3ADenny%27s"&gt;Denny's&lt;/a&gt; 1,600 chain restaurants across &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, were slammed for eight hours Tuesday with hungry patrons standing on sidewalks for nearly two hours to take advantage of the $5.99 "&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Slam"&gt;Grand Slam&lt;/a&gt; Breakfast" giveaway.

Denny's, a dining chain with annual revenue of about $900 million, has advertised in a TV commercial Sunday during the &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl%20XLIII"&gt;Super Bowl XLIII&lt;/a&gt; that it would give away its signature breakfast from 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. local time Tuesday, at all its restaurants in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, Canada and Puerto Rico, while supplies lasted. 

Denny's Diner has promoted the iconic dish giveaway heavily, with a bold 30-second appeal ad that aired during the third quarter of the Super Bowl 43 on Sunday, plus another 15-second ad during the post-game show, offering a free breakfast to some 90 million viewers. In addition, it has placed a full-page ad in &lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;'s Monday edition. The promotion was further announced on &lt;a href="w%3AToday%20%28NBC%20program%29"&gt;The Today Show&lt;/a&gt; and notices were also sent out to the chain's "Denny's Breakfast Club" members. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20Sunday%20Night%20Football"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; ad, which was bought to unveil a new promotion for customers squeezed by the recession, may have cost as much as $3 million, said Nelson Marchioli, CEO of Denny's Corp. Super Bowl XLIII's 30-second commercial time slot costs $2.4 million–$3 million for the airtime alone, excluding production and talent costs. 

The game was televised live by the US &lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20Sunday%20Night%20Football"&gt;NBC Sunday Night Football&lt;/a&gt; and Canada's &lt;a href="w%3ACTV%20Television%20Network"&gt;CTV Television Network&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ABayTSP"&gt;BayTSP&lt;/a&gt; has reported that, "as of 10 a.m. Wednesday, commercials that initially aired during NBC's Super Bowl XLIII broadcast subsequently had been watched online more than 28 million times."

"The promotion has a total cost of $5 million U.S., which includes $3 million for the commercial on NBC," said a Denny's spokesman, noting also that the company received about $50 million in news coverage, most of which was positive. According to a Denny's representative, two million people walked through the restaurant chains’ doors Tuesday, and each Denny’s restaurant served an average of 130 Grand Slams per hour.

With the "Denny's Feeds America" promotion, the company has reported 14 million hits on its Web site between Sunday night and Monday morning. Denny's shares rose 6 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $1.98 in afternoon trading. The stock has traded in a range of $1.18 to $4.10 over the past 52 weeks. 
"Denny's free Grand Slam" has ranked in the top 10 &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; searches early Tuesday and fell to No. 18 by the end of the promotion, while “denny s locations” was #9 on &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Trends"&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks fast-rising searches. It has also held spots No. 1 (Denny's) and 7 (Grand Slam) on &lt;a href="w%3ATwitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;'s trending topics. It has generated much chat on Twitter, garnering 1,700 tweets on Tuesday, compared with its average of 59. &lt;a href="w%3ADoritos"&gt;Doritos&lt;/a&gt;, winner of the USA TODAY survey for best Super Bowl spot ad, had 933 mentions after reaching a peak of almost 3,300. 

The idea of the TV ad was to get people to come in and re-evaluate Denny’s Diner. “A lot of people have forgotten what Denny’s is, or they think they know, while we’ve come out with a whole lot of new products. We felt like we needed to jump start the brand,” Denny’s Chief Marketing and Innovation Officer Mark Chmiel said. 

"We're celebrating the Grand Slam this year," Chmiel said. According to the company's financial data, on January 15 Denny's reported systemwide comparable-store sales for the fourth quarter were down 6.1 percent, compared to a 0.2 percent decline from the same period in 2007.

According to Robert Gonzalez, public relations company &lt;a href="w%3AHill%20%26amp%3B%20Knowlton"&gt;Hill &amp; Knowlton&lt;/a&gt; spokesman, Denny's has expected at least 2 million people to eat a free Grand Slam by the end of the promotion. "Every restaurant is packed with people and lines," Gonzalez said. "Everything today is about fast. People are on the go, and they're eating fast food. It's cutting into sit-down dining," he added. 

"Each of the more than 1,500 Denny's were planning to make about 100 Grand Slams an hour," Denny's spokeswoman Cori Rice said. It had predicted it will have served about 1,400 people per location, more than five times the normal volume. "&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Slam"&gt;Grand Slam Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;" is a four-item option on its menu, consisting of two pancakes, two eggs, two strips of bacon and two sausage links. It weighs in at 44 grams of fat, 56 &lt;a href="w%3ACarbohydrates"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; and 770 &lt;a href="w%3ACalories"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt;.

Nationwide, Denny's expected to sell about 2 million Grand Slams — about 15 percent of the annual tally. According to Mark Chmiel, chief marketing operator and executive vice president, the diner chain has reported approximately 2 million meals worth more than $12 million were given away nationwide and each Denny’s restaurant served an average of 130 Grand Slams per hour. It estimated it has earned about $50 million worth of public relations following the free Grand Slam campaign, Chmiel said. 

The company is also experimenting with a Grand Slam Burrito and also has introduced for this year, a Grand Slamwich, which includes eggs, bacon, sausage and cheese between two slices of bread, with a teaspoon serving. "It already has shown strong consumer appeal," said Chmiel. The company has received flood of e-mails and letters proving the positive impact of the Grand Slam campaign and commercials on its customers.

Chmiel also announced he's planning a third major promotion in this year's third quarter, which happens to include another major sporting event, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Series"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;. "That's one we're definitely looking at," he said.

Jobless Paris Winslow of downtown &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt; has joined the long line which stretched from the front door on &lt;a href="w%3AMission%20Street"&gt;Mission Street&lt;/a&gt;, between Fourth and Fifth streets, to the corner of Fourth and up the block. "The economy is getting kind of scary. This line looks like those pictures of soup kitchen lines during the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Depression"&gt;1929 Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;," Winslow said.

"I came all the way from San Francisco for a free $6 meal, Isn't that pathetic? A year ago, I never would have done this. These days I'm willing to put my ego on the back burner," said Stephen Weller, a jobless contractor who waited with his dog, Emmett. California Denny's restaurant managers have issued rain checks (for free chilled meals, as security backed by actual bacon) to anyone who failed to get in by the 2 p.m. deadline. 

A big eater could also "Slam It Up" by adding any two additional items for 99 cents each to their meal. Customers on Tuesday were also handed "bounceback" coupon books that include offers for additional free menu items with purchases. &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Tribune"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt; reporter Kevin Pang has eaten five free Grand Slams on Tuesday at five different Denny's Diners in four hours. He claims to have consumed 4,100 calories at Harwood Heights, 5:36 a.m, at Schiller Park, 6:22 a.m., at Franklin Park, 7:08 a.m., at Melrose Park, 7:41 a.m. and at Grand Slam No. 5 Oak Park, 8:57 a.m.
"The Grand Slam has always been a Denny's favorite. This free offer is our way of reacquainting America with Denny's real breakfast and with the Denny's brand," Denny's CEO Nelson Marchioli said in a statement. In 1977s, the Grand Slam started as a baseball-related promotion in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. Its normal price averages around $5.99. Marchioli said the event was also a way to kick-off its "Year of the Grand Slam" promotion. Denny's claimed it has sold 12.5 million Grand Slams a year. 

"The economy's tough and people are jumping all the way to fast food to try to figure it out. We all use fast food, whether it's for time or convenience or for money. But you can go to Denny's and you don't have to give up a real breakfast and that was the whole focus of our commercial," Marchioli explained. &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonald%27s"&gt;McDonald's&lt;/a&gt; (MCD, &lt;a href="w%3AFortune%20500"&gt;Fortune 500&lt;/a&gt;) has done well during this economic meltdown since the global recession pushes people toward less expensive dining options. 

McDonald's has announced plans Wednesday to open 175 new restaurants in China this year despite the global economic crisis, thereby increasing the number of outlets in China by 17 percent, from 1,050 currently. Last month, McDonald's 2008 net profit has risen 80 percent from 2007 to 4.3 billion dollars.

Marchioli has also introduced Denny's $4 Weekday Express Slam, which is a streamlined version of the Grand Slam. "I want to take back share. For too long, we have allowed others to take share, whether it was &lt;a href="w%3AStarbucks"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; or McDonald's. They're fine competitors and I don't expect to take all their business from them, but I'd like a little bit back," Marchioli noted.

According to Rafi Mohammed, author of "The Art of Pricing," people love free. "It triggers a Pavlovian response in people," said Mohammed. If Pavlov's dogs salivate when a bell rings, Denny's free Grand Slam breakfast has attracted 2 million hungry customers. "I believe free maximizes trial and doesn't devalue a product as long as it is a rare event. Aside from the cost, the major downside is that it attracts customers who truly have no intention of coming back," he added.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Portland"&gt;University of Portland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20behavior"&gt;consumer psychology&lt;/a&gt; professor Deana Julka, people flock to free promotions amid just a few dollars saving because there's nothing in life for free. "So when there's something out there that costs nothing, it creates a psychological rush. Especially in these times when people feel overtaxed or overburden, there's an internal reward people feel by getting something for free," she said. "It's being thrifty and feeling like you beat the system. Free really hits the spot for a lot of people," Julka added.

"Free is an emotional hot button. When free is concerned, there is no downside - or, at least, we don't see the downside immediately. So we overvalue everything that is free. People love free stuff, particularly when money's tight," said Dan Ariely, a business professor at &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20University"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;, author of "Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions."

Experts, however, explained these moves need to be done sparingly, since giveaways can teeter in the balance between desperation and a well designed marketing ploy. "Giving your product away for free is not worth it because it undermines your brand value," said branding expert Rob Frankel, saying people are attached to the idea of it being free, than the actual product itself. 

Free giveaways are not anything new in the food industry. "It just feels good when you can get something for free and not have to worry about it coming out of your wallet," Frankel noted. &lt;a href="w%3ADunkin%27%20Donuts"&gt;Dunkin' Donuts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APanera%20Bread"&gt;Panera Bread&lt;/a&gt; all have had free coffee and food promos last year. "In November, &lt;a href="w%3AStarbucks"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; gave away free cup of coffee to anyone who came in on Election Day. Have you taken a look at how Starbucks is doing now?" Last week it has announced it would shut down 300 stores, in addition to the 600 it already planned to close.
On February 24, IHOP will be offering a free shortstack to every customer to encourage donations (in place of the cost) for Childrens Miracle Network. &lt;a href="w%3AIHOP%20%28restaurant%29"&gt;The International House of Pancakes (IHOP)&lt;/a&gt; is a United States-based restaurant chain that specializes in breakfast foods and is owned by &lt;a href="w%3ADineEquity"&gt;DineEquity&lt;/a&gt;. The chain had more than 1950 restaurants in all 50 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada and Mexico. Since 2006, IHOP's National &lt;a href="w%3AShrove%20Tuesday"&gt;Pancake Day&lt;/a&gt; celebration has raised over $1.85 million. In 2008, over 1.5 million pancakes (12 miles high if they were stacked) were given to customers for donations.

&lt;a href="w%3ADenny%27s"&gt;Denny's&lt;/a&gt; ("Denny's Diner") is a full-service diner/family restaurant chain in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. It operates over 2,500 restaurants in the United States (including &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, Curaçao, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Jamaica, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico, and New Zealand). The resto chain is known for always being open, serving breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert around the clock.

Today, Denny's operates about 1,600 restaurants in all 50 &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20state"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt;s, Canada and &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. There are also about 578 Denny's restaurants in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; operated under a license by a subsidiary of &lt;a href="w%3ASeven%20%26amp%3B%20I%20Holdings"&gt;Seven &amp; I Holdings&lt;/a&gt;, seven Denny's locations in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, and approximately 38 Denny's diners in the United States. Denny's headquarters is now located in &lt;a href="w%3ASpartanburg%2C%20South%20Carolina"&gt;Spartanburg, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, headquarters of the parent company &lt;a href="w%3ATrans%20World%20Corporation"&gt;Trans World Corporation&lt;/a&gt; that acquired Denny's in 1987.

Denny's was historically notable for offering a ♡❤free meal♡❤ to anyone on their birthday. The offer included a limited number of meal options from a special birthday menu. The promotional ritual ceased in 1993, though occasionally individual franchises will continue the tradition. 

In 2008, Denny's has ceased to be in the ranks among the top diner chains in the $83 billion breakfast market, whose top five firms -- McDonald's, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, Burger King and IHOP -- accounted for 22 percent of the volume. "A lot of consumers have written Denny's off their let's-go-there list," said Ron Paul, president of Technomic, a consulting firm. 

&lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl%20XLIII"&gt;Super Bowl XLIII&lt;/a&gt; was an &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20football"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; game between the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Football%20Conference"&gt;American Football Conference&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Steelers"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; (15–4) and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20Conference"&gt;National Football Conference&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href="w%3AArizona%20Cardinals"&gt;Arizona Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; (12–8) to decide the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL) champion for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20NFL%20season"&gt;2008 NFL season&lt;/a&gt;. It was played on February 1, 2009, at &lt;a href="w%3ARaymond%20James%20Stadium"&gt;Raymond James Stadium&lt;/a&gt;in &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%2C%20Florida"&gt;Tampa, Florida&lt;/a&gt;. It has an attendance of 70,774 and 98.7 million viewers. Pittsburgh earned its sixth Super Bowl win, thus securing sole possession of the record for most Super Bowl wins.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; has sacked &lt;a href="w%3ACarol%20Thatcher"&gt;Carol Thatcher&lt;/a&gt; after she compared a &lt;a href="w%3ABlack_people%23Britain"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; tennis player to a &lt;a href="w%3AGolliwogg"&gt;golliwog&lt;/a&gt; doll.

Thatcher, daughter of former &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Thatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;, was dropped from the primetime &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20One"&gt;BBC One&lt;/a&gt; magazine programme ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20One%20Show"&gt;The One Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ after she made the remark after the show in the studio green room. The BBC has declined to name the tennis player in question.

The BBC said that it had hoped for an unconditional apology from the 55-year-old journalist and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AI%27m%20a%20Celebrity%20Get%20Me%20Out%20of%20Here"&gt;I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ winner after staff reported that the remark to management, but a spokesman said "We're no longer going to be working with her on ♡❤The One Show♡❤" when the apology did not appear.

Thatcher's spokesman said that she "never intended any racist comment", adding that "[s]he made a light aside about this tennis player and his similarity to the &lt;a href="w%3ARobertson%27s"&gt;golliwog on the jam pot&lt;/a&gt; when she was growing up. There's no way, obviously, that she would condone any racist comment - we would refute that entirely. It would not be in her nature to do anything like that". He said that "[s]he has summarily apologised".

The BBC said that remarks of this type were "wholly unacceptable". Former &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; cabinet minister &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%20Tebbit"&gt;Lord Tebbit&lt;/a&gt; said "It does seem very odd that &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Ross"&gt;Jonathan Ross&lt;/a&gt; can be back broadcasting having made obscene, insulting remarks on the air, and Carol Thatcher, who said something which is allegedly highly offensive but which I rather doubt was meant to be so, in private, should be banned in this way," adding, "It is probably a bit of a way for the BBC to get back at Carol's mother". The &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt; news agency reports that Thatcher will still work with the BBC on other projects.

The Corporation has suffered scandals in the last few years, such as the recent &lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Brand"&gt;Russell Brand&lt;/a&gt;-Jonathan Ross episode, which saw the two presenters making obscene phone calls to actor &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Sachs"&gt;Andrew Sachs&lt;/a&gt;.

On February 4, 2009 in an attempt to keep &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; safe for young users, MySpace officials stated that they have removed 90,000 sex offender accounts from their website. The social networking site admitted this is double what they anticipated last year. MySpace previously thought the site had 40,000 offender accounts registered.
&lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; attorney general Roy Cooper and &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; attorney general Richard Blumenthal stated that they encourage and seek more social networking sites like MySpace to become safer. After the MySpace team calculated the number of sex offenders on their website they submitted the numbers to both attorneys on Tuesday February 3.

"This shocking revelation, resulting from our subpoena, provides compelling proof that social networking sites remain rife with sexual predators," said Blumenthal.

Both attorneys work with &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and MySpace in an agreement to make their social networking websites safer, especially for young users. They have already made both websites safer by implementing dozens of safeguards and a special features where users older than the age of 18 have limitations searching users less than 18 years of age.

<h1>Queensland state Green party to run environmental lawyer in treasurer's electorate</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Queensland%20state%20Green%20party%20to%20run%20environmental%20lawyer%20in%20treasurer%27s%20electorate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20Greens"&gt;Queensland Greens&lt;/a&gt; will run an environmental lawyer against incumbent treasurer &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Fraser%20%28Queensland%20politician%29"&gt;Andrew Fraser&lt;/a&gt; at this years &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20state%20election%2C%202009"&gt;Queensland state election&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Larissa Waters will be the party's candidate for the seat of &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Coot-tha%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Mt Coot-tha&lt;/a&gt;.

Ms Waters says she is hoping that &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Bligh"&gt;the premier&lt;/a&gt; does not call the election in May, as she [Ms Waters] is expecting her first child that month. 

"I am giving that a fair bit of interest," she said. "Luckily we have a pretty good branch in Mt Coot-tha."

Ms Waters received a 6 per cent swing at the &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20state%20election%2C%202006"&gt;2006 election&lt;/a&gt; in the Brisbane Central electorate, which was then held by then premier &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt;. She then missed out on a federal senate spot by a narrow margin.

While acknowledging Mr Fraser's abilities, Ms Waters questions whether he was still in touch with the electorate.

"This has been the greenest electorate in Queensland is the past few elections," she said. "And Andrew Fraser is just not green enough for this electorate. It think it is more important that he is more connected with the people of his electorate than schmoozing."

The Greens unveiled its policy to open two solar power stations last weekend.

"We can tackle climate change and create long-term jobs, but Labor can't see that because they are blinded by the interests of their big donors - the urban development and coal industries," Ms Waters said.

"The Greens want to give the community and the environment a voice back in State Parliament."

Queensland's unicameral parliament is currently made up of 58 &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; (ALP) members, 25 &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20National%20Party%20of%20Queensland"&gt;Liberal National Party&lt;/a&gt; (LNP) members, one member each from The Greens and &lt;a href="w%3AOne%20Nation%20%28Australia%29"&gt;One Nation&lt;/a&gt; and four independents.

Ms Waters believes there is a general dissatisfaction with both the ALP and LNP and promotes the Greens as an appropriate balance of power, similar to that of the party's federal senate members.

Acknowledging the steps taken by the premier on reforming laws to protect the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Barrier%20Reef"&gt;Great Barrier Reef&lt;/a&gt;, she has said that "[i]t is long overdue. But the package doesn't cover the complete range of issues. We need both 'stick and carrot' in our approach in this area."

Her campaign will be officially launched today on Mt Coot-tha.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the founder of computer software company &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, tried to bring attention to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amalaria"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; while speaking at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATED%20%28conference%29"&gt;TED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conference on Wednesday February 4 in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Beach%2C%20California"&gt;Long Beach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. He did so by releasing a "swarm" of mosquitoes from a jar, into the crowd.

"Malaria is spread by mosquitoes. I brought some. Here I'll let them roam around. There is no reason only poor people should be infected," said Gates as he opened the jar. After waiting a minute, Gates then stated that the mosquitoes were not infected with the disease.

"There is more money put into baldness drugs than into malaria. Now, baldness is a terrible thing and rich men are afflicted. That is why that priority has been set," said Gates jokingly.

The prank was first reported by Dave Morin, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's manager, on the social networking and micro-blogging site &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATwitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Morin stated that "Gates just released mosquito[e]s into the audience at TED and said: 'Not only poor people should experience this,'" followed by a smiley face.

Gates donated nearly &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 170 million to the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative in September 2008 to fund research to fight malaria, and develop a vaccine.

The TED conference, held annually, features, among other things, the latest in technology, science, and politics. People who have previously spoken at the conference include former &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and former vice president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h3>Flight 1549 transcript released</h3>

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; has released a transcript of the conversations that went on between Flight 1549 and the control tower at La Guardia before the airplane crash landed in the Hudson river. All 155 passengers and crew survived and were rescued by a flotilla of boats.

The transcripts reveal that the pilot, Chesley Sullenberger, realised that both engines had been disabled by &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20strike"&gt;bird strike&lt;/a&gt; and that the airplane was about to crash. Controllers attempted to clear runways at nearby airports but Sullenberger had to put down immediately, telling them "we're going to be in the Hudson".

The transcript, in PDF format, can be read &lt;a href="http%3A//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/AWE1549_FAA_Transcript.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>UK house prices rise despite recession</h3>

The average price of a house in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; rose by 1.9% in January, according to a survey by the mortgage lender &lt;a href="w%3AHalifax%20%28United%20Kingdom%20bank%29"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;. This takes the average price to &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;163,966 - a rise, according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Mail"&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, of £100 a day, although their headline and story do not agree on the figure. 

Year-on-year figures show that prices fell 17.2% since January 2007, and 5.1% over the last three months. A similar survey by the &lt;a href="w%3ANationwide%20Building%20Society"&gt;Nationwide Building Society&lt;/a&gt; said that prices fell 1.3% in January. ♡❤The Daily Mail♡❤ says 1.2 million households now have "negative equity", where the mortgage on their property is more than the property is actually worth.

<h3>Bank of England cuts interest rate; European Central Bank waits</h3>

The &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20England"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;, the UK's central bank, has cut interest rates to their lowest level since the bank was created in 1694. The new base rate is to be 1%, down half a percentage point. 

Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Central%20Bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt;, which governs rates in the &lt;a href="w%3AEurozone"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt;, has left its rates unchanged at 2%, but has hinted that a half point cut is possible in the next review in a month's time.

<h3>U.S. new unemployment at 26-year high</h3>

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor"&gt;U.S. Department of Labor&lt;/a&gt; says that initial jobless claims in the country have gone up 35,000 to a seasonally adjusted 626,000. The figures for the last week of January are the highest since 1982. The four-week average, which removes anomolies like strikes and holidays, were up 39,000 to 582,250. America now has 4.788 million people unemployed and claiming welfare. &lt;a href="w%3ABloomberg"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; believes that 7.5% of the working population will be unemployed in figures to be released tomorrow.

Members of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20for%20Wales"&gt;National Assembly for Wales&lt;/a&gt; have condemned a decision by local broadcaster &lt;a href="w%3AITV%20Wales"&gt;ITV Wales&lt;/a&gt; to drop sign language interpretation for the deaf.

South &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APlaid%20Cymru"&gt;Plaid Cymru&lt;/a&gt; AM Jocelyn Davies, a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AWelsh%20Assembly%20Government"&gt;Welsh Assembly Government&lt;/a&gt;, pointed out that the decision "means that deaf &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Sign%20Language"&gt;British Sign Language&lt;/a&gt; users in Wales will no longer have access to local news". &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; AM &lt;a href="w%3AEleanor%20Burnham"&gt;Eleanor Burnham&lt;/a&gt; went further, saying it was "an outrageous decision which it seems has been taken without any consultation with deaf people at all, which is appalling".

ITV Wales announced that they were "discontinuing the signed 20 second headlines every weekday" after 23 years and that doing so would bring the Welsh local news programme &lt;a href="w%3AWales%20Tonight"&gt;Wales Tonight&lt;/a&gt; "in line with all other ITV regions". They added that "ITV will continue to meet its licence obligations for signing across its family of channels" and that the bulletin would keep its optional subtitling. The move apparently has the blessing of media regulator &lt;a href="w%3AOfcom"&gt;Ofcom&lt;/a&gt;.

The Wales Deaf Broadcasting Council said that it was a "severe blow" and that it was "very concerned that no consultation with the deaf community has taken place about this decision, neither by ITV Wales nor Ofcom".

Plaid's &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Price"&gt;Adam Price&lt;/a&gt; said "I am... concerned about the very short notice given for implementation of this decision. I hope that this is not an attempt by ITV Wales to achieve a fait accompli".

ITV has been scaling back its public service broadcasting commitments recently, saying it wished to stop producing and airing local news at all. Ofcom has already allowed the weekly amount of news on ITV Wales to fall from five hours and twenty minutes to four hours.

The disease was spotted during a routine check-up. She is likely to be hospitalised for ten days.

"Justice Ginsburg had no symptoms prior to the incidental discovery of the lesion during a routine annual checkup in late January at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland," the Supreme Court announced.

Ginsburg underwent sugery and had chemotherapy for colorectal cancer in 1999; her mother and husband also suffered from cancer.

She was appointed to the Supreme Court by President &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, and is considered to be on the liberal wing of the nine-member court.

A spokesman for President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; said that Obama's thoughts and prayers are with Ginsburg.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Cancer%20Society"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, the one-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is 24%, and the five-year survival rate is 5%.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; announced on Thursday that he was renaming and expanding an office created by former President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Office%20of%20Faith-Based%20and%20Neighborhood%20Partnerships"&gt;White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships&lt;/a&gt;.

"No matter how much money we invest or how sensibly we design our policies, the change that Americans are looking for will not come from government alone," Obama said, while announcing the new office at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Prayer%20Breakfast"&gt;National Prayer Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;. "There is a force for good greater than government."

"The goal of this office will not be to favor one religious group over another — or even religious groups over secular groups," Obama elaborated. "It will simply be to work on behalf of those organizations that want to work on behalf of our communities, and to do so without blurring the line that our founders wisely drew between church and state."

&lt;a href="w%3AJoshua%20DuBois"&gt;Joshua DuBois&lt;/a&gt;, the 26-year-old &lt;a href="w%3APentecostalism"&gt;Pentecostal&lt;/a&gt; minister who led the &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008"&gt;Obama campaign&lt;/a&gt;'s religious outreach program, will direct the new White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.

In an interview, DuBois said, "The President is still very much committed to clear constitutionality and legality in this program. He’s committed to nondiscrimination."

When asked if the office would work with religious groups like the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;, DuBois said, "There’s no picking or choosing or cherry-picking of groups. That was allowed before, but it will not be the practice moving forward."

"President Obama has put the cart before the horse," said the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;'s senior legislative counsel, Christopher Anders. "He is expanding the Bush administration's faith-based initiative without putting the most important safeguards in place. The President has created a more powerful office with a greater ability to shovel federal taxpayer dollars to religious groups, but civil-rights protections are being deferred for later study and decisions."

<h3>Clarkson calls British Prime Minister Gordon a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'</h3>
&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; television presenter and newspaper columnist &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Clarkson"&gt;Jeremy Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; has told journalists in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, that UK Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; is a "one-eyed Scottish idiot".

The remark caused outrage amongst &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; politicians with some calling for the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; to sack him. Clarkson has since apologised.

<h3>U.S. gay spouses entitled to benefits, says judge</h3>
&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Court of Appeals Judge &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Reinhardt"&gt;Stephen Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; has ruled that same-sex marriages must be treated the same as straight marriages by authorities when it comes to healthcare and benefits rights. He also said that the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional.

The judge was ruling in a specific administrative dispute process, so the judgment does not set a wider precedent.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; swimmer &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Phelps"&gt;Michael Phelps&lt;/a&gt; has been banned from competition and his training stipend revoked for three months by &lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Swimming"&gt;USA Swimming&lt;/a&gt; after Phelps was photographed smoking from a glass pipe, often used for smoking &lt;a href="w%3Acannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt;. The picture was published last Sunday by British &lt;a href="w%3ATabloid"&gt;tabloid&lt;/a&gt; News of the World.

USA Swimming, which is the governing body of swimming in the United States, however said that no "anti-doping" rules had been violated.

"This is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated, but we decided to send a strong message to Michael because he disappointed so many people, particularly the hundreds of thousands of USA Swimming member kids who look up to him as a role model and a hero," it stated. "Michael has voluntarily accepted this reprimand and has committed to earn back our trust."

Phelps has also lost sponsor &lt;a href="w%3AKellogg"&gt;Kellogg&lt;/a&gt;, who said that it would not renew its deal with the swimmer next month.

Phelps won a record eight gold medals at the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Olympic%20Games"&gt;2008 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in Beijing last year, and has since become one of the world's most famous athletes.

The future of &lt;a href="w%3AMircosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Flight%20Simulator"&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/a&gt; series is uncertain after the company fired all of Flight Simulator's developers this January. Microsoft still insists that it is "committed" to the series, although the ACES studio, which develops the simulator, was closed when the company shed 5000 jobs.

Nels Anderson, the founder of &lt;a href="w%3AFlightsim.com"&gt;FlightSim.com&lt;/a&gt;, a MSFS enthusiast website, called it a "dark day" for the simulation market. "Microsoft have apparently cancelled a 27 year franchise. Flight sims were one of the few things about Microsoft people actually liked. It made them money and had an enormous following. To cancel something like that is an amazing thing to do," he said in an interview with the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.

Derek Davis, who is the editor of the PC Pilot Magazine, however, said that there could be a bright side to the news: "I don't know what the eventual fate of Microsoft's Flight Simulator series will be, but I think we're going to see a rise in sales and an increase in third-party development. There is now some stability to be had — we're all going to be using FSX for some time — and that is going to make it far easier for developers to produce new aircraft," he said. &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Flight%20Simulator%20X"&gt;Flight Simulator X&lt;/a&gt; (FSX) is the current edition in the series.

The Flight Simulator series is possibly the longest-running computer game series ever, with the first version of the game released back in 1982. It is known, not only for its official releases, but also for its dedicated fan base, which has produced large amounts of third-party addons for the game.

Prior to the dissolution of the ACES studio, an eleventh version of Flight Simulator was planned for release in about a year and a half. Also in development at the studio at the time of its closure was &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Train%20Simulator"&gt;Microsoft Train Simulator&lt;/a&gt; 2, which was expected to be released this year.

Dr. Qadeer filed a petition at the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad%20High%20Court"&gt;Islamabad High Court&lt;/a&gt; against the government, to address his detention and house arrest. He was freed and now lives as a "free citizen," but the terms upon which he and the government agreed remain secret.

He sent his regards to &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAsif%20Ali%20Zardari"&gt;Asif Ali Zardari&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AYousaf%20Raza%20Gillani"&gt;Yousaf Raza Gillani&lt;/a&gt;, and the Interior Adviser, and thanked them for their stance opposing his detention. 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Secretary of State &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; said she was "very much concerned" about Khan's release. One of the spokesmen, Gordon Duguid, said Khan "remains a serious proliferation risk" and releasing him would be "extremely regrettable". Gillani has rejected such remarks, saying that Dr. Qadeer's network has been dismantled and said that he has been released under Court orders.

On Monday, Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AShah%20Mehmood%20Qureshi"&gt;Shah Mehmood Qureshi&lt;/a&gt; tried to calm international worries. He reiterated that Khan's network had been broken up and said that the government reserves the right to appeal the court's ruling.

Khan, who is now 72 years old and has received treatment for &lt;a href="w%3Aprostate%20cancer"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;, told reporters that he was finished with nuclear work and plans to devote himself to education.

At least one fisherman has died and 134 others were rescued on &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Erie"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; off the shores of &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; after an eight mile wide piece of ice broke off the frozen lake's ice shelf and began to drift. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; says the unidentified man who died fell into the water while trying to find a way off the ice. Rescuers were able to get him out of the water, but he died while being flown to a nearby hospital for treatment.

The Coast Guard also said that the fishermen were warned that the ice could break, but many didn't believe there was any danger.

"We were in no danger. We knew there was enough ice out there," said &lt;a href="w%3ASwanton%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Swanton, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; resident Norb Pilaczynski, one of those rescued from the ice. Before heading onto the already broken ice, they made a makeshift bridge from wooden pallets to get to and from the shore, but the ice shifted and the bridge was destroyed. It left all 135 people stranded more than 1,000 yards from the shoreline.

The ice in most parts of the lake can be up to two feet thick, but on Saturday temperatures rose above freezing, with winds of over 35 miles per hour. The combination of both high winds and temperatures, broke the thick ice into dozens of large pieces.

&lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20County%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Ottawa County&lt;/a&gt; sheriff Bob Bratton called those who avoided the warnings "idiotic".

"What happened here today was just idiotic. I don't know how else to put it," stated Bratton. The rescue operation took nearly five hours to complete. Lake Erie is the fourth largest lake of the five &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Lakes"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., but the smallest by volume, and the tenth largest fresh water lake in the world. 

Several helicopters were called in from &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATraverse%20City%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Traverse City&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="w%3AC-130"&gt;C-130&lt;/a&gt; was also used to survey the lake which was flown in from &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20City%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Elizabeth City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
&lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Victory%20FC"&gt;Melbourne Victory FC&lt;/a&gt; has advanced through to the 2008-9 A-League Grand Final after defeating &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide%20United"&gt;Adelaide United&lt;/a&gt; in their 2-leg Semi Final. Melbourne will now host the winner of the Adelaide verses &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20Roar"&gt;Queensland Roar&lt;/a&gt; Preliminary Final. In a &lt;a href="w%3APage%20playoff%20system"&gt;top four finals series&lt;/a&gt;, which the A-League uses, the Preliminary Final is a final played between the qualifying Semi Final (1st vs. 2nd) and the winner of the elimination Semi Final (3rd vs. 4th) for the remaining spot in the &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Final"&gt;Grand Final&lt;/a&gt;.

Melbourne handed Adelaide a four goal to none thumping in the second leg of the semi final. Adealaide did not look like they were in the match after Archie Thompson slotted home a goal in the tenth minute.

Carlos Hernandez produced three assists and scored a goal in the 48th minute. Hernandez had flown in from representing Coasta Rica in a World Cup qualifier.

Michael Lynch of The Age described Adelaide's performance as "inept and embarrassing, lacking wit, verve, invention or ideas."

"It will be interesting to see what happens when Carlos [Hernandez] is really fit as well, when he's had a bit of a rest. He was supurb for us tonight," said Melbourne captain Kevin Muscat.

"After everything we spoke about last week, coming in and getting a positive result and working hard, it just didn't happen and at this level that's not acceptable...we'll have a long hard look at ourselves this week and see if we want to be here, and on that performance you would say no," said Adelaide captain Travis Dodd, ruing his sides defeat.

"The motivation has to be there, we're playing for a grand final spot, to host a grand final, and if that's the best we can do then...you have to wonder where we're at. I guess it is going to be a week of soul searching we have to get our act together for Queensland's game," added Dodd.

Melbourne won the game four goals to one and the semi final six goals to none.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; – 
&lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20Roar"&gt;Queensland Roar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has advanced through to the 2008-9 A-League Preliminary Final, after defeating the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Coast%20Mariners"&gt;Central Coast Mariners&lt;/a&gt; in their 2-leg Semi Final. Queensland will now travel to Adelaide for the Preliminary Final. In a &lt;a href="w%3APage%20playoff%20system"&gt;top four finals series&lt;/a&gt;, which the A-League uses, the Preliminary Final is a final played between the qualifying Semi Final (1st vs. 2nd) and the winner of the elimination Semi Final (3rd vs. 4th) for the remaining spot in the &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Final"&gt;Grand Final&lt;/a&gt;.

Queensland lead one goal to zero after a back and forth first half. The Mariners pressed early keeping Queensland to their own half in the first three minutes. Queensland created a number of opportunities down the other end to no avail. The Queenslanders missed from a corner and were unlucky to have an offside decision go against them. Michael Zullo fired off a shot from close range only for it to be saved.

The Mariners fired right back. They secured a free kick 20 metres out from goal. The kick went was saved and resulted in a corner. Queensland cleared the ball from their penalty area. The Mariners jumped on a number of Queensland mistakes, taking three shots on goal in the space of two minutes.

Queensland then applied pressure down the Mariners end resulting in a goal to Mitchell Nichols. This goal was Nichols third in three games and fifth for the season.

The two teams then trade shots at goal with neither team scoring. Mariners midfielder Nigel Boogard was booked by referee Peter Green on 38 minutes. Paul O'Grady was booked on fort five minutes.

At half time, the Mariners substituted Andrew Clark with Sasho Patrovski.

Not dissimilar to the start of the first half, the second began with Queensland pushing forward. The pressure, however did not last as long as the Mariners did in the first half. Queensland reneged the Mariners pressure, resulting in a goal in the forty ninth minute to Matthew McKay.

The Mariners hit back with a late consolation goal to Nik Mrdja in the sixty fifth minute. Two Mariners players were booked in the space of about five minutes nearing the end of the game. Dean Heffernan on eighty minutes and John Hutchinson on eighty five.

Queensland won the game two goals to one and the semi final four goals to one.

On February 3, 2009, the Government of &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; released a list of 85 &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabian%20most%20wanted%20list"&gt;most wanted suspected terrorists&lt;/a&gt;.
In the days that followed, close to a dozen former &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20captive"&gt;Guantanamo captives&lt;/a&gt; were identified, among those were 85 men and boys.

Guantanamo has held &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20captives%20in%20Guantanamo"&gt;129&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi&lt;/a&gt; captives. 113 of the Saudi captives have been set free or transferred to Saudi custody. Most former captives were held, for a time, at the &lt;a href="w%3ACare%20rehabilitation%20center"&gt;Care rehabilitation center&lt;/a&gt;. The center is described as a humane facility. The intent of the center was to re-educate and re-integrate into mainstream Saudi society. It employed counseling, lectures, and generous financial assistance upon graduation.

The program was described as successful. It was held up as a model, and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; encouraged neighboring countries, like &lt;a href="Yemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, to set up similar rehabilitation and reintegration programs.

Then in January 2009, two former Guantanamo captives, and alumni of the rehabilitation program, &lt;a href="w%3ASa%27id%20Ali%20Jabir%20Al%20Khathim%20Al%20Shihri"&gt;Sa'id Ali Jabir Al Khathim Al Shihri&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AISN%20372"&gt;ISN 372&lt;/a&gt;♡❤) and &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Hareth%20Muhammad%20al-Oufi"&gt;Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Oufi&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AISN%20333"&gt;ISN 333&lt;/a&gt;♡❤) appeared in a threatening &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; video. Said Jabir identified himself as the second in command of &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaida%20in%20the%20Arabian%20Peninsula"&gt;Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.
Up until this video became public the Saudi government had claimed the program was a complete success.

The two men were among the men listed on the most wanted list. It has been reported that eleven former captives are on the list. The Saudi government hasn't officially identified the former Guantanamo captives in any English language press release; however, reporters and researchers have identified eight former Guantanamo captive on the list, in the English media.

In addition to Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Oufi and Sa'id Ali Jabir Al Khathim Al Shihri the other six former captives identified in English language media are:
&lt;a href="w%3AAdnan%20Al-Sayegh"&gt;Adnan Al-Sayegh&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤(&lt;a href="w%3AISN%20105"&gt;ISN 105&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤, 
&lt;a href="w%3AYusuf%20Al%20Jebairi%20Al%20Shahri"&gt;Yusuf Al Jebairi Al Shahri&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤(&lt;a href="w%3AISN%20114"&gt;ISN 114&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤,
&lt;a href="w%3AOthman%20Al-Ghamdi"&gt;Othman Al-Ghamdi&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤(&lt;a href="w%3AISN%20184"&gt;ISN 184&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤,
&lt;a href="w%3ATurki%20Mashawi%20Al%20Aseery"&gt;Turki Mashawi Al Aseery&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤(&lt;a href="w%3AISN%20185"&gt;ISN 185&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤,
&lt;a href="w%3AMurtadi%20Muqrim"&gt;Murtadi Muqrim&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤(&lt;a href="w%3AISN%20187"&gt;ISN 187&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤,
&lt;a href="w%3AJaber%20Jabran"&gt;Jaber Jabran&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤(&lt;a href="w%3AISN%20188"&gt;ISN 188&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤.

The transfer of Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Oufi and Sa'id Ali Jabir Al Khathim Al Shihri is widely used as an example of the difficulties in distinguishing which captives no longer posed a threat, and could safely be sent home. All the review boards of these men had recommended that they continued to pose a sufficiently serious threat to the U.S. and that they should remain in U.S. custody.

Six of the eight former Guantanamo captives who ended up on the Saudi's most wanted list following their release from Saudi custody were transferred in spite of all their &lt;a href="w%3AAdministrative%20Review%20Board"&gt;annual review boards&lt;/a&gt; recommending their continued detention.

Of the 300 former captives transferred from Guantanamo since authorities started conducting formal reviews in 2004 three quarters were transferred after officers sitting on a board or &lt;a href="w%3ACombatant%20Status%20Review%20Tribunal"&gt;tribunal&lt;/a&gt; had recommended their transfer. Of these eight men only Adnan Al-Sayegh and Jabir Jabran were sent home because their annual review had recommended their release. Adnan Al-Sayegh's repatriation to Saudi custody was authorized on August 16, 2005, and he was repatriated on May 19, 2006. Jabir Jabran's repatriation was authorized on June 26, 2006, and he was repatriated on February 21, 2007.

The other six men, those not recommended for transfer, were all transferred on November 9, 2007. These six were among thirteen Saudis repatriated that day. Eleven of which were repatriated in spite of the recommendations of their review boards.

<h1>American baseball star Rodriguez admits to using performance enhancing drugs</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=American%20baseball%20star%20Rodriguez%20admits%20to%20using%20performance%20enhancing%20drugs&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Major%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; third baseman &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Rodriguez"&gt;Alex Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt;, a star player for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt;, admitted in an interview on sports network &lt;a href="w%3AESPN"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; that he used &lt;a href="w%3Aperformance-enhancing%20drugs"&gt;performance-enhancing drugs&lt;/a&gt; during 2001 through 2003.

"I did take a banned substance, and for that, I'm very sorry," Rodriguez told ESPN's &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Gammons"&gt;Peter Gammons&lt;/a&gt;. "When I arrived at Texas in 2001 I felt an enormous amount of pressure to perform."
Last week, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASports%20Illustrated"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that the baseball player, nicknamed 'A-Rod', tested positive in 2003 for &lt;a href="w%3Ametenolone%20enanthate"&gt;Primobolan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Atestosterone"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt;, two substances that have been banned by the league.

During the 2003 season, Rodriguez was playing with the &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Rangers"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, and was the winner of the &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award"&gt;American League MVP Award&lt;/a&gt; and was American League leader in &lt;a href="w%3Ahome%20run"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s. According to sources, Rodriguez was one of 104 players named on a list for testing positive before the 2003 season. The list was compiled in an attempt to determine whether the MLB needed to begin conducting random drug testing.

After the initial report Rodriguez was approached by ♡❤Sports Illustrated♡❤ while he was training for the upcoming season in a &lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; area gym. At that time, Rodriguez told the reporter "You'll have to talk to the union." He was also asked for an explanation of his positive test result, to which he commented "I'm not saying anything." According to a report by ESPN, sources claim that Rodriguez was aware that he tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.

However, in December 2007 after United States Senator &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20J.%20Mitchell"&gt;George J. Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMitchell%20Report"&gt;Mitchell Report&lt;/a&gt; was released accusing such teammates of Rodriguez as &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Clemens"&gt;Roger Clemens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Giambi"&gt;Jason Giambi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Pettitte"&gt;Andy Pettitte&lt;/a&gt; of steroid use, Rodriguez appeared on ABC's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A60%20Minutes"&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and declined the use of any steroid or performance-enhancing drug. He also commented that he would not need the help of steroids, stating, "I've never felt overmatched on the baseball field. I felt that if I did my, my work as I've done since I was, you know, a rookie back in Seattle, I didn't have a problem competing at any level."

Senator Mitchell stated in a prepared comment yesterday that his report had only named that players that "had received credible evidence of their illegal purchase, possession, or use of performance enhancing substances." He pointed out that he "did not have access to the results of the 2003 drug testing, and to this day I do not know which players tested positive then."

The MLB declined to comment directly on the situation due to court orders on the list of names and documents, but did release a statement: "Information and documents relating to the results of the 2003 MLB testing program are both confidential and under seal by court orders. We are prohibited from confirming or denying any allegation about the test results of any particular player by the court orders. Anyone with knowledge of such documents who discloses their contents may be in violation of those court orders."

Rodriguez has been one of the many prominent American baseball players over the past few years who has been linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Other prominent names include both the arguably greatest hitter and pitcher in Major League Baseball history, &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Bonds"&gt;Barry Bonds&lt;/a&gt; and Roger Clemens. Bonds, the all-time Major League record holder for home runs, was linked to steroid use during the &lt;a href="w%3ABALCO%20scandal"&gt;BALCO scandal&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, while Clemens was named in the Mitchell report in December of 2007.

The executive vice president for labor relations of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, stated that league commissioner &lt;a href="w%3ABud%20Selig"&gt;Bud Selig&lt;/a&gt; was "disturbed" by the linking of steroid use to Rodriguez. Commenting for the league, he said, "Because the survey testing that took place in 2003 was intended to be non-disciplinary and anonymous, we cannot make any comment on the accuracy of this report as it pertains to the player named."

The report by ♡❤Sports Illustrated♡❤ also made the claim that Gene Orza, the COO of the &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association"&gt;Major League Baseball Players Association&lt;/a&gt; informed Rodriguez of a random drug test that occurred in September of 2004, a test that was supposed to remain confidential to all players. The MLBPA denied the accusations, commenting "There was no improper tipping of players in 2004 about the timing of drug tests. In September 2004 MLBPA attorneys met with certain players, but we are not able to confirm or deny the names of any players with whom we met." When asked in the ♡❤Sports Illustrated♡❤ report, Orza declined to comment, stating "I'm not interested in discussing this information with you."
The anonymous testing of players was started in 2003 by the MLB, in order to get a brief estimate of how many players were using performance-enhancing drugs, leading to the beginning of the mandatory, penalty-enforced testing that began in 2004. 1,198 players took the "survey test" in 2003, and the results were later stored in a laboratory in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, with codes being used in place of the players names. However, a list of the players actual names that went with the list of codes was kept in a separate office in &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Beach%2C%20California"&gt;Long Beach&lt;/a&gt;, never intended to ever be together with the codes.

In April 2004, federal agents with search warrants raided the two labs looking for information on the 2003 BALCO scandal test results of 10 players, including Barry Bonds. While searching, they found both the list of names and the codes, including the positive test result of Rodriguez. Following the investigation and raid, the MLBPA informed all 104 players on the list that their positive test data had been sized by the federal agents.
Former Major League Baseball star and self-confessed steroid user &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Canseco"&gt;José Canseco&lt;/a&gt; told the media that the news was old, saying "I said in my book ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVindicated"&gt;Vindicated&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that he was a known steroid user before 2000. It's old news. I've been saying this forever. You guys are playing catch-up." In the book, Canseco links Rodriguez to steroids through the claim that he saw him using the drugs. In his first book, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJuiced"&gt;Juiced&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, references to Rodriguez were removed by the publisher of the book because it could not be confirmed that Canseco actually saw Rodriguez taking steroids. According to the publisher, it was only after Canseco passed a lie detector test that information about Rodriguez was allowed into ♡❤Vindicated♡❤.
Current senior advisor to the Texas Rangers &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hart%20%28baseball%29"&gt;John Hart&lt;/a&gt; commented on the situation in an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AMLB%20Network"&gt;MLB Network&lt;/a&gt;. "I think in the climate that we have today, you don't have much shock anymore. Obviously Alex probably is the best player in baseball. This has always been a special talent and the guy has been putting up Hall of Fame numbers since the day he showed up in the big leagues. I've been in the game for almost 40 years and it hurts a little bit, if in fact this is true. It breaks my heart for the game that we have this kind of thing occurring, But at the same time, a lot of people seem to have been caught in this net," he said. 

Since the positive test occurred in 2003 before penalties were instituted, Rodriguez will most likely not be suspended by the MLB as a result of the situation.

<h1>Queensland Premier denies March 28 election</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Queensland%20Premier%20denies%20March%2028%20election&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Despite fuelling speculation of a March 28 election, &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Queensland"&gt;Queensland Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Bligh"&gt;Anna Bligh&lt;/a&gt; has indicated that she will serve a full term. &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Courier-Mail"&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/a&gt; reported that the premier was moving to "tie off issues that could hurt Labor's prospects" in the election.

However, Anthony Chisholm, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; state secretary, has indicated that it does not mean an early election would be called.

"I've got no idea on timing - the Premier has indicated she intends on going full term," he said.

The government move to set up a lobbyist register, a 1998 election promise, and to reined-in judicial entitlements that involved magistrate Di Fingleton.

An inquiry has also been set up to address continuing concerns at &lt;a href="w%3ABundaberg%20Base%20Hospital"&gt;Bundaberg Base Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. The inquiry was announce by health minister Stephen Robertson a day after he said that the issue was dated.

The quick actions to quell these issues encouraged fresh conjecture from the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20National%20Party%20of%20Queensland"&gt;Liberal National Party&lt;/a&gt; that the election would be held next month, possibly on the 28th. This would be legal as the Queensland Electoral Act (1992) requires the election campaign to last between 26 and 56 days.

Early election or not, several minor parties have already nominated candidates for a number of electorates. Notably, The Greens will run environmental lawyer Larissa Waters in Mt Coo-tha against treasurer Andrew Fraser, the Socialist Alliance will run Sam Watson in the premiers South Brisbane electorate and Daylight Saving for South East Queensland will run candidates in South East Queensland electorates only.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=No%20injuries%2C%20deaths%20after%20car-bomb%20explodes%20in%20Madrid%2C%20Spain&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The attack comes three weeks before Basque regional elections and a day after the Spanish Supreme Court banned two nationalist party members from running for office in the upcoming election.

The van exploded around 9:00 a.m. local time (3:00 a.m.&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;) outside the HQ of the building company Ferrovial Agroman, at the Campo de las Naciones. A warning about the pending attack was phoned into the city's local chapter of the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; about 90 minutes before the explosion. The caller said the bomb would explode at 9:00 a.m. local time. No one was injured or killed, but the blast shattered windows in buildings and destroyed about 30 vehicles surrounding the blast zone. A nearby railway line and a bridge were also damaged.

Ferrovial is involved in building a &lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20Y"&gt;high-speed train line in the Basque region&lt;/a&gt;, a project criticized by leftist Basque nationalists and &lt;a href="w%3Aecologism"&gt;ecologists&lt;/a&gt; and targeted by ETA in previous attacks. In December 2008, Ignacio Uria, a businessman linked to this project, was shot and killed. The ETA claimed responsibility for the attack. Ferrovial has not commented on the incident.

Citing health reasons, the &lt;a href="w%3AMayor%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Flint%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AFlint%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Flint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Williamson"&gt;Don Williamson&lt;/a&gt; announced Monday at an 11:20 A.M. news conference that he was resigning from office effective Sunday February 15, 2009 at midnight. Williamson, age 75, indicated that he had multiple sinus infections and kidney stones since November 1 and his doctors wanted him to slow down by reducing his schedule.

A number of events has lead to speculation about Williamson's resignation. His interim Police Chief, David Dicks, has been charged with defrauding the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government stemming from the Federal investigation into his father's security company, City Security, and its contract with Career Alliance in January. Further, a recall election was scheduled for February 24. The snap selection of Michael Brown to be the new Flint City Administrator and his current City Administrator Darryl Buchanan to the non-City Charter position of "deputy mayor" last week Wednesday. Last Thursday a press conference, originally announced to explain the switch in City Administrators and the position of "deputy mayor," was canceled. And finally, on Friday the Interim Police Chief David Forystek was replaced with a new Interim Police Chief, John Keahey. This returned Forystek to department's traffic bureau. 

Over the last weekend, Williamson denied the rumors. Buchanan was at the press conference while Brown did not attend.

Williamson is a multi-millionaire. He is majority stockholder and chairman of the publicly traded The Colonel's International Inc. (Nasdaq:COLO).

Williamson first stepped onto the political field by running for Mayor of Flint in 1991 but failed to get out the primary. In 1999 he lost to &lt;a href="w%3AWoodrow%20Stanley"&gt;Woodrow Stanley&lt;/a&gt; in the general election. In 2003 election — the first full term election after the recall of Stanley — Williamson won the office of Mayor, while the city was still under state financial administration, succeeding Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20W.%20Rutherford"&gt;James W. Rutherford&lt;/a&gt; into office.

In 2007, Williamson won a narrow re-election over Dayne Walling. He was only drawing a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1 per year salary. A number of problems have cropped up since then including budget deficits, layoffs, and proposed drag strip.

Some leaders in the community that were surprised at his resignation. The ♡❤Flint Journal♡❤ quoted Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton as stating "I'm shocked." While County Sheriff Robert Pickell stated to the ♡❤Journal♡❤ that he was "absolutely shocked that the mayor resigned." Pickel added, that "with Darryl Buchanan working with Mr. Brown, it will be a good team."

City Councilor, and Williamson opponent, Scott Kincaid is quoted by &lt;a href="w%3AWJRT-TV"&gt;ABC 12 News&lt;/a&gt; as stating that this "was a super-fantastic day" for the city of Flint. City Councilor Jackie Poplar said "Hallelujah!" to ABC 12. 

According to the City Charter, Michael Brown as the Flint City Administrator will take over as Temporary Mayor, with no veto nor ability to remove mayorial appointees with out City Council approval. A primary will be scheduled for the May election date and the general election in August for a replacement mayor.

The recall was based on charges that Williamson mishandled city funds and misstated the status of the city's finances. An additional recall charge according to recall supporters was he disregarded public safety by moving to eliminate 59 police officers and nine firefighters.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27Tim%20Hortons%27%20coffee%20shops%20to%20go%20%27Cold%20Stone%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Hortons"&gt;Tim Hortons&lt;/a&gt;, a popular &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; express coffee and doughnut chain, has announced that they will be co-branding with another popular chain, &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20Stone%20Creamery"&gt;Cold Stone Creamery&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aice%20cream"&gt;ice cream&lt;/a&gt; parlor chain.

The deal includes a total of 100 new stores, at &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CA$&lt;/a&gt;121,690 (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollars"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;100,000) each. Each company will have 50 stores that they will build as, or convert into, dual-operation franchises. Each of the 50 stores will offer menus from each company and be located in 7 states, mostly in the Northeastern U.S.. 

Executives at Tim Hortons believe that mixing the two together is perfect because Tim Hortons makes most of their profit in the morning, while the Creameries are more popular in the evening. The idea proved successful when tested for three months in &lt;a href="Rhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, in two different stores.

"We're very excited about the complementary daypart piece. It's something unique in what we see from a co-branding perspective," said Tim Hortons chief of operations, David Clanachan. Construction has already started and stores are expected to open in May.

Tim Hortons was founded by Canadian ice hockey player &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Horton"&gt;Tim Horton&lt;/a&gt;. The first store opened in &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; in 1964. In July of 2007, there were over 2,700 locations in Canada and 500 in the U.S.. Cold Stone Creamery was founded in 1988 in &lt;a href="w%3AScottsdale%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Scottsdale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. There are over 1,400 operation, in locations such as &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; and the U.S..

&lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippine&lt;/a&gt; fishermen, volunteers and authorities with dozens of fishing boats have joined hands in guiding back to sea about 500 disorientated &lt;a href="w%3AMelon-headed%20Whale"&gt;melon-headed whales&lt;/a&gt; that were stranded in the shallow waters near the mouth of &lt;a href="w%3AManila%20Bay"&gt;Manila Bay&lt;/a&gt; delta in the &lt;a href="w%3ABataan%20Peninsula"&gt;Bataan Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.

The gentle mammals were first spotted swimming back and forth and straying very dangerously close (about a mile or 1.6 kilometers) to the shores of the &lt;a href="w%3ACoast"&gt;coastal&lt;/a&gt; towns of &lt;a href="w%3APilar%2C%20Bataan"&gt;Pilar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOrion%2C%20Bataan"&gt;Orion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAbucay%2C%20Bataan"&gt;Abucay&lt;/a&gt; 135 kilometers northwest of &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; at around at around 4:00 am on Tuesday, said &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;Philippine Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; (PCG) &lt;a href="w%3ACommodore"&gt;Commodore&lt;/a&gt; Luis Tuazon and Bataan Governor Enrique Garcia Jr.

The &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Fisheries%20and%20Aquatic%20Resources%20%28Philippines%29"&gt;Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources&lt;/a&gt; (BFAR) said its has responded to the reported mass "stranding" of whales off &lt;a href="w%3APilar%2C%20Bataan"&gt;Pilar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATerritorial%20waters"&gt;coastal waters&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ABataan"&gt;province of Bataan&lt;/a&gt; where the famous and historic &lt;a href="w%3ACorregidor%20Island"&gt;Corregidor Island&lt;/a&gt; is located. 

Using dozens of fishing boats with machines shut down and bare hands, more than 100 village fishermen and volunteers along with BFAR, local police and &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;Philippine Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; personnel have joined the massive rescue. With great difficulty, the emergency team has waded into the chest-deep water, clapping their hands and hitting the surface to guide and drive the whales farther away from the coastal shore to deeper waters.

"The mammals were at first thought to have been &lt;a href="w%3ADolphins"&gt;dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, but experts then identified them as melon-headed whales," local veterinarian Mariel Flores said. "This type of whale can be easily mistaken for dolphins because of their size and their teeth, which resemble those of dolphins. The mammals have ears that are sensitive to large changes in pressure underwater," she added.
"It looked like they never wanted to leave. They looked sad,” said Rodolfo Joson, a village councilor. Joson and his son, Joey, a fisherman like him, have rushed home at about 4 a.m. to report the pod sighting. “It was still dark when we waded into the water. The whales were about 200 meters from the shore. The water was up to my neck. We first checked their conditions by playing with them. They did not repel us or leave. They were making hooting sounds,” Joson explained the mass beaching. “It seemed they were running away from waters that they didn’t like. Dolphins are happy and strong creatures. They raced with ships,” he added.

A &lt;a href="w%3APost-mortem%20examination"&gt;post-mortem examination&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that four dead whales found beached farther up north in Abucay, Bataan, include two adult females, one of which was pregnant, while the other gave birth to a calf that also died, said Dr. Lemnuel Aragones of &lt;a href="w%3ASubic%20Bay%20Freeport%20Zone"&gt;Ocean Adventure in Subic Freeport&lt;/a&gt; who did the necropsy at the Bataan fisheries office in &lt;a href="w%3ABalanga%20City"&gt;Balanga City&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the first time that such large numbers of dolphins had been stranded in the Philippines. "We are trying to come up with a possible explanation to this unusual occurrence. It could be that the dolphins had lost their bearings and inadvertently ended up on the shallow portion of the coast unable to extricate themselves," said Dr Lemuel Aragones, Associate Professor at the &lt;a href="w%3AUP%20Diliman%20College%20of%20Science"&gt;UP Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology&lt;/a&gt;. 

Dr Aragones, who holds a PhD on Tropical Environmental Studies (Marine Ecology) from Australia's &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Cook%20University"&gt;James Cook University&lt;/a&gt;, explained that "the melon-headed whales of the dolphin family have sophisticated navigation systems that operate on a principle similar to sonar instruments used in submarines. Like humans, dolphins also follow a 'leader' of their pod. It is possible that the leader of this dolphin [pod] had somehow lost its way. In turn, the leader’s acoustic system, which serves as its guidance system, might have been impaired," the marine expert elaborated.

Dr Aragones said "BFAR, UPIESM, and the Ocean Adventure Marine Park in Subic started the Philippine Marine Mammals Stranding Network (PMMSN) in 2005 as a response to cetacean strandings or beachings." She cited the PMMSN training received by BFAR officers in Bataan during Tuesday's mass beaching. She has asked the government to release funds for marine mammal studies.

The two adults had damaged eardrums, Alberto Venturina, the provincial veterinarian, said. "Dolphins with injured eardrums become disoriented, cannot dive for food and are too weak to swim and just flow with the current. If it's a sick leader, the animal needs to be identified and taken out of sight of the rest of the pod so the healthy dolphins could be prodded back to sea," he added."The two animals were identified as melon-headed dolphins, weighing about 250 to 300 kilograms (550 to 660 pounds)," explained Venturina, adding "the third dolphin was only a month old and measured barely a meter long. Its gender had not yet been determined."
According to Nelson Bien, head of the Fisheries Resource and Management Division of BFAR Region III, a &lt;a href="w%3ANecropsy"&gt;necropsy&lt;/a&gt; by BFAR, the provincial veterinarian, and veterinarians from the &lt;a href="w%3ASubic%20Bay%20Freeport%20Zone"&gt;Ocean Adventure in Subic Freeport&lt;/a&gt; has traced the cause of their death to drowning. 

The marine doctors have determined that the marine mammals might have drowned after failing to extricate themselves from the fishing nets or "baklad," explained Dr. Mundita Lim, director of the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau (PAWB) of the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Environment%20and%20Natural%20Resources%20%28Philippines%29"&gt;Department of Environment and Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; (DENR). “There were no injuries to their ears, like visible lesions, but the possibility of an acoustic problem or trauma is still there,” Dr Lim explained, saying, "more tests, like analysis of tissue samples and &lt;a href="w%3AMagnetic%20resonance%20imaging"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; tests will have to be done to see if there were other injuries to the animals not visible externally."

They are sending tissue samples to the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20the%20Philippines%2C%20Los%20Ba%C3%B1os"&gt;University of Philippines in Los Baños, Laguna&lt;/a&gt; for analysis. “If it was something like climate change, then it would be a bigger environmental problem,” Lim added.

A fourth and pregnant one was also found dead in the village of Tortugas in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ABalanga%2C%20Bataan"&gt;Balanga, Bataan&lt;/a&gt;, said Bien, saying they were investigating the incident and would conduct a “water quality and water parameter test” to determine why the dolphins beached to shallow waters. The condition of melon-headed whale found at Talisay River and taken to Ocean Adventure in Subic Freeport has improved amid forced feeding and treatment of its 2 wounds, said Nilo Ramoso, Biologist III, &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20turtle"&gt;Pawikan&lt;/a&gt; Conservation Project.

Dr. Westly Rosario, BFAR Center chief in &lt;a href="w%3ADagupan%20City"&gt;Dagupan City&lt;/a&gt;, has reported that BFAR personnel were also investigating a “problem in the water, probably chemical pollution,” to explain why the dolphins beached and sought shelter in the shallow waters. The dolphins have faced the same direction and their &lt;a href="w%3ABlowhole%20%28biology%29"&gt;blowholes&lt;/a&gt; above water, they seemed to be avoiding something. “The dolphins were behaving in the same way, they have the same action. People were trying to drive them back into the sea but they refused. There could be chemical pollution somewhere which they were avoiding,” Rosario explained.

Dolphins' disorientation is sometimes caused by the changes in &lt;a href="w%3AEarth%27s%20magnetic%20field"&gt;earth's magnetic field&lt;/a&gt; “that cause the dolphins’ navigational mechanisms to go haywire,” Dr. Edgardo Gomez, professor emeritus of the &lt;a href="w%3AMarine%20Science%20Institute%2C%20UP%20Diliman"&gt;University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute&lt;/a&gt;, said, adding that "it could also be chemicals in the water that affected the dolphins, although this should be proven by water tests." Philippine &lt;a href="w%3AMarine%20biology"&gt;marine biologist&lt;/a&gt; Rizza Salinas said a possible cause for the stranding of large pods of distressed whales is that there could have been &lt;a href="w%3ABlast%20fishing"&gt;illegal dynamite fishing&lt;/a&gt; in the area.
“This is very strange. What is also unusual is they appeared disoriented. I am on my way to &lt;a href="w%3ABataan"&gt;Bataan&lt;/a&gt; on board BFAR’s patrol vessel. We will look into the situation. Our patrol boats are also on their way to the area. We are also getting experts on stranding," said BFAR director Malcolm Sarmiento Jr. Sarmiento, explaining that the highest number of stranded dolphins recorded by the BFAR was only 20 to 30. "It's something unusual. It's the first time that such a large &lt;a href="w%3APod"&gt;pod&lt;/a&gt; has entered Manila Bay, and is acting strangely," Sarmiento added.

"Most strandings are caused by &lt;a href="w%3AEarthquake"&gt;seaquakes&lt;/a&gt;, heat wave or disturbances at sea. Such disturbances affect the pressure underwater, which subsequently affects the dolphins’ eardrums and sense of balance, leading to their "disorientation." The creatures then will avoid diving in deeper parts of the ocean and will swim to shallow areas. They came from the north and were headed towards the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20China%20Sea"&gt;South China Sea&lt;/a&gt;," Sarmiento explained, adding that the unusual occurrence may have also been caused when the pod could have been following a sick or injured leader.

Sarmiento has appealed to the public not to inflict harm on the dolphins, which are considered threatened species. "Please do not harm the dolphins because they are already endangered. The authorities should also prevent the people who want to inflict harm on the creatures. They should be arrested, if needed." Melon-head dolphins are considered threatened species — meaning they are likely to become endangered in the future. 

"At around 12 noon, the dolphins were finally guided to the open seas, but residents in &lt;a href="w%3AHermosa%2C%20Bataan"&gt;Hermosa&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AMariveles%2C%20Bataan"&gt;Mariveles&lt;/a&gt; were surprised to see the dolphins near their shoreline, but around 4:30 pm, all the dolphins have left the shoreline and swam towards into deeper waters," said Governor Garcia.

"The dolphins swam parallel back to Abucay, Hermosa, and Manila Bay before they were eventually herded farther offshore. There are theories that this phenomenon was a result of the Monday night &lt;a href="w%3ALunar%20eclipse"&gt;lunar eclipse&lt;/a&gt;. The Fisheries Bureau will know after their tests,” Garcia added. 

Having suspected the dolphins’ habitat must have been disrupted, forcing them to flee and seek refuge in shallow waters, &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20of%20the%20Philippines"&gt;Senate of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMajority%20Leader"&gt;Majority Leader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Miguel%20Zubiri"&gt;Juan Miguel Zubiri&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday asked experts to probe the cause of the sudden appearance of more than 300 electra dolphins near the shores of Pilar town in Bataan province Tuesday morning.

Senator Zubiri wanted the experts to examine the possibility that an earthquake study, involving an undersea experiment using blasting in the South China Sea by the &lt;a href="w%3ALamont-Doherty%20Earth%20Observatory"&gt;Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory&lt;/a&gt; (L-DEO) - a collaborator of &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; - caused the abnormal behavior of the small whales.

Citing an International Union for Conservation of Nature research concluding that the melon-headed whales may have been distracted by the South China Sea study, forcing the dolphins to wander in the shallow waters, Senator Zubiri said that “the earthquake study is a sea floor investigation project in the exclusive economic zone that includes Taiwan, China, Japan and the Philippines for its earthquake research. On top of saving stranded dolphins, we should find the cause for the tragedy in order to avoid them in the future and to be prepared when it occurs again," he explained.

But according to Erlinton Olavare, &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20Institute%20of%20Volcanology%20and%20Seismology"&gt;Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology&lt;/a&gt; (PHIVOLCS) science research specialist, “no significant event was recorded by their stations in Bolinao, Sta. Cruz and Lubag, near Pilar at the time the dolphins were stranded Tuesday."

&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Environment%20and%20Natural%20Resources%20%28Philippines%29"&gt;Department of Environment and Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20L.%20Atienza%2C%20Jr."&gt;Jose L. Atienza, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; said Bataan Gov. Enrique “Tet” Garcia on Wednesday confirmed there was &lt;a href="w%3ABlast%20fishing"&gt;dynamite fishing&lt;/a&gt; in his province. “I asked him [Garcia] and he confirmed it. He also said he was battling this illegal activity,” said Atienza. “The causes of the &lt;a href="w%3ANoise-induced%20hearing%20loss"&gt;acoustic trauma&lt;/a&gt; could have been sound waves caused by dynamite fishing or sounds emitted by passing ships or seaquakes,” Gov. Garcia said. 

"Dolphins are a 'cohesive' group and that they follow where their leader takes them. If the leader of the dolphins was sick, then the animal could have committed a “navigational error” and led the rest of the group to shore," said the &lt;a href="w%3AWhale%20and%20Dolphin%20Conservation%20Society"&gt;Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society&lt;/a&gt; (WDCS).

"The pod of melon-headed whales (dolphins) on Manila Bay were injured by a rather nasty group of more than 120 undersea earthquakes. The swarm started with a small magnitude-4.5 event on December 21, 2008. Things got red-hot on January 3, 2009 when a magnitude-7.6 event erupted near the water’s edge on &lt;a href="w%3APapua%20%28Indonesian%20province%29"&gt;Papua Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, 700 miles southeast of &lt;a href="w%3ADavao%20City"&gt;Davao City&lt;/a&gt; in Mindanao. The 7.6 magnitude quake was followed by more than 120 major aftershocks each one capable by itself of inflicting injury on a pod of dolphins," said Capt. David Williams, a retired marine mammal researcher, a commercial sea captain for 40 years and active whale conservationist. 

Capt. Williams explained that whales and dolphins have small air sacs (pterygoid sinuses) that surround each inner ear and help then sense sound direction underwater. A damaged pterygoid air sac results in the loosing of echonavigation and &lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20echolocation"&gt;echolocation&lt;/a&gt;. "In summary, my Seaquake Theory indicates that barotrauma, as a result of exposure to potent earthquake-induced changes in ambient pressure, solves the centuries-old mystery of why whales and dolphins mass-strand on beaches around the world," Capt. Williams concluded.

An &lt;a href="w%3AExplosion"&gt;explosive blast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUncontrolled%20decompression"&gt;explosive decompression&lt;/a&gt; create a pressure wave that can induce &lt;a href="w%3ABarotrauma"&gt;barotrauma&lt;/a&gt;. The difference in pressure between internal organs and the outer surface of the body causes injuries to internal organs that contain gas, such as the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and ear.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20History%20Museum"&gt;Natural History Museum&lt;/a&gt; experts, &lt;a href="w%3AWhales"&gt;whale&lt;/a&gt; and dolphins can become confused, mis-read the Earth's magnetic fields, fear certain sounds and get lost. Since 1913, it has investigated all &lt;a href="w%3ABeached%20whale"&gt;strandings&lt;/a&gt;, more than 11,000 so far, and it runs the UK Whale and Dolphin Stranding Scheme. 

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;'s Project Jonah has claimed that the largest recorded beach stranding was in 1918 when 1,000 &lt;a href="w%3APilot%20whale"&gt;pilot whales&lt;/a&gt; were stranded on New Zealand's &lt;a href="w%3AChatham%20Islands"&gt;Chatham Islands&lt;/a&gt;. 

The last mass beaching in the Philippines was in 1956 when around 12 &lt;a href="w%3ASperm%20Whale"&gt;sperm whales&lt;/a&gt; were stranded in a coastal area in &lt;a href="w%3ACapiz"&gt;Capiz&lt;/a&gt;, amid at least 10 yearly strandings that happened in the country involving only one or two animals that were either sick or dying.

Last January this year, Filipino fishermen have also rescued an endangered &lt;a href="w%3AManatee"&gt;sea cow&lt;/a&gt;. The fishermen aided the beached sea cow to the deep sea, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature"&gt;Worldwide Fund for Nature&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMelon-headed%20Whale"&gt;Melon-headed whale&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Peponocephala electra♡❤; many-toothed blackfish and electra dolphin) is a &lt;a href="w%3ACetacea"&gt;cetacean&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AOceanic%20dolphin"&gt;oceanic dolphin&lt;/a&gt; family (Delphinidae). As small members of the dolphin
group, it is closely related to the &lt;a href="w%3APygmy%20Killer%20Whale"&gt;Pygmy Killer Whale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APilot%20Whale"&gt;Pilot Whale&lt;/a&gt;, and collectively these dolphin species are known by the common name &lt;a href="w%3Ablackfish%23Cetaceans"&gt;blackfish&lt;/a&gt;.

The tender mammal can grow up to 2.7 meters (9 feet) and weigh as much as 210 kilograms (460
pounds). With black triangular “mask” on its face, it appears dark gray to black in color, has no discernible beak and its head is shaped like a rounded &lt;a href="w%3AMelon"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;, thus the name. Its primary diet is &lt;a href="w%3ASquid"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; and fish. The Melon-headed whale lives well off-shore in all the world's tropical and sub-tropical oceans. 
At the northern fringes of its range it may also be found in the warm currents of temperate waters. Ordinarily, however, it is found beyond the &lt;a href="w%3AContinental%20shelf"&gt;continental shelf&lt;/a&gt; between 20° S and 20° N. The Melon-headed whale is widespread throughout the world's tropical waters, although not often seen by humans on account of its preference for deep water. It has been found in &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACebu%20Island"&gt;Cebu&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.

As social species, they are covered by the &lt;a href="w%3AMarine%20Mammal%20Protection%20Act"&gt;Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. In July 2004, between 150 and 200 melon-headed whales occupied the shallow waters of &lt;a href="w%3AKauai"&gt;Kauai&lt;/a&gt; island in &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; for over 28 hours, after which, they were rescued and guided to deeper water. This incident may have been related to nearby &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Navy"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASonar"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; exercise. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature"&gt;International Union for Conservation of Nature&lt;/a&gt; (IUCN) which includes the melon-headed whales in its &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20List%20Index"&gt;Red List&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AThreatened%20species"&gt;threatened species&lt;/a&gt; said that the number of whales involved in mass stranding had increased in the last 30 years.

"The melon-headed whales are likely to be “vulnerable” to loud sounds, such as those generated by navy sonar and &lt;a href="w%3AReflection%20seismology"&gt;seismic exploration&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence from stranded whales also has indicated that they may have died after swallowing plastic items. It has been predicted that the whales will be affected by global climate change, but the impact is still unclear," the IUCN explained.

A man in &lt;a href="w%3ABoynton%20Beach%2C%20Florida"&gt;Boynton Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested for misusing the city's &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt; emergency phone service. Jean Fortune, 66, called 911 to complain about a fast food order from &lt;a href="w%3ABurger%20King"&gt;Burger King&lt;/a&gt; he had not yet placed.

On Monday Fortune called 911 to complain that the Burger King he was going to eat at did not sell lemonade. He also complained to 911 operators that the food he had yet to order, was going to take 15 minutes to complete.

"You cannot dial 911 because you are unhappy with your burger, ok. I know you don't seriously think that the police need to make Burger King give you food faster," says the operator as Fortune continued to complain. "If it takes 15 minutes to cook, it takes 15 minutes to cook, ok. You don't need to call 911."

It turns out, after nearly three minutes of arguing with the operator, Fortune never even placed an order. 

"Have you given them any money?," asks the operator. Fortune replies "no." The operator then asks Fortune, "have they given you any food?" Again Fortune replies "no." The operator then tells Fortune that he is able to "just drive away" from the situation, but he disagrees and tells her he will "just move [his] car". The operator warns Fortune that the police are on their way and then tells him to not block the drive-thru.

When police arrived, they arrested him for misusing the emergency line, which is a criminal offense in Florida. He was formally charged with the crime, issued a notice to appear in court and then released.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; passed a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009"&gt;stimulus package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; worth &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 838 billion on Tuesday, aimed at creating millions of new jobs and steering the economy out of the recession. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -controlled Senate passed the bill by a vote of 61-37, with only three &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; supporting the plan. The move comes in the midst of a recession, which has claimed 3.6 million jobs in the US.

Before the bill can be signed into law by the president, the Senate package first has to be reconciled with a different version of the plan that was adopted by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The main differences between the two versions are over spending priorities and how to expand Medicaid, the medicinal program. The Senate version would also give more resources to tax cuts, whereas the House's plan would devote more money to local governments and schools.

President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the news, calling it a "good start". "That's good news and I want to thank all of the members of the Senate who have moved the process forward," he said, speaking at a town hall meeting in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Myers%2C%20Florida"&gt;Fort Myers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "We've still got to get the House bill and the Senate bill to match up before it gets sent to my desk, so we got a little more work to do over the next couple of days."

The only Republicans who voted for the bill were Senators &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Collins"&gt;Susan Collins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOlympia%20Snowe"&gt;Olympia Snowe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArlen%20Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Wall Street reacted negatively to the passage of the bill, with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; down over three hundred points in afternoon trading.

Australia and Japan played out a scoreless draw in front of sixty five and a half thousand spectators at Yokohama International Stadium in Japan. Both countries are expected to go through to the &lt;a href="w%3A2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa.

The Australians sustained heavy pressure throughout the match, they managed to defend effectively. The pressure however cause three players to be booked by the referee. Namely Scott Chipperfield (after 21 minutes), Luke Wilkshire (25 minutes) and Carl Valeri (1 minute into 2nd half added time).

Japan managed to open up Australia's left hand side and create a number of chances up front. Unfortunately for the Japanese, the chances resulted in corners and near misses at best.

"It's a great result," said Tim Cahill, Australia's makeshift striker. "They've had five weeks preparing, we've had two days. We will take that result - and I'm sure they will too."

The result sees them two wins clear of Bahrain, who would play-off for fifth overall in Asia if qualification happened after four games per team.

"You've got to look at the table," Cahill said. "We're six points clear of the team in third (Bahrain). We're sitting pretty and so are Japan."

"It's frustrating not to take three points at home," said Japan coach Takeshi Okada, who had admitted his job was in trouble. "We did everything but put the ball in the net. But it's about qualifying for the World Cup. We have four games left and have to keep pushing."

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20response%20to%20Omar%20Khadr"&gt;Coalition to Repatriate Omar Khadr&lt;/a&gt; held a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, where &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Khadr"&gt;Khadr&lt;/a&gt;'s lawyer &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Edney"&gt;Dennis Edney&lt;/a&gt; unveiled his reintegration strategy for the sole Western citizen still held at &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes that he can be returned to &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

Edney presented his "plan of reintegration" for Khadr, which constituted maintaining distance from &lt;a href="w%3AKhadr%20family"&gt;his controversial family&lt;/a&gt; while undergoing physical and psychological tests and counselling while &lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20of%20Canada"&gt;the legal system&lt;/a&gt; decides whether to charge him under the &lt;a href="w%3ACriminal%20Code%20of%20Canada"&gt;Criminal Code of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ANate%20Whitling"&gt;Nate Whitling&lt;/a&gt;, another lawyer representing Khadr, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Globe%20and%20Mail"&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that his defence team had "no objection at all to fair trial".

However, there has been no indication of acceptance of the plan from government officials, who were delivered an outline of the proposed terms of release earlier this week. Edney reiterated his plea for &lt;a href="w%3Adue%20process"&gt;due process&lt;/a&gt;, urging the government to "accept our plan ... a plan that says something about who we are as Canadians."

Khadr, who was 15 years old and serving as a translator for &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban%20insurgency"&gt;Afghan insurgents&lt;/a&gt; when he was captured by American &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Special%20Operations%20Forces"&gt;Special Forces&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, has been a controversial point in Canadian politics since his capture. 

While the ruling &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal party&lt;/a&gt; had initially made motions towards ensuring that the youth would face fair legal proceedings, they were superseded by the current &lt;a href="w%3APremiership%20of%20Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Conservative premiership&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; three years ago. Since then, the government has refused to intervene stating that the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20military%20commission"&gt;Guantanamo military tribunals&lt;/a&gt; constituted an "ongoing legal process" determining his fate. 
When &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; announced the suspension of the tribunals and the closure of the detainment camps in January 2009, Harper maintained his position that Khadr did not constitute a &lt;a href="w%3Amilitary%20use%20of%20children"&gt;child soldier&lt;/a&gt; and was better to be tried by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; than his native country. Dismissing Harper's claims on Wednesday, Edney suggested that the Prime Minister "learn some international law".

Also on Wednesday, the leaders of the three opposition parties in &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Canada"&gt;Canadian parliament&lt;/a&gt; sent a letter to Obama urging him to repatriate Khadr as both the majority of the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; and the population support his return and reintegration into society.

Last week, 185 Canadian groups and individuals accused the Prime Minister of "harbouring anti-Muslim sentiment" in his refusal to comply with international law, and public opinion, to return Khadr to face justice in Canada. A petition with more than 50,000 signatures was also delivered to &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20Hill"&gt;Parliament Hill&lt;/a&gt; by representatives of &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; calling for Khadr's release.

Despite legislation enacted by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; and signed into law by President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, more than one-third of &lt;a href="w%3Atelevision"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; stations in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; are planning to move ahead with the transition to &lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20television"&gt;digital television&lt;/a&gt;, according to reports.

The transition, which was scheduled for February 17, has been pushed back to June 12, 2009, per the DTV Delay Act enacted on Wednesday. However, it left a loophole for broadcasters, allowing them to make the switch anytime between February 17 and June 12.

"During these challenging economic times, the needs of American consumers are a top priority of my administration," President Obama said in a statement about the DTV Delay Act. "Millions of Americans, including those in our most vulnerable communities, would have been left in the dark if the conversion had gone on as planned, and this solution is an important step forward as we work to get the nation ready for digital TV." 

On Tuesday, the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FCC) said that 681 of the nearly 1,800 television broadcast stations in the United States would cease broadcasting in the old &lt;a href="w%3Aanalog%20television"&gt;analog&lt;/a&gt; format on the original February 17 date.

Owners of analog TV sets will need a converter box, for which there has been a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1.5 billion federal program of $40 coupons for such boxes, which will allow them to view digital programming on analog televisions.

The three 'major' networks, &lt;a href="w%3AAmercian%20Broadcasting%20Corportation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, have pledged to continue broadcasting in analog, but they only own about 100 of the 1,800 stations.

NBC affiliate, &lt;a href="w%3AWDTN"&gt;WDTN&lt;/a&gt; said that it would continue to broadcast public safety information over the analog signals, but that it had done research that showed most viewers were ready for the switch.

"It's what we've been telling viewers all along," Lisa Barhorst said, explaining why WDTN would go forward with the February 17 switch.

"Next week is not going to be pretty," &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Copps"&gt;Michael Copps&lt;/a&gt;, the acting chairman of the FCC, said on Wednesday. "There is going to be consumer dislocation and confusion next week."

"Our next few days are pretty much spoken for at the FCC," Copps added. "That's not how I would have hoped to be spending my time as acting chairman."

"There's always going to be a certain percentage of people who won't be ready," Wayne Simons, general manager of CBS affiliate &lt;a href="w%3AWINK-TV"&gt;WINK-TV&lt;/a&gt;, said. "We won't be any more prepared June 12 than we are right now."

Politicians from both houses of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; have reached a consensus over a &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009"&gt;stimulus package&lt;/a&gt; worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

The package was bridged between the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;' version of the stimulus, which was worth US$820 billion, and the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;'s version, which cost $838 billion. The package now costs $789 billion, and devotes resources to tax cuts and spending intended to help revive the faltering US economy.

The House of Representatives' version of the bill was passed without any &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; support, while the Senate's version, which was voted upon on Tuesday, was backed by only three Republican senators.

The stimulus is aimed at giving help to those who have suffered from the recession, in the form of food stamps, health coverage, unemployment benefits, and various other things.

&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; hailed the agreement as a "hard-fought compromise".

"I want to thank the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and Republicans in Congress who came together," he said, "with the urgency that this moment demands."

Obama is to sign to bill into law after the revised version of the stimulus is passed by Congress. He has said that he wants the bill on his desk ready to sign by this weekend.

Republican politicians, however, still disapprove of the stimulus plan, saying that the package is too costly and will increase the size of the federal government and not create any new jobs.

US stock markets posted modest gains at the end of day following the agreement.

<h1>Fake impotence drugs linked to low blood sugar outbreak</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fake%20impotence%20drugs%20linked%20to%20low%20blood%20sugar%20outbreak&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An article in the February 12 issue of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports on an unusual cause for an outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3Ahypoglycemia"&gt;low blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; among men in &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;: illegal use of sexual performance enhancement drugs that were contaminated with a &lt;a href="w%3Aanti-diabetic%20drug"&gt;diabetes drug&lt;/a&gt;.

Between January and May 2008, 149 men and one woman between 19 and 97 (mean age 51) were admitted to five public hospitals for unexplained low blood sugar. Similar cases were reported in media reports from &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. Seven Singaporean patients remained in a coma because of prolonged sugar starvation of the brain, and four subsequently died. The diabetes drug &lt;a href="w%3Aglyburide"&gt;glyburide&lt;/a&gt; was found in blood and/or urine samples in 85% of cases; 30% admitted having used illegal sexual performance enhancers.

The contaminated products were a counterfeit version of the drug &lt;a href="w%3ACialis"&gt;Cialis&lt;/a&gt; (meant for the treatment of genuine &lt;a href="w%3Aerectile%20dysfunction"&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;), and three purported herbal preparation (the affected brands included Power 1 Walnut and Santi Bovine Penis Erecting Capsule). All four preparations additionally contained Viagra in varying concentrations. Two herbal products contained traces of the weight loss drug &lt;a href="w%3Asibutramine"&gt;sibutramine&lt;/a&gt;, a compound related to amphetamines.

The drug packaging mentioned names of non-existent overseas production facilities, so the source of the contamination with the diabetes drug could not be established.

The authors underline the risks that is known to be associated with purchasing drugs from unreliable providers or from online resellers. The clandestine use of impotence drugs as sexual performance enhancers seems to have provided a good illustration of this problem. They further call for more efforts by national and international health and law enforcement agencies to curb the manufacturing, international transport and sales of untrustworthy medication.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJudd%20Gregg"&gt;Judd Gregg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;NH&lt;/a&gt;), who was nominated by President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; as the next &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce"&gt;United States Secretary of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , withdrew from consideration Thursday, citing "irresolvable conflicts" with Obama over the administration's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009"&gt;proposed stimulus package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Census"&gt;Census&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Judd Gregg is a current &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; representing New Hampshire, where he formerly served as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20New%20Hampshire"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Senator Gregg is also the ranking member of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Budget"&gt;Senate Budget Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and a member of the Republican Party. Had he been confirmed, he would have been the second Republican in Obama's cabinet.

In a statement, Gregg thanked the President for the nomination.

"However, it has become apparent during this process that this will not work for me as I have found that on issues such as the stimulus package and the Census there are irresolvable conflicts for me. Prior to accepting this post, we had discussed these and other potential differences, but unfortunately we did not adequately focus on these concerns," Senator Gregg said in his statement.

In an official &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Press%20Secretary"&gt;White House press release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gibbs"&gt;Robert Gibbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stated: "Once it became clear after his nomination that Senator Gregg was not going to be supporting some of President Obama’s key economic priorities, it became necessary for Senator Gregg and the Obama administration to part ways. We regret that he has had a change of heart."

Gregg is the fourth cabinet nominee of Obama to withdraw. The first three were former &lt;a href="South%20Dakota"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; Sen. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Daschle"&gt;Tom Daschle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , consultant &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Killefer"&gt;Nancy Killefer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Richardson"&gt;Bill Richardson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who was Obama's first choice for Commerce Secretary.

&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; rock and &lt;a href="w%3Ametal%20music"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt; label &lt;a href="w%3AGUN%20Records"&gt;GUN Records&lt;/a&gt; (Great Unlimited Noises) announced Friday that they were to close. No explanation has been given for the move.

Formed as a joint venture between &lt;a href="w%3ABMG"&gt;BMG&lt;/a&gt; and Wolfgang Funk in 1992, the label had seen its parent merge with &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 to form &lt;a href="w%3ASony%20BMG"&gt;Sony BMG&lt;/a&gt; and Funk quit as president in December 2008. In the nineties the label worked with German metal bands such as &lt;a href="w%3AU.D.O."&gt;U.D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASodom%20%28band%29"&gt;Sodom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARunning%20Wild"&gt;Running Wild&lt;/a&gt;.

GUN's current international acts - including &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="w%3ABullet%20for%20My%20Valentine"&gt;Bullet for My Valentine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="the%20Netherlands"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="w%3AWithin%20Tempatation"&gt;Within Tempatation&lt;/a&gt; - will now be handled out of Sony's &lt;a href="w%3AMunich"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; international division. National artists, such as &lt;a href="w%3AOomph%21"&gt;Oomph!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Donots"&gt;The Donots&lt;/a&gt;, will also be Sony's direct responsibility via either &lt;a href="w%3AFour%20Music"&gt;Four Music&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20Germany"&gt;Columbia Germany&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;.

The label has also worked with &lt;a href="w%3ASturm%20und%20Drang"&gt;Sturm und Drang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AApocalyptica"&gt;Apocalyptica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHIM%20%28band%29"&gt;HIM&lt;/a&gt;. The closure will affect eight employees including Arno Hartfield, the managing director.

A car crash on the &lt;a href="w%3AA614%20road"&gt;A614 road&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ANottinghamshire"&gt;Nottinghamshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; has killed six people, all of whom are believed to have lived near the scene of the crash.

All six victims died at the scene of the crash, which involved four young adults in a Peugeot 206 and two elderly people, possibly a male and female, who police believe to be in their 60s, in the other car said to be a Ford Fiesta. Rescue workers fought to save the one of the elderly individuals, but were unsuccessful. Both vehicles collided head-on and exploded upon colliding.

Two police officers on traffic patrol discovered the crash, which took place at 23:00 local time (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) yesterday. The officers involved were praised by Bruce Cameron, a superintendent for &lt;a href="w%3ANottinghamshire%20Police"&gt;Nottinghamshire Police&lt;/a&gt;. "The bodies are very badly burnt and they will have to be identified using dental records. We want to make sure we are absolutely certain as to who was in both cars when the accident happened," he said. 
Local residents say that the A614 has been the scene of a large number of accidents. One resident, Stuart Stonebridge, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that "we only moved here three years ago and there have been a lot of accidents and some fatalities in that time," while another resident, Janice Gilbody said that "the people of Bilsthorpe will be in shock, horror and disbelief at the young lives lost."

Gilbody also said that this accident is "yet again another accident on this road." She then added that the road was dangerous, saying that "it’s a wonder it doesn’t happen more often."

The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but police say weather was not a contributing factor.

MV ♡❤Chemstar Venus♡❤, a chemical tanker flagged in &lt;a href="Panama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt; and owned by a &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese firm, has been freed by &lt;a href="w%3Apiracy%20in%20Somalia"&gt;pirates in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;. The vessel has a crew of 23 and a cargo of chemicals that has not been identified.

The ship was seized on November 15 and has a crew of five &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;ns and eighteen &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Filipinos&lt;/a&gt;. She was released Thursday, with the news announced Friday by an anonymous diplomat in &lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. It is unclear if a ransom was paid.

There has recently been a sharp rise in pirate attacks after a lull in January, thought to be a result of a combination of stormy weather finally subsiding and pirates seeking to replenish their stock of captive vessels after seven recent releases. Six ships were attacked across Wednesday and Thursday.

A &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n battlecruiser &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20battlecruiser%20Pyotr%20Velikiy"&gt;named after Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt; detained ten suspected pirates who were moving in on a fishing trawler registered in &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. They seized drugs, rifles and a large amount of cash and military prosecutors are now interviewing the men.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; passed a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 787 billion stimulus package late Friday night, in an effort to curb the recession and boost the faltering US economy.

The bill was passed by a vote of 60&amp;ndashp;38, barely reaching the minimum number of 60 votes needed to make the bill a law. Only three &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; senators voted for the measure. Shortly before the &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; vote, the &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;US House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; approved of the stimulus by a margin of 246&amp;ndash;183, with all 176 Republicans and seven Democrats voting against the bill.

The Senate vote was delayed until night so that &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASherrod%20Brown"&gt;Sherrod Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could fly back from &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, where his mother had recently died. He cast the final and decisive sixtieth vote in favor of the stimulus bill.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; is expected to sign the bill into law in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADenver%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, February 17.

"This is a major milestone on our road to recovery, and I want to thank the members of Congress who came together in common purpose to make it happen," Obama said in his weekly address. "I will sign this legislation into law shortly, and we'll begin making the immediate investments necessary to put people back to work doing the work America needs done. This historic step won't be the end of what we do to turn our economy around, but the beginning."

Senate Majority leader &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; said that the stimulus package was the most important legislation that he had ever worked on. "The country is in trouble and we're so fortunate we were able to get it passed. It's going to give this country a shot in the arm."

"The bill that was about jobs, jobs, jobs has turned into a bill that's about spending, spending, spending," said House Republican leader &lt;a href="John%20Boehner"&gt;John Boehner&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, throwing a copy of the bill on the floor in protest.

Last week, the House of Representatives passed a stimulus package worth $825 billion with no support from Republicans. Shortly thereafter, the Senate passed a slightly different version of the bill worth $838 billion. The differences between the two bills had to be bridged in a Senate-House committee before it was voted upon in both houses.

A woman who held the &lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20World%20Records"&gt;Guinness World Record&lt;/a&gt; for having the world's longest fingernails has lost them in a four-car accident in her hometown of &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

66-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Redmond"&gt;Lee Redmond&lt;/a&gt; was seriously injured after she was ejected from the sports utility vehicle (SUV) she had been a passenger in. It had collided with one car, causing it to collide with two other cars on Tuesday February 10. She is expected to make a full recovery.

"[Her nails] were damaged beyond repair," reported the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News%20Online"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, quoting Guinness World Records, who also said that Redmond's nails were "a fundamental part of her life and unique character". The cause of the crash is not yet known and an investigation is ongoing.

Redmond is credited by the Guinness Book for having a combined fingernail length of 28 feet, the longest on record. She has been growing all eight fingers and two thumbnails since 1979. Her longest of all nails was her right thumb, which was 2ft and eleven inches long.

Before Redmond was named as the record holder in 2006, &lt;a href="w%3AShridhar%20Chillal"&gt;Shridhar Chillal&lt;/a&gt; from India had the longest at a combined length of just over twenty feet.

<h1>Eurovision '73 winner Anne Marie David discusses her four-decade career and the Contest, past and present</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Eurovision%20%2773%20winner%20Anne%20Marie%20David%20discusses%20her%20four-decade%20career%20and%20the%20Contest%2C%20past%20and%20present&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
In the 1970s, she was one of the most popular female vocalists in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and became well-known internationally. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAnne%20Marie%20David"&gt;Anne Marie David&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArles"&gt;Arles&lt;/a&gt; in the south of France, parlayed her initial success from playing Mary Magdalene in the French production of ♡❤&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJesus%20Christ%20Superstar"&gt;Jesus Christ Superstar&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ into taking home the "grand prix" at the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%201973"&gt;Eurovision Song Contest&lt;/a&gt; in 1973. Her winning song, "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATu%20te%20reconna%C3%AEtras"&gt;Tu te reconnaîtras&lt;/a&gt;" (♡❤You will recognize yourself♡❤), became a Europe-wide hit that spring.

At the height of her popularity, David perfomed world tours, and even lived abroad in Turkey for a time. In 1979, she tried once again to win the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%201979"&gt;Eurovision&lt;/a&gt;, and placed a respectable third. Her song "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJe%20suis%20l%27enfant%20soleil"&gt;Je suis l'enfant soleil&lt;/a&gt;" (♡❤I'm a child of the sun♡❤) became similarly popular across France and in the Francophone nations.

As time went on, however, her place in the French music scene became less certain. Touring the world had taken a personal toll, and David decided to retire from music completely in 1987. However, with the help of her fan base, she was coaxed out of retirement in 2003 and is returning to a part of her life that she tried to leave, but never left her. Celebrating four decades in the music scene, David is looking forward to adventurous new projects and a newfound zest for life.

Anne Marie David corresponded with ♡❤&lt;nowiki&gt;Wikinews&lt;/nowiki&gt;♡❤♡ about her eventful career, her personal anecdotes regarding living abroad, her successes in past Eurovision contests and her grievances with the way the show is produced today. This is the second in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202009"&gt;next contest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Early career</h2>
 
♡❤♡ I saw the photos on your website, and I must say, you hardly look older than when you did Eurovision 30 years ago. Has anyone told you that back then, you looked a lot like &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMarie%20Osmond"&gt;Marie Osmond&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡Anne Marie David♡❤♡: Thank you for the compliment, but I don't recall anyone alluding to a resemblance with Marie Osmond. I would have taken that as a compliment, no?

♡❤♡ When did you first start singing? Who were your musical inspirations while you were growing up?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: I was already singing as a young child; my mother said that when she was pregnant with me, she sang lullabies to me... My [own] musical culture is very large. At home we listened to a lot of opera and operettas, but also French ♡❤&lt;a href="%3Aw%3Afr%3AMusique%20de%20vari%C3%A9t%C3%A9s"&gt;variété&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ or the accordion. But my big revelation was my discovery of Barbra Streisand in ♡❤Funny Girl♡❤. That changed everything for me... I absolutely wanted to approach [the level of] this great artist, the greatest in my opinion, and try to pull myself to the heights of her talent. Not by imitating her, but by succeeding in acquiring this vocal perfection she possesses, and by orienting all my efforts towards the acting that I could present by interpreting my songs whenever the [lyrics] allowed me to.

♡❤♡ You became very well-known in 1972 when you played Mary Magdalene in ♡❤Jesus Christ Superstar♡❤. How did you get the part? If you had to audition, what were the auditions like, and were you nervous?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: At the time I played in the musical comedy "The Me Nobody Knows," originating from the United States. Unfortunately the promotion for this presentation was not excellent and it remained confidential. My artistic director at the time, Pierre Hebrard, knew that the casting of ♡❤Jesus Christ Superstar♡❤ was finished but that the role of Mary Magdalene had not yet been definitively [cast]. He asked the production [company] to audition me. I practiced the beginning of the song for a quarter of an hour with Anthony Bowles, the musical director, then I sang the song. They asked me to learn the entire song for the next morning, and to come back to sing it. I did so... I sang the song the next day and in the end, they said OK, we'll take you... I learned that for this role the production auditioned 600 girls! I was stressed out ♡❤after♡❤ the audition... when I realized the challenge. Before I had not been very relaxed [or] comfortable, but I mostly wanted to [sell the song]... The show must go on, no?

♡❤♡ You're from the south of France, and some of the French Wikipedians remarked, "But she doesn't have any accent when she's singing!" Did you have to take vocal classes or was it natural for you to sing without an accent?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: I'm a big fan of accent imitations... accents are also music, and in private I often tell jokes with accents. It's the actress in me... but in fact singing in French for me is singing without an accent; it's a natural thing... I make no particular effort [to remove an accent].

♡❤♡ After your success in the theatre, you were victorious at Eurovision in 1973. Luxembourg usually selected their entrants internally, so how did RTL [♡❤Editor's note: The state broadcaster of Luxembourg♡❤] become aware of you? How were you approached by them, and did you ever consider not participating in the Contest?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: I had the opportunity to have the director of programs and the director of special programming for RTL [watching me] the night of the premiere of ♡❤Jesus Christ Superstar♡❤. They saw me and were enthused by my performance. When they asked me that night if I would accept to represent Luxembourg in 1973, I only asked if it wasn't a problem [for them because] they'd won with Vicky Léandros that year (1972). They told me no, that for them winning several times in a row was not a problem... so I said ♡❤yes♡❤ with ♡❤pleasure♡❤!

<h2>Eurovision '73 and initial mainstream success</h2>

♡❤♡ When you competed for Luxembourg, one country winning twice in a row was still rare. Was there a lot of pressure for you to win the grand prize for Luxembourg? Did you also feel pressure to succeed from yourself?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: There was no need to win the grand ♡❤prize♡❤ except in ♡❤my head♡❤. I felt sure that an opportunity like that one was ♡❤unique♡❤ and that I would not have it a second time... I was incorrect... I got it twice! What I mean to say is that Eurovision remains for me a musical contest before all else, although of course a good song is worth nothing without a good [singer]. Thus the need to have both!

I've always had a taste for challenges... Eurovision is one. And among the challenges I like the competition, so when challenge and competition are combined, I think only of victory. I think it would be ridiculous and useless to go to Eurovision without wanting to win! I never participate in a contest, or anywhere for that matter, when it consists of singing with a tourist view of it. I prioritize my work and the result of my work. This has not allowed me to visit many things in all the countries where I have been in competition, but this allowed me to never find myself poorly ranked or last. One must know whether one wants victory or tourism...and I think it's a lack of respect to all those who count on us, and all those who spend a lot [of time] (production, television, etc...) to not take every chance to rank better or not put every chance of winning on our side.

♡❤♡ You ended up in a three-way dead heat between Mocedades from Spain and Cliff Richard from the United Kingdom, who both performed songs some fans also consider worthy of the grand prize. What were your opinions of those songs? If, hypothetically, your song didn't win, do you think either of them were strong enough to be winner material?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: 1973 was a year very rich in quality candidates... the proof: victory came to me with just a very few points ahead. The ranking of that year's other candidates was what I dreaded most. Mocedades was a pure moment of happiness and of a formidable effectiveness; Cliff Richard benefited from an exceptional notoriety and a mastery of the scene that I was far from having; so I needed to play everything I had... but I told you that I'd chosen ♡❤victory♡❤, not tourism!

♡❤♡ During the mid-1970s, you did many tours of Turkey and the Middle East, and won reporters' music awards there. What was the best thing you liked about being in Turkey? What experiences did you have that really stand out in your mind even today?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: I had the immense joy of working a lot of time and also living over there, and for me it was the discovery of an immense culture, well beyond what I could have imagined. It was an encounter with a people, the Turkish people, whom we don't make the effort to know in depth. Most of the time there are too many clichés that are in no way reflections of what these people truly are... I am not talking about the leaders, I'm talking about the citizens of a country. I learned about them, to understand them, to exchange with them, in all their diversity, and God knows that in matters of diversity Turkey knows what it's talking about. I spent rare moments there surrounded by Turks, Armenians, Greeks, and Jews sitting at the same table and speaking the same language, the language of love and friendship... In all the whole world it's the same thing. All is well except when politics or religion intervene.

<h2>Eurovision '79</h2>

♡❤♡ In 1979, you decided to compete for a spot at the Eurovision final again, this time for France. Why did you want to go back a second time? Considering your past success, were you fairly confident that you would end up being the French representative that year?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: It was a taste for risk that guided me, but a measured risk, because 'Winner of the Grand Eurovision Prize 1973' is a lifetime title that one does not risk losing if one takes another chance. The place [you received] remains [that] place. When I accepted [the opportunity] to try representing France in 1979, I knew that the rules of the game were different than the ones in Luxembourg. Winner [from] 1973 or not, it didn't change [things] much since one needed to pass through a selection process. I played the game like everyone else and it was the public who voted for the 12 semi-finalists. Unfortunately television was on strike, and the finale could not be held as planned. The 12 semi-finalists were therefore viewed by a jury of professionals, and I was retained. But I respected the rule all the way to the end, and above all French television ♡❤never♡❤ modified the rule until the final candidate selection. I would have appreciated that France 3 [♡❤Editor's note: The current television station broadcasting Eurovision in France♡❤] respects the rule of the game the same way this year... and that ♡❤all♡❤ the candidates win or lose in loyal fashion, by respecting the rule. This will not be the case and I regret that... [♡❤Editor's note: After decades of public voting to select France's finalist, France 3 selected their artist internally this year despite originally calling for finalists.♡❤]

♡❤♡ Competing at the Eurovision in 1979, you ended the voting on the wrong end of a close three-way finish, being beaten by the songs from Israel and Spain. Considering your victory helped Luxembourg win twice in a row, were you happy for Israel as they also achieved the same feat? 

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: Of course! It's once again a rule fixed ahead of time, and which does not prohibit a country from winning several times in a row.

♡❤♡ Many Eurovision fans on sites like YouTube feel the 1979 Contest was one of the strongest years ever for Eurovision. Apart from your own song, were there any songs you remember that you really liked? Also, which song do you feel was a stronger entry, "Je suis l'enfant soleil" or "Tu te reconnaîtras"?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: I have indeed seen how much Internet users appreciate "Je suis l'enfant soleil"... let them be reassured, so do I! That year, in 1979, I particularly liked Milk and Honey and Gali Atari who won, and the German group who sang "Dschinghis Khan", which was a very strong title and sold well. With time, singing my songs from Eurovision continue to give me pleasure. "Je suis l'enfant soleil" tells a very beautiful tale and allows me to play comedy [♡❤Editor's note: "Comedy" in the theatrical sense, aiming to denounce the faults and vices of society using humor♡❤] a lot. But I adore "Tu te reconnaîtras" for what it has in singing, pulling in, being direct with the audience. In fact, each [song] brings me something different and to the public as well.

<h2>1980s: Retirement</h2>

♡❤♡ During the 1980s, you competed in some more song festivals, including one in Norway and one in Chile. Anabela, the 1993 entrant from Portugal, felt she was eventually typecast as being "the song festival girl." Did you ever feel restricted in the same way? Were there ever any other facets to your musical repertoire that you would have liked to explore?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: I always assumed the image of a competitor, maybe because I grew up in a place where I was very happy, but where we were not very rich; so I always had to make choices and needed to earn each thing that life gave me. Also, it's great to know that others count on you and think that you can bring them a victory; it's not given to everyone. As for the facets of my personality, for a long time I had to struggle (again!) against a face which refused to age, and which thus prevented me from being credible in certain repertoires. 

Today time has passed, I am totally free in my choices, my voice has ripened well, and my silhouette too, my mastery of the scene is much more elaborated and thus I take on all the styles if the song touches or pleases me. And also I take on challenges like the song which I recorded with Jean Renard, [called] "Federico" which is totally "gypsy" and totally unlike my usual image. I am currently preparing a song for my English[-language] dance floor album (yep!) which is being [released] by Energise Records. [Dance music] is totally the opposite of what I do... but that amuses me and also the producers convinced me that I'd be great in it... so I hope not to disappoint them. [Here's a] scoop: it's called "You Came to Me."

♡❤♡ In the late 1980s, you retired from music completely. Was this a difficult decision for you to make? What things did you want out of your life which required you to leave music? Where did you go, and what did you do in retirement?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: Nothing is ever difficult when we accept to assume our choice. Those years were very disco, we were entering terrains I wasn't ready to tread, and I had been spoiled by my artist's life by going ever farther and farther from home. The French media ignored me after my victory for Luxembourg. Everyone wanted a second "Tu te reconnaîtras" and that is impossible. 

And so I went where the public awaited me, by changing countries nearly daily, and this tired me. I told myself that my life was not made ♡❤only♡❤ of songs and glory, and that I was passionate [about] many other things. I would have had to sacrifice far too many things and people to recover a place in France, like going to live in France, living a life of popularity, etc... I told myself that I had already been spoiled, so I said ♡❤stop!♡❤ in 1987 after the [Song] Festival in Chile. I participated in [many] great projects [revolving] around the Lusitanian horses and the fighting bulls which I raised with passion and love, but [my] life [eventually] did not follow those paths... maybe because ♡❤my♡❤ life is the stage and ♡❤life♡❤ took charge [and reminded] me of that...

<h2>Return to music</h2>

♡❤♡ You came out of retirement five years ago. How often did you think about returning to music while in retirement? Was music something you felt you couldn't just "let go"?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: When I decide to do something, I do it. When I decide to stop something, I do that too. But that isn't taking into account that there are things which we want to do, and those which life decides for us! In 1987, I vowed never to return to the stage, but as I said, life sometimes serves you dishes that you didn't choose, and in 2003 it's chance that made me return to the stage, and it's my fans whom I never imagined [I had] in such numbers and whom, so many years later, had conserved their love, which made me stay. I owe them a lot and will never forget that.

♡❤♡ Tell us about the CDs you have released since coming out of retirement. Are you experimenting with any new musical styles? I read you had a lot of input into your CD "Federico"; describe the direction you wanted to pursue with that disc.

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: It's thanks to the fans from my fan club that I could create a live CD, which I titled "Live à Charleroi" (Live at Charleroi). They sent me money via my fan club to allow me to be at the concert, and they bought my CD in advance even before it existed. [All of this was] just to help me, just to show me how much they wanted to find me [on stage] again [for that moment], in the space of 14 songs with a simple piano. 

For "Federico" it's Jean Renard who had the idea. [It was] a task which was totally unlike [anything in] my experience, but he trusted me and I trusted him. I don't regret it. There is a little bit of me in "Federico." I have Iberian origins from my mother, and furthermore this allowed me to write two songs in Spanish. Nothing but happiness!

♡❤♡ What new projects will you be doing in 2009? Are you doing any concerts?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: Yes, I will be in some concerts but this time as an artisan. I will co-produce a large portion of them; I'm preparing an album of twelve new songs for 2010... and after if God wills it I'll celebrate my 40 years in [music] at &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AParis%20Olympia"&gt;Olympia&lt;/a&gt; if it's possible. I also continue [on] as a coach and the artistic director of the group "Caprice" ([who are] three of my students), who had hoped to represent France at Eurovision 2009, but whom France 3 discarded from the game in a pretty dishonest way (along with all the others, for that matter). They will record other songs this year and I'm sure they'll do great. I like talent and they have it. I already partially explained my point of view on the subject in my response to [an earlier question regarding the representative at Eurovision 2009].

<h2>Views about Eurovision today</h2>

♡❤♡ In the past ten years or so, public interest in Eurovision has dwindled somewhat in France, a trend that has already been seen in countries like the Netherlands and Germany. Why do you feel that is? Is there anything France, or perhaps France Télévisions, can do to get French people watching the Contest again, especially in a television landscape populated by reality television?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: The only solution would be to stop changing a game rule that has proven itself for years, not [to] mix the genres, [to] return to the fundamentals. Eurovision is a contest of songs, not of stars, or [a] dance floor, or ♡❤Top Model♡❤... If this type of manifestation, which pleases the [current viewing] base had not been derived, all those who loved Eurovision would watch it still. 

But the system of votes by SMS developed the youths' votes, against whom I bear no ill but few adults play that game (my grandmother or mother will never vote that way). To put the spotlight favourably on the operators who that night will swipe the wealth [♡❤Editor's note: A reference to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APactolus"&gt;Pactolus&lt;/a&gt;, in which King Midas washed his hands of the golden touch in the river there♡❤], they prefer to take from it an evening which was an international family party... And tell yourself that any economic power who wants to make his candidate win can afford the luxury of buying millions of portable cell phones, distribute them with unlimited plans for a night to kids who could not afford them and win! Anyway, when I say "win", [it nowadays] implies not really winning! 

As for the jury, it must stay visible. Previously, each country sent its two judges and during the contest were kept apart from everyone... Tricking votes would be seen on the screens the night of the Contest and thus it almost never happened. What a strange idea also to distinguish between countries which are qualified for [the final] and the others! It's a total injustice. 

You see [Eurovision today] is not neutral, and don't [anyone] tell me that it's reasoning from a different age... It's just a series of observations... Nobody can contest the fact that certain generations who were the success of Eurovision no longer find their satisfaction in it and are therefore disinterested. Nobody can contest, also, that for decades the great Eurovision [winners] were international hits that everyone still sings today. Who today is capable of singing the titles which win? And what will remain of [the contest] in the future?

♡❤♡ Some viewers were not happy about last year's entrant, Sébastien Tellier. Singing his entry in essentially "franglais," [♡❤Editor's note: A mix of words and sentences interchanged between French and English♡❤] even a member of Parliament demanded that the next entry be purely in French. How did you feel about Tellier's performance, and do you feel every French entry must be sung in French? Do you feel not singing in English hinders France as an entrant in today's contest?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: Once again, I think we must return to the fundamentals. Turn the problem however you'd like but in the end you will arrive at the same conclusions. Germany won in German, Spain won in Spanish, Holland won in Dutch, Norway won in Norwegian, etc... What else? 

I see no reason to abandon everything to English; anyway I will fight that it not be the case with French! I sing in English, I speak English, I love the language of Shakespeare, but if I must represent my country in an international contest, I want to do it in French, and I also want it to be done in French. It's not an issue of chauvinism, it's an issue of respect with regards to all those who paid with their blood so that France is a full nation. It's the same for the national anthem of my country. And I would have the same reasoning whatever my nationality. I was born under the sun of France, it's normal that I love that sun.

♡❤♡ In our first Eurovision interview, &lt;a href="Eurovision%20%2782%20winner%20Nicole%20talks%20about%20%27Ein%20bi%C3%9Fchen%20Frieden%27%2C%20her%20success%20and%20the%20Contest%20today"&gt;we asked the 1982 winner, Nicole&lt;/a&gt;, how she felt about the alleged "bloc voting" taking place between the nations of eastern Europe. She replied, "The eastern European countries obviously support each other with the so-called 'bloc voting.' It's now a political affair and no longer a 'song contest.'" Do you feel that way as well? What exactly are your feelings about the results from the past few years, which place countries like France, the United Kingdom and Germany at the bottom nearly every time?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: You already have my analysis of the problem in my responses to [the last two questions]; but Nicole is right, she is defending her country and I find that very respectable. It's what is lacking today: people who have nothing to sell and who say what they think without being part of a political machine. Thank you, Nicole.

♡❤♡ Do you ever see yourself returning to the Eurovision stage as the representative from France or any of the francophone nations?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: I've been asked several times, including in 2009, to represent my country once more at Eurovision. But I've said and I repeat, it's not the place of confirmed artists to take that of young artists who need this springboard to be known by more people. And it is not the fear of losing my title of winner. I acquired it definitively for 1973, and I ranked third in 1979. Never can anything nor anyone change that. I prefer my position as coach, adviser... it's magnificent to rediscover one's twenties through someone who is 20, no? My emotions are unchanged... [I still get] the fear and stage fright as well, so can I ask for anything else [at this point]?

♡❤♡ Will you be a part of the French delegation going to Moscow this year? If no decision has been made yet, would you like to go?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: Too many things separate me from the French selection for 2009, which the essential [grievance] rests on the contempt of respect for the given word, contempt for the respect of the written word, transgressed precisely by those who have a duty and mission to ensure that [such rules] are not [transgressed]. Moreover I think that all the places in the delegation are reserved and distributed in advance based on a procedure that escapes me... I have nothing to add.

♡❤♡ In closing, what would you like to say to all of your fans who have followed your career these past four decades?

♡❤♡AMD♡❤♡: Yes, I would like to simply say ♡❤thank you♡❤ and see you very soon to continue our beautiful love story.

On Tuesday, February 10, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; civilian communications satellite &lt;a href="w%3AIridium%2033"&gt;Iridium 33&lt;/a&gt;, launched in 1997, and the defunct &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n military communications satellite &lt;a href="w%3AKosmos-2251"&gt;Kosmos-2251&lt;/a&gt;, launched in 1993, &lt;a href="w%3A2009%20satellite%20collision"&gt;collided&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="w%3ASiberia"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;. Five days after the collision, reports have surfaced that burning debris from the collision has been spotted over several U.S. cities from &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.

Calls to &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt; began to come in to &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamson%20County%2C%20Texas"&gt;Williamson County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; sheriff's office around 12:30 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone%20%28Americas%29"&gt;CT&lt;/a&gt;) that burning debris and fireballs were seen falling from the sky onto parts of &lt;a href="w%3AAustin%2C%20Texas"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWaco%2C%20Texas"&gt;Waco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%2C%20Texas"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;. Residents reported their homes and windows shaking and large explosions. After a search of several areas, the Williamson county sheriff's office reported that no debris or impact sites were found. Earlier unconfirmed reports had said the debris could have been the result of a small plane exploding. 

Steve Thornton, a resident in Austin told &lt;a href="w%3AKEYE-TV"&gt;KEYE-TV&lt;/a&gt; that he "saw something burn up in the atmosphere going east to west at 40 degrees in the horizon looking north" which was "about the size of a half moon and as bright as a welders torch". Other residents reported to KEYE-TV that they saw an "egg-shape with an orange center and bluish outer aura; a silvery-white tail." Some report the incident lasting about 10 minutes.

On February 13, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA) issued an alert following reports of "explosions and earthquakes" along with "flashes in the sky" in &lt;a href="w%3AJackson%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALouisville%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;. There were no injures and authorities could not locate any damage.

"The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FAA) reported to local law enforcement on Friday that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris. These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms, resulting in vibrations felt by some residents, as well as flashes of light across the sky," said the NOAA in a public information statement on February 13. The FAA also warns that the debris could cause damage to aircraft in areas reporting falling debris.

"Aircraft are advised that a potential hazard may occur due to reentry of satellite debris into the &lt;a href="w%3AEarth%27s%20atmosphere"&gt;Earth's atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;. It is critical that all pilots/crew members report any observed falling space debris," said the FAA on February 13. Both the NOAA and FAA alerts are in place until further notice and cover an area from &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to Kentucky.

However, Dr. Marco Ciocca, a professor at &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Kentucky%20University"&gt;Eastern Kentucky University&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AWKYT"&gt;WKYT&lt;/a&gt; in Kentucky it would "be months" before any of the satellite wreckage enters the &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth's&lt;/a&gt; atmosphere. "The debris doesn't simply fall out of its orbit. It will either vaporize or stay in orbit for some time before falling into Earth's atmosphere." 

The satellites, both of which weighed in excess of 1,000 pounds, and traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour, collided 491 miles above the Earth. Scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive. They are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the Earth will be affected. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Strategic%20Command"&gt;United States Strategic Command&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;U.S. Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; office is tracking the debris. The result of plotting analysis will be posted to a public website.

&lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide%20United%20FC"&gt;Adelaide United&lt;/a&gt; will play in the &lt;a href="w%3AA-League"&gt;A-League&lt;/a&gt; football preliminary final &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20Roar%20FC"&gt;Queensland Roar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday night. In a &lt;a href="w%3APage%20playoff%20system"&gt;top four finals series&lt;/a&gt;, which the A-League uses, the preliminary final is a final played between the qualifying Semi Final (1st vs. 2nd) and the winner of the elimination Semi Final (3rd vs. 4th) for the remaining spot in the Grand Final.

Adelaide United opened the scoring at the 25 minute mark through midfielder Fabian Barbiero. Barbiero's shot, which sailed into the top lefthand corner of goal, came from just outside the 18 yard box off to the right of the goals.

"I thought we were most probably the better team but we were beaten by a wonder strike, it was a fantastic strike," said Queensland coach Frank Farina.

Queensland rallied in the second half and continually took shots on goal. However, an indifferent Adelaide kept them out. Serginho Van Dijk fired some inaccurate shots while Mitch Nichols had a low trajectory shot saved by Adelaide keeper Eugene Galekovic.

"That's the biggest disappointment. The grand final's not a disappointment, to be totally honest," Farina said. "It's not qualifying for &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, that was the biggest prize tonight. It's disappointing, but if we keep this current squad together it'll happen. We'll get to Asia and we'll get to a grand final."

Adelaide will now play &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Victory%20FC"&gt;Melbourne Victory&lt;/a&gt; in the Grand Final at the &lt;a href="w%3ADocklands%20Stadium"&gt;Telstra Dome&lt;/a&gt;.

"There is no correlation between the debris from that collision and those reports of re-entry," said STRATCOM military spokeswoman Major Maj. Regina.

"It's a natural meteor, definitely," said Bill Cooke, an &lt;a href="w%3Aastronomy"&gt;astronomer&lt;/a&gt; at NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. 

On Tuesday, February 10, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; civilian communications satellite &lt;a href="w%3AIridium%2033"&gt;Iridium 33&lt;/a&gt;, launched in 1997, and the defunct &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; military communications satellite &lt;a href="w%3AKosmos-2251"&gt;Kosmos-2251&lt;/a&gt;, launched in 1993, collided over Siberia. On Friday February 13, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA) issued an alert for falling debris from the satellites, following reports of "explosions and earthquakes" along with "flashes in the sky" in &lt;a href="w%3AJackson%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALouisville%2C%20Kentucky"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.

Then again on Sunday, calls to &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt; began to come in to &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamson%20County%2C%20Texas"&gt;Williamson County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; sheriff's office around 12:30 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone"&gt;Central time&lt;/a&gt;) that burning debris and fireballs were seen falling from the sky onto parts of &lt;a href="w%3AAustin%2C%20Texas"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWaco%2C%20Texas"&gt;Waco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%2C%20Texas"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;.

"The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FAA) reported to local law enforcement on Friday that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris. These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms, resulting in vibrations felt by some residents, as well as flashes of light across the sky," said the NOAA on Friday in an public information alert posted on their website. The FAA says the burning material over Texas is not related to this alert.

"We don't know what it was [over Texas]," said Roland Herwig, a spokesman for the FAA on Monday. The alerts still remain in effect in Kentucky until further notice.

Residents in Texas reported their homes and windows shaking and large explosions on Sunday morning. After a search of several areas, the &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamson%20County%2C%20Texas"&gt;Williamson county&lt;/a&gt; sheriff's office reported that no debris or impact sites were found. Earlier unconfirmed reports had said the debris could have been the result of a small plane exploding. 

There was previous speculation was that the object in Texas could have been a meteor. Doctor Marco Ciocca, a professor at &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Kentucky%20University"&gt;Eastern Kentucky University&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AWKYT"&gt;WKYT&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday that it's too early for the debris from the satellites to be reentering the planet's atmosphere. "[It could] be months" before any of the satellite wreckage enters the earth's atmosphere. "The debris doesn't simply fall out of its orbit. It will either vaporize or stay in orbit for some time before falling into earth's atmosphere."

However, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20of%20Concerned%20Scientists"&gt;Union of Concerned Scientists&lt;/a&gt; (UCS) said on February 12 that the debris could have taken 10 days or less to reenter over portions of the planet. 

"Within 24 hours of the collision, the U.S. space tracking system had identified 600 pieces of debris. This large number suggests that the collision must have been relatively head-on. If the two satellites hit head-on, rather than a glancing blow, the energy of the collision would completely disintegrate both satellites into clouds of debris," said the UCS in a statement on their website who also added that the collision took place in "the same region of space where &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; destroyed a defunct Chinese weather satellite with an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon" in 2007. "That January 2007 test created a massive amount of debris." There have been at least eight major satellite collisions since 1991. 

The satellites, both of which had a mass in excess of 450 kilograms, and were traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour (28,150 km/hour), collided 491 miles (790 km) above the earth. Scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive. They are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the earth will be affected. STRATCOM continues to track the debris. The results of a plotting analysis will be posted to a public website.

A team of scientists at &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; claim to have detected a subtle, missing element of &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Einstein"&gt;Einstein's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20relativity"&gt;theory of relativity&lt;/a&gt;.

In a press release dated February 16th, Robert Kahn, Stanford University's Public Affairs Coordinator, announced the experimental confirmation of &lt;a href="w%3Aframe%20dragging"&gt;frame dragging&lt;/a&gt;, an effect in which the presence of a rotating body causes space itself to be pulled along as the body rotates. While the effect was theorized by &lt;a href="w%3AJosef%20Lense"&gt;Josef Lense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Thirring"&gt;Hans Thirring&lt;/a&gt; as far back as 1918, the small scale of the effect, as little as one part in a trillion for a satellite orbiting the &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;, made detecting the effect difficult.

The experiment was conducted on the satellite from 2004 to 2005. However, the complexity of the data analysis along with unforeseen engineering problems have made finding the effect in the experiment's results difficult. In particular, the presence of small electrical charges on the gyroscopes interfered with their results.

Francis Everitt, the experiment's Principal Investigator, stresses in an interview with the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that their announcement is only preliminary and that, with further analysis, they hope to improve the precision of their results; currently, they say they have only detected the frame dragging effect to within plus or minus fifteen percent of its expected value.

The theory of general relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century to explain the behavior of moving objects in space, after the discovery that the &lt;a href="w%3Aspeed%20of%20light"&gt;speed of light&lt;/a&gt; was always the same no matter how the person measuring it was moving. While it successfully explains many strange behaviors in space, such as the slow shifting of the orbit of &lt;a href="w%3AMercury%20%28planet%29"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3Agravitational%20lensing"&gt;bending of light&lt;/a&gt; by massive objects such as &lt;a href="w%3Ablack%20hole"&gt;black holes&lt;/a&gt;, testing the theory on Earth has always been difficult due to the small scale of relativity's effects in everyday life.

"I don't want to pretend that today marks the end of our economic problems, nor does it constitute all of what we're going to have to do to turn our economy around," Obama said at the ceremony, "but today does mark the beginning of the end — the beginning of what we need to do to create jobs for Americans scrambling in the wake of layoffs.

"The beginning of what we need to do to provide relief from families worried they won't be able to pay next month's bills. The beginning of the first steps to set our economy on a firmer foundation, paving the way to long-term growth and prosperity."
&lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Joe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; praised the president on his work getting the bill passed. "Less than a month into his presidency, the president is about to sign into law what is, I believe, a landmark achievement," he said. "Because of what he did America can take a first very strong step leading us out of this very difficult road to recovery we find ourselves with. So, on behalf of our country and its people, Mr President, let me presume to say: thank you, we owe you a great deal." 

According to Obama, the package is intended to save or create up to three and a half million jobs, and increase rebuilding infrastructure and consumer spending. 34% of the package is devoted to tax cuts equalling $286 billion, and a further $120 billion will be used to fund infrastructure projects, such as road-building and transportation. 64% of the package will be allocated for money for social programs and spending.
Most &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; lawmakers opposed the bill when it was voted upon in the Senate and the House last week. The &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; passed the bill without any Republican support, and only three Republicans voted for it in the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Committee"&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/a&gt; chairman &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20S.%20Steele"&gt;Michael S. Steele&lt;/a&gt; said he was disappointed by what he thought was the president's lack of a bipartisan approach in passing the bill: "In these difficult economic times, it is imperative that Republicans and Democrats work together to create new jobs and grow the economy. Instead, Congressional Democrats worked behind closed doors to write legislation that will fall short of creating the promised new jobs, but will guarantee a larger debt burden on our children and grandchildren." 

US stock markets were lower today, with the &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; losing 3.29% or 258.62 points at the end of the day to a level of 7,591.79.

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; has seized 425 acres of &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; land in the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; in order to build 2,500 new &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20settlement"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; homes according to Israeli officials. This comes after &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Special Envoy &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Mitchell"&gt;George Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; asked for a freeze on settlement expansion which is deemed illegal under international law.

The seized land will be integrated into the Israeli city of &lt;a href="w%3AEfrat"&gt;Efrat&lt;/a&gt;, a city which is to house 30,000 people according to the mayor of Efrat.

Israeli foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3ATzipi%20Livni"&gt;Tzipi Livni&lt;/a&gt; has stated that in order to make peace, settlement expansion must stop and furthermore Israeli settlers should leave lands already settled in. Livni's party, &lt;a href="w%3AKadima"&gt;Kadima&lt;/a&gt;, beat the right wing &lt;a href="w%3ALikud"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt; party in elections last week by one parliament seat, not enough to form the required majority. Likud party leader &lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Netanyahu"&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt; has stated that he firmly supports settlement expansion and has said that peace talks with Palestinians are a waste of time.

&lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, Palestinian president in the West Bank, has previously stated that there will be no negotiations as long as settlement expansion continues. "We oppose settlement activity in principle, and if the settlement activity doesn't stop, any meetings (with the Israelis) will be worthless," Abbas said Monday.

Israeli human rights group &lt;a href="w%3AYesh%20Din"&gt;Yesh Din&lt;/a&gt; has stated that these settlements are a violation of international law, saying that the occupying power is supposed to work for the benefit of the people being occupied. The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; agrees saying that the settlements are a violation of the &lt;a href="w%3AFourth%20Geneva%20Convention"&gt;Fourth Geneva Convention&lt;/a&gt; and international law.

According to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrnithology"&gt;ornithologists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a rare &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abuttonquail"&gt;buttonquail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; feared to have gone extinct was recently documented alive by a cameraman inadvertently filming a local market, right before it was sold and headed for the cooking pot. Scientists had suspected the species—listed as "data deficient" on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIUCN%20Red%20List"&gt;2008 International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List Category&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; —was &lt;a href="wikt%3Aextinct"&gt;extinct&lt;/a&gt;. 

Last month, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20trapping"&gt;native bird trappers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; snared and successfully caught the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuzon%20Buttonquail"&gt;Luzon Buttonquail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (♡❤Turnix worcesteri♡❤ or ♡❤Worcester's buttonquail♡❤) in Dalton Pass, a cold and wind-swept bird passageway in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACaraballo%20Mountains"&gt;Caraballo Mountains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANueva%20Vizcaya"&gt;Nueva Vizcaya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , located between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACordillera%20Central%2C%20Luzon"&gt;Cordillera Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASierra%20Madre%20%28Philippines%29"&gt;Sierra Madre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mountain ranges, in Northern &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuzon"&gt;Luzon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

The rare species, previously known to birders only through drawings based on dead museum specimens collected several decades ago, was identified in a documentary filmed in the Philippines called ♡❤Bye-Bye Birdie♡❤.

British &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABirdwatching"&gt;birder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and WBCP member Desmond Allen was watching a January 26 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADVD-video"&gt;DVD-video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of a documentary, ♡❤Bye-Bye Birdie♡❤, when he recognized the bird in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astill%20image"&gt;still image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20picture%20credits"&gt;credits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that lasted less than a second. Allen created a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ascreenshot"&gt;screenshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which was photographed by their birder-companion, Arnel Telesforo, also a WBCP member,
in Nueva Vizcaya's poultry market, before it was cooked and eaten.

♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AI-Witness"&gt;i-Witness: The GMA Documentaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, a Philippine &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADocumentary%20film"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news and public affairs television show aired by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGMA%20Network"&gt;GMA Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had incorporated Telesforo's photographs and video footage of the live bird in the documentary, that was created by the TV crew led by Mr Howie Severino. The Philippine Network had not realized what they filmed until Allen had informed the crew of interesting discovery.

Mr Severino and the crew were at that time, in Dalton Pass to film "akik", the traditional practice of trapping wild birds with nets by first attracting them with bright lights on moonless nights. "I'm shocked. I don't know of any other photos of this. No bird watchers have ever given convincing reports that they have seen it at all... This is an exciting discovery," said Allen. 
The Luzon Buttonquail was only known through an illustration in the authoritative book by Robert S. Kennedy, et al, ♡❤A Guide to the Birds of the Philippines♡❤. This birders "bible" includes a drawing based on the skins of dead specimens collected a century ago, whereas the otherwise comprehensive &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStock%20photography"&gt;image bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOriental%20Bird%20Club"&gt;Oriental Bird Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; does not contain a single image of the Worcester's Buttonquail.

“With the photograph and the promise of more sightings in the wild, we can see the living bill, the eye color, the feathers, rather than just the mushed-up museum skin,” exclaimed Allen, who has been birdwatching for fifty years, fifteen in the Philippines, and has an extensive collection of bird calls on his ipod. He has also spotted the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchurian%20Bush-warbler"&gt;Oriental (or Manchurian) Bush Warbler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , another rare bird which he has not seen in the Philippines. 

“We are ecstatic that this rarely seen species was photographed by accident. It may be the only photo of this poorly known bird. But I also feel sad that the locals do not value the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abiodiversity"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around them and that this bird was sold for only P10 and headed for the cooking pot,” Wild Bird Club of the Philippines (WBCP) president Mike Lu said. “Much more has to be done in creating conservation awareness and local consciousness about our unique threatened bird fauna. This should be an easy task for the local governments assisted by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Environment%20and%20Natural%20Resources%20%28Philippines%29"&gt;DENR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . What if this was the last of its species?” Lu added.

“This is a very important finding. Once you don’t see a bird species in a generation, you start to wonder if it’s extinct, and for this bird species we simply do not know its status at all," said Arne Jensen, a Danish ornithologist and biodiversity expert, and WBCP Records Committee head.

According to the WBCP, the Worcester’s buttonquail was first described based on specimens bought in Quinta Market in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQuiapo%2C%20Manila"&gt;Quiapo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1902, and was named after Dean Conant Worcester.

Since then just a few single specimens have been photographed and filmed from Nueva Vizcaya and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABenguet"&gt;Benguet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and lately, in 2007, from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20Province"&gt;Mountain Province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AField%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History"&gt;Field Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADean%20Conant%20Worcester"&gt;Dean Conant Worcester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , D.Sc., F.R.G.S. was an &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZoology"&gt;zoologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , public official, and authority on the Philippines, born at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThetford%2C%20Vermont"&gt;Thetford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Vermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt;, and educated at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Michigan"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (A.B., 1889). 

From 1899 to 1901 he was a member of 
the United States &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20Commission"&gt;Philippine Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; thenceforth until 1913 he served as secretary of the interior for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20Insular%20Government"&gt;Philippine Insular Government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In 1910, he founded the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20General%20Hospital"&gt;Philippine General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which has become the hospital for the poor and the sick.

In October, 2004, at the request of Mr Moises Butic, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALamut%2C%20Ifugao"&gt;Lamut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; CENR Officer, Mr Jon Hornbuckle, of Grove Road, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASheffield"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has conducted a short investigation into &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20trapping"&gt;bird-trapping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIfugao%2C%20Mountain%20Province"&gt;Ifugao, Mountain Province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABanaue%2C%20Ifugao"&gt;Banaue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Mount Polis, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASagada%2CMountain%20Province"&gt;Sagada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Dalton Pass, in Nueva Vizcaya.

"Prices ranged from 100 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20peso"&gt;pesos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFruit-dove"&gt;Fruit-Dove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to 300 pesos for a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMetallic%20Pigeon"&gt;Metallic Pigeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Other species that are caught from time to time include &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlame-breasted%20Fruit-dove"&gt;Flame-breasted Fruit-Dove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuzon%20Bleeding-heart"&gt;Luzon Bleeding-heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; on one occasion, around 50 of the latter were trapped! All other trapped birds are eaten," said Hornbuckle. "The main trapping season is November to February. Birds are caught at the lights using &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInsect%20collecting"&gt;butterfly-catching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; type nets. Quails and Buttonquails were more often shot in the fields at this time, rather than caught, and occasionally included the rare Luzon (Worcester’s) Buttonquail, which is only known from dead specimens, and is a threatened bird species reported from Dalton Pass," he added.

In August, 1929, Richard C. McGregor and Leon L. Gardner of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACooper%20Ornithological%20Society"&gt;Cooper Ornithological Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; compiled a book entitled ♡❤Philippine Bird Traps♡❤. The authors described the Luzon Buttonquail as "very rare," having only encountered it twice, once in August and once in September. 

"They are caught with a scoop net from the back of a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acarabao"&gt;carabao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Filipino hunters snared them, baiting with branches of artificial red peppers made of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asealing%20wax"&gt;sealing wax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ," wrote McGregor and Leon L. Gardner. "The various ingenious and effectual devices used by Filipinos for bird-trapping include [the] 'Teepee Trap' which consists of a conical tepee, woven of split &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abamboo"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arattan"&gt;rattan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about 3 feet high and 3 feet across at the base, with a fairly narrow entrance. 'Spring &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASnares"&gt;Snares&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' were also used, where a slip noose fastened to a strongly bent bamboo or other elastic branch, which is released by a trigger, which is usually the perch of the trap," their book explained.

A passage from the bird-trap book, which explains why &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFilipino"&gt;Filipinos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had eaten these endangered bird species, goes as follows:
A global review of threatened species by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature"&gt;International Union for Conservation of Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IUCN) indicates &lt;a href="Report%20says%20disappearing%20life%20threatens%20biodiversity"&gt;drastic decline of animal and plant life&lt;/a&gt;. This includes a quarter of all &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amammal"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one out of eight birds, one out of three &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aamphibians"&gt;amphibians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and 70 percent of plants.

The report, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIUCN%20Red%20List"&gt;♡❤Red List of Threatened Species♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is published by IUCN every year. Additionally, a global assessment of the health of the world's species is released once in four years. The data is compiled by 1,700 experts from 130 countries. The key findings of the report were announced at the World Conservation Congress held in &lt;a href="Barcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. 

The survey includes 44,838 species of wild &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afauna"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aflora"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , out of which 16,928 species are threatened with extinction. Among the threatened, 3,246 are tagged critically endangered, the highest category of threat. Another 4,770 species are endangered and 8,912 vulnerable to extinction. 
Environmental scientists say they have concrete evidence that the planet is undergoing the &lt;a href="Largest%20mass%20extinction%20in%2065%20million%20years%20underway%2C%20scientists%20say"&gt;"largest mass extinction in 65 million years"&lt;/a&gt;. Leading environmental scientist Professor Norman Myers says the Earth is experiencing its "Sixth Extinction."

Scientists forecast that up to five million species will be lost this century. "We are well into the opening phase of a mass extinction of species. There are about 10 million species on earth. If we carry on as we are, we could lose half of all those 10 million species," Myers said.

Scientists are warning that by the end of this century, the planet could lose up to half its species, and that these extinctions will alter not only biological diversity but also the evolutionary processes itself. They state that human activities have brought our planet to the point of biotic crisis.

In 1993, Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson estimated that the planet is losing 30,000 species per year - around three species per hour. Some biologists have begun to feel that the biodiversity crisis dubbed the "Sixth Extinction" is even more severe, and more imminent, than Wilson had expected.

The Luzon Buttonquail (♡❤Turnix worcesteri♡❤) is a species of bird in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATurnicidae"&gt;Turnicidae&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; family. It is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEndemism"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the island of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuzon"&gt;Luzon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, where it is known from just six localities thereof. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland, in the highlands of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACordillera%20Central%20%28Luzon%29"&gt;Cordillera Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , although records are from 150-1,250 m, and the possibility that it frequents forested (non-grassland) habitats cannot be discounted.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AButtonquail"&gt;buttonquails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or ♡❤hemipodes♡❤ are a small family of birds which resemble, but are unrelated to, the true &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQuail"&gt;quails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They inhabit warm grasslands in Asia, Africa, and Australia. They are assumed to be &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABird%20migration"&gt;intra-island migrants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and breed somewhere in northern Luzon in April-June and that at least some birds disperse southwards in the period July-March. 
These ♡❤Turnicidae♡❤ are small, drab, running birds, which avoid flying. The female is the more brightly coloured of the sexes, and initiates courtship. Unusually, the buttonquails are &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APolyandry"&gt;polyandrous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with the females circulating among several males and expelling rival females from her territory. Both sexes cooperate in building a nest in the earth, but only the male &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20incubation"&gt;incubates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the eggs and tends the young.

Called "Pugo" (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aquail"&gt;quail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) by natives, these birds inhabit rice paddies and scrub lands near farm areas because of the abundance of seeds and insects that they feed on regularly. These birds are characterized by their black heads with white spots, a brown or fawn colored body and yellow legs on males and the females are brown with white and black spots. 

These birds are very secretive, choosing to make small path ways through the rice fields, which unfortunately leads to their deaths as well, they are hunted by children and young men by means of setting spring traps along their usual path ways.

Buttonquails are a notoriously &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACrypsis"&gt;cryptic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and unobtrusive family of birds, and the species could conceivably occur in reasonable numbers somewhere. They are included in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIUCN%20Red%20List"&gt;2008 IUCN Red List Category&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (as evaluated by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABirdLife%20International"&gt;BirdLife International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; IUCN Red List of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThreatened%20Species"&gt;Threatened Species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). They are also considered as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVulnerable%20species"&gt;Vulnerable species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by IUCN and BirdLife International, since these species is judged to have a ten percent chance of going extinct in the next one hundred years.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASuperior%20Courts%20of%20California"&gt;Superior Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Judge Peter Espinoza has today rejected a motion by lawyers for &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="film"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt; director &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Polanski"&gt;Roman Polanski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to have charges of unlawful sex with a child dismissed.

In 1977, Polanski was arrested charged with sodomy, sexual assault and rape of a 13-year-old girl at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Nicholson"&gt;Jack Nicholson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's house in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Polanski agreed to plead guilty to unlawful sex with a child, often called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astatutory%20rape"&gt;statutory rape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in exchange for having the more serious charges dropped.

However, in 1978, before his sentencing, Polanski fled the United States. He has since been a fugitive and faces arrest if he sets foot on US soil. France refuses to extradite him.

Polanski's lawyers argued that there were irregularities and misconduct in the original handling of the case. While the Judge agreed, he rejected the notion that the charges should be dismissed on the grounds that Polanski cannot challenge the ruling while on the run as a fugitive.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Politicians%20begin%20campaigns%20for%20Flint%2C%20Michigan%20replacement%20mayor&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Several candidates have announced their intent to run in the special &lt;a href="w%3AFlint%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Flint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; mayoral primary election scheduled for May 5, 2009. The primary election was called to fill the remainder of resigning Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Williamson"&gt;Don Williamson&lt;/a&gt;'s term ending in 2011. The two candidates with the most votes will face off in the August special general election. Each candidate will need to collect at least 900 signatures of registered Flint electors in twenty day to qualify for the May 5, 2009 ballot. 

On the first day petitions were available, the City Clerk's office handed out petitions in the morning to Aron Gerics, Dayne Walling, Sheldon Neeley and &lt;a href="w%3ABrenda%20Clack"&gt;Brenda Clack&lt;/a&gt;. Gregory Eason, Waseem (Sam) Fakhoury, Theodore P. Jankowski, Eric Mays, Devona Watson and Darryl Buchanan picked up petitions later in the day. Stephanie Robb Martin, a Flint Board of Education Trustee was one of eight more potential candidates that pick up petitions since then.

Darryl Buchanan, former City Administrator and "Deputy Mayor", announced he is the running for the office of Mayor on Tuesday February 17. Williamson just replaced Buchanan as City Administrator on February 4, keeping him from succeeding Williamson as Temporary Mayor upon his resignation. Buchanan served as the city ombudsman and councilor before becoming city administrator. He believes he has good relations with the city council and was critical of Williamson's combative relations with the council. 

Buchanan supporters believe that Buchanan has the experience for the position of mayor. While some residents and a political analyst, Bill Ballenger, editor of ♡❤Inside Michigan Politics♡❤, believes that his role in Williamson's administration and their friendship hurts his candidacy.

Sheldon Neeley, current city councilman for Ward 6, announced his candidacy. Neely stated he will open three offices last week. Already, Sheldon Neeley has returned his petitions Thursday with 1,100 signatures to the City Clerk's office. 

Dayne Walling, who narrowly lost to Don Williamson in the 2007 general election, previously announced that he was running if the recall election against Williamson was successful. On Thursday, Walling officially announced he was running at a "Working for Change" rally at the YMCA.
&lt;a href="w%3AGenesee%20County%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Genesee County&lt;/a&gt; Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3ABrenda%20Clack"&gt;Brenda Clack&lt;/a&gt; served as Michigan 34th District State Representative from 2002 to 2008 switching positions with former Flint Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AWoodrow%20Stanley"&gt;Woodrow Stanley&lt;/a&gt;.

Aron Gerics, a Mott Community College student and a Mott's Workforce Development Program program assistant, intends to run for mayor. As a write-in candidate for the 2008 49th District House seat election, Gerics lost to Lee Gonzales, D-Flint Twp, the incumbent.

Gregory Eason is a former CEO for Jobs Central Inc. and a Williamson critic. Eric Mays is a political activist. Devona Watson is retiree and long time resident. Theodore P. Jankowski served in the Marines and produces a show for public access television.

City Administrator and Temporary Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Brown%20%28Michigan%20politician%29"&gt;Michael Brown&lt;/a&gt; 
stated that he will not run as he wants to focus on city business, and is slated to deliver the annual state-of-the-city address.

"He's not just keeping the seat warm until someone else takes over," Brown's communications director Bob Campbell said. "There are some difficult decisions ahead, most notably in the area of the city's finances. He's all about the revival and renewal of the city of Flint."

Additional public officials are considering entering the race including former County Commissioner Raynetta Speed and Councilman Scott Kincaid. State senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Gleason"&gt;John Gleason&lt;/a&gt; D-Flushing is pondering a moving into the city to run.

On Tuesday, March 3, Darryl Buchanan, Brenda Clack and Gregory Eason all turned in their completed nominations to the city clerk's office.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Electoral%20Commission"&gt;Australian Electoral Commission&lt;/a&gt; has announced that electorates for the federal election will be redrawn in the states of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Australia%23House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Australian House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; has 150 members elected from single representative electorates.

New South Wales will lose an electorate while Queensland gains one.

"The figures show the population for Queensland has increased sufficiently to result in that State increasing its entitlement from 29 to 30 seats,” said Electoral Commissioner Ed Killesteyn. “At the same time, the entitlement for New South Wales will reduce from 49 to 48 seats.”

A similar occurrence occurred before the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20federal%20election%2C%202007"&gt;2007 election&lt;/a&gt;, with the electorate of &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Gwydir"&gt;Gwydir&lt;/a&gt; in New South Wales being abolished and the electorate of &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Flynn"&gt;Flynn&lt;/a&gt; being created in central Queensland.

<h3>Ireland's most-wanted traffic offender unmasked</h3>

For several years &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGarda%20Siochana"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; hunted the country's most notorious traffic offender. Mr Prawo Jazdy ran up over fifty speeding and parking offences all over the country, but escaped fines by giving a different address each time. Eventually the penny dropped, and in June 2007 the Garda Traffic Division issued a confidential memo to officers, which has just been published in the Irish press. "♡❤Prawo Jazdy♡❤ is actually the Polish for driving license and not the first and surname on the license. Having noticed this, I decided to check and see how many times officers have made this mistake. It is quite embarrassing to see that the system has created Prawo Jazdy as a person with over 50 identities."

200,000 Polish citizens moved to Ireland in the years following Poland's accession to the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, and their driving licenses remain valid throughout the EU.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Court of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; has awarded &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;2500 to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAbu%20Qatada"&gt;Abu Qatada&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; militant and cleric, in a lawsuit he filed against the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; which detained him without trial in 2002.

Qatada, who is facing extradition to &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; to serve a life sentence for terrorism charges, and 10 others were detained under &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-terrorism%2C%20Crime%20and%20Security%20Act%202001"&gt;Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001&lt;/a&gt;. This act allowed foreign nationals suspected of terrorism to be detained, before being repealed in 2004 due to its discriminatory nature. The ECHR's ruling determined the decision to detain Qatada under this law breached the 'right to liberty and security' secured in the European Convention of Human Rights.

The British government claimed they believed the people detained were "a threat to our national security."

Some British politicians also objected to paying compensation to people believed to be terrorists.

Matthew Elliot, a lobbyist for the Taxpayers' Alliance, argued: "This man hates everything Britain stands for, so it is disgusting that ordinary taxpayers are now forced to pay him thousands of pounds."

Chris Grayling, the shadow home secretary commented: "This decision will horrify most reasonable people in the UK … it makes a mockery of the concept of human rights if we can't protect ourselves against people who are out to destroy our society."

<h1>Sheffield pub is CAMRA's Pub of the Year</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sheffield%20pub%20is%20CAMRA%27s%20Pub%20of%20the%20Year&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A &lt;a href="w%3AYorkshire"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; pub affected by &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20Kingdom%20floods"&gt;flooding in 2007&lt;/a&gt; has been named &lt;a href="w%3ACAMRA"&gt;CAMRA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Pub%20of%20the%20Year"&gt;National Pub of the Year&lt;/a&gt; for 2008.

The Kelham Island Tavern in &lt;a href="w%3ASheffield"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AKelham%20Island%20Quarter"&gt;Kelham Island Quarter&lt;/a&gt; was in a "semi derelict" state when it was purchased in 2001. After it was re-opened in 2002 by licensee Trevor Wraith and manager Lewis Gonda, business quickly picked up and the pub has been awarded Sheffield CAMRA's local Pub of the Year award for the past four years. The pub won the award despite six weeks of closure a year and a half ago when the pub's cellar and floor were affected by the flooding of the &lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20Don%2C%20South%20Yorkshire"&gt;River Don&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby Kelham goit. The pub also received Yorkshire CAMRA's Pub of the Year award in 2004 and 2007. 

CAMRA's Pub of the Year award is judged in several stages, with local CAMRA branches evaluating the pubs in their area and passing on recommendations for regional championships. The list of regional champions is then whittled down to four finalists, with CAMRA judges visiting each of these anonymously before making a final decision.

The pub regularly serves ten and often up to thirteen &lt;a href="w%3AReal%20Ale"&gt;Real Ales&lt;/a&gt;, and variety and quality of beers served are of particular interest to CAMRA, which was founded in 1971 in order to preserve and promote traditional British beer and pubs, which the group see as threatened.

However, other considerations beyond range and variety of beers are also important. Julian Hough, CAMRA's Pubs Director, made particular note of the Tavern's "attention to detail". Mr Wraith also pointed out the pub's "sub-tropical" beer garden, which he calls his "pride and joy"; the pub was awarded Silver Gilts in the Yorkshire In Bloom competition every year since 2003 and has received the Gold Award in the local Sheffield In Bloom competition every year since 2005. The pub also regularly hosts evenings of folk music.

Mr Gonda credited the pub's success to the "excellent brewers we deal with, our faithful and supportive pub regulars, and our invaluable staff members." It was this community support which helped the pub recover so quickly after the 2007 flooding, with Mr Wraith describing the day the waters entered the pub. "The funny thing was that it was difficult to get the customers to evacuate. They just wanted to keep on drinking, but we did have to get them out eventually and some of them did get wet." Flood defences were erected after the customers left, but to no avail; Mr Wraith stayed in the pub overnight, despite the flooding and the lack of electricity.

The pub will be presented with the award in a ceremony later today at 1pm GMT.

The video was posted on the video sharing website &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, but was later removed "due to a copyright claim by Axiom 10 Productions, Inc." &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Bunker"&gt;Mark Bunker&lt;/a&gt; of XenuTV questioned why Axiom 10 would utilize the &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt; to remove the video from YouTube, as it was promoting their ideology about psychiatrists. It was later re-added to another site called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVimeo"&gt;Vimeo.com&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

David Figueroa, a spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3ACitizens%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights"&gt;Citizens Commission On Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; (CCHR), a human rights group founded by the Church in 1969, said, "terrorism employs violence. Against not just the general public, like in 9/11, but against individuals when they are captured." Figueroa is president of the CCHR organization in Florida.

"To take [a] person, and turn them into a killing machine, against their will or have them do things that are against their nature, you need something behind that. Psychiatrists employ drugs and conditioning techniques in order to change people from what they would normally be, into killing machines," added Figueroa. He also says that the leader of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; got the idea to form the terrorist group from his second in command, &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt; in 1988. Then 13 years later, 19 terrorists hijacked four U.S. commercial airliners, crashing two into the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; towers, one into the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;The Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; and one into a field in &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people.

"He was [bin Laden] just transformed from someone who was a supporter" of the "&lt;a href="w%3Ajihad"&gt;jihad&lt;/a&gt;" against the &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; occupation of &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, into someone whose "whole thought patterns and his entire viewpoint was changed by Zawahiri, and by whatever types of drugs Zawahiri used to make that change in bin Laden, we don't know", said Figueroa, who adds that Zawahiri was acting as a "psychiatrist". In another show hosed by Byrnes, former CCHR-International president Dennis H. Clarke claims Zawahiri to be a "psychiatrist, a therapist"; Zawahiri is referred to in this program as the "guy who runs" bin Laden. However, Zawahiri is actually a surgeon; he is not a psychiatrist or a psychologist.

Figueroa goes on to say that &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Akamikaze"&gt;kamikaze&lt;/a&gt; pilots responsible for bombing &lt;a href="w%3AAttack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; in December of 1941 were "on amphetamines which is a psychiatric drug" when they attacked. However, the Japanese did not employ kamikaze tactics until later in the war. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has contacted the CCHR for a statement regarding Figueroa's remarks, but have yet to receive a reply. Scientology-associated publications have also attributed tragedies including the &lt;a href="w%3AJonestown"&gt;Jonestown massacre&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; to psychiatry.

At the conclusion of the television program, the host promotes a brochure which he says illustrates how "notorious terrorist acts like 9/11 were basically created by psychiatrists operating behind the scenes".

The issue of Scientology's stance on psychiatry was brought to the forefront in the media during a 2005 appearance by &lt;a href="Tom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s program ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AToday%20%28NBC%20program%29"&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ with &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Lauer"&gt;Matt Lauer&lt;/a&gt;. At the time Cruise told Lauer he was critical of psychiatry and the use of antidepressants. In a December 2008 appearance on the ♡❤Today♡❤ show on a promotional tour for his film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AValkyrie%20%28film%29"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Cruise told Lauer he wanted to apologize and felt he appeared arrogant in his 2005 interview.

This is not the first time the Church made false accusations for acts of violence. In October 2008, the Church falsely accused the internet protest group ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ of a 2007 school shooting in &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. They accused ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ of being involved in the November 2007 shooting at &lt;a href="w%3AJokela%20school%20shooting"&gt;Jokela High School&lt;/a&gt;, in which a man named Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot and killed nine people, including himself. The Church accused Auvinen of being part of Anonymous, and further accused the group of plotting the attack. The &lt;a href="w%3AKeskusrikospoliisi"&gt;National Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (NBI) in Finland later told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that Anonymous had nothing to do with the crime.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit"&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; on Friday has declared &lt;a href="w%3AConstitutionality"&gt;unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Assembly%20Bills%201792%20%26amp%3B%201793"&gt;California Assembly Bills 1792 &amp; 1793&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; "ultraviolent video games law" that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent &lt;a href="w%3Avideo%20games"&gt;video games&lt;/a&gt; to minors.

&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20judge"&gt;Federal judge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AConsuelo%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Callahan"&gt;Consuelo M. Callahan&lt;/a&gt; has ruled that the 2005 statewide ban, which has yet to be enforced, violates minors' rights under the US Constitution's First and 14th amendment because even the most graphic on-screen mayhem, video game content represents free speech that cannot be censored without proper justification. 

The Court has ruled that there’s no convincing evidence it causes psychological damage to young people. The 3-0 judgment has affirmed an earlier ruling by a U.S. District Court, which barred enforcement of the law on the basis that it was "unduly restrictive" and "used overly broad definitions," and that the state failed to show that the limitations on violent video games would actually protect children.

In 2005, &lt;a href="w%3ALeland%20Yee"&gt;Leland Yee&lt;/a&gt; (余胤良), a &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Senate"&gt;California State Senator&lt;/a&gt; (in District 8 which includes the western half of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and most of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Mateo%20County"&gt;San Mateo County&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20pro%20Tempore"&gt;Speaker pro Tempore&lt;/a&gt; of the Assembly (D-&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ADaly%20City%2C%20California"&gt;Daly City&lt;/a&gt;), introduced &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Assembly%20Bills%201792%20%26amp%3B%201793"&gt;California Assembly Bills 1792 &amp; 1793&lt;/a&gt; which barred "ultra-violent" video games from &lt;a href="w%3Aminor%20%28law%29"&gt;minor&lt;/a&gt;s under the age of &lt;a href="w%3A8%20%28number%29"&gt;eighteen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and mandated the application of &lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board"&gt;ESRB&lt;/a&gt; ratings for video games. 

"California Assembly Bills 1792 &amp; 1793" were commonly called the "&lt;a href="w%3AUltraviolence"&gt;ultraviolent&lt;/a&gt; video games bills" or simply "video game ban" bills. Bill 1792 banned the sales of such video games while Bill 1793 required signs explaining the regulations on said games to be placed where such were sold. &lt;a href="California%20bans%20sale%20of%20violent%20video%20games%20to%20minors"&gt;Both bills were passed by the Assembly and signed&lt;/a&gt; by Governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; into law (AB 1179) on October 7, 2005.

♡❤Explicitly, these two bills provided that:♡❤

BULLET::::- AB 1792 will place ultra-violent video games into the "&lt;a href="w%3Aharmful"&gt;matter&lt;/a&gt;" portion of the &lt;a href="w%3Apenal%20code"&gt;penal code&lt;/a&gt;, which criminalizes the sale of said material to a minor.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- AB 1793 will require retailers to place M-rated games separate from other games intended for children, and will also require retailers to display signage explaining the ESRB rating system.

</ul>
Yee, a former child psychologist has &lt;a href="w%3ALeland%20Yee%23Video%20game%20controversies"&gt;publicly criticized&lt;/a&gt; such games as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto%3A%20San%20Andreas"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AManhunt%202"&gt;Manhunt 2&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and opposes the U.S. Army's ♡❤Global Gaming League♡❤. 

On October 17, 2005, before the effectivity of the challenged Act, plaintiffs &lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Merchants%20Association"&gt;Video Software Dealers Association&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Anot-for-profit"&gt;not-for-profit&lt;/a&gt; international trade association dedicated to advancing the interests of the $32 billion &lt;a href="w%3Ahome%20entertainment%20industry"&gt;home entertainment industry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Software%20Association"&gt;Entertainment Software Association&lt;/a&gt;, a 1994 US &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20association"&gt;trade association&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3Avideo%20game%20industry"&gt;video game industry&lt;/a&gt; have filed lawsuit (D.C. No. CV-05-04188-RMW) against the defendants Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Attorney%20General"&gt;CA Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;, Edmund G. Brown, Santa Clara County District Attorney George Kennedy, City Attorney for the City of San Jose, Richard Doyle, and County Counsel for the County of Santa Clara, Ann Miller Ravel.
Plaintiffs' counsel, &lt;a href="w%3AJenner%20%26amp%3B%20Block"&gt;Jenner &amp; Block&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20M.%20Smith"&gt;Paul M. Smith&lt;/a&gt; has filed a &lt;a href="w%3ADeclaratory%20relief"&gt;declaratory relief&lt;/a&gt; to invalidate the newly-enacted &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Civil%20Code"&gt;California Civil Code&lt;/a&gt; sections 1746-1746.5 (the “Act”), on the grounds that it allegedly violated 42 &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Code"&gt;U.S.C.&lt;/a&gt; § 1983 and the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Fourteenth Amendments&lt;/a&gt;. 

Plaintiffs have submitted that "the Act unconstitutionally curtailed &lt;a href="w%3Afreedom%20of%20expression"&gt;freedom of expression&lt;/a&gt; on its face based on content regulation and the labeling requirement, was unconstitutionally vague, and violated equal protection. California's restrictions could open the door for states to limit minors' access to other material under the guise of protecting children."

By December 2005, both bills had been struck down as unconstitutional, by &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20M.%20Whyte"&gt;Ronald M. Whyte&lt;/a&gt;, District Judge, Presiding in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California"&gt;United States District Court for the Northern District of California&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, thereby preventing either from going into effect on January 1, 2006. 

Judge Whyte has granted plaintiffs’ motion for a &lt;a href="w%3Apreliminary%20injunction"&gt;preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; in "Video Software Dealers Ass’n v. Schwarzenegger," 401 &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Supplement"&gt;F. Supp. 2d&lt;/a&gt; 1034 (N.D. Cal. 2005), and cross-motions for &lt;a href="w%3Asummary%20judgment"&gt;summary judgment&lt;/a&gt;, in "Video Software Dealers Ass’n v. Schwarzenegger," No. C-05-04188, slip op. (N.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2007). 

Similar bills were subsequently filed in such states as Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Michigan and Louisiana have been ruled to be unconstitutional by federal courts on First Amendment grounds, according to Sean Bersell, a spokesman for the Entertainment Merchants Association. 

The defendants, in the instant Case No. 07-16620, have timely appealed the &lt;a href="w%3Ajudgment"&gt;judgment&lt;/a&gt;. On October 29, 2008, the appealed case was argued and submitted to the &lt;a href="w%3ASacramento%2C%20California"&gt;Sacramento, California&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit"&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;, hence, the promulgation of the instant 30 pages decision (No. 07-16620; D.C. No. CV-05-04188-RMW) by &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Kozinski"&gt;Alex Kozinski&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Judge, &lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Runyan%20Thomas"&gt;Sidney R. Thomas&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href="w%3AConsuelo%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Callahan"&gt;Consuelo M. Callahan&lt;/a&gt; (who wrote the court's opinion), &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit"&gt;United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit&lt;/a&gt; Judges.

In the ban’s defense, &lt;a href="w%3ADeputy%20Attorney%20General"&gt;Deputy Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; for the State of California, Zackery Morazzini has contended that "if governments restrict the sale of pornography to minors, it should also create a separate category for ultra-violent video games." &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Brown"&gt;Edmund Gerald "Jerry" Brown, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Attorney%20General"&gt;California Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;, has also argued that "the Court should analyze the Act’s restrictions under what has been called the 'variable obscenity' or 'obscenity as to minors' standard first mentioned in Ginsberg, 390 U.S. 629. The Court’s reasoning in Ginsberg that a state could prohibit the sale of sexually-explicit material to minors that it could not ban from distribution to adults should be extended to materials containing violence."

The "Fallo" or dispositive portion of the &lt;a href="w%3AJudgment%20%28law%29"&gt;judgment&lt;/a&gt; in question goes as follows:
"We need to help empower parents with the ultimate decision over whether or not their children play in a world of violence and murder," said the law's author, Sen. Leland Yee, announcing he wanted &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Brown"&gt;Edmund Gerald "Jerry" Brown, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, the current &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Attorney%20General"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; and a former &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20California"&gt;governor&lt;/a&gt; of the State of California, to appeal the decision to the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;. 

"Letting the industry police itself is like letting kids sign their own report cards and that a self regulating system simply doesn't work. I've always contended that the ... law the governor signed was a good one for protecting children from the harm from playing these ultra-violent video games. I've always felt it would end up in the Supreme Court," Sen. Yee explained. "In fact, the high court recently agreed, in &lt;a href="w%3ARoper%20v.%20Simmons"&gt;Roper v. Simmons&lt;/a&gt; (2005), that we need to treat children differently in the eyes of the law due to brain development," he added.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Gallagher%20%28US%20politician%29"&gt;Michael D. Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;, president of the &lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Software%20Association"&gt;Entertainment Software Association&lt;/a&gt;, plaintiff, the Court's ruling has stressed that parents, with assistance from the industry, are the ones who should control what games their children play. "This is a clear signal that in California and across the country, the reckless pursuit of anti-video game legislation like this is an exercise in wasting taxpayer money, government time and state resources," Gallagher said in a statement.
Entertainment Software Association members include &lt;a href="w%3ADisney%20Interactive%20Studios"&gt;Disney Interactive Studios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Arts"&gt;Electronic Arts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft Corp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATHQ"&gt;THQ Inc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASony%20Computer%20Entertainment"&gt;Sony Computer Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; America, and &lt;a href="w%3ATake-Two%20Interactive"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt; Software, the maker of &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto%20%28series%29"&gt;“Grand Theft Auto”&lt;/a&gt; games. 

Judge Callahan has also reprimanded state lawyers for having failed to show any reasonable alternatives to an outright statewide ban against the ultra-violent video games. "Ratings education, retailer ratings enforcement, and control of game play by parents are the appropriate responses to concerns about video game content," said Bo Andersen, president and chief executive of the &lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Merchants%20Association"&gt;Entertainment Merchants Association&lt;/a&gt;. 

Andersen continues, "retailers are committed to assisting parents in assuring that children do not purchase games that are not appropriate for their age. Independent surveys show that retailers are doing a very good job in this area, with an 80 percent enforcement rate, and retailers will continue to work to increase enforcement rates even further; the court has correctly noted that the state cannot simply dismiss these efforts."

California was already forced to pay $282,794 to the ESA for attorneys' fees, money that would've helped with the state's current budget difficulties. Andersen has urged California government officials not to appeal the case. "The estimated $283,000 in taxpayer money spent by the state on this case is so far an 'ill-advised, and ultimately doomed, attempt at state-sponsored nannyism.' A voluntary ratings system already exists to avoid the state-sponsored nannyism of a ban," he explained.

"The governor believes strongly we have a responsibility to our children and our communities to protect against the effects of video games depicting ultra-violent actions," said Governor Schwarzenegger spokeswoman Camille Anderson adding the governor was reviewing Friday's decision.
Deputy Attorney General Zackery Morazzini, the state's counsel in the appealed case, has stressed that "a law restricting sales of violent games is far more effective than industry self-policing, since the technological controls that the court cited as another alternative can be easily bypassed by any kid with an Internet connection."

According to Jim Steyer, Founder of Common Sense Media, a non-profit organization of 750,000 regular users dedicated to improving children’s media lives, researches have shown that playing these violent video games are detrimental for kids mental and physical health. “The health threat involved with kids playing such games is equivalent to smoking cigarettes,” Steyer said. “These violent video games are learning tools for our children and clearly result in more aggressive behavior,” said Randall Hagar, California Psychiatric Association’s Director of Government Affairs.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Trade%20Commission"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;'s data reveals that "nearly 70 percent of thirteen to sixteen year olds are able to purchase M-rated (Mature) video games, which are designed for adults; ninety-two percent of children play video or computer games, of which about forty percent are rated M, which are the fastest growing segment of the 10 billion-dollar video game industry; the top selling games reward players for killing police officers, maiming elderly persons, running over pedestrians and committing despicable acts of murder and torture upon women and racial minorities."

<h1>Adela Lupșe, outburst TV presenter, gives her side</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Adela%20Lup%C8%99e%2C%20outburst%20TV%20presenter%2C%20gives%20her%20side&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The call-in quiz show is a staple of cheap programming throughout &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The format is simple: a question is displayed on screen, and callers phone in with their guesses &amp;ndash; paying a premium rate to do so. The programs are often repetitive, the average question simple, the average prize small.

Once in a while, though, something unusual does happen.

On December 6 2008, Adela Lupșe, presenting the call-in quiz ♡❤Telepremii♡❤ on &lt;a href="w%3ANa%C5%A3ional%20TV"&gt;Național TV&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ATelevision%20in%20Romania"&gt;Romanian television&lt;/a&gt;, had what ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ described as a "tantrum on air". As the final prize became available, Ms Lupșe's show had no callers. Already excited, she began to shout. Throwing the telephone down on the studio floor and stomping on it, she admonished her viewers, "I want the telephone to ring now. Now. Call me now!"

Various reports in the English-speaking press went on to state that Ms Lupșe had been fired, or fired and re-hired, that the show had been fined heavily, forced to move to a late-evening time slot, or given an adults-only rating.

After presenting the broadcasts of this morning's call-in programs, including the same one she was supposedly fired from in January, Ms Lupșe spoke to Wikinews from her television studio in &lt;a href="w%3ABudapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; to give her first full-length English interview and talk about her work and her version of events.

Adela Lupșe was born in 1988 to a miner's family in the village of &lt;a href="w%3APoiana%23Transylvania"&gt;Poiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABihor%20County"&gt;Bihor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATransylvania"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. A member of Romania's first post-&lt;a href="w%3ANicolae%20Ceau%C8%99escu"&gt;Ceaușescu&lt;/a&gt; generation, she grasped the power of television at a young age: "I think television is the most interesting phenomenon that the modern day has given us...for my type of personality, I find it impressive, the power that television has worldwide...We dress like the people that television promotes. We want to look like the celebrities that television launches."
Knowing television was the career for her, Lupșe moved to the city of &lt;a href="w%3AOradea"&gt;Oradea&lt;/a&gt; to study journalism, and began a job at a local television station as a health reporter. Using that position as a launching board, she found her way onto the national reality program ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aro%3ANor%C4%83%20pentru%20mama"&gt;Noră pentru mama 1&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (♡❤Daughter-in-law for Mom♡❤) on &lt;a href="w%3AKanal%20D"&gt;Kanal D&lt;/a&gt;, a show in which mothers of single sons attempted to matchmake for their children. Lupșe unabashedly admits she took part in the show only for exposure: "Actually my goal from the start was not to win this thing or to find someone. I wanted to get some attention and get people to know my face. I want this attention because I'm aware of the fact that it is not easy to enter this world! And I was doing all this in order to increase my chances to get my dream job in television." That dream: to host a nationally-broadcast talk show.

After participating in ♡❤Noră pentru mama♡❤, Lupșe was asked to audition for her first call-in program and was quickly hired. She describes a typical day: "One hour and a half before the show I'm in the make-up room. After I'm done with hair and make-up I go down to the studio for the before the show to talk to the producer. And then is the result that anyone gets to see." All of her banter on-air is improvised: "Definitely there is no script! Everything that you see comes out spontaneosly during the show."

On any given day, Ms Lupșe is on camera for between one and five hours, presenting a number of different call-in shows on several different networks: not only Național TV but also &lt;a href="w%3APrima%20TV"&gt;Prima TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAntena%201%20%28Romania%29"&gt;Antena 1&lt;/a&gt;, all broadcast from the same studio. Despite the repetition, she doesn't get bored. "For me it's always exciting. I enjoy it very much! If I'm tired at the end of the show it means I've done a good show. But I'm never tired during the show." When I play a clip of one of her energetic show presentations &amp;ndash; not the one she's become best known for &amp;ndash; she elaborates on her exuberance. "I'm always excited when I'm about to give big prizes! There is no show without winners!"
Adela Lupșe's December 6 broadcast was a normal day. She went to the studio, prepared her hair and makeup, spoke to the producer, and went onscreen. The only thing out of the ordinary, she says, was the size of the prize: 1500 &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20leu"&gt;leu&lt;/a&gt;, about $US 450, or roughly a month's wage for a typical Romanian. She describes the critical moment in nonchalant terms:

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡You weren't angry at all?♡❤♡
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Even when you put your foot on the telephone.♡❤♡
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡All we in most countries have seen is those two minutes. What happened afterward?♡❤♡

She says she and her show weren't fired or fined. The first inkling she had, in fact, that there was something unusual about that day's broadcast was when, on January 9 2009, &lt;a href="w%3AMTV%20Russia"&gt;MTV Russia&lt;/a&gt; aired the clip of her shouting and stomping on the phone, mixed with some dramatic orchestral rock music. That same clip, uploaded onto video service &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, quickly garnered over one million views.
Adela Lupșe says she's happy with the attention brought her from her outburst: she's been interviewed on talk shows in both Hungary and Romania so "people were able to see that I'm a normal, fun to be around person." She's occasionally recognized in the street, which she enjoys.

And as for the charge most frequently leveled against her, that she's "crazy": "I think it is normal that people have prejudicies, everyone is free to express his opinion in the same way that I'm free to do my job the best that I can! I'm hurt if my family is unhappy with people's comments but I think I gain the wisdom to ignore the negative feedback!

"I think also I'm a little bit crazy. So it's all good!"

<h1>Australian state of Queensland will go to the polls on March 21</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20state%20of%20Queensland%20will%20go%20to%20the%20polls%20on%20March%2021&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

"It's time for Queensland to settle this election. It's time to settle the speculation. So that government, business and the community can get on with the task at hand and not be distracted and destabilised by looming elections," Ms Bligh said in the statement.

Ms Bligh has recently denied that she would call an early election.

"I have always said that I want my government to run the full term and I have not changed my view on this lightly," she said.

"After 11 years in office, Ms Bligh only cares about one job: her own," said &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Springborg"&gt;Lawrence Springborg&lt;/a&gt; head of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20National%20Party%20of%20Queensland"&gt;Liberal National Party&lt;/a&gt; (LNP) and the &lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20Opposition"&gt;Leader of the Opposition&lt;/a&gt;. "Queensland deserves better. Over the next 27 days, the LNP will build on our vision for the Queensland we all deserve."

The Opposition need to pick up at least twenty seats from the government to overcome the significant Labor majority and a number of independents.

"It is a sad legacy of economic management and mismanagement of the Labor Government that after 11 years of the rivers of gold, our state is broke," Mr Springborg said. "It's a little bit like lighting a fire and then running around and wanting credit for putting it out." 

A March 21 election gives candidates twenty six day to campaign. This is just within the legal requirements. The Queensland Electoral Act (1992) requires the election campaign to last between 26 and 56 days.

The &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20Greens"&gt;Queensland Greens&lt;/a&gt; nominated an environmental lawyer to run against treasurer Andrew Fraser.

"We can tackle climate change and create long-term jobs, but Labor can't see that because they are blinded by the interests of their big donors - the urban development and coal industries," says Larrisa Waters, the Greens candidate for &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Coot-tha%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Mt-Cootha&lt;/a&gt;.

"The Greens want to give the community and the environment a voice back in State Parliament."

"The current stance taken by both major parties, in relation to Daylight Saving in Queensland, is outdated, out of touch and inflexible. South East Queenslanders are frustrated that neither major party is currently prepared to explore options on the issue of Daylight Saving", DS4SEQ party leader Jason Furze told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ on January 30. DS4SEQ is a single-issue party, focused on the debate on &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian_Eastern_Standard_Time%23Debate_over_daylight_saving_time"&gt;daylight saving time&lt;/a&gt;.

Indigenous activist Sam Watson will be contesting the South Brisbane electorate which is currently held by the premier. He will represent the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Alliance%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Socialist Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Watson campaigned heavly for indigenous rights since the 1970s and was a community spokesperson following the death of Mulrunji Doomadgee in 2004.

The rocket carrying &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AOrbiting%20Carbon%20Observatory"&gt;Orbiting Carbon Observatory&lt;/a&gt; has crashed, sending the remains of the atmosphere observation satellite into the ocean off the coast of &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly before the crash, the 'payload fairing' failed to deploy from the craft.

"Several minutes into the flight of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaurus%20%28rocket%29"&gt;Taurus rocket&lt;/a&gt; carrying NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory spacecraft, launch managers declared a contingency after the payload fairing failed to separate," said NASA in a statement on their website. "The spacecraft did not reach orbit and likely landed in the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; near Antarctica". The cause of the failure to deploy and the crash are still under investigation.

"A Mishap Investigation Board will be immediately convened to determine the cause of the launch failure," added the statement.

Steve Cole, a spokesperson for NASA told &lt;a href="w%3ABloomberg%20L.P."&gt;Bloomberg L.P.&lt;/a&gt;, "the mission is lost. At this point no one is exactly sure what the cause is". The rocket that would have carried the observatory into space, a Taurus XL, took off from &lt;a href="w%3AVandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Vandenberg Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, at approximately 4:55 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 10 minutes into the mission, the payload failed to separate and a contingency was activated, but was unsuccessful.

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory was the latest mission in NASA's ongoing study of the global carbon cycle. It would have been the first spacecraft dedicated to studying atmospheric &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, the most significant human-produced greenhouse gas and the principal human-produced driver of climate change. The cost of the project was &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;273 million.

A &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;-based operation, known now as &lt;a href="w%3AUSF1%20%28Formula%20One%29"&gt;USF1&lt;/a&gt;, has unveiled plans to join the &lt;a href="Formula%20One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; motor racing series beginning in the &lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Formula%20One%20season"&gt;2010 season&lt;/a&gt;. Team principal Ken Anderson and sporting director &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Windsor"&gt;Peter Windsor&lt;/a&gt; officially launched USF1 in a live press conference broadcast on the US television channel &lt;a href="w%3ASpeed%20%28TV%20channel%29"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;.

Ken Anderson has previously worked for the &lt;a href="w%3ALigier"&gt;Ligier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOnyx%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Onyx Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; Formula One teams, and most recently held the position of technical director for the &lt;a href="w%3AStewart%20Haas%20Racing"&gt;Haas CNC Racing&lt;/a&gt; team in the American &lt;a href="w%3ANASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; series. Windsor has previously been general manager at &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Ferrari"&gt;Scuderia Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; and team manager for &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamsF1"&gt;WilliamsF1&lt;/a&gt; before taking up his current role as a journalist and reporter for the Speed channel.

USF1 would be based in &lt;a href="w%3ACharlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, unlike all eleven teams that participated in the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Formula%20One%20season"&gt;2008 Formula One season&lt;/a&gt;, which are based in Europe. Anderson also expressed a preference for the team's drivers to be of American nationality. They confirmed that they do not yet have an engine supply contact but expressed a desire to contact all existing Formula One engine builders before signing one.

The team expressed an intention to be more open to fans than current Formula One teams in order to appeal to the US market. The possibility for fans to tour the factory and see the car being built as well as television shows showing the inner workings of the team were suggested. Windsor claimed that the team had received the backing of both &lt;a href="w%3AMax%20Mosley"&gt;Max Mosley&lt;/a&gt;, the president of Formula One's governing body, and &lt;a href="w%3ABernie%20Ecclestone"&gt;Bernie Ecclestone&lt;/a&gt;, president of Formula One's commercial rights holders. No details were given on the team's financial backers, however.

On Wednesday, February 25, &lt;a href="Hilda%20Solis"&gt;Hilda Solis&lt;/a&gt; made her entrance as the new &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Labor"&gt;United States Secretary of Labor&lt;/a&gt; saying she was "fired up and ready to go." Solis reported for her first day as the new Secretary after having been confirmed by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; by a vote of 80–17 on February 24. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was there for her appearance.

After being confirmed, she resigned from her position as a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Representative&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and was sworn into her new position that same evening. She then joined the cabinet at &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;President Obama&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama%20speech%20to%20Joint%20session%20of%20Congress%2C%202009"&gt;speech to Joint session of Congress&lt;/a&gt; which took place on February 24.

Solis' arrival was announced on Wednesday to all Department of Labor employees who were invited to attend an informal gathering to greet her on her first day. More than 1,000 employees greeted Solis as she walked into the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor"&gt;Department of Labor's&lt;/a&gt; Frances Perkins Building. Solis stopped to shake hands and accept the congratulations of her new staff.

Solis briefly spoke to the assembly and then set about to start her day. She addressed the crowd, assembled both inside and outside the building, by saying "We need to revitalize this agency." She also told the crowd, "It's time to put labor back in the Department of Labor."

The department has an annual budget of approximately $53 billion and nearly 17,000 employees. Solis received a warm welcome from her new staff.

<h1>Obama budget calls for record US deficit</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Obama%20budget%20calls%20for%20record%20US%20deficit&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; unveiled his &lt;a href="w%3APresidency%20of%20Barack%20Obama"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3A2010%20United%20States%20federal%20budget"&gt;2010 United States federal budget&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. The budget calls for a record &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;3.6 trillion in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20federal%20budget%23Total%20Outlays%20in%20Recent%20Budget%20Submissions"&gt;spending&lt;/a&gt;.

The new budget will use a $1.75 trillion deficit, which would be nearly four times greater than any previous deficit and is $250 billion larger than what was projected just days ago due to a proposed new spending for another bank bailout.

"We will, each and every one of us, have to compromise on certain things we care about but which we simply cannot afford right now," said President Obama. "What I won't do is sacrifice investments that will make America stronger, more competitive and more prosperous in the 21st century — investments that have been neglected for too long."

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; minority leader &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Boehner"&gt;John Boehner&lt;/a&gt; was critical of the budget. "We can't tax and spend our way to prosperity," he said. "The era of big government is back, and Democrats are asking you to pay for it."

"Given the economic catastrophe that we face, to go right into the teeth of that hurricane and plan for some ambitious expansion of government that goes beyond the triage element is bold to say the least," &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%20J.%20Ornstein"&gt;Norman J. Ornstein&lt;/a&gt;, a political scholar at the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Enterprise%20Institute"&gt;American Enterprise Institute&lt;/a&gt;, told Reuters.

$634 billion of the budget is "dedicated [to] financing reforms to our health care system," according to Obama. Analysts reporting for the &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; both conclude that, if passed, it lays a ground-work for a form of &lt;a href="w%3Auniversal%20health%20care"&gt;universal health care&lt;/a&gt;.

"Queensland's censorship laws are far stricter than any other state in Australia and the same as laws on erotica in totalitarian states like &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;," says party convenor &lt;a href="w%3AFiona%20Patten"&gt;Fiona Patten&lt;/a&gt;.
The party will run of a number of platforms including &lt;a href="w%3Asame%20sex%20marriage"&gt;same sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aage%20of%20consent"&gt;age of consent&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; the age of consent for homosexuals is 18 while it is 16 for heterosexuals. Every other state in Australia has an age of consent of 16 regardless of sexual orientation.

The party has been met with opposition from the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Christian%20Lobby"&gt;Australian Christian Lobby&lt;/a&gt; (ACL). The ACL has challenged the major parties to place Sex Party candidates last on their how-to-vote cards. "The Australian Sex Party exists to represent the interests of businesses who make money from the exploitation and degradation of women," Jim Wallace, ACL managing director, said.

"If Labor, the LNP and the Greens believe women should be respected and are concerned about the enormous damage caused by pornography and prostitution then they should be demonstrating this by having nothing to do with the Sex Party or its affiliated candidates," said Wallace. The &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20Greens"&gt;Queensland Greens&lt;/a&gt; sole Member of Parliament &lt;a href="w%3ARonan%20Lee"&gt;Ronan Lee&lt;/a&gt; has indicated that the Greens will wait until nominations close until they decide on preferences.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=ACLU%20commemorates%20anniversary%20of%20US%20Supreme%20Court%20decision%20on%20student%20free%20speech&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
On Tuesday, the &lt;a href="w%3Anon-profit%20organization"&gt;non-profit organization&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU) released a video and press release commemorating 40 years since the landmark &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; decision involving &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt; in the case ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATinker%20v.%20Des%20Moines%20Independent%20Community%20School%20District"&gt;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The ♡❤Tinker♡❤ case was decided on February 24, 1969. The case involved students in &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; who chose to wear black armbands with peace symbols in protest of the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; in violation of a recent school board policy. In their statement, the ACLU compared issues of freedom of speech in the ♡❤Tinker♡❤ case to a more recent case, ♡❤Gillman v. Holmes County School District♡❤, where a school district in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; forbade students from wearing &lt;a href="w%3ARainbow%20flag%20%28LGBT%20movement%29"&gt;rainbow symbol&lt;/a&gt;s in school in support of &lt;a href="w%3ALGBT%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;LGBT rights&lt;/a&gt;.

In the ♡❤Tinker♡❤ case, John and Mary Beth Tinker and another student decided to wear black armbands with peace symbols to school in protest of the Vietnam War. The school district heard of the students' plans and decided to ban armbands in school. The three students case were represented by the ACLU of Iowa, and in a 7-2 decision the Supreme Court ruled for the plaintiffs. 
Supreme Court Justice &lt;a href="w%3AAbe%20Fortas"&gt;Abe Fortas&lt;/a&gt; wrote in the : "It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights...at the schoolhouse gate."

The ♡❤Gillman♡❤ case began in September 2007 when according to students at &lt;a href="w%3APonce%20de%20Leon%20High%20School"&gt;Ponce de Leon High School&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, school officials responded improperly to complaints from a &lt;a href="w%3Alesbian"&gt;lesbian&lt;/a&gt; student that she was being harassed by other students. The ACLU contacted the school district on behalf of junior Heather Gillman, inquiring what form of symbols or slogans relating to LGBT rights would be allowed. 

The school district responded saying it would not allow any expression of the sort, because it would "likely be disruptive", and said the wearing of these types of symbols by students could signify they were part of a "secret/illegal organization". 

The video released by the ACLU includes clips of a deposition given by David Davis, the principal of Ponce de Leon High School in Florida. Davis testified he decided to ban students from wearing rainbow symbols in school because the rainbow is a symbol of "gay pride", and he said it "could hinder the educational process". He also testified that these symbols would immediately cause students viewing them to think of &lt;a href="w%3AHomosexuality"&gt;homosexual sex&lt;/a&gt;. Heather Gillman commented in the ACLU video "It was kind of scary, kinda, because I didn't know what people would think, but then I figured 'Who cares what people think, I'm standing up for something I believe in.'"
On May 13, 2008, a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court"&gt;federal judge&lt;/a&gt; decided in favor of the plaintiff, and permanently enjoined the school district from infringing upon the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; rights of the students. Matt Coles, director of the ACLU's national LGBT Project, stated "Schools need to know censorship is illegal, and students need to know their schools can't get away with it."
In reflecting on the use of the ♡❤Tinker♡❤ precedent in the ♡❤Gillman♡❤ case, the ACLU cited three instances in which schools "were made to stop illegally censoring students thanks to ♡❤Tinker v. Des Moines♡❤." These include a 2006 incident where a student in &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; was instructed by school administrators to remove a t-shirt which read "I support gay marriage", and a 2007 incident where a teacher and an assistant principal at a school in &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; told a student she could not wear a t-shirt with overlapping female gender symbols. In both cases the ACLU represented the students and school officials backed down and apologized for their actions.

In a blog post Tuesday by Mary Beth Tinker at &lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Kos"&gt;Daily Kos&lt;/a&gt;, Tinker reflected on the similarities between her case before the Supreme Court of the United States and the more recent federal case of Heather Gillman. "I’m grateful that the precedent established by the Supreme Court 40 years ago is still protecting students, including LGBT students and their friends," wrote Tinker. She encouraged young people to speak out about issues of concern to them and to freely express their thoughts and views. Tinker is currently a nurse in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, and travels the United States speaking to students about their First Amendment rights.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; unveiled an 18-month plan to end combat operations and troop withdrawal in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. He was quoted as saying "Let me say this as plainly as I can: By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end," to marines at &lt;a href="w%3AMarine%20Corps%20Base%20Camp%20Lejeune"&gt;Camp Lejeune&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. 

Obama stated that the 50,000 troops not involved in combat are expected to stay in Iraq to provide support, training and advice to counter terrorism, which had mixed reactions from the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20war"&gt;This war&lt;/a&gt; has so far cost more than 4250 &lt;a href="w%3ACasualties%20of%20the%20Iraq%20War%23U.S.%20armed%20forces"&gt;U.S. lives&lt;/a&gt; in combat operations in the last six years. The &lt;a href="w%3ACasualties%20of%20the%20Iraq%20War%23Iraqi%20deaths"&gt;Iraqi deaths&lt;/a&gt; are unknown but are estimated to be in the tens of thousands.

Obama added that this withdrawal will allow the U.S. to focus on &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in the fight against terrorism. Obama also said he is planning to remove all U.S. troops by 2011, in order to complete the transition of Iraq to the Iraqi people. Obama Administration officials said that there was not a more specific schedule set by the president because he wanted to allow the commanders in Iraq more flexibility during the exit strategy.

A collision between two &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military helicopters in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; that killed four last month has been blamed on enemy fire. The two &lt;a href="w%3AOH-58%20Kiowa%20Warrior"&gt;OH-58 Kiowa Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s had been on a mission in &lt;a href="w%3AKirkuk"&gt;Kirkuk&lt;/a&gt; when they were targeted and struck each other during evasive action, killing all those on board.

The anouncement on the involvement of hostile fire, which had previously been ruled out, was made at &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Drum"&gt;Fort Drum&lt;/a&gt; shortly after a memorial service for the two crews, who had been based there. The Army said that forensic evidence revealed the presence of enemy fire.

"The two OH-58D helicopters were engaged and struck by hostile fire while conducting a reconnaissance mission," said a Fort Drum spokeswoman. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was told that the investigation "determined that the two OH-58 helicopters involved in the January 25 &lt;a href="w%3Aaviation%20incidents%20and%20accidents"&gt;incident&lt;/a&gt; in Kirkuk province were engaged and struck by hostile fire," and that "While executing evasive manoeuvres in response to the hostile fire, the two OH-58s collided, resulting in the catastrophic loss of both aircraft and crews," by a US Army spokesman for northern Iraq. There is no indication as in to the precise nature of the attack.

&lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; nationalist extremist group &lt;a href="w%3ANakshabandiya"&gt;Nakshabandiya&lt;/a&gt; had handed out leaflets after the attack saying they had shot the aircraft down and "would soon show a video," later repeating this claim on their website. The group has ties to &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;'s fugitive deputy &lt;a href="w%3AIzzat%20Ibrahim%20al-Duri"&gt;Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri&lt;/a&gt;.

The death toll was the highest for US soldiers in a single event for four months in Iraq. The four men were Philip E. Windorski Jr., Matthew Kelley, Joshua Tillery and Benjamin Todd, all &lt;a href="w%3AWarrant%20Officer"&gt;Warrant Officer&lt;/a&gt;s with the &lt;a href="w%3A10th%20Mountain%20Division"&gt;10th Mountain Division&lt;/a&gt;'s 10th Combat Aviation Brigade. All are survived by their wives and children.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Thousands%20take%20part%20in%20protests%20across%20US%20against%20government%27s%20financial%20policy&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Last Friday, thousands of people, in a total of more than thirty &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; cities, took part in a protest against the economic policy of the US government.

The event, which was inspired by the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Tea%20Party"&gt;Boston Tea Party&lt;/a&gt;, took place due to comments made by &lt;a href="w%3ACNBC"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; presenter &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Santelli"&gt;Rick Santelli&lt;/a&gt;.

"This is America! How many of you people want to pay for your neighbors' mortgages, that has an extra bathroom and can't pay their bills?" said Santelli, speaking on-air to the television audience. "We're thinking about having a Chicago tea party in July. All you capitalists that wanna show up at Lake Michigan, I'm gonna start organizing." 

The protest took place in anger against the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009"&gt;American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;/a&gt; (ARRA). Several protesters voiced their opposition to this act. "I'm sick and tired of it," said protester Barbara Keeton, speaking to WYFF4.com. "That's my money. That's my grandchildren's future. It's down the toilet."

"The debt that &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Obama's&lt;/a&gt; got, is way higher now, less than 100 days after he's been in office," she continued.

Organizers of Friday's protests have announced that they are planning a new series of protests on April 15.

SA is a left-wing political party. There stated describes itself as an anti-capitalist party which believes in "a democratic society that is run by and for working people, not the tiny, greedy, destructive elite that now rules." 

It should be noted that SA is not registered for &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; elections due to what they describe as "restrictive rules for registration." Their candidates will run as independents. They are, however, registered for federal elections and elections in other states.

&lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Queensland"&gt;Queensland's unicameral parliament&lt;/a&gt; is up for election on March 21. The election campaign will run for a total of 26 days following the issue of the writs by Governor &lt;a href="w%3APenelope%20Wensley"&gt;Penelope Wensley&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ held an exclusive interview with the SA. Answering on behalf of the party was Queensland State Gonvenor Paul Benedek.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡Why do you want to get into parliament?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Paul Benedek♡❤♡: For Socialist Alliance, parliament is only one aspect of social change. Our primary focus is building up community action and people's power, because we believe that such grassroots action is essential to social change, as history has shown from struggles for the vote for women to civil liberties to the campaign against the ♡❤[sic]♡❤ Vietnam War.

However, having a socialist in parliament would be a huge asset for such struggles. Having someone who speaks uncompromisingly for the oppressed and voiceless - working people, the unemployed, students, Indigenous people - in the "parliamentary pit" would help expose the lack of democracy in a parliamentary system that favours those with wealth and resources. It would boost the resources and media profile for socialist solutions.

♡❤♡What are the three main policies you will take into this election?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Paul Benedek♡❤♡: ♡❤1. Free public transport &amp; mass investment in renewables to address the climate emergency.♡❤ Unbelievably, the current government is looking to triple coal production in the biggest coal exporting state, in the biggest coal exporting country in the world! Meanwhile, the only solution we have to atrocious traffic and car dependence is...more roads, more tunnels, more bridges!
Socialist Alliance says we need free public transport to get cars off the road, and provide quality alternatives to all people, regardless of wealth. In the Belgian city of Hasselt, free public transport saw an 800% increase in usage in one year! Socialist Alliance says move on renewable energy rather than more coal mines, and provide retraining for fossil fuel workers in green jobs.

♡❤2. Bailout people and communities, not corporations.♡❤ With the worst economic crisis since the 1930s Great Depression, working people are being hit hard - and its going to get worse. The major parties are united in wanting to bail out business - but it's their 'profits before all else' focus that has caused this disaster. Socialist Alliance says we need to defend communities not profits, supporting workers, investing in public housing, health and education. With Sam Watson running in South Brisbane, we will also have an emphasis on justice for Aboriginal people.

♡❤3. Make government genuinely accountable to the people.♡❤ We are seeing a LNP "opposition" with big business's hands all over it, and the Labor Government which charges thousands of dollars to sit down with Ministers for lunch. Socialist Alliance call for an end to this undemocratic farce. We need community referenda, not fake “consultation”. An end to cronyism and private factional deals and manipulation. Fixed of government to prevent manipulation for self-interested gain.

♡❤♡How will you address these policies?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Paul Benedek♡❤♡: These are policies that Socialist Alliance fights for on a daily basis, and helps to build movements for. We publish the progressive newspaper Green Left Weekly (www.greenleft.org.au) which provides an excellent alternative to the corporate media. On the environment front, we are involved in the climate justice movement in Brisbane and around the country.

♡❤♡Who will lead your party if you gain more than one or two seats in parliament?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Paul Benedek♡❤♡: Socialist Alliance is a truly democratic organisation, with a collective leadership. A key spokesperson for our party would be Aboriginal activist Sam Watson (our candidate for South Brisbane).

♡❤♡If you can't form government, who would you like to see do so?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Paul Benedek♡❤♡: We want to see the most progressive government possible. We would like to see as many Greens elected as possible. We see both Labor and the LNP as big business parties that are almost like choosing between Coke and Pepsi! However, we generally favour Labor over the LNP, as being a slightly lesser evil.

♡❤♡What should Queenslanders keep in mind, when heading to the polls?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Paul Benedek♡❤♡: That choosing between "tweedledee" and "tweedledum" once every few years is not real democracy, and with the planet in peril, facing an economic meltdown, and all manner of social problems, we can't afford to leave sociaety ♡❤[sic]♡❤ in the hands of the pro-corporate parties. No matter what the vote is, the struggle will continue in the communities, and while voting can be part of changing the world, its people's power that has always made the most important, progressive changes.

<h1>Two-time Eurovision entrant Edsilia Rombley discusses music, love, and her contrasting Contest experiences</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Two-time%20Eurovision%20entrant%20Edsilia%20Rombley%20discusses%20music%2C%20love%2C%20and%20her%20contrasting%20Contest%20experiences&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

When she was barely 20 years old, &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; singer &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEdsilia%20Rombley"&gt;Edsilia Rombley&lt;/a&gt; got her first large taste of international acclaim. Already a winner of the smaller imitation contest ♡❤Soundmix Show♡❤, she decided to shoot higher. With a great deal of determination, she performed in front of hundreds of millions of television viewers at the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%201998"&gt;1998 Eurovision Song Contest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Her song, the R&amp;B flavored "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHemel%20en%20aarde"&gt;Hemel en aarde&lt;/a&gt;" (♡❤Heaven and earth♡❤), placed fourth and gave her country their highest placing at Eurovision since their last win in 1975. No Dutch contestant after her has been able to place similarly.

After the accolades died down, Rombley set her sights on promoting her vision and passion through her music. Partnering with producer Tjeerd Oosterhuis became a double blessing; eventually they became husband and wife. Even a return to Eurovision at the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202007"&gt;2007 Contest&lt;/a&gt;, with less than favorable results, didn't keep her discouraged for long. Today she has finished recording a live CD of her favorite English songs, and a live DVD of selections in Dutch, and is currently touring in singing engagements this spring in theaters across the Netherlands.

Edsilia Rombley granted ♡❤&lt;nowiki&gt;Wikinews&lt;/nowiki&gt;♡❤♡ an interview; she reflected on her career, her inspirations, what a day is like in her life, and what she would love to do in the future. This is the third in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202009"&gt;next contest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>A day in the life</h2>

♡❤♡ You recently had a birthday. Happy birthday! How did you celebrate this year?

♡❤♡Edsilia Rombley♡❤♡: I'm doing a tour across 43 Dutch theatres from January until May. On February 13th, I was doing in a show in Beverwijk. I wasn't planning on much, but I was surprised with a birthday cake before the show and lovely presents and flowers, even from the audience! The whole audience sang a birthday song for me during the show, which was great. I had a wonderful evening.

♡❤♡ I've visited your website and you seem to be very busy with various projects. Can you describe what a typical work day is like for you?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: Because I often work late and seldom sleep before 1 a.m., I usually get up around 11 a.m., check my e-mail, contact my management for day to day business, and depending on the day I might have photoshoots or interviews. I work out at the gym, get groceries and cook some dinner (yes, I really love cooking!). When I've finished eating, it's usually time for me to get ready for my real "workday", although it's more a "worknight" for me. My tour manager picks me up and off I go, performing in every corner of the country with my two backing vocals, and I don't usually arrive back home before 1 a.m.

<h2>Beginnings</h2>
 
♡❤♡ You were originally part of the girl group Dignity. Did you ever feel apprehensive about placing yourself in the public stage at such a young age?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: The girls and I all knew each other and one time, after a birthday party we decided to form a group. It was performing with that group (remember, I was only fifteen at the time) that I found my love for performing on a stage and really started thinking about a career in music.

♡❤♡ Your first international recognition came with winning the European Soundmix Show in Amsterdam in 1997. What was the experience like? What memory sticks out most in your mind even today?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: That I never thought I would get that far. I remember everyone being nervous and I wasn't really, because I just didn't think it would be such a huge success for me. I was just having fun backstage with everyone, enjoying the experience in general. Only when I won, the reality of having a real long-lasting career in music began to sink in, and that was a great feeling.
♡❤♡ Who were your musical influences in the formative years of your career, and are they still influential to you today? You've covered many songs by Oleta Adams; is she someone you've looked up to in your career?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: I listened a lot to artists like Anita Baker, Betty Wright, Gladys Knight and of course Oleta Adams. In our home we listened to soul and R&amp;B music a lot and we grew up singing their songs while doing our daily household chores, singing together using everything we could find as a microphone, from hairbrushes to broomsticks! I respect all these artists for what they accomplished in their career. They brought me in contact with the kind of music I'm still such a big fan of today.

<h2>Eurovision '98</h2>

♡❤♡ You won the Nationaal Songfestival by a wide margin in 1998, and then your song "Hemel en aarde" placed fourth in Birmingham, which was the highest placing the Netherlands had seen since they won 23 years earlier. Did you find the attention and accolades overwhelming? Going into the Eurovision, did you have any insecurities about your song or your performance? Knowing the Netherlands' shaky track record in the Contest, did you expect to receive high marks?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: I really didn't "expect" anything at the time. I was very young and was just very proud that I was given the opportunity to represent the Netherlands in this contest. The attention was a very new experience and I felt fortunate every step along the way that I was experiencing all these amazing things. I kept reminding myself to keep both feet firmly on the ground, because as easy as the success may have come at the time, I realised that it could end as quickly as it began.

♡❤♡ You and Ruth Jacott before you are frequently remarked upon as "revitalizing" the "songfestival" with R&amp;B melodies. Do you think that the urban contemporary sound is what Dutch music needed at that time? Would you consider such a move an "Americanization" of Dutch pop music, and if so, do you think that's a good or bad thing?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: To be honest I didn't really place the whole experience in such a wide perspective at the time. I just did my thing and it turned out great for me, as I still have a great musical career. I think Dutch pop music has always been influenced by America, this was set in long before I entered the Songfestival; on one hand I think this is a great thing, because America has so many great artists. It's just important that we, while embracing foreign influences, don't forget all the talents in the Netherlands, who make great Dutch music.

<h2>Mainstream record success</h2>

♡❤♡ Your next albums after Eurovision were produced by Tjeerd Oosterhuis, who is now your husband. How did you end up in a partnership with him? And perhaps most importantly, how did you two fall in love?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: I collaborated with his sister Trijntje Oosterhuis, who introduced me to her brother. So we got to know each other, friends at first, but in the end it wasn't only the musical collaboration that worked out great, we fell in love, and we've been together ever since. It's wonderful that I can share my passion for music with my partner.

♡❤♡ You've done a fair bit of charity work, dedicating songs and concerts both to situations in Bangladesh and for the victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami. What kind of role do you think charity and giving plays in your life? How do you feel about artists who are more concerned with their own images and song rights than coming together to help others?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: I always try to do good where I can, as long as the charity is something that touches me and my heart goes out to it. I cannot judge other artists on what they do, especially because I can also understand that you would want to keep those two things (your career as an artist and doing something for charity) separate.
♡❤♡ Whose idea was it to participate in ♡❤Dancing with the Stars♡❤? Your experience was short overall, but did you have a fun experience? What did you take away from your time on the show?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: It was my idea. I used to watch dance contests on TV and loved the amazing dresses of the female dancers. This was my chance to wear some of those great dresses myself! I had a great experience. The most important thing I learned [was that] professional dancing is much more difficult [than] I thought it would be!

♡❤♡ You've released albums in a variety of different genres, in both English and Dutch. What genre do you feel best describes your innermost feelings? Do you prefer singing in Dutch over English? Have you considered starting a music career in the United States? You could give Jennifer Hudson a run for her money...

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: English and Dutch both feel good to me, it's very difficult to choose a favourite language. I love to see people party to my up-tempo Dutch repertoire, but can also put all my emotion into a Dutch ballad. With English it's especially the soul repertoire that touches me, and if I get the chance to take my musical career abroad, I would jump at the opportunity! I am very happy with what I've accomplished so far, but am of course always striving for more.

♡❤♡ Recently you released a CD and DVD, where you performed your past hits. How did the idea for a live album come about? Listening to some of the tracks, the sound is very intimate and personal; was this something that was a selling point for you? How did you feel revisiting your entire repertoire?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: The DVD is called "Live @ The Wisseloord Studios" and contains these studio sessions, which are all Dutch songs from my album "Meer dan ooit". As a bonus there are English songs from my 2005 tour, and songs from Anita Baker, Betty Wright, Gladys Knight and Oleta Adams.

The album is simply called "Edsilia Rombley LIVE" and contains a selection of my favourite English songs from the same tour, and I am so proud that these songs are finally on CD, because before I could not let people hear the English repertoire (unless I sang live to them).

<h2>Eurovision '07 and thoughts about the Contest today</h2>

♡❤♡ In 2007, you returned to the Eurovision, and as someone fondly remembered from a past contest, there were high hopes placed on you. However, your song "On Top of the World" did not advance from the semi-finals. How disappointed were you that you didn't advance? Did you feel "On Top of the World" was as strong of a song as "Hemel en aarde" was?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: Of course I went in with a positive, winning attitude, so needless to say I was disappointed. For me everything felt perfect, the song, the team I was surrounded by, it all came together perfectly. The reactions in the Netherlands were very positive, so I had that to take with me from the experience. It's the way things go sometimes, I don't dwell on it too much. 

I can't really compare the two songs, there was so much time between them, the music industry has changed, as well as the Eurovision. What was different is that at the time of "Hemel en aarde" every country sang in their own language, which was one of the unique things [about] Eurovision.

♡❤♡ In the past decade, public interest in Eurovision has dwindled a great deal in the Netherlands, leading a trend that has followed in countries like France and Germany (all three share a common trait in that they haven't won the Contest in decades). Do you feel that's a big reason interest has tapered off, or are there other problems you see that have Dutch people tuning out? Is there anything &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANederlandse%20Omroep%20Stichting"&gt;NOS&lt;/a&gt; can do to get Dutch people watching the Contest again, especially in a television landscape populated by reality fare?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: As I pointed out before, every country sang in their own language before, which was one of the things that separated the Eurovision from other talent shows. With an overflow of talent shows nowadays, the diversity is gone, and you feel the pressure to sing in English more and more. Furthermore, if a professional jury had the upper hand in selecting winners, I believe that would make a big difference as well.

♡❤♡ Many fans on esctoday.com have expressed a negative opinion of this year's entrant, De Toppers, saying that their music is out of touch with today's styles. What are your feelings about De Toppers, and do you think they have a good chance of advancing from the semi-finals?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: De Toppers are very successful in the Netherlands, so from that point of view they have a chance. Whether or not their national success will help them advance at Eurovision, only time can tell.

♡❤♡ Do you ever see yourself returning to the Eurovision stage as the representative from the Netherlands?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: No. As I said, the experiences were great, and the first time I entered was the start of a future in music for me, for that I am very grateful. I have learned never to say never again though, but from where I stand right now, I would not participate again.

♡❤♡ Will you be a part of the Dutch delegation going to Moscow this year? 

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: No, I will not be part of the delegation.

♡❤♡ In closing, what would you like to say to all of your fans in the Netherlands and across Europe?

♡❤♡ER♡❤♡: I am so grateful that so many people are still supporting what I do, giving me the opportunity to do what I love to do most. It makes it so much more fun to be on stage when you see people enjoying your performance. My 2009 tour is titled: Just let me sing... (♡❤Laat mij maar zingen♡❤...) So as long as you keep enjoying my music, I will definitely not stop singing!

Researchers say that a study of &lt;a href="w%3Achimpanzee"&gt;chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, show that they specifically create and design tools to catch &lt;a href="w%3Atermite"&gt;termites&lt;/a&gt; living underground. The study was performed in the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park in the Congo in an area known as the &lt;a href="w%3AGoualougo%20Triangle"&gt;Goualougo Triangle&lt;/a&gt;. The study was published in the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Society"&gt;Royal Society&lt;/a&gt; journal ♡❤Biology Letters♡❤.

Dr. Crickette Sanz, the leader of the team who filmed the chimps crafting "fishing rod" type tools, says that they have "invented" ways of "improving their termite-fishing technique" by using a stick from a plant called the &lt;a href="w%3AMarantaceae"&gt;Marantaceae&lt;/a&gt;. They pick off the leaves and then create and place a brush like object on the end. Doing so improved the number of termites they catch, by more than 10 times.

"They then pulled the herb stems through their teeth, which were partially closed, to make the brush and they also attended to the brush by sometimes pulling apart the fibres to make them better at gathering the termites," stated Sanz to the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers are aware that chimps have used similar methods in the past, but it was not fully known if the tools they used were designed specifically for the task of gathering the insects. Of all the tools the chimps left behind and recovered by Sanz's team, 80% were custom made by their owners. Sanz says the new study has determined that their methods have since evolved, proving previous hypotheses.

"Our results indicate that chimpanzees have a mental template of the tool form, which is employed in crafting the tool prior to use and refining it during use," Sanz said. 

Sanz also says that because of Africa's vastness, much of it is still unstudied leaving him to suggest other species of chimps and apes use complex tools to gather food.

"Just as we are learning about these exciting new complex tool behaviours, the chimps that are showing us these behaviours are under danger from logging, poaching and &lt;a href="w%3AEbola"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt;," added Sanz. The triangle is a host to a variety of endangered or threatened animals including &lt;a href="w%3AGorilla"&gt;gorillas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aelephant"&gt;elephants&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>ICC Champions Trophy for cricket may be relocated</h2>

The eighth &lt;a href="w%3A2009%20ICC%20Champions%20Trophy"&gt;ICC Champions Trophy&lt;/a&gt; for cricket in 2009 involving the top eight &lt;a href="w%3Atest%20cricket"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; playing countries could be moved away from &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; due to weather concerns during the month of October. The tournament is scheduled for October 2009, which is the peak rainy season and one of the wettest months in Sri Lanka. The tournament was supposed to be played in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in September 2008 but was postponed over security issues.

The main options currently being considered are &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3APretoria"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Dhabi"&gt;Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;. This was confirmed by &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Cricket%20Council"&gt;ICC's&lt;/a&gt; general manager, &lt;a href="w%3ADave%20Richardson"&gt;Dave Richardson&lt;/a&gt;. He said that the cricket tournament could be played within a 12 day window in two or more grounds that are located within a short distance to reduce travel time for the teams. He said the decision would be made during the ICC board meeting in Dubai in April.

<h2>US Supreme Court rules against limits on medical tort claims</h2>

It was improperly administered and punctured an artery. &lt;a href="w%3AGangrene"&gt;Gangrene&lt;/a&gt; set in and her right arm was amputated within several weeks.

The court voted 6-3 in favor of Levine.

<h2>SPL: Rangers 0 - 1 Inverness CT</h2>
The last-place team in the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Premier%20League"&gt;Scottish Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AInverness%20CT"&gt;Inverness CT&lt;/a&gt;, went to &lt;a href="w%3AIbrox%20Stadium"&gt;Ibrox Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday hoping to avoid another loss at the hands of &lt;a href="w%3ARangers%20FC"&gt;Rangers FC&lt;/a&gt;. Inverness had already been beaten by a total of 0 - 8 in their last two meetings with the Rangers, comprised of a 0 - 3 defeat at home and a 5 - 0 thumping on their last trip to Ibrox. It seemed Rangers would be in control again as they had a bevy of chances early on, including a shot from &lt;a href="w%3ASa%C5%A1a%20Papac"&gt;Saša Papac&lt;/a&gt; that was cleared by &lt;a href="w%3AGrant%20Munro"&gt;Grant Munro&lt;/a&gt; just before it crossed the goal-line. After thirty minutes, &lt;a href="w%3AKenny%20Miller"&gt;Kenny Miller&lt;/a&gt; appeared to score for Rangers, but he was adjudged to be offside and his goal was disallowed. Inverness continued to stymie the Rangers' offence into the second half. Their efforts were finally rewarded when &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Weir"&gt;David Weir&lt;/a&gt; was sent off in injury time for a hard tackle on &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Proctor"&gt;David Proctor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Black"&gt;Ian Black&lt;/a&gt; converted the penalty kick. Inverness escape the drop zone with the win and Rangers give up the lead of the SPL to &lt;a href="w%3ACeltic%20F.C."&gt;Celtic FC&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated &lt;a href="w%3AKilmarnock%20FC"&gt;Kilmarnock FC&lt;/a&gt; by 2 - 1.

The small archipelago of &lt;a href="Malta"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; in the Mediterranean Sea takes the Eurovision Song Contest very seriously. Leading a fight to remove a cap on the number of competing countries brought them back to the Contest in 1991 after a 16-year absence, and ever since the nation has had perfect attendance. 

Since then, Malta's dependable "shining star" has been &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AChiara%20Siracusa"&gt;Chiara Siracusa&lt;/a&gt;, who goes by her first name in her music career. First competing in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%201998"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 21, she was pushed to the brink of victory until the votes from the final country that evening leveled her placement to third. Her rendition of the song "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AThe%20One%20That%20I%20Love"&gt;The One That I Love&lt;/a&gt;," and the recognition she received not only for herself, but for her country, made her a star in Malta overnight, and helped her launch a singing career in Europe.

She would later return to the Contest in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; with "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAngel%20%28Chiara%20song%29"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;," an anthem she penned herself, and achieved second place. Now, in 2009, she will be going back to Eurovision for a third try, hoping for the "3-2-1" charm and a victory &amp;mdash; something that has eluded her thus far. Her entry, the ballad "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWhat%20If%20We%20%28song%29"&gt;What If We&lt;/a&gt;," has special memories for Chiara; it is dedicated to her father, who is recently deceased. 

What if Chiara could take home the gold in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;; for Malta, for her father, and for herself? Only time will tell. Chiara took time out of her Eurovision promotional schedule to answer some questions from ♡❤&lt;nowiki&gt;Wikinews&lt;/nowiki&gt;♡❤♡ about her past performances, and most importantly, her upcoming one.

This is the fourth in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202009"&gt;next contest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤♡ You'll be going to Moscow for a third try at possibly winning Eurovision. Why did you decide to compete this year? How did your partnership with Marc Paelinck and Gregory Bilsen come about?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: Well, I met Marc Paelinck long time ago through a friend in Belgium. We started working together and it brought us to this collaboration today. I was thinking of going back to the festival [for a long time] and this year felt like the right year to do so.

♡❤♡ Eurovision fans from across Europe picked you as the wide favorite to win Malta's preselection this year. Were you as confident? Were you nervous about competing in the semi-final rounds this time around, or did you think this was something you could handle?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: When I go into a competition, I always go to win, but I was nervous like everyone else...I think [when] you win a festival, [you win] for what you present, not for what your history is.

♡❤♡ Growing up, did you always want to become a singer? Who were your musical influences, and what genres do you think are your favorite? Do you think these preferences have molded you into the singer you are today?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: Definitely. My mum always says I used to sing and dance for them all the time since I was a baby, and I've always loved ballads. In fact, my favourite singer has always been Whitney Houston.

♡❤♡ How did you come to the decision to enter the Eurovision pre-selection for Malta back in 1998? What kinds of feelings did you experience during the path you took to eventual victory in the national final?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: 1998 was my first time in the festival. I was very young and I felt I could never win it. I wanted just to try and be there with the big names of those times. It was very scary and overwhelming, [and] then I won.

♡❤♡ Did you feel overwhelmed performing in front of an international audience in Birmingham? What kind of personal feelings and emotions made you relate to the song you sang, "The One That I Love"? There were remarks afterwards that your performance was great, but your dress had similarities to Barbara Dex's from five years before (and she has become well-known for her "fashion don't"). Looking back on it, what did you think of that dress?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: Well...looking back I remember that I was completely overwhelmed [singing] in front of so many people. I was very scared but managed to do well. As for the dress, they were different times [back then] and it was beyond my control.

♡❤♡ You came very close to winning the Contest for Malta back in 1998. When you didn't, how did it make you feel? Did you feel "robbed"? As an addenda, some Wikipedians I've talked to have hypothesized that tabloid hype before the event helped Dana International win; in other words, she would not have won had she not been a transsexual. Do you feel that's true, and did you like her song?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: I know a lot of Maltese who voted for Dana because they liked the song and for no other reason. The song was good and we still hear it today. 

Obviously when you are so close to winning something and you don't, yes, you feel a bit robbed, but [then there's] the moment [when] you realise you did well and you are happy.

♡❤♡ After Eurovision, you made a transformation from an unknown singing hopeful to a true recording artist. Tell us a bit about your transformation, and how you felt during this time. Also, around this time you started to perform in concerts and festivals abroad. What was your best memory from this time, when you were performing abroad and people from outside Malta not only knew who you were, but were interested in your life and music.

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: Everything came like rain in my life, from one thing to the other, and before I knew it I became "Chiara of Malta." I loved it, but I didn't have much time to think about it. It came quickly; I went to a lot of places and sang with many people but I think what I will always remember is the concert I did with my band, where Seal was as well in the same event, in Frankfurt. It was incredible.

♡❤♡ In 2005, you entered the Contest again, this time with a song you wrote yourself. What is the meaning behind "Angel," and what kind of story do the lyrics tell about your own life and experiences?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: "Angel" is a love song and it will always have a special place in my heart. It's about the love you give someone without wanting anything back, and the unlimited support too.

♡❤♡ You achieved the best placing for Malta in Eurovision history with your performance in 2005. What did you learn from your experiences in 1998 and, in your mind, how did you improve to become more successful in 2005?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: I think it's the maturity and the experience. [Through] the years, without knowing, you [gather] so many lessons and behave better and take things a bit more serious and so on.

♡❤♡ Surely you've read not only supportive comments, but negative ones as well, particularly concerning your weight. At the same time, however, you have become a role model of sorts for fuller-figured women across Europe, who aren't accustomed to seeing "people like them" at Eurovision. How did you deal with the negativity, both in the context of the Contest and in your personal life, and what message do you hope to give to full-figured women who look to you for inspiration?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: Well, I have always been "full figured," as you put it. I have spent time in my life trying to become as thin as I could, but I could never make it. Through the years I have learnt to accept myself and love me for what I am and how I look. I feel I have nothing less than others and my advice is to be happy with yourself, and love yourself, because you can never get someone to love you if you yourself don't.

♡❤♡ Tell us about the emotions you convey in the song "What If We." Every song has a story, so what is the story played out in this song?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: The story for me with this song is completely about my father. He was the one to contact Marc [Paelinck] and he was the machine behind Eurovision for me, so he's entirely what this song is about for me and being that he passed away three months ago, well, it makes the song very special when 
I sing it.

♡❤♡ If you had to absolutely pick one song, which of the three songs you've submitted is your favorite, and why?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: The three songs [each] have a story of [their own]. "The One That I Love" gave me my whole career, my fame and everything I am today so i can never forget it; "Angel" is too special because it's like my baby, I wrote it myself; and "What If We" is very deep in my heart because of my dad, so I can never choose between them. Sorry!

♡❤♡ What are your plans for after the Contest? What kinds of projects would you like to pursue? Have you considered launching a singing career in the United States?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: My immediate project after the festival is an album which I have already started working on, in my style [which] is completely ballads, then wherever that takes me I'll go, [whether it be] the U.S. or elsewhere.

♡❤♡ Finally, what would you like to tell all of your fans, awaiting your performance this May in Moscow?

♡❤♡Chiara♡❤♡: I would like to thank them for the ongoing support they have always showed me, and promise them I will give them my all on the performance night in Moscow.

Dubbed as the 'King of Pop music', &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jackson"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; says he will go one last concert tour in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; beginning in July. Jackson had said after a performance at the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20O2%20arena%20%28London%29"&gt;O2 Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that he calls the tour his "final curtain calls".

"These will be my final shows ... performances in London. When I say this is it, I mean this is it. I'll be performing the songs my fans want to hear. This is it, this is really it, this is the final curtain call," said Jackson after the concert. 

Tim Leiweke, CEO of &lt;a href="w%3AAnschutz%20Entertainment%20Group"&gt;Anschutz Entertainment Group&lt;/a&gt; (AEG), earlier told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABillboard%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that the tour in the UK will consist of somewhere between 20-25 concerts, all to be held at the O2, starting July 8.

"We spent two years working with Michael trying to get him comfortable with this," said Leiweke to ♡❤Billboard♡❤, who also said that Jackson's health is not an issue. "Despite everything you read about him, he was fine. The man took a physical for us to go do these concerts". 

Jackson's last major concert tour was in 2001. It is also the first major public appearance he will be making since 2005, when a jury aquitted him in a trial where he was charged with child molestation.

<h1>California Supreme Court defers ruling on same-sex marriage ban</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=California%20Supreme%20Court%20defers%20ruling%20on%20same-sex%20marriage%20ban&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After hours of hearing arguments in the case questioning the legality of the ban on &lt;a href="same-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriages&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the state's Supreme Court deferred ruling on the ban, known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProposition%208"&gt;Proposition 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The court could issue a ruling in the next 90 days.

Opponents of the ban were fighting to have the law overturned— saying it was unconstitutional for the state to have banned same-sex marriages. Californians voted in November 2008 to ban same-sex marriages, leaving the nearly 20,000 married same-sex couples wondering if their marriages, which were legal at the time they were married, would be voided.

"Prop 8 opponents would have the court choose between the inalienable right to marry and the right of the people to change the constitution as they see fit, and what I'm picking up from the oral argument in this case is this court should willy-nilly disregard the will of the people," Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoyce%20L.%20Kennard"&gt;Joyce Kennard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said while addressing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShannon%20Minter"&gt;Shannon Minter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the lawyer representing the opponents of the ban.

One of the petitioners in the case against Proposition 8, Robin Tyler, told &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that she thinks "they [the court] are going to uphold our marriages and they are going to uphold Proposition 8, and it's a loss."

In June 2008, the state supreme court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional. Between that time, and November 2008, 18,000 same-sex couples were legally married in California. Currently in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, same-sex marriages are only legal in &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.

Valuable personal items belonging to &lt;a href="w%3AMahatma_Gandhi"&gt;Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;, The father of &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; were auctioned for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollars"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1.8 million by Antiquorum Auctioneers in &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. Documentary filmmaker James Otis owned these items and put these up for auction.

The items were bought by the owner of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Breweries%20Group"&gt;United Breweries group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKingfisher%20Airlines"&gt;Kingfisher Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVijay%20Mallya"&gt;Vijay Mallaya&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Bangalore"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; based Indian entrepreneur. The list of rare personal belongings included a Zenith sterling silver Pocket watch, a pair of eyeglasses used by Gandhi, a pair of leather sandals, his blood work from Irwin Hospital, &lt;a href="New%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; and a brass bowl and a plate set.

The initial bid price was $20,000, but reached $1 million in less than a minute. Mallaya eventually outbid all other bidders for the final price of $1.8 million. The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20India"&gt;Indian government&lt;/a&gt; did not participate in the auction due to a restraint order from the &lt;a href="w%3ADelhi%20High%20Court"&gt;Delhi High Court&lt;/a&gt;. The restraining order was passed by the court in response to a written petition filed by the legal heir of Mahatma Gandhi, Navjivan Trust.

Brawn GP have completed their takeover of the &lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Racing%20F1"&gt;Honda Racing F1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula%20One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; team. The management buyout, led by team principal &lt;a href="w%3ARoss%20Brawn"&gt;Ross Brawn&lt;/a&gt;, was a result of Honda announcing their intention to withdraw from the sport in December 2008 as a result of the current economic climate. 

&lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Button"&gt;Jenson Button&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARubens%20Barrichello"&gt;Rubens Barrichello&lt;/a&gt;, Honda's drivers for the 2008 season, will be retained by Brawn GP for the upcoming 2009 season. The team will continue to be based at Honda Racing F1's Brackley headquarters in Northamptonshire, England. Engines for the cars will be made by &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes%20Benz"&gt;Mercedes Benz&lt;/a&gt;.

Ross Brawn said of the announcement: "The vast experience and knowledge that both drivers bring to our team will prove invaluable as we aim to get up to speed in the shortest possible time to be ready for the first race of the season...I would also like to take this opportunity to pay due credit to our staff at Brackley. The levels of motivation and commitment that I have witnessed at the factory deserve the highest praise."

The Managing Officer of Honda, Hiroshi Oshima, said that the company was "very pleased that we could sell the team to Ross Brawn, with whom we have been partaking in the challenges of F1 competition, and are grateful for his decision. We offer our sincerest wishes for the new team which will be led by Ross."

The team have three weeks remaining until the opening round of the 2009 Formula One World Championship in Australia on March 23.

Korean &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJiyai%20Shin"&gt;Jiyai Shin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; played a faultless final round to win the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHSBC%20Women%27s%20Champions"&gt;HSBC Women's Champions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; at the Tanah Merah Country Club. Starting the final day six shots behind the overnight leader of, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKatherine%20Hull"&gt;Katherine Hull&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Shin birdied the first four holes to close the gap quickly.

Shin who is ranked 4th in the world takes home a purse of US$300,000.

Shin showed class and poise to seal the championship with her approach shot on the 18th. Playing from 180 yards on the par 4, Shin found the green with comfort and was left with a 30 foot putt to seal victory. Despite running her putt well past the hole, Shin sunk the putt to par and finish with 6 under for the day and 11 under for the tournament.

The championship took an interesting turn midway through the final round when Katherine Hull boogied the 10th hole and then two holes later followed with another bogey. Seemingly shaken from two lost shots early on the back nine, Hull then found trouble left on the 14th fairway and had to take an unplayable lie and consequently double-boogied. These two holes took Hull from at one point a four shot lead to suddenly being level with Shin who was gaining in confidence each hole.

Hull managed a birdie on the 17th and still in contention to force a play-off should Shin falter. Hull’s final tee-shot again showed the difficulties she had been experiencing all day and pushed it right forcing another drop and effectively ending her chances. Hull finished with another boogie and 74 for the final round. 
Behind Hull and Shin there was a series of interesting battles for the minor placings with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaula%20Creamer"&gt;Paula Creamer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scoring birdie on the 16th and 17th holes and then finding trouble on her first shot on the 18th effectively ending her chance of staging an unlikely win. Her recovery from the bunker still left her short of the green and eventually finishing with a boogie and 8 under for the tournament in equal 3rd place.
World number one rated player, Mexican &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALorena%20Ochoa"&gt;Lorena Ochoa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , never troubled the leaders after winning last years HSBC championship and also winning last week at the tour of Thailand. Ochoa finished in sixth place with a final score of seven under. Her chance of scoring back-to-back wins faded with a disappointing second round of 73.

Another player who found difficulties in finishing the final round was Sun Young Yoo who boogied three consecutive hole starting at the 13th dropping her from second place to eighth. Yoo scored a much needed birdie on the 17th to finish tied for sixth with Jane Park and Lorena Ochoa

Bremen, determined to win, dominated the game on both sides of the ball, while Leverkusen seemed lazy and "lifeless". Leverkusen's best chance came after 22 minutes. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Helmes"&gt;Patrick Helmes&lt;/a&gt; found himself in front of the net with only Bremen keeper &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Weise"&gt;Tim Weise&lt;/a&gt; to beat, but he spectacularly failed to score. Bremen started pouring on the chances, with several coming just before the half. Bremen keeper &lt;a href="w%3ARen%C3%A9%20Adler"&gt;René Adler&lt;/a&gt; had to push a header from &lt;a href="w%3ARonaldo%20Naldo"&gt;Naldo&lt;/a&gt; just over the bar in injury time. The game was tied on 45 minutes.

The second half started with a powerful shot from &lt;a href="w%3ATranquillo%20Barnetta"&gt;Tranquillo Barnetta&lt;/a&gt; that, unfortunately for Bayer, was easily saved by Wiese. Just four minutes later, the only goal of the game was scored. &lt;a href="w%3AMesut%20%C3%96zil"&gt;Mesut Özil&lt;/a&gt; took a shot from a rather severe angle. The shot bounced off of &lt;a href="w%3AManuel%20Friedrich"&gt;Manuel Friedrich&lt;/a&gt;'s outstretched leg and into the net. Leverkusen tried to respond, but came up just short. &lt;a href="w%3AStefan%20Kie%C3%9Fling"&gt;Stefan Kießling&lt;/a&gt; seemed to have a legitimate chance after 79 minutes, but it was despatched by &lt;a href="w%3ASebastian%20Pr%C3%B6dl"&gt;Sebastian Prödl&lt;/a&gt;. Leverkusen tried one last time to score during four minutes of injury time. They were helped when referee Dr Helmut Fleischer booked &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Almeida"&gt;Hugo Almeida&lt;/a&gt; and Wiese for time-wasting. Two minutes into injury time, Kießling's head missed a cross by inches, and it sailed past him and out of play. By the time four minutes were up, Werder players were begging the referee to end play. Finally, after almost five minutes of injury time, Fleischer blew the whistle and the celebrations began in Bremen.

The women's Pokal final was played earlier in the day. &lt;a href="w%3AFCR%202001%20Duisburg"&gt;FCR 2001 Duisburg&lt;/a&gt; followed up their &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Women%27s%20Cup%202008-09"&gt;UEFA Women's Cup&lt;/a&gt; win with a 7–0 humbling of &lt;a href="w%3A1.%20FFC%20Turbine%20Potsdam"&gt;1. FFC Turbine Potsdam&lt;/a&gt;. Five goals were scored in the second half. It is the biggest margin of victory in the DFB Frauen Pokal's 28-year history.

&lt;a href="w%3AWolfram_Research"&gt;Wolfram Research Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, makers of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMathematica"&gt;Mathematica&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤A New Kind of Science♡❤, have released a limited alpha of their new web service Wolfram Alpha. Wolfram Alpha is described by CEO &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Wolfram"&gt;Stephen Wolfram&lt;/a&gt; as a "computational knowledge engine." Unlike &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; and other traditional web search engines that rely on statistical methods for retrieving online documents, Wolfram Alpha answers factual questions in the way that Wikipedia does, except it relies on analytical methods instead of human-generated documents.

Although the product is still in a limited release some details about its operation and design have been revealed by Wolfram on his blog, and by &lt;a href="w%3ANova%20Spivack"&gt;Nova Spivack&lt;/a&gt; who recently interviewed Wolfram about Wolfram Alpha. The product is available on the Web as a single search box reminiscent of Google’s main search page. The search queries can be entered in natural language and the natural language system will parse the query and use models of knowledge (ontologies) and human-curated data to return an answer including graphs and other representations. The ontologies and data are managed by Wolfram employees who must input new ontologies and data by hand or, occasionally, with the assistance of programmatic tools. It is expected that an Application Programming Interface (API) will eventually be available, although it is not known what the API will be used for.

Unlike traditional search engines Wolfram Alpha does not search online documents, and thus does not return answers to "fuzzy" questions, such as opinion or advice. Instead, the scope of answers is limited to the knowledge that has already been modeled and encoded in the ontologies and the associated data. In this way the system can generate knowledge that was previously unknown. It is thought that while Wolfram will concentrate on scientific and technical information the system may eventually be able to answer questions in other domains, such as stock information, geography and history. In theory, any question with a factual answer could be answered by Wolfram Alpha.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACommunity%20Broadcasting%20Association%20of%20Australia"&gt;Community Broadcasting Association of Australia&lt;/a&gt; (CBAA) has urged the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20government"&gt;Australian government&lt;/a&gt; to increase funding for community broadcasters. CBAA is asking for an extra &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;$AU&lt;/a&gt;14 million for "vital community broadcasting services."

According to CBAA President Deborah Welch, community television is the training ground for the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n media industry.

"It is the launching pad for the career of thousands of Australian musicians. It is an incredible source of local news, music and culture targeted specifically to local communities and produced by members of the community themselves," Ms Welch said in a statement.

Stations broadcast a range of programs from religious programing, to car shows and sporting events. Several state based sporting leagues broadcast on community television stations. C31 Melbourne broadcasts an show called The Victoria Football Show; Queensland Community Television broadcasts AFL Queensland State League matches; and C31 Adelaide broadcasts Indoor Cricket &amp; Netball and South Australian National Football League matches.

According to the CBAA, the primary income sources for community television stations are sponsorship announcements and community donations.

"The CBBA is calling on the Federal Government to commit $14 million in new funding for content production, infrastructure, training and sector co-ordination and planning," Ms Walch says. "With $10.4 billion being spent on 'strengthening the economy' this is highly targeted $14 million will assist in skills development and employment pathways for many volunteers involved in local stations as well as strengthening local communities ability to sustain themselves in tough times."

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; communications spokesperson Senator Scott Ludlum says, "[The] government should always be looking at ways to bring communities together, through sharing information and building partnerships."

The &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indies%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies cricket team&lt;/a&gt; held on to a draw in the fifth and final test of the five match test series at &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Park%20Oval"&gt;Queen's Park Oval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APort%20of%20Spain"&gt;Port-of-Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago"&gt;Trinidad&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;cricket team&lt;/a&gt; to win the five test series 1-0 and regain the &lt;a href="w%3AWisden%20Trophy"&gt;Wisden trophy&lt;/a&gt; after a gap of nine years. This is their first major test series victory in five years.

To win the match, West Indies were set a target of 240 runs in 66 overs or to bat two sessions for a draw. West Indies pair of &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Edwards"&gt;Fidel Edwards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADenesh%20Ramdin"&gt;Denesh Ramdhin&lt;/a&gt; thwarted the English attack to finish on 114-8 and drawing the match.Earlier in the day &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Pietersen"&gt;Kevin Pietersen&lt;/a&gt; scored 102 runs to enable England to declare at 237/6 in their second innings. 

England had drawn the previous two tests in &lt;a href="Barbados"&gt;Barbados&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda"&gt;Antigua and Barbuda&lt;/a&gt; and had lost the first test in &lt;a href="Jamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; by an innings and 23 runs. The second test in Antigua was abandoned. &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Prior"&gt;Matt Prior&lt;/a&gt; was declared Player of the match and &lt;a href="w%3ARamnaresh%20Sarwan"&gt;Ramnaresh Sarwan&lt;/a&gt; was declared the player of the series.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Cramer"&gt;Jim Cramer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACNBC"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's host of ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMad%20Money"&gt;Mad Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, plans to appear on ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Show"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ Thursday, in the midst of an escalating feud between Cramer and the &lt;a href="Comedy%20Central"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/a&gt; show's host, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Stewart"&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Jim Cramer has been the only CNBC employee to publicly respond to ♡❤Daily Show♡❤ segments strongly criticizing the television business news channel's financial coverage during the growing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20financial%20crisis%20of%202008%E2%80%932009"&gt;global recession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , particularly focusing on specific remarks by made by Cramer.

The feud began on March 4, when ♡❤The Daily Show♡❤ aired an eight-minute clip lampooning CNBC. The comedy news show featured several clips of pundits, focusing particularly on predictions or reports by CNBC reporters that ♡❤The Daily Show♡❤ argued were overly optimistic or too strongly slanted in favor of the companies being discussed.

In one clip, a CNBC host reported &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMerrill%20Lynch"&gt;Merrill Lynch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said it would not need capital, which ♡❤The Daily Show♡❤ followed with a list of billions in bailout money the financial services firm has required since September. In another clip, Jim Cramer is shown allegedly affirming "Your money is safe in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABear%20Sterns"&gt;Bear Sterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ", followed by a ♡❤Daily Show♡❤ statement that the global investment bank went under six days later. 

“If I’d only followed CNBC’s advice, I’d have a million dollars today," Stewart said during the bit, "provided I’d started with a hundred million dollars."

Although most CNBC reporters and executives declined to comment, Cramer defended himself in a column published Monday, claiming the clip was taken out of context. Cramer said he wasn't talking about buying Bear Sterns stock, but simply reassuring a viewer that his liquidity held in Bear Sterns was safe.

"The absurdity astounds me," Cramer said of the ♡❤Daily Show♡❤ bit. "The fact that I was right rankles me even more."

Later that day, ♡❤The Daily Show♡❤ responded with another montage of clips, this time more specifically targeting Cramer. 

"So Jim Cramer, I apologize," Stewart said ironically, then promptly showcased video of Cramer suggesting the safety of Bear Stearns stock 5 days prior to the collapse of Bear Stearns on Mad Money's Lighting Round. Provokingly, Jon Stewart then admitted, "He's not saying literally 'I'm asking you to buy Bear Stearns,' for that you have to go back a full 7 weeks" this time showing video footage of Cramer on January 24, 2008, telling TheStreet.com TV viewers to specifically "buy Bear Stearns" stock 7 weeks before it collapsed. 

The following day on March 10, Cramer responded again during a Tuesday appearance on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToday%20%28NBC%20program%29"&gt;♡❤Today♡❤ show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , saying, "[Jon Stewart] is a comedian, and he's decided to focus on some calls I made during a bull market. The guy is a comedian. Did I make a mistake? First of all, any time you recommend a stock and it goes down, you've made a mistake. Here's a shocker: Almost every stock is down! Any stock you recommended is bad. You know, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Buffett"&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , I could run tapes from him, he would look like a complete fool."

The feud between ♡❤The Daily Show♡❤ and CNBC generated a significant amount of attention in the mainstream media. The &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; called the first ♡❤Daily Show♡❤ bit a "brutal takedown" of CNBC. Other publications, like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20%28magazine%29"&gt;New York magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , defended CNBC, writing, "We doubt there's a single news outlet that hasn't made a misstatement regarding the economy in the past year."

The Thursday ♡❤Daily Show♡❤ sketch ran the same day CNBC reporter &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Santelli"&gt;Rick Santelli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was scheduled to appear on the show, to discuss his vocal criticisms of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;'s plans for dealing with foreclosures. Santelli cancelled the appearance, but ♡❤Daily Show♡❤ executives said the CNBC montage was not retaliatory and that they planned to show it before the cancellation was announced.
