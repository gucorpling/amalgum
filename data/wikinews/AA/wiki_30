In a move widely viewed as surprising, the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20England"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt; raised UK interest rates from 5% to 5.25%, the highest in five years. In a press release the Bank stated that "an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points to 5.25% was necessary to bring CPI inflation back to the target in the medium term".

The last publicly released value for inflation (measured according to the &lt;a href="w%3Aconsumer%20price%20index"&gt;consumer price index&lt;/a&gt;) stood at 2.7%, above the Government target of 2%. However the Bank and Government receive advance figures, not due to be publicly released until next week. Analysts have speculated that these figures may explain the rise.

Following the announcement the &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100"&gt;FTSE 100&lt;/a&gt; fell.

The Bank of England's &lt;a href="w%3AMonetary%20Policy%20Committee"&gt;Monetary Policy Committee&lt;/a&gt; has been responsible for setting the UK's official interest rate each month since 1997. Prior to this the base rates were controlled by the Treasury and the &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt;.

In a separate decision the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Central%20Bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt; maintained the interest rate within the &lt;a href="w%3AEurozone"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt; at its previous value of 3.5%.

CBS program ♡❤The Early Show♡❤ ran a segment Monday about the Tigger incident at Florida theme park Walt Disney World, which a company blog later criticized.

CBS runs a regularly updated feed on its website, entitled "The Public Eye". It was created by the television station to "bring transparency to the editorial operations" of that department. It went one step further, recently, when criticising their program's actions.

The post knocked co-anchor Hannah Strom, who "did not challenge the family's characterization of the incident." Writer Brian Montopoli commented that "we'd like to think that we would have brought somewhat more skepticism to the table".

On Sunday, video broke internationally of Disney employee Michael J. Fedelem as Tigger, hitting teen Jerry Monaco Jr. in the head. The New Hampshire tourist and his father both claim the hit was unprovoked. They claimed Jerry Jr. needed medical attention and prescription medicine that night.

"Nuh, no provokin' at all, ya know, it was all out of the blue." Junior told FOX News the day before.

The CBS interview was even featured in that morning's post-show email from CBS ♡❤The Early Show♡❤.

The comments were made by Montopoli, associate producer of this section.

There has been an explosion at the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; embassy in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAthens%2C%20Greece"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, at 05:58 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20European%20Summer%20Time"&gt;EEST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B3"&gt;UTC+3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). 

Police say the explosion was caused by a rocket propelled grenade fired from across the street at a United States eagle emblem at the front of the embassy. Minor damage and no injuries have been reported.

The explosion apparently occurred inside the embassy compound. Initial eyewitness reports have not given any mention of injuries. Chaos is reported within the compound and Greek police have cordoned off Vassilis Sofias Avenue in central Athens, causing traffic jams. The U.S. ambassador in Greece, Charles Ries told the reporters that the attack was "a senseless act of violence". Both the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Public Order of Greece, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADora%20Bakoyannis"&gt;Dora Bakoyannis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Byron Polidoras, strongly condemned the action.

Greek security officials say a group calling itself "Revolutionary Struggle" is claiming responsibility for the attack, but the officials have not yet accepted the claim as authentic, according to a report by the International Herald Tribune. Toronto Daily News calls the group "the most active of a new generation of small extreme leftist groups with strong anti-U.S. sentiments." The group has reportedly also claimed responsibility for bombings of a court building in Athens (2003) and the Economics Ministry (December 2005).

&lt;a href="w%3ACanon%20%28company%29"&gt;Canon Inc.&lt;/a&gt; announced the initiative to start production of new generation flat-panel &lt;a href="w%3ATelevision"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; on its own. The sole production will occur after Canon Inc. buys the stake of &lt;a href="w%3AToshiba"&gt;Toshiba Corp.&lt;/a&gt; in their joint venture, &lt;a href="w%3ASED%20Inc"&gt;SED Inc.&lt;/a&gt;

The companies are expected to make an official statement concerning their &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20venture"&gt;joint venture&lt;/a&gt;.

In order to start production of the new flat-screens based on the SED technology, Canon Inc. had to clarify the situation with the &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;-based Nano-Proprietary Inc. The latter has brought a lawsuit against Canon in 2005 on the basis of the two sided agreement concerning the patent on SED technology. The agreement didn't allow Canon to make any other ventures on this technology, but Canon joining forces with Toshiba was the reason for the mentioned lawsuit.

The dispute with Nano-Proprietary was the ground for Canon and Toshiba to delay the construction of the $1.7 billion plant for SED-based flat-panels. Earlier the companies agreed to contribute with 100 billion &lt;a href="w%3Ayen"&gt;yen&lt;/a&gt; each in the SED plant.

Toshiba's stake in the joint venture SED Inc. is about &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20yen"&gt;Yen$&lt;/a&gt;10 billion, or, approximately, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;83 million.

This new SED (&lt;a href="w%3ASurface-conduction%20electron-emitter%20display"&gt;surface-conduction electron-emitter display&lt;/a&gt;) technology is meant to replace the existing &lt;a href="w%3ALiquid%20crystal%20display"&gt;LCD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APlasma%20%28physics%29"&gt;plasma&lt;/a&gt; screen due to their smaller sizes and lower energy consumption. At the end of this year the companies planned to start mass production of these new displays.

The iPhone only made its appearance as a prototype and there have been controversies aroused.

The dispute has come up between the manufacturer of the &lt;a href="w%3AiPhone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; (which was resented on Wednesday for the first time) - &lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; - and a leader in network and communication systems, based in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="w%3ACisco%20Systems"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;. The company claims to possess the trademark for iPhone, and moreover, that it sells devices under the same brand through one of its divisions.

This became the reason for Cisco to file a lawsuit against &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Inc."&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; so that the latter would stop selling the device.

Cisco states that it has received the trademark in 2000, when the company overtook Infogear Technology Corp., which took place in 1996.

The Vice President and general counsel of the company, Mark Chandler, explained that there was no doubt about the excitement of the new device from Apple, but they should not use a trademark, which belongs to Cisco.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALinksys%20iPhone"&gt;iPhone developed by Cisco&lt;/a&gt; is a device which allows users to make phone calls over the voice over Internet protocol (&lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20over%20IP"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt;).

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; armed forces detained five &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ians working at a "liaison office" located in &lt;a href="w%3AErbil"&gt;Erbil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; before dawn on Friday. Sources said that the U.S. forces first landed their helicopters around the building, then broke through the office's gate, disarmed the guards, confiscated some documents and certain objects, arrested five suspected terrorists, and then left for an undisclosed location.

However, there was no raid on the Iranian Consulate General as earlier reported. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt; that the building raided was "not a consulate or a government building", which appears to be confirmed by the Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, who said the Iranians were working at an office that had government approval and was in the process of being approved as a consulate, but was not a Consulate nor the Iranian Consulate General. The US is strategically insisting that they raided a "liaison office" instead of a Consulate to avoid being found in violation of Article 36 of the &lt;a href="w%3AVienna%20Convention%20on%20Consular%20Relations"&gt;Vienna Convention on Consular Relations&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs"&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; Mikhail Kamynin said that the raid was absolutely unacceptable and was a violation of the &lt;a href="w%3AVienna%20Convention%20on%20Consular%20Relations"&gt;Vienna Convention on Consular Relations&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Regional%20Government"&gt;Kurdistan Regional Government&lt;/a&gt; also expressed their shock and disapproval of the raid.

On Thursday's hearing on Iraq, Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Biden"&gt;Joseph Biden&lt;/a&gt; (D-Delware), chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Foreign%20Relations%20Committee"&gt;Senate Foreign Relations Committee&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; that the Bush Administration did not have the authority to send U.S. troops on cross-border raids. Biden said, "I believe the present authorization granted the president to use force in Iraq does not cover that, and he does need congressional authority to do that. I just want to set that marker." After the meeting, Biden sent a follow-up letter to the White House asking for an explanation from the Bush Administration on the matter.

On Thursday morning, Iran's &lt;a href="w%3Aforeign%20ministry"&gt;foreign ministry&lt;/a&gt; official sent a letter to Iraq's foreign ministry asking Iraq to stop the Bush Administration from interfering with Iraq-Iran relations, and has protested the raid on its liaison office. The official said, "We expect the Iraqi government to take immediate measures to set the aforesaid individuals free and to condemn the U.S. troopers for the measure. Following up on the case and releasing the arrestees is a responsibility of primarily the Iraqi government and then the local government and officials of the Iraqi Kurdistan."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Reports say that a subway train and a car have collided in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;.

Witnesses say that calls to 911 came in just before 12:00 p.m. [EST] that a car had driven onto the tracks of the Metro Rail operated by the Niagra Frontier Transit Authority at the Theatre District rail stop which is near West Tupper and Main Streets in Downtown Buffalo.

The train was traveling on the northbound track toward the Allen Medical Station when the vehicle apparently began to drive norhtbound away from the train. The train did stop but still managed to make light contact with the vehicle from behind.

The driver of the car is reported to be a 73 year-old male who was not injured in the accident but is currently being evaluated at Erie County Medical Center. Witnesses say the man was "out of it" when police arrived. It is unknown if charges will be filed against the driver.

There were no injuries to passengers and witnesses have stated that all the passengers on the train were evacuated.

Buffalo is now the smallest city in the U.S. to have a subway system.

Police are now searching Canada-wide for 25-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Spencer%20%28entrepreneur%29"&gt;Adam Spencer&lt;/a&gt;, a man with ties to the &lt;a href="w%3AOakville%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Oakville, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; areas. He is a motivational speaker, and the founder/chief executive (&lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;) of &lt;a href="w%3AEmexis"&gt;Emexis&lt;/a&gt; Integrated Solutions, an upstart information technology company.

First off, Spencer told investors between September 2005 and May of last year that he was making Emexis a public company, located in &lt;a href="w%3ADowntown%20Toronto"&gt;downtown Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. He allegedly took &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CAN$&lt;/a&gt;8 million from Canadian investors, defrauded 100 investors out of amounts ranging from CAN$5,000 to as much as CAN$2 million each in a couple of cases, and is on the run with their cash.

Police don't even know if he is still in Canada. They suspect that he could be in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; because he has a passport there.

Spencer travels to car race events all around the world.

Wikinews will continue to follow this story as updates are known.

Rumors are circulating in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; has declared a "secret, informal war" on &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, according to a pair of blogs written by apparent Washington insiders.

"Washington intelligence, military and foreign policy circles are abuzz today with speculation that the President, yesterday or in recent days, sent a secret Executive Order to the Secretary of Defense and to the Director of the CIA to launch military operations against Syria and Iran," blogger and think-tank fellow &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20C.%20Clemons"&gt;Steven Clemons&lt;/a&gt; wrote on Thursday on his site, ♡❤The Washington Note♡❤. ♡❤The Plank♡❤, hosted by the New Republic Magazine, posted an entry on Friday about similar speculation around the capital U.S. city.

Both blogs cited questions asked by &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Biden"&gt;Senator Joseph Biden&lt;/a&gt; to Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; at a congressional hearing on Thursday. The hearing was a planned follow-up by the administration to answer concerns raised by President Bush's address to the nation on Wednesday where he announced the commitment to send more troops to Iraq. Biden asked several questions about whether the president had plans to send troops across the borders of Iran and Syria.

"Does that mean the president has plans to cross the Syrian and/or Iranian border to pursue those persons or individuals or governments providing that help?" Biden asked.

In an extensive answer, the secretary did not seem to explicitly deny it: "...What we're really trying to do here which is to protect our forces and that we are doing that by seeking out these networks that we know are operating in Iraq. We are doing it through intelligence. We are then able, as we did on the 21st of December, to go after these groups where we find them. In that case, we then asked the Iraqi government to declare them ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Apersona%20non%20grata"&gt;persona non grata&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and expel them from the country because they were holding diplomatic passports."

She soon added: "...We do need to work with our allies to make certain that they have the defense capacity that they need against growing Iranian military build-up, that they feel that we are going to be a presence in the &lt;a href="w%3APersian%20Gulf"&gt;Persian Gulf region&lt;/a&gt; as we have been, and that we establish confidence with the states with which we have long alliances, that we will help defend their interests. And that's what the president had in mind."

♡❤The Plank♡❤ was quick to note that the "secret war" was, at this point, just a rumor. Later that day, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ published a report on an interview conducted in Condoleezza Rice's office Friday afternoon, before she left for a trip to the Middle East. "There has been a decision to go after these networks," she said, referring to President Bush. The U.S. military was authorized by the president to take action against Iranian operatives in Iraq months ago.

In the same report, the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ quoted the new secretary of defense &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert M. Gates&lt;/a&gt; as saying, "We believe that we can interrupt these networks that are providing support, through actions inside the territory of Iraq, that there is no need to attack targets in Iran itself."

Though he is Commander in Chief of the U.S. armed forces, the president does not have the constitutional authority to declare war (only the Congress does). The president, however, can order military strikes without declaring war.

The U.S. has long explored possible attacks on Iran, according to Seymour Hersh, who has written three articles on deteriorating US-Iran relations for the New Yorker magazine.

The US, acting through Turkey, has supported Israeli intelligence collection and propaganda broadcasts supporting the ethnic &lt;a href="w%3AAzeri"&gt;Azeri&lt;/a&gt; nationalist movement in the north of Iran, according to Scott Ritter, former UNSCOM weapons inspector in Iraq, since at least 1996.

Anticipation of possible US military action against Iran has only intensified since Bush's midweek speech in which he announced 21,500 more soldiers would be sent to Iraq. In the same speech, he warned Iran and Syria against involvement in the Iraq conflict.

Hours after the speech, U.S. forces raided the Iranian Consulate in the town of Arbil, in the Kurdish area of Iraq, detaining several Iranian officials.

&lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cypriot&lt;/a&gt; cargo ship "Server" went down in &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; territory of the North Sea near the Norwegian city &lt;a href="w%3ABergen"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt; around 6pm local time on January 12. The ship broke into two parts and the accident is described as a catastrophe for the environment in the area due to a significant fuel oil leak. The oil reached land a short time after the breakdown.

The entire 25-man crew was brought to land around 9pm by a Sea King-helicopter. At noon next day it was reported that 290 tons of heavy fuel oil had leaked out onto the sea. The spilt oil has covered ground along the coast and is reported to be still spreading. A nature reservation area for birds is in imminent danger of pollution.

At least 2 coal miners in &lt;a href="w%3ACucumber%2C%20West%20Virginia"&gt;Cucumber, West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; were killed inside an underground mine after the roof collapsed when a pillar fell over. The collapse happened approximately 1.5 miles away from the entrance to the mine and it is not known what caused the pillar to fall.

"There's no need for rescue teams, the individuals have been recovered," said Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training director, Ron Wooten.

The mine is called the Brooks Run Mine and owned by Alpha Natural Resources LLC. The mine is located in McDowell County, in the southern part of the state.

A call to 911 was placed at approximately 11:00 a.m. [EST].

Officials say that an investigation is being conducted.

A British church group has defended a city mosque accused of "extremism", following an investigation by Channel 4 television.

The Saltley Gate Peace Group, an interfaith organisation based in Birmingham, has expressed "its undiminished support" for the Green Lane Masjid, featured in Channel 4's investigative ♡❤Dispatches♡❤ programme shown on Monday 15 January.

While filming ♡❤Undercover Mosque♡❤, a secret ♡❤Dispatches♡❤♡ reporter attended lectures at mosques run by key organisations whose public faces are presented as "moderate and mainstream" - but is believed to discover "preachers condemning the idea of integration into British society". The apparent influence of "Saudi Arabian Islam", sometimes known as Wahabism or Salafism, is also scrutinised in the film.

Programme makers claim the documentary, filmed and written by journalist Bobby Pathak, reveals "a number of mosques run by high profile national organisations that claim to be dedicated to moderation and dialogue with other faiths" but are in fact spreading "a message of religious bigotry and extremism". One of the Islamic organisations allegedly secretly filmed is Markazi Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith, a registered British charity which runs more than 40 mosques and branches in the UK with its headquarters at Green Lane Mosque in the Small Heath area of the city.

The documentary largely focused on the views of Abu Usama at-Thahabi, an African-American preacher based at the Green Lane Mosque. The documentary purported to show evidence of speeches made by the imam in which he allegedly condemns women, homosexuals and non-Muslims. In one clip, he is heard to say: "Allah has created the woman - even if she gets a PhD - deficient. Her intellect is incomplete, deficient. She may be suffering from hormones that will make her emotional. It takes two witnesses of a woman to equal the one witness of the man."
However, the Medinah University educated convert to Islam claimed his words had been misconstrued, later releasing a Google internet video defending his words.

However, the Anglo-Muslim group, founded in the 1970s, has rebuked the allegations, describing the documentary as "grossly distorted". Shaykh Shouaib Ahmed, the Secretary General of Markazi Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith voiced his concerns.

"We reject all forms of extremism. It is deeply alarming that a few sentences have been taken out of context in order to create the impression that our institution is a hotbed of fanaticism they could have approached us directly - we operate an open door policy in our mosques. We have nothing to hide. The religion of Islam is very clear."

The mosque explained, "We would like to make it clear that Markazi Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith cannot be regarded as endorsing every word uttered by every speaker we invite to our various mosques. Islam commands us to respond in kind to those who desire peaceful co-existence. If anyone contradicts this teaching then we would repudiate their views without hesitation."

A similar opinion was echoed in a statement from the Saltley Gate Peace Group. The community action project, based at the Saltley Methodist Church, feared the community around the mosque would be ostracized as a result of the investigation. "We cannot speak for the views of specific individuals featured in the film but are completely in support of the good nature of the mosque's diverse, multiracial and peaceful worshippers and administration."

The group has in the past successfully campaigned against propaganda campaigns in the area led by the disbanded radical group, Al-Muhajiroun.

"It is our hope that more resources will be spent on preventing true radical groups from brainwashing young Muslims and less time spent on demonising the general Muslim population for the actions of a select few", they added.

The Markazi Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith and Green Lane Masjid felt the forthcoming edition of ♡❤Dispatches♡❤ would "play into the hands of those who wish to exacerbate tensions within society". The religious authority has sent a letter to producer of the programme, Andrew Smith, highlighting their concerns.

An Ahl-e-Hadith mosque in Derby was also put under the spotlight in the programme, along with a Birmingham mosque run by the UK Islamic Mission (UKIM).

&lt;a href="w%3A2channel"&gt;2channel&lt;/a&gt;, the largest Internet forum in the world and an ISP in &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, has been shuttered by a Japanese court ruling in a civil slander case. The corporation managing 2channel was declared bankrupt and its assets will be seized. The ISP will close on January 15th, and the future of the famous "mega-BBS" is uncertain.

2channel's operator, &lt;a href="w%3AHiroyuki%20Nishimura"&gt;Hiroyuki Nishimura&lt;/a&gt;, was sued in 2006 by an unnamed 35-year-old office worker who had been made fun of and insulted on one of 2channel's forums. Nishimura moved his operations outside of Japan but did not contest the judge, who awarded the anonymous office worker 5 million yen, to be taken from 2channel's meager holdings within the country, such as its ISP "2channel Provider."

Nishimura issued no official response, but the splash page of 2ch, traditionally featuring a Japanese vase, was given an sarcastic "notice" telling readers that the vase was being repossessed by the Akabane District Court.

2channel was founded in 1999 and currently receives over 2.7 million posts per day from millions of users, mostly in Japan. 2channel is hosted in California but the domain name is registered in Japan.

Western &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; is preparing for what some forecasters are saying to be a major ice storm.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANOAA"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; has issued several warnings for Western New York which begin at 7:00 p.m. [EST] on Saturday and continue into Monday January 15, 2007.

A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for tonight and Sunday Morning for the "potential of heavy amounts" of ice, sleet and snow and has the potential to become "dangerous." The advisory is set to expire at 8:00 a.m. [EST] on Sunday morning.

"Light freezing rain and freezing drizzle is expected to begin after midnight tonight and continue into Sunday morning. Precipitation amounts are expected to be very light; however, it does not take much freezing rain to make untreated surfaces slippery," said the advisory on the NOAA's website.

"It [the freezing rain] is not expected to be heavy enough to cause tree or power problems," added the statement.

On Sunday night and Monday, "a wintery mix of precipitation with the potential for heavy amounts is expected Sunday night into Monday. This event has the potential to be much more significant than the precipitation tonight and Sunday morning. Heavy accumulations of snow, sleet or freezing rain are possible, which could lead to significant travel problems and utility outages caused by downed powerlines and poles," said a statement on the NOAA's website.

Although warnings and watches are posted, the NOAA says that the track of the storm is still "uncertain."

"There is still a good deal of uncertainty" as to the track of the storm, "but this storm has the potential to become dangerous," added the statement.

The same storm has caused more than 125,000 people to lose power near &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Loius%2C%20Missouri"&gt;St. Louis, Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and power officials say that they are "still losing people," said Springfield’s City Utilities spokesman, Ern DeCamp.

At least 6 people have been killed due to the storm around the Midwest and has caused schools and flights from and to &lt;a href="w%3ALambert-St.%20Louis%20International%20Airport"&gt;Lambert-St. Louis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMissouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADallas-Fort%20Worth%20International%20Airport"&gt;Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; to be cancelled. 25,000 people in &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; are still without power.

An emergency proclamation has been issued by Gov. &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; after below freezing temperatures caused "conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property."

The &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Aotearoa%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Green party of Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has ranked other political parties in New Zealand based on their policies and action taken on climate change. The results were announced at a Greens picnic today by co-leader, &lt;a href="w%3ARussel%20Norman"&gt;Doctor Russel Norman&lt;/a&gt; at his ♡❤State of the Planet♡❤ speech.

The top party was themselves, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Labour (Government)&lt;/a&gt; in second with Dr Norman saying they are "too frightened to do what needs to be done,", the &lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori%20Party"&gt;Māori party&lt;/a&gt; in third, then &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Future%20New%20Zealand"&gt;United Future&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20First"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt; and lastly, &lt;a href="w%3AACT%20New%20Zealand"&gt;ACT&lt;/a&gt;, leaving out &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Jim Anderton's Progressive Coalition&lt;/a&gt; party from being ranked. According to the Greens, ACT is denying how important climate change really is.

However not even Dr Norman is satisfied being at the top of the list, stating that more can be improved on. "We have been leading the debate but we don't have all the answers." Dr Norman does say that if the Greens were not in Parliament then all the other parties would be "floundering" because they would not know what to do.

Dr Norman says that New Zealand needs to do our part in helping Earth face its biggest challenge.

In Dr Norman's speech he also encouraged the other parties to take more action regarding climate change. "The results show that while the parties are more than happy to jump aboard the climate change band wagon, when it comes down to it, there is still a lack of political will to take firm action."

Dr Norman said: "Most parties had yet to tackle the tough issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector - this sector accounts for about 50 percent of New Zealand’s total emissions. They fared only slightly better in increasing forested area and reducing emissions from the electricity sector."

Dr Norman said that we are heading towards a "global catastrophe."

You won't find the word "Bravitude" in any French dictionary yet. Bravitude is a neologism used by &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal"&gt;Ségolène Royal&lt;/a&gt;, the French socialist presidential candidate. She said it during a visit to the Great Wall of China, and the term caused a media buzz in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. It also provoked ironic reactions from &lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, who has been nominated Sunday by &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;President Chirac's&lt;/a&gt; party &lt;a href="w%3AUMP"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt; as their candidate for the presidency. According to Royal's entourage, it was meant to express something more than just simple bravery (in French: ♡❤bravoure♡❤), a kind of ♡❤fullness of bravery♡❤.

Some &lt;a href="w%3Aneologism"&gt;neologisms&lt;/a&gt; need months, often years, to reach an acceptable level of recognition to get included in a conventional dictionary. This is often based on the usage in newspapers ♡❤etc♡❤. Bravitude on Google had only, the day before its first occurrence on French TV, a mere 110 hits.

Bravitude was already used since 2005 on some blogs and by fans of a relatively unknown role-playing game. On Tuesday last week, "bravitude" could be found in 200,000 different pages and in less than one week, had reached the one million mark. This neologism is this Tuesday in a slow decline, around 900,000 hits on Google, probably due to those web sites who hide their oldest pages when Google robots scan them.

&lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australian&lt;/a&gt; government authorities say they believe a toxin may be responsible for the recent mysterious death of an estimated 5,000 birds found in the area of &lt;a href="w%3AEsperance"&gt;Esperance&lt;/a&gt; - on the state's south eastern coastline. Autopsies by toxicologists from the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Agriculture%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;WA Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; will test for organochlorins, organophosphates and heavy metals. 

Esperance residents first noticed large numbers of dead birds littering their streets and gardens on December 7 last year. Populations of &lt;a href="w%3AHoneyeater"&gt;honeyeaters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWattle-bird"&gt;wattle birds&lt;/a&gt; and miners have reportedly been effected. 

The birds were being found vomiting and convulsing in bushland and suburban backyards over an extensive area. &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Environment%20and%20Conservation"&gt;Department of Environment and Conservation&lt;/a&gt;'s (DEC) nature conservation coordinator Mike Fitzgerald says toxic wetlands near Esperance are the most likely reason for the mass bird deaths. 

The DEC says it has failed to figure out the cause of death despite interviewing industry groups, farmers, grain handlers and timber companies about pesticide and chemical use.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.birdsaustralia.com.au"&gt;Birds Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the peak group dedicated to the conservation, study and enjoyment of Australia's native birds and their habitats, said it had not heard of a similar occurrence. "Not on that scale, and all at the same time, and also the fact that it's several different species," chief executive Graeme Hamilton told the Sunday Times. "You'd have to call that a most unusual event and one that we'd all have to be concerned about."

Mike Fitzgerald said the DEC were looking at something "pretty potent." "This is not a normal situation. The common thing that we have seen and heard is that the affected birds have an insatiable thirst... If it turns out to be a toxin that is responsible, that will raise more questions because there is no obvious source of exposure."

The deaths could be a result of a drier than normal winter, causing algal and bacterial blooms in the Esperance Lakes Nature Reserves. Esperance recorded 457mm rainfall in 2006; the average is 620mm.

Initially, health authorities feared a virus, such as the deadly &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20bird%20flu"&gt;avian bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, was responsible. That was quickly ruled out, along with poisoning from bacteria or eating poisoned insects.

The first deaths were reported by Esperance resident Michelle Crisp - who lives close to the worst-affected area. Dozens of native birds began dying in her back yard a week before Christmas. She says she contacted neighbours to discover if they were experiencing the same thing. Mrs Crisp found four dead birds, then 16, then 30 and finally up to 80.

Mike Fitzgerald said that any one of hundreds of toxins could be causing the deaths but so far all leads had not produced any answers.

Legendary &lt;a href="w%3ABollywood"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt; actor &lt;a href="w%3AAmitabh%20Bachchan"&gt;Amitabh Bachchan&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that his son &lt;a href="w%3AAbhishek%20Bachchan"&gt;Abhishek&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href="w%3AMiss%20World"&gt;Miss World&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAishwarya%20Rai"&gt;Aishwarya Rai&lt;/a&gt; were engaged last evening at a private ceremony at the &lt;a href="w%3AJalsa"&gt;Bachchans' residence&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. 

It is believed that the younger Bachchan proposed to his bride-to-be in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, soon after the Toronto premiere of his new movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGuru%20%28film%29"&gt;Guru&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The media had been following the romance between the two closely for some time past, but this is the first time they have come out in the open about their relationship. Rumours that the couple were planning to spread the know began to spread in November last year, when they visited the &lt;a href="w%3ASankat%20Mochan%20Temple"&gt;Sankat Mochan Temple&lt;/a&gt; together, with some even saying that they had already been married even earlier at the &lt;a href="w%3AMeenakshi%20Temple"&gt;Meenakshi temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMadurai"&gt;Madurai&lt;/a&gt;

According to one daily, the wedding will take place either on February 19 or March 7 at the &lt;a href="w%3AHyatt"&gt;Hyatt Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. "The children have decided.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pirate%20Bay"&gt;The Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt;, a file-sharing website based in &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, seeks to purchase its own &lt;a href="w%3Aisland%20nation"&gt;island nation&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to escape copyright laws. A group of people has launched a campaign to collect money via the Internet to acquire a former British sea platform situated in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sea"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;, six miles (9.6 kilometers) off the British coast.

The Pirate Bay states that the platform, named ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASealand"&gt;Sealand&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, will give users an easy way of sharing files protected by copyright in other nations. According to the statement made on the website, those who invest in purchasing Sealand will receive citizenship in it. 

The platform was occupied in 1967 by the associates and family members of &lt;a href="w%3APaddy%20Roy%20Bates"&gt;Paddy Roy Bates&lt;/a&gt;, a former radio broadcaster and former British Army Major, who now form its royal family. Prince Roy and Princess Joan Bates and their son Prince Regent Michael are willing to sell the platform for £65m. The royal family claims that it is independent and outside of any country's jurisdiction. 

The sovereign status of the platform is disputed. The Government of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; extended the territorial waters from 3 to 12 nautical miles after 1987, placing Sealand in its jurisdiction. However, Prince Roy simultaneously expanded the territory of Sealand and claimed continued independence. (See &lt;a href="w%3ASealand%23Legal%20status"&gt;Sealand&lt;/a&gt; on Wikipedia.)

Hired estate agents from &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; estimate the price of the floating island to be about 504 million pounds. The Swedish website mentioned that it was looking for alternatives to acquire Sealand. It also mentioned that if the "Internet-pirate" community is not able to buy Sealand, it will look for another small place to claim as its own.

The Pirate Bay website was closed for some time in May 2006 due to Swedish police raids. The site was later re-opened from &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; before moving back to &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;, best known for his role in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Terminator"&gt;The Terminator&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and being the Govenor of &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; (which earned him the nickname ♡❤The Governator♡❤), has been invited by the &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20the%20Prime%20Minister%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Prime Minister's Office&lt;/a&gt; to visit Canada.

Schwarzenegger is reported to have higher expectations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions than Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;.

"I hope it means they are serious about taking the kind of actions that Arnold Schwarzenegger is taking in California on climate change," said &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20May"&gt;Elizabeth May&lt;/a&gt;.

Environment minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Baird%20%28Canadian%20politician%29"&gt;John Baird&lt;/a&gt; said he and the Canadian government are concerned about the climate.

"We're concerned about the huge climate change challenges," said Baird. "The erratic weather we've had this winter is a huge wake-up call."

The Canadian PM and "The Governator" first met when they went to &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; for the inauguration of &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Calder%C3%B3n"&gt;Felipe Calderón&lt;/a&gt;, the president of Mexico.

No date has been set as to when the meeting will happen.

A &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrofoil"&gt;hydrofoil&lt;/a&gt; and a cargo ship have entered into collision this evening, at around 18:15 Italian local time (17:15 UTC) near the harbor of , &lt;a href="w%3ASicily"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.

The hydrofoil, named "Segesta jet", was doing a regular passenger service from to &lt;a href="w%3AMessina"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt;, carrying 151 passengers and 6 crew members.

The cargo ship is reported to be the "Susan Borchard", registered in &lt;a href="w%3AAntigua%20and%20Barbuda"&gt;Antigua and Barbuda&lt;/a&gt;.

The number of people dead or injured is not currently established, but during the night the number of fatalities rose to 4.

Saddam Hussein's half brother and former chief of the Iraqi secret police, &lt;a href="w%3ABarzan%20Ibrahim%20al-Tikriti"&gt;Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti&lt;/a&gt;, along with the former chief judge of the revolutionary court, &lt;a href="w%3AAwad%20Hamad%20al-Bandar"&gt;Awad Hamad al-Bandar&lt;/a&gt; were hanged today in Baghdad at approximately 3:00 a.m. local time for their role in the 1982 killing of 148 Shiite Muslims in the village of &lt;a href="w%3ADujail"&gt;Dujail&lt;/a&gt;.

Although efforts were taken to prevent a repeat of the controversy surrounding the perceived impropriety that followed the cellphone video of last week's &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein%20executed%20by%20hanging"&gt;execution of Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, including confiscation of reporters' cellphones and requiring all individuals present to sign a statement that they would not engage in Shiite chants and taunting, outrage is already being heard from many quarters over an apparent miscalculation by the executioner resulting in al-Tikriti's decapitation by the noose.

Shaken by the mishap, officials waited seven hours before announcing the execution and waited another six before showing to reporters a three minute official video of the hangings, who were told that it would not be shown again.

Large parts of &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; were hit with &lt;a href="w%3Apower%20outage"&gt;power outage&lt;/a&gt;s after bushfires near &lt;a href="w%3ABenalla"&gt;Benalla&lt;/a&gt; knocked out power transmission lines connecting the state to the national &lt;a href="w%3AElectricity%20distribution"&gt;electricity grid&lt;/a&gt; at approximately 4:00 p.m. local time. &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href="w%3ABallarat"&gt;Ballarat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABendigo"&gt;Bendigo&lt;/a&gt; were all affected. 

Paul Price from the national electricity grid supervisor &lt;a href="w%3ANEMMCO"&gt;NEMMCO&lt;/a&gt; said that today set an all-time record for electricity demand.

Emma Daniell, from the power supplier &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Power"&gt;SP AusNet&lt;/a&gt; said the result of the fires "prompted an automatic load reduction system to kick in, reducing power supply to customers". These rolling &lt;a href="w%3ABlackout"&gt;blackouts&lt;/a&gt; are occurring across the surrounding suburbs lasting one hour a time. 

The blackout affected about 200,000 homes, 1,200 &lt;a href="w%3Atraffic%20light"&gt;traffic lights&lt;/a&gt; and "mobile base stations". &lt;a href="w%3ARailways%20in%20Melbourne"&gt;Trains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATrams%20in%20Melbourne"&gt;trams&lt;/a&gt; were reduced to a crawl, with buses replacing trains between &lt;a href="w%3AEssendon%20railway%20station%2C%20Melbourne"&gt;Essendon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKensington%20railway%20station%2C%20Melbourne"&gt;Kensington&lt;/a&gt; railway stations, and on the &lt;a href="w%3AWerribee"&gt;Werribee&lt;/a&gt; loop. 

Geelong was the region worst affected, with the entire city losing power from 4 p.m. Power was restored to the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20business%20district"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt; area shortly after 5 p.m., however many parts of the city were not restored until 8 p.m.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Open"&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt; tennis tournament was not affected.

Fighting broke out between rioters and civil defense groups in the central Bolivian city of Cochabamba on Thursday, January 11 leaving 2 dead and 240 injured.

Coca farmers backing the government of president &lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt; attacked government buildings and set fire to part of the local government offices in Cochabamba. 

The rioters were demanding the resignation of the state governor - a critic of president Morales who supported a move to give Bolivia's states greater autonomy.

Opposition political parties have demanded an investigation into allegations that president Morales' ally, senator Leonilda Zurita, delivered supplies to the demonstrators who have laid siege to the local government building.

<h2>Headlines</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Saddam%27s%20co-defendant%20decapitated%20while%20being%20hanged"&gt;Saddam's co-defendant decapitated while being hanged&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
In Baghdad, Saddam Hussein's half brother and former chief of the Iraqi secret police, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, along with the former chief judge of the revolutionary court, Awad Hamad al-Bandar were hanged yesterday at approximately 3:00 a.m. local time for their role in the 1982 killing of 148 Shiite Muslims in the village of Dujail.

Although efforts were taken to prevent a repeat of the controversy surrounding the perceived impropriety that followed the cellphone video of last week's execution of Saddam Hussein, including confiscation of reporters' cellphones and requiring all individuals present to sign a statement that they would not engage in Shiite chants and taunting, outrage is already being heard from many quarters over an apparent miscalculation by the executioner resulting in al-Tikriti's decapitation by the noose.

<h3>&lt;a href="Hydrofoil%20collides%20with%20cargo%20ship%20near%20Sicily"&gt;Hydrofoil collides with cargo ship near Sicily&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

The newly elected Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation scheduled talk on the main French TV was met with questions about a last minute deletion of the entry for &lt;a href="Bravitude%20climbing%20fast%20on%20Google"&gt;bravitude&lt;/a&gt;, (a neologism used by &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal"&gt;Ségolène Royal&lt;/a&gt;, the French socialist presidential candidate and commonly heard in the French media). It was deleted from the French version of Wikipedia not long prior to the televised appearance by Devouard. The decision to delete the entry apparently perplexed the &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20presenter"&gt;anchor&lt;/a&gt; commentator, who judged the term was currently noteworthy and felt his view was shared by many Frenchmen today. 

Chair Nibart-Devouard then explained that since Wikipedia is written collaboratively by volunteers, its articles can be and are edited by almost anyone with access to the Web site. Therefore any article, including one on bravitude, can be added to this Wiki encyclopedia... but the article can be modified or even deleted if the &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AVerifiability"&gt;verification process&lt;/a&gt; leads to a &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AConsensus"&gt;consensus&lt;/a&gt; to do so.

One might speculate whether the French media interest in the French Wikipedia's deletion of the term bravitude will result in sufficient discussion to warrant this neologism being restored to the French Wikipedia.

Numerous city, state, and federal agencies are involved in the investigation of a recent string of church fires this past weekend in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AGreenville%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Greenville, North Carolina, U.S.A.&lt;/a&gt;

A police spokesman said two Baptist churches were believed to be set on fire and a third was broken into this past weekend. Damages are estimated to be over &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1,000,000.

City of Greenville Police, Greenville Fire Department, North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%20and%20Firearms"&gt;Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms&lt;/a&gt; are a part of a joint task force set up to investigate these incidents.

Evidence from the fire scenes have been sent to the state crime lab for analysis.

A US$10,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest of the perpetrators of this crime.

Adam Spencer, 26-years-old, and former (&lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;) of &lt;a href="w%3AEmexis"&gt;Emexis&lt;/a&gt; Integrated Solutions Inc. turned himself in yesterday morning. His family and his lawyer were with him.

This came after a Canada-wide police search was started on January 12, 2007. The &lt;a href="w%3AOakville%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Oakville, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; man disappeared last year after asking for money from Canadian investors to help his company Emexis go public. However, Spencer did not take Emexis public as promised.

Eighty-nine investors, who, at the time, believed Spencer, have come forward to police.

"The long and the short of it is that he did not meet his obligations in terms of what he promised his investors," Mr. Peter Leupen, one of the investors who helped Spencer, said. "He promised us a dividend on an initial investment and that never happened."

"He's genuinely dishonest, I think he's immature and putting the best gloss on it, he let the money he was collecting go to his head. He was spending it like a drunken sailor on boats, houses, race cars, everything but what he was supposed to be spending it on," Mr. Symon Zucker, a Toronto lawyer who the investors sought help from.

Spencer was last seen before Christmas and recently returned to Canada. Detective Jeff Thompson said Spencer was in &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; for the weekend.

"It appears that he was not in any hurry to face the music," said Thompson.

Spencer will go to a &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; court on Monday.

♡❤North Korea's 007♡❤, a currently very popular short movie by some &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Anetizens"&gt;netizens&lt;/a&gt;, mocks &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Jong%20Il"&gt;Kim Jong Il&lt;/a&gt; and his secret agent buying Hennessy XO wine from Chinese black market.

As of 3:27 AM, January 20, 2007, China Standard Time, the movie has been watched 1,993,567 times on a single site (6rooms.com) and received 1620 comments.

The talks between the &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;ns are in English; the talks between the agent and the Chinese are in Chinese (now featuring English subtitles). The story part situated in China is as follows:

♡❤♡Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.♡❤♡

The agent first went to a grocery where he didn't find XO, then to a wine store which sells XO, but he complained about the price being much more expensive than the price quoted on the Internet. His accent surprised a girl who recognized his North Korean identity and the saleswoman rejected his buying due to "resulting UN security council penalty." The agent left the store and a white-coated fat man (a black market wine seller) and a black-coated man followed.

The agent checked in at a hotel and received 3 phone calls; one from his commander urging him forward on the mission, one from a whore offering "special service" (to whom the agent replied with "Yes, I need, I need a bottle of XO!"), and one from the fat man asking him to go to a disco bar for XO trading. He went to the bar and watched the fat man dancing to "We Were Forced to Be Gangs" (the music is Michael Jackson's "Beat It"). The fat man found the agent's money was fake (which the agent explained was because North Korea wanted to "ease the pressure that the hostile West put on China for currency appreciation") and a fight ensued. The fat man was defeated and said "Your country is not based on honesty" while the agent said in his mind, "No honesty for your revisionist country."

The agent is about to cross the China-North Korea border and the black-coated man caught up and defeated him by breaking his "Kim Jong Il medal" (which is a devastating psychological strike to North Koreans). The black-coated man revealed himself to be George W. Bush and some Chinese bystanders questioned him on why he hung Saddam ("One Saddam is down but a million Saddams will be up!") and drove him away. The curious Chinese bystanders accidentally broke the agent's XO which resulted in another devastating episode. The white-coated fat man reappeared and said he saw the whole event and was impressed by the agent and gave away another bottle of XO to him.

The agent returned to North Korea and presented the XO to Kim Jong Il (on their way to Kim's residence their eyes were covered in order not to "give the Americans a chance to pinpoint Kim's precise location"). Kim immediately died because the wine was faked and poisonous.

&lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;'s lawyers are reportedly pursuing legal action against persons whom they claim are wrongfully using icons, interfaces, and other copyright- or patent-protected materials from its new &lt;a href="w%3AiPhone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; on other &lt;a href="w%3ASmart%20phone"&gt;smart phones&lt;/a&gt;, which may have features similar to the iPhone's. Apple has also reportedly contacted at least one blogger who posted screenshots of iPhone icons with "cease and desist" requests, although it should be noted that in the one reported case referenced below, the blogger had also posted a download link to an interface containing features allegedly appropriated from the iPhone. Apple's new gadget was demonstrated at Macworld &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. 

Protecting intellectual property can involve a balance between (among other things) allowing some unauthorized use of such material in order to obtain "free promotion" of a company or product, and preventing competitors from "piggybacking" upon original research or upon an established reputation.

The head of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israel Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Halutz"&gt;Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , resigned on Tuesday January 16, 2007 after an internal review criticized his military's leadership during the war in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; last summer.

Halutz sent his resignation letter to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which according to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20army%20radio"&gt;Israeli Army Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said, "For me, the concept of responsibility is everything."

Halutz has also been facing criticism after it was disclosed that he sold a portion of his stock portfolio hours after the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; fighting began on July 12, 2006.

Fighter jet parts and other &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; military gear that were to be sold to &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have been traced back to the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;. The gear was not sold directly to these countries, but rather it was obtained by middlemen who the sold it again.

In one case, federal investigators said that a &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; middleman purchased arms from the &lt;a href="w%3ADefense%20Department"&gt;Defense Department’s&lt;/a&gt; surplus auction. The arms purchased were &lt;a href="w%3AChinook%20helicopter"&gt;Chinook helicopter&lt;/a&gt; engine parts, which the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement"&gt;Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; agency said did successfully make it to Iran.

In a second case, &lt;a href="w%3AF-14%20Tomcat"&gt;Tomcat&lt;/a&gt; parts were bought from the Defense Department’s surplus division. Custom agents confiscated and returned the parts, but later found out that the Defense Department had resold the parts to another buyer suspected of being a broker for &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. Except for the &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, which recently retired its Tomcat air fleet, Iran is the only other country flying Tomcats.

In 2005 alone, the profits made from the Pentagon's public surplus sales were $57 million. 

The Pentagon has had previous incidents in the past. In 2003, a &lt;a href="w%3ACamden%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Camden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; company, State Metal Industries, was convicted for selling &lt;a href="w%3AAIM-7%20Sparrow"&gt;AIM-7 Sparrow missile&lt;/a&gt; guidance parts, which it had bought from the Defense Department’s surplus auctions, to an entity partially owned by the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20government"&gt;Chinese government&lt;/a&gt;.

An EU Commission-funded research studied costs and benefits of adopting , such as &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href="w%3Aproprietary%20software"&gt;proprietary software&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWindows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Office"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt;.

The study also reported that they found "no particular delays or lost of time in the daily work due to the use of OpenOffice.org" (p. 283) instead of Microsoft Office. 

This is bad news for Microsoft, who is in a legal battle with European Union over its monopolist behaviors. It is also competing with a number of open source software distributors for the market. Microsoft recently released an update to its popular operating system Windows, as well as to its browser Internet Explorer and its office productivity suite Microsoft Office. These products are competing with distributors such as &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Hat"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFirefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, and OpenOffice.org.

<h1>Peasant group to rap Philippine military for ‘electioneering’</h1>

A Philippine daily reported that peasant group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (Peasant Movement of the Philippines or KMP) plans to file electioneering case against Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) claiming that fully armed troops have been deployed in various areas around the country with strong presence of progressive organizations and party lists groups.

The military says that politicians running for elections have sought the military's protection against what it says is harassment and extortion by the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20the%20Philippines"&gt;Communist Party of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; and its military wing, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20People%E2%80%99s%20Army"&gt;New People’s Army&lt;/a&gt;.

Danilo Ramos, KMP Secretary General, said they also seek to exclude AFP members from voting in the upcoming May elections, pointing out the possibility of the soldiers as "flying voters".

Prior to that, another group, an urban poor organization Kadamay, hit the increased presence of soldiers in areas where the group is active. The group suspects that the deployment of soldiers in a number of barangays in Quezon City and parts of Metro Manila is an attempt to flush out activist leaders.

&lt;a href="w%3ASex%20industry"&gt;Sex industry&lt;/a&gt; producers think over a new service: on-demand live sex video that can be watched from a hotel room. Will this service be popular? Will large hotel chains go along? These and some other issues were talked about during panel discussion at annual Las Vegas, Nevada trade show for sex entertainment industry producers, marketers and payment processors Internext.

There were two opinions on this issue. Gregory Clayman, the owner of the live-action company Video Secrets expressed confidence that in the nearest future sex industry would be selling images of couples making &lt;a href="w%3ALove"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; live over the hotel's entertainment systems. 

At the same time Anne Taulane, managing editor of Lodging magazine, said she doubted whether major hotel chains would be enthusiastic about this idea as she was convinced that on-demand sex video was more available to the mainstream than viewing live sex performers over hotel's entertainment system. 

The panelists praised &lt;a href="w%3AMastercard"&gt;Mastercard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVisa%20Debit"&gt;Visa&lt;/a&gt; programs which helped to reduce chargebacks or refusals to pay for ordered sex video and debated whether requiring a &lt;a href="w%3ACredit%20card"&gt;credit card&lt;/a&gt; would prevent minors from viewing sexually explicit materials in the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. As the result they came to the conclusion that the government must intervene to cope with these problems.

<h1>Cambodian woman found after 19 years of jungle life</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Cambodian%20woman%20found%20after%2019%20years%20of%20jungle%20life&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A woman who disappeared in the jungles of &lt;a href="w%3ACambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 8, has been found after having lived as a &lt;a href="w%3AFeral%20child"&gt;feral child&lt;/a&gt; for 19 years. She is identified as &lt;a href="w%3ARochom%20P%27ngieng"&gt;Rochom P'ngieng&lt;/a&gt;, who disappeared in 1988, when tending buffalos in a remote part of the jungles of north-eastern Cambodia.

Her parents had given up all hope of finding her since it was so long ago that she disappeared. The father of the girl is convinced that the woman is his daughter based on a distinct scar on her back and facial features. Authorities have asked for a &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; test to confirm the girl's identity. Rochom P'ngieng would be 27 years old.

The woman speaks no comprehensible language and thus it is difficult to confirm what has happened to her. She was discovered when a villager noticed that food had disappeared from a lunchbox he had left nearby his home, so he decided to watch the area, discovering the naked woman when she came again for some rice, according to the chief of police, Mao San in Oyado. "It is as if she's part human and part animal", said Mao San. A group of villagers were called together to catch the woman. The woman has had a hard time adjusting to normal life.

"She is strange. She sleeps in the day and wakes in the night," said Mao San.

In the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Carphone%20Warehouse"&gt;The Carphone Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACelebrity%20Big%20Brother%202007%20%28UK%29"&gt;Celebrity Big Brother's&lt;/a&gt; sponsor, has pulled out after some of the reality TV show's contestants were accused of racism, with which the company did not want to be associated. The Perfume Shop has announced they will withdraw the perfume ♡❤Shh...♡❤ of &lt;a href="w%3AJade%20Goody"&gt;Jade Goody&lt;/a&gt;, one of the contestants accused of bullying with a racist undertone. Motorcycle insurance company &lt;a href="w%3ABennetts"&gt;Bennetts&lt;/a&gt; unilaterally terminated its deal with former Miss England &lt;a href="w%3ADanielle%20Lloyd"&gt;Danielle Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; to front an advertisement campaign.

The accusations centre around recent comments made by Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd and &lt;a href="w%3AJo%20O%27Meara"&gt;Jo O'Meara&lt;/a&gt; (a former member of pop act &lt;a href="w%3AS%20Club%207"&gt;S Club 7&lt;/a&gt;) about &lt;a href="w%3ABollywood"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt; actress &lt;a href="w%3AShilpa%20Shetty"&gt;Shilpa Shetty&lt;/a&gt;. The racism row was sparked by Jade's mother, who referred to Shilpa as "the Indian", instead of calling her by her name. She also asked Shilpa: "Do you live in a house or a shack?" There have been remarks over her accent, her alleged lack of hygiene when cooking, and reactions because she touched the food of housemates with her hands. Danielle Lloyd said: "You don't know where those hands have been." Lloyd also commented to Goody about the Indian actress: "She wants to be white".

When asked about the incident in the Diary Room, Shetty said "...I don't feel there was any racial discrimination happening from Jade's end. I think there are a lot of insecurities from her end but it's definitely not racial."

Hertfordshire Police, the constabulary within which the Big Brother House falls, have received numerous formal complaints they will be investigating. Politicians, other celebrities, and fans spoke of their disgust as the UK media regulator &lt;a href="w%3AOfcom"&gt;Ofcom&lt;/a&gt; received a record number of complaints that rose tonight to 33,000. The Commission for Racial Equality is investigating if the footage was manipulated to deliberately imply racism.

&lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; MP &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Vaz"&gt;Keith Vaz&lt;/a&gt; even proposed a motion in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; condemning the abuse. He said "If this racist behaviour goes on, they [Jo O'Meara, Danielle Lloyd and Jade Goody] should be asked to leave". &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, currently on tour in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, told reporters in &lt;a href="Bangalore"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;: "I want to reassure people that what British people are proud of is our reputation for tolerance and fairness." Others believe this reflects a racist tendency in British our Western society in general. The newspaper &lt;a href="w%3ATimes%20of%20India"&gt;Times of India&lt;/a&gt; ran the headline "Big(ot) Brother bullies Shilpa". "What is happening in Big Brother is just holding the mirror to the western society. This is the real, discriminating face of the West.", was the reaction of Bollywood film director &lt;a href="w%3AMahesh%20Bhatt"&gt;Mahesh Bhatt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Livingstone"&gt;Ken Livingstone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AMayor%20of%20London"&gt;Mayor of London&lt;/a&gt;, accused &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt; of damaging the country's reputation.

The show was recently losing viewers, but as a result of the controversy, viewing rates are up for the program.

The opening ceremony of 23th edition of Winter &lt;a href="w%3AUniversiade"&gt;Universiade&lt;/a&gt; took place yesterday night in &lt;a href="w%3ATurin"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt;. The Universiade, also referred to as the World University Games, is an international event for university athletes organized by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20University%20Sports%20Federation"&gt;International University Sports Federation&lt;/a&gt;.

Representatives of 52 countries took part to the event. The participants to this edition of Universiade are the highest number ever, both in terms of countries and athletes (that amount to 2,700). The Olympic Oath was taken by Francesco Ghedina, nephew of famous &lt;a href="w%3ADownhill"&gt;downhill&lt;/a&gt; skier, &lt;a href="w%3AKristian%20Ghedina"&gt;Kristian Ghedina&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="w%3ALivio%20Berruti"&gt;Livio Berruti&lt;/a&gt;, world medalist in &lt;a href="w%3A200%20metres"&gt;200 metres&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1960%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;1960 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;, was the last torch relay and ignited symbolically the &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Flame"&gt;Olympic Flame&lt;/a&gt;. The fire was just symbolic because obvious safety reasons prohibited a real fire inside an indoor &lt;a href="w%3Aarena"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;.

The ceremony show featured the Football World Champion &lt;a href="w%3AGianluigi%20Buffon"&gt;Gianluigi Buffon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Agoalkeeper"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AJuventus%20FC"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;, the long jumper &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Howe"&gt;Andrew Howe&lt;/a&gt; and the actor &lt;a href="w%3AArturo%20Brachetti"&gt;Arturo Brachetti&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; computer company &lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has reached 78 percent increase in its profits during the last quarter, which ended December 30, &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. This fact is explained by great demand enjoyed by Apple's &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; digital music players during the Christmas and New Year sales period.

As a result of successful Christmas sales, the very beginning of the financial year marked a double increase of the Apple's sales if compared to the $ 565 million profit reaped during the same period of the last year. The company gained the record-breaking $ 1 billion. The overall annual revenue of the company made up $ 7.1 billion in 2006, having boosted from $5.8 billion in &lt;a href="w%3A2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;. The company's revenue growth is partially explained by the fact that the laptops produced by Apple are also found among the bestsellers. 

Even the &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; experts have not broadcasted such remarkable results for the Apple computer company. Apple's results were way ahead of market expectations. Its net profit has made up $1.14 per share, while Wall Street expected just 77 cents. 

During the first quarter of the financial year Apple Inc. sold more than 21 million iPod players and about 1.6 million computers - it implies the respective growth of 28% and 50% again compared to the previous year. As soon as the results were announced at the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, the shares of the American computer company increased by 5 percent. 

It should be mentioned that the stock capital of Apple Inc tripled in &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, doubled in 2005 and increased by 16 percent in 2006. The steady growth is also due to considerable sales of its iPods and computers. 

Last week the company presented the iPhone.

A new search engine that was announced yesterday finds articles and links within the English &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AWikiseek"&gt;Wikiseek&lt;/a&gt;, run by a California based startup company called "searchme", is a website which aims to be "A better way to search Wikipedia."

Although most keywords work without problems, &lt;a href="w%3ADigg"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt; users have found search terms that the site does not recognize. If you enter "Chicago" for example, it shows no Wikipedia articles at all, and clicking "Chicago, Illinois" leads to an article on West Chicago, Illinois and other related articles to the subject. Similarly, entering "&lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;" or "&lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%203"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;" only provides links to related articles on Wikipedia, although they are in the top 10 of most viewed articles in the English Wikipedia. Searching "porn" comes up with commercial websites linked from Wikipedia, but not the relevant articles in the free encyclopedia. For most articles however, the relevant Wikipedia article is the first result or among the results.

The site says that "The contents of Wikiseek are restricted to Wikipedia pages and only those sites which are referenced within Wikipedia, making it an authoritative source of information less subject to spam and SEO schemes." The site also offers a Toolbar plugin and a Firefox extension to add a Wikiseek search button inside of Wikipedia pages.

Danny Sullivan at the Search Engine Land blog found Wikiseek's results inferior compared to the results from established search engines. SearchMe CEO Randy Adams stressed that Wikiseek is still in a beta phase. He pointed out that they welcome feedback more than the average search engine, which can be posted on their company wiki.

Searchme put a button on their main page, encouraging beta testers to instantly promote the site on Digg. In August 2006, Digg had half a million registered users.

Some media outlets have reported that Wikiseek was created by either the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; which runs Wikipedia, or private corporation &lt;a href="w%3AWikia"&gt;Wikia&lt;/a&gt;, which hosts a collection of wiki communities. Both rumors are untrue, says &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Beesley"&gt;Angela Beesley&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of Wikia and chair of the Advisory Board of the Wikimedia Foundation. "Wikiseek is an independent project with no affiliation with either Wikia or the Wikimedia Foundation."

The Wikiseek site says they contribute the majority of its revenue from advertisement to the Wikimedia Foundation's fundraising effort.

&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has shot down one of their old weather satellites with a ballistic missile and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is concerned about the test.

"The US believes China's development and testing of such weapons is inconsistent with the spirit of cooperation that both countries aspire to in the civil space area. We and other countries have expressed our concern to the Chinese," said a spokesman for the National Security Council, Gordon Johndroe.

The Feng Yun 1C polar orbit weather satellite was hit by a medium-range, ground based ballistic missile approximately 537 miles above the Earth's surface. The missile used a "kinetic impact" to destroy the satellite, said Johndroe. Both the satellite and the missile were launched from the Xichang Space Center in Sichuan Province; the satellite in 1999, and the missile on January 11 this year.

Officials in the U.S. are now concerned that debris from the test could cause problems for civilian and/or military satellites. It is estimated that at least 40,000 pieces of debris are now floating around in space as the result of the test, and the pieces range anywhere from 1&amp;ndash;10 cm. The pieces of the satellite and missile could stay in Earth's orbit for several decades.

When the test happened, the U.S. stated that communication with one of its spy satellites was lost, but thus far no evidence has turned up to suggest the loss of communication was directly related to China's test.

The test took place on January 11, 2007 and this is the first such test to occur in over 20 years. The U.S. last tested an anti-satellite system back on September 13, 1985

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; have both stated concerns about the test and &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; are all expected to voice their concerns over the test.

&lt;a href="w%3ATJX%20Companies"&gt;TJX Companies&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; chain, that owns &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20box"&gt;big box&lt;/a&gt; stores &lt;a href="w%3AWinners"&gt;Winners&lt;/a&gt;, a fashion outlet, and &lt;a href="w%3AHomeSense"&gt;HomeSense&lt;/a&gt;, a home accessories store, has revealed they had their computers hacked back in mid-December.

It also affected the U.S. and &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; stores &lt;a href="w%3AMarshalls"&gt;Marshalls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AT.J.%20Maxx"&gt;T.J.

The intrusion could also affect stores in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.

They discovered the hacking in mid-December and revealed the information to the public on Wednesday.

"The company is committed to providing its customers with more information when it becomes available," TJX Companies said in a statement.

The computers contain credit card, debit card, check, and merchandise return transactions information. The hacker could have accessed transactions during 2003 and from May through December 2006.

Jefferies analyst Timothy Allen said the chain should use this as an opportunity for excellent customer service. He added that they should offer coupons to customers to get them back to shopping in stores owned by TJX.

Customers with questions can call one of the help lines at 866-484-6978 in the United States, 866-903-1408 in Canada, and 0800-77-90-15 for the United Kingdom and Ireland.

In &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Times"&gt;Daily Times&lt;/a&gt; reported that construction work on a sewerage project has started in Pindi.

It said that the construction work for the Rawalpindi Environment Improvement Project (REIP) aims to lay a new underground drainage and sewerage system in the area. 

The project director of REIP, Aslam Sabzwari, said, according to the report, that improvement of sanitation and sewerage system had started in the eastern zone of the city, consisting of 15 union councils (UCs). The project includes improvement of the sanitation and sewerage systems, a sewage treatment plant, solid waste management, removal of slaughter-houses and construction of public toilets.

Sabzwari also said that 22 new tube wells would be installed, while 32 old ones would be repaired under the project, recalling that the existing sewerage systems in Satellite Town and Kahyabane-Sirsyed were laid in the 1950s and 1969s, respectively, and were the main cause of the increasing case of hepatitis in the city.

&lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20Development%20Bank"&gt;Asian Development Bank&lt;/a&gt; (ADB) and the Punjab government sponsor the REIP.

Philippine human rights commission (CHR) together with various local government officials branded "overkill" the police assault on the &lt;a href="w%3AIloilo"&gt;Iloilo&lt;/a&gt; provincial capitol on Wednesday.

In an attempt to arrest Governor Niel Tupas, Sr. and seize control of the capitol, hundreds of policemen armed with M-16 rifles stormed the capitol, smashed glass doors and destroyed padlocked iron gates. The rifles were pointed at civilians.

In a television interview, CHR Chairman Purificacion Quisumbing called the act "frightening".

Quisumbing was worried that it would turn out bloody had the shots been fired. She was "shocked to see policemen going into a public building with assault rifles in a manner not consonant with the picture we are trying to portray of a peaceful country of law-abiding citizens.”

"If this can happen in broad daylight to an elected official and (before) the media, (how much) more at night in the barrios?" she said.

The assault was stopped by a 60-day temporary restraining order against the enforcement of the dismissal order.

But Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Ronaldo Puno defended the police and proposed a joint investigation with CHR on the matter.

"The policemen ... should not be condemned. They should even be commended," Puno said.

An initial assessment prompted Quisumbing to declare that the police committed human rights violations. She also indicated in a television interview that CHR would look into the matter independently, thereby rejecting DILG's proposal for a joint probe.

She was quoted as saying “we define our independent investigation as one where we ourselves have to examine the facts and the circumstances.”

Quisumbing also noted that a joint investigation with DILG would be in conflict CHR's mandate and function.

Brian Fields, a retired &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Air Force Colonel, has photographed what he claims are two &lt;a href="w%3AUFO"&gt;UFOs&lt;/a&gt; hovering over his home in &lt;a href="w%3AVan%20Buren%2C%20Arkansas"&gt;Van Buren, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;.

Fields said, "I believe these lights were not of this world, and I feel a duty and responsibility to come forward. At first I thought they were landing lights from an aircraft. As I continued to observe them they began to slowly disappear, then suddenly one reappeared, followed by two, then three. On at least one occasion four or five appeared. Each time they would slowly fade and eventually disappear. This occurred several times and when they would reappear they might do so in differing numbers and in different positions, sometimes in a triangular shape, sometimes stacked on top of each other, sometimes line abreast, etc. When the objects appeared they might stay illuminated 10 or more minutes. I'm certain it wasn't an aircraft [from Earth]. It's not anything I ever had any experience with. ... They were some kind of energy or something.” 

Fields ruled out the possibility of the UFOs being flares saying that the movements made by the UFOs did not resemble that of a flare. In 1997, &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20Lights"&gt;lights seen over Arizona and Nevada&lt;/a&gt; were also claimed to have been UFOs before the US Air Force identified them as flares dropped by an airplane on a training mission. 

Fields, now 61, was in the military for almost 32 years of his life, flying &lt;a href="w%3AF-16"&gt;F-16&lt;/a&gt; fighter jets.

On the 18th of December, &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; held the "Unbound" event that attracted about 300 people, who gathered at the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Public%20Library"&gt;New York Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. The event's visitors met to discuss the issue of Google's Library Project and Book Search tool and the publishing business perspectives in general. Google decided to bring up the issue, as a lot of representatives of the publishing industry believe that the project will deprive them from the expected profits from books sold in bookstores and online marketplaces. 

The speech of Jim Gerber, manager of content partnerships at &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, opened the event. Mr. Gerber noted that their meeting was aimed at a mutual understanding of changes the book-publishing market will face in the 21st century. Among the speakers present were those closely related to the publishing business - authors, publishers and analysts, including &lt;a href="w%3ACory%20Doctorow"&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;, a science fiction writer and co-editor of &lt;a href="w%3ABoing%20Boing"&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt;, as well as agents of the leading publishing stores such as &lt;a href="w%3AHarper%20Collins"&gt;Harper Collins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%20University%20Press"&gt;Cambridge University Press&lt;/a&gt;. 

Having organized the event, Google pursued their aim of improving the perception of its Book Search project. The company tried to establish links with publishers and libraries by extending an offer whereby portions of copyrighted published content would be availabe for public view through the Google search database. Still, Google stumbled upon skeptical attitudes by publishers. 

However, some of the publishers supported the initiative. Cory Doctorow expressed his belief, grounded upon his personal experiences, that book snippets available free on the Internet implied the possibility of commercial benefit. One of the major advantages of the on-line library is the guaranteed attention and interest it can attract to the publishers' products.

Although the issue aroused a lot of controversial opinions, the speakers came to the conclusion that as the digital world has been experiencing rapid growth, the publishing industry has to keep to the modern pace and broaden its horizons. As it was mentioned by Tim O'Reilly, the founder of &lt;a href="w%3AO%27Reilly%20Media"&gt;O'Reilly Media&lt;/a&gt;, a technical manual publishing company, that in the time of revolutionary changes, brought by the development of digital technologies, it was important for their industry segment not to ignore but embrace the forthcoming changes. He also mentioned that the Library Project and Book Search tool carried out by Google represented an opportunity to become part of the newly-born media culture.

<h1>Sri Lankan military liberates key town</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sri%20Lankan%20military%20liberates%20key%20town&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lankan troops&lt;/a&gt; liberated a key town in Eastern &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; as they continued their offensive to evict the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberation%20Tigers%20of%20Tamil%20Eelam"&gt;Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam&lt;/a&gt; (LTTE, also called the Tamil Tigers) from the &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Province%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29"&gt;Eastern Province&lt;/a&gt; of the country. 

The town of Vakarai, which has been under the control of the LTTE since 1996, was a key stronghold for the LTTE and one of their last major bases in the East. Sri Lankan troops met little resistance as they moved into the town at around noon local time, as the Tamil Tigers were believed to have fled further North.

A Sri Lankan defense ministry statement on its website said the LTTE had fled the town area "unable to withstand the intrusive thrust of the armed forces". A statement from the Media Center for National Security said "triumphant troops are presently consolidating their positions and clearing the terrain to resettle displace civilians."

The Tigers have so far failed to comment on the fighting. 

Leading up to the capture of the town, around 12,000 civilians, whom the government claimed the LTTE were using as &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Shields"&gt;Human Shields&lt;/a&gt;, were reported to have fled to the safety of government controlled areas. This added to the 20,000 who had already fled to government controlled areas since heavy fighting began in December 2006.

Basic necessities for them were provided by the security forces. The government stated that it would make all efforts to resettle the civilians as soon as normalcy is restored in the town.

The fall of Vakarai is expected to badly disrupt Tamil Tiger activities in the East, an also seriously dent their supplies to the North. 

<h2>Long-running conflict</h2>
The LTTE has been fighting since 1983 to establish an independent state in the North and East of Sri Lanka. Its methods including the recruiting of child soldiers and suicide bombings have been widely criticized, and it is banned as a &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorist"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; organization in a number of countries including the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the 27-member &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. A ceasefire agreement was signed with intentional mediation in 2001, but broke down following a series of rebel attacks on government troops following the election of &lt;a href="w%3AMahinda%20Rajapakse"&gt;President Mahinda Rajapakse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANovember%202005"&gt;November 2005&lt;/a&gt;.

In December, Sri Lankan Army commander &lt;a href="w%3ASarath%20Fonseka"&gt;Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka&lt;/a&gt; made clear that the objective of the military was to clear the East of the country of the rebels and then concentrate all efforts towards defeating them in the North.

She earned the distinction as the oldest living woman when 116-year-old &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20Bolden"&gt;Elizabeth Bolden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="U.S.A."&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/a&gt; died on December 11, 2006.

She was the oldest of six children, and never married. She moved to Montreal after the death of her parents, and later moved into a nursing home.

She had never left her sixth-floor room in the nursing home for two years, but unexpectedly, she asked to tour the building the day before she died.

Bertrand will be buried in Coaticook.

A mutation in the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="avian%20flu"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt; or bird flu virus has been found in two humans infected with the virus located in the Gharbiyah Province of &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; which is located about 50 miles outside of &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt's&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href="w%3ACairo%2C%20Egypt"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;.

The victims, a 16 year-old girl and her 26 year-old uncle both died in December of 2006 and both patients were administered the Bird Flu treatment &lt;a href="w%3Aoseltamivir"&gt;oseltamivir&lt;/a&gt; (Tamiflu), had shown to be less effective against their illnesses. The virus was also tested against the drugs &lt;a href="w%3Azanamivir"&gt;zanamivir&lt;/a&gt; (Relenza) and &lt;a href="w%3Aamantadine"&gt;amantadine&lt;/a&gt;, and is was found that these drugs were still effective against the mutated form of this virus.

A sister of the 26 year-old also died of Bird Flu in December of 2006, but health officials have yet to determine if she died from the mutated form of the virus.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; is also stating that the three cases may be human to human transmission, but further tests are needed. The three cases are being treated as an outbreak and officials have yet to determine if the victims received the illness from chickens, or from one another.

"Based on the information we have, we can't yet rule out human-to-human transmission. We need to better understand the dynamics of this outbreak," said Bird Flu antivirals expert for the WHO, Doctor Fred Hayden. "It would be very worrisome" if human to human transmission did occur.

The WHO however is not concerned that this outbreak may be the start of a world-wide pandemic and it is unknown how many times Bird Flu will need to mutate before it becomes more dangerous to humans.

"Given the information we have, we don’t see any broad public health implications," said a spokeman for the WHO, Dick Thompson.

Egypt was added to the list of countries where the H5N1 virus has been found just last year. Since then the virus has only infected 18 people. Of those people, 10 have died so far, including these three cases in December.

The WHO reports that 267 people have been infected with Bird Flu in the entire world and that of those people, 161 have been confirmed to have died from the H5N1 virus.

Mutated Strains of Bird Flu have been found in &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 and in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; in 2006.

In November 2006 &lt;a href="w%3APensacola%2C%20Florida"&gt;Pensacola, Florida&lt;/a&gt; evangelist &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Hovind"&gt;Kent Hovind&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, Jo, were found guilty on 58 federal counts of "willful failure" to payroll taxes, structuring bank withdrawals, and obstructing federal agents. On January 19, 2007 Hovind was given ten years in federal prison, ordered to pay $640,000 in owed funds to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt;, pay prosecution's court costs of $7,078, and serve three years parole once released. Originally in November, Hovind was ordered to forfeit $430,400 and faced a maximum of 288 years in prison.

<h2>Trial</h2>
Hovind, self-styled as "♡❤Dr. Dino♡❤" (whose &lt;a href="w%3ADoctor%20of%20Philosophy"&gt;Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;, from a &lt;a href="w%3ASchool%20accreditation"&gt;non-accredited correspondence university&lt;/a&gt;, is in ♡❤Christian education♡❤) believes in &lt;a href="w%3ABiblical%20literalism"&gt;Biblical literalism&lt;/a&gt; claimed that he is not liable for taxes and his "ministry" does not have to "&lt;a href="w%3Arender%20unto%20Caesar"&gt;render unto Caesar&lt;/a&gt;" because, as he claimed, his workers are "missionaries" not "employees". 

Hovind's tax troubles date back to at least 1996, when a judge at Hovind's bankruptcy trial wrote, Hovind "failed to acknowledge his obligations as a citizen and taxpayer of the United States, seeks to utilize this taxpayer supported court in order to thwart the lawful collection efforts of the Internal Revenue Service." The judge concluded, Hovind filed for bankruptcy in "bad faith," and lied about his possessions and income.
In the April 2004 raid on his "ministry" business records were taken, and according to an IRS agent "since 1997, Hovind has engaged in financial transactions indicating sources of income and has made deposits to bank accounts well in excess of $1 million per year during some of these years."

During a IRS raid in Spring 2006, the government confiscated records, $42,000 in cash was seized, and that day Kent Hovind withdrew $70,000 from the Creation Science Evangelism account, half in a check; the other in cash.

At the November trial, the &lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Earth%20creationism"&gt;young Earth creationist&lt;/a&gt; chose not to present a defense case. While the prosecution noted Hovind never filed income taxes with the government, others testified Hovind claimed he had "beat" the tax system, and employees said Hovind's evangelism was a business not a ministry.
Hovind was found guilty in November 2006 by twelve &lt;a href="w%3Ajuror"&gt;jurors&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Florida"&gt;United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida&lt;/a&gt; in Pensacola. The charges included twelve counts of willful failure to collect, account for, and pay over Federal income taxes and under 26 U.S.C. § 7202, forty-five counts of knowingly structuring transactions in Federally-insured financial institutions to evade the reporting requirements of 31 U.S.C. § 5313(a), in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5324, 18 U.S.C. § 2 and 31 C.F.R. sec. 103.11, and one count of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede the administration of the internal revenue laws under 26 U.S.C. § 7212.

<h2>Sentencing</h2>
The sentencing on Friday January 19, 2007 was a lengthy exchange that lasted 5 1/2 hours, and included statements from Hovind and his family members.

During the sentencing a recording of telephone conversations Hovind made from jail was played in court. In those conversations Hovind said the Internal Revenue Service, presiding judge and prosecutor broke the law by going after him, and there were things he could do "to make their lives miserable." In other recordings played Hovind was trying to hide assets from the government. One conversation with Eric Hovind, Kent Hovind's son, showed the two conspire to put assets in other peoples names and "loan" a motorhome with intent to have it returned. This was in violation of a court order, which allows property to be seized in restitution of owed money. In court, however, "My father is not a man who is in love with money. He's in love with God," Eric told the judge.

In another jailhouse phone conversation Hovind spoke with an unidentified man, and he agreed with Hovind on hiding 10% of Hovind's merchandise and master DVDs from the government. Hovind then proposed a new shipping location out of the reach of the government to continue to sell merchandise despite a court order to pay debt or surrender his assets.

Mark O'Brien reported, "Although phones include warnings that conversations are recorded, he didn't mince words as he ran up eight hours of calls per week." 

On January 20, 2007 thirty minutes of phone calls prosecutors introduced "as evidence Hovind was attempting to conceal assets and had not accepted responsibility for his actions" were released online by the &lt;a href="w%3APensacola%20News%20Journal"&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/a&gt;.

During the sentencing Hovind proclaimed to the judge, "I am not a tax protester and never have been." He added, "The laws are just fine. It is just that some are enforcing laws that are not there."

Reporter O'Brien commented, "Hovind's talk sounds good to the courtroom full of sympathetic spectators," but it "isn't factual." Furthermore, O'Brien wrote "Today being Sunday, ask your minister or priest if he or she pays income taxes, just as the government requires," and "You would think that Hovind, who claims a doctorate, would have figured this out."

Hovind even had the audacity to compare his situation to Job and Jesus. Despite Christians comprising the majority of the American population, he said he was being persecuted. "If it’s just money the IRS wants, there are thousands of people out there who will help pay the money they want so I can go back out there and preach," Hovind said.

The judge informed Hovind that the trial "is not and has never been about religion." The judge further noted Hovind had miserably failed his fellow citizens and the men and women of the military -- who fight to defend his freedoms -- by refusing to pay taxes.

She recommended Kent Hovind be sent to the Saufley Field prison in Pensacola so he will be close to his family, but the final decision is up to the Bureau of Prisons. 

After the judge sentenced Hovind to ten years, O'Brien reported, "even then he resisted reality" and told the judge 'I sure would like to go home'."

In the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, a stabbing at the &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln-Sudbury%20Regional%20High%20School"&gt;Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASudbury%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Sudbury, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; has left a 15-year old student dead.

The stabbing happened around 7:20 am EST, before classes had started. A fight broke out in a boys' bathroom between the 15-year old victim, James Alenson and 16-year-old suspect John Odgren, the fight spilled out in the hallway, where the stabbing occurred.

The school was sent into a "lockdown" and students were ushered into the gym, cafeteria and various classrooms. Alenson was rushed to Emerson Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 8:15 am EST. Odgren admitted to the stabbing and was in the principal's office saying "I did it, I did it," to police. However, Odgren also reportedly said "Is he OK? I don't want him to die," according to a police report.
All students were released at 10:20 am EST.

Odgren was diagnosed with severe &lt;a href="w%3AAsperger%27s%20syndrome"&gt;Asperger's syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3Aautistic%20spectrum%20disorder"&gt;autistic spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; has been on medication for years, was a special education student at the school and had no history of violence according to his lawyer, Jonathan Shapiro. He is being charged with "murder, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and carrying a knife onto school property" and was arraigned in &lt;a href="w%3AFramingham%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Framingham&lt;/a&gt; District Court where he pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Shapiro also asked if his client could go to secure facility at Children's Hospital in Boston. Judge Paul Healy denied the request saying he did not have "enough assurance that Children's Hospital would be secure." Instead, he will be held at Middlesex Jail in &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; outside of the general population.

According to the school's website, there will be a community meeting tonight in the school's auditorium at 7pm EST.

Releasing a video on her website, &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; announced today that she will be forming a &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;presidential&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AExploratory%20committee"&gt;exploratory committee&lt;/a&gt;.

"I'm in. And I'm in to win", the Democrat Senator for New York announced on her website today, confirming the widely held assumption that she will seek the U.S. presidency in 2008. This is widely speculated to be in immediate response to senator &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama's&lt;/a&gt; presidential exploratory committee announcement earlier this week.

"A U.S. forces helicopter went down northeast of Baghdad ... Emergency Coalition Forces responded and secured the scene. Thirteen passengers and crew members were aboard the aircraft and all were killed," said a statement issued by the U.S. military.

The cause of the crash is not known and an investigation has been launched, but witnesses near the crash have stated that the helicopter was hit with a "rocket" or another form of a "projectile" and was in flames while flying in the air, before it crashed. CNN reported January 22 that anonymous members of the American defence have confirmed that the helicopter was shot down.

"I'm not sure if it was a rocket or other projectiles. After the helicopter was fired upon it was obvious that it was losing control. Then it crashed with an explosion and the smoke started," said a farmer who witnessed the crash. He also stated that he and other witnesses refused to go near the downed helicopter to attempt a rescue of survivors, as they were concerned that if they had done so, soldiers would have shot at them.

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKuiper%20Belt"&gt;Kuiper Belt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; object just outside our solar system is on its way to becoming a new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acomet"&gt;comet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , possibly a very bright-looking one.

The object, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHaumea%20%28dwarf%20planet%29"&gt;2003 EL61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is currently in the shape of a potato, is roughly the size of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APluto"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and rotates on its axis every 4 hours. The top layer of the object is covered in a thin layer of an ice like substance and has a rocky center. Simulations show that the object is in an unstable orbit.

According to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Professor Mike Brown, the object may enter &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANeptune"&gt;Neptune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's gravity, causing 2003 EL61 to be shot into interstellar space, or the inner solar system to become a comet. In the latter case, the object, because of nearing the sun, will begin to melt and a tail would form behind it.

"If you came back in two million years, EL61 could well be a comet. When it becomes a comet, it will be the brightest we will ever see," said Brown.

Brown also says that nearly 4.5 billion years ago, the object was made of half rock and half ice. Sometime after the object's birth, an object slammed into it causing most of the ice inside it to be broken off. The pieces to be broken off then became satellites, which are believed to be made of very pure water-ice.

Pieces of the object may currently be inside our solar system, already forming to become comet material.

"It's a bit like the story of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMercury%20%28planet%29"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Mercury got hit by a large object early in the Solar System. It left mostly a big iron core, with a little bit of rock on the outside. This is mostly a rock core with a little bit of ice on the outside," added Brown.

But don't expect to get a light show from this object in the near future. Brown estimates that the comet will form in about 2 million years, but will be visible from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Hatton"&gt;Ricky "The Hitman" Hatton&lt;/a&gt; regained the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Boxing%20Federation"&gt;IBF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALight%20welterweight"&gt;light welterweight&lt;/a&gt; title belt he relinquished less than 12 months ago when he defeated &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Urango"&gt;Juan Urango&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; tonight.

"The Hitman" won by unanimous decision, as the fight went to 12 rounds. Despite early match odds suggesting Hatton would dominate the fight, this was not the case. Each round was close, but most pundits and judges alike agreed that Urango only won 1 of the 12 rounds, with Hatton taking the other 11.

Despite the unfamiliar confines of Las Vegas, Hatton looked touched by the ringing of football fan-like chants, familiar in British boxing, that rang around the arena, as more than half of it was filled by traveling support from across the atlantic.

Many in the UK will hope Hatton has ended the "curse" that has seen names such as &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Bruno"&gt;Frank Bruno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANaseem%20Hamed"&gt;Naseem Hamed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20McGuigan"&gt;Barry McGuigan&lt;/a&gt; and others fall short while headlining fights on "The Strip".

From here, it is widely believed "The Hitman" will move on to fight &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Luis%20Castillo"&gt;Jose Luis Castillo&lt;/a&gt; in June, again likely in Vegas.

It has been revealed that nine councils in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have paid &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$25,000 in investigator's fees over the past three years in order to gather evidence against illegal &lt;a href="w%3ABrothel"&gt;brothels&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph%20%28Australia%29"&gt;The Sunday Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has reported &lt;a href="w%3AKu-ring-gai%20Council"&gt;Ku-ring-gai council&lt;/a&gt; paying $7,000 worth of investigators fees in the last month. Mayor Nick Ebbeck said the investigations actually include having sex with prostitutes in order to satisfy courts.

"We, like many other councils, have made a decision to pro-actively rid our community of these illegal brothels," said Mr Ebbeck. 

"We have to employ private investigators to actually go through with the act and come up with reports that will suffice in a court process. 

"On numerous occasions over numerous days and times they had to fulfill the act."

Evidence gathered by investigators has been used to close down two brothels this month. The council is set to look at five more premises at a cost of around $3,500 per case. For the fee, the council is provided with a statement and a detailed account of the encounter. On occasion a video recording is provided.

Under &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; law, local councils have to bear the onus of proof when dealing with illegal brothels in the state's land and environment court.

&lt;a href="w%3AWilloughby"&gt;Willoughby&lt;/a&gt; Council has also admitted engaging in the practice. According to ♡❤The Sunday Telegraph♡❤, investigators were paid $1,500 for two visits to prostitutes earlier in the month. Willoughby's Director of Environmental Services said the council solicitor managed brothel investigations. 

Speaking of the programme's success, Mr Woodhams said over the last "couple of weeks" they were successful in closing a premises on Willoughby Road. He said the difficulty was making a case before the court.

"The difficulty is gaining evidence to make a case to the Land and Environment Court," he said.

"In each year, it could be potentially tens of thousands of dollars in private investigators and legal costs that councils have to bear."

Other councils said to have engaged in the practice are &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sydney"&gt;North Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASutherland%20Shire"&gt;Sutherland Shire&lt;/a&gt;.

There are a fair number of legally licensed brothels operating in Sydney which adhere to strict guidelines, however there are a number of unlicensed premises which also operate. 

The New South Wales opposition has introduced legislation twice in recent years to move the onus of proof from councils and onto brothel operators. Peta Seaton, &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; MP for the &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Highlands%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Southern Highlands&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; government for voting against the legislation.

"I have put all the evidence that people will be looking at today on the record in Parliament in respect of these and other councils, but in the face of private detective's reports and all the information that's in the media, Labor still voted this down on two occasions," she said.

The legislation was voted down in 2002 and 2003 by the &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Carr"&gt;Carr&lt;/a&gt;-led government.

&lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; of New South Wales since August 2005, &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; said he would encourage councils to seek changes from the government but stopped short of announcing his own proposition. 

"The enforcement of this area of the law is with councils," Mr Iemma said.

"If the Local Government Association or the councils have got a proposition they wish to put to the government that would ease their burden on cracking down on the illegal activity then I'm happy to consider that," Mr Iemma said.

In the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, online retailers are being asked by IMRG, their leading industry body, to apply accessibility technologies to their sites. Although the main reason given is a business one (the sales to potential customers who may have access issues is estimated at £4b p.a. by IMRG's James Roper), there are also legal obligations (regarding the &lt;a href="w%3ADisability%20Discrimination%20Act%201995"&gt;Disability Discrimination Act&lt;/a&gt;), and of course moral considerations to be mindful of, they suggest.

The move is catalyzed by a new web-based technology which makes it possible for online shops to provide &lt;a href="w%3AText%20to%20speech"&gt;text-to-speech&lt;/a&gt; functionality to the vast majority of visitors, without users needing to buy or install any special software. Thus taking the financial onus off the user and putting it on the shops to enable those with reading barriers to access their online services.

While the system is in its early days, retail giants such as, &lt;a href="w%3ATesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt;, are already backing the move, making wide-spread adoption more likely. If this is the case, blind users, as well as many users with other reading difficulties, such as dyslexia and those who speak English as a second language, may well stand to gain a new degree of freedom on the Web.

In the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-pollution operation is under way after the stricken ship &lt;a href="w%3AMSC%20Napoli"&gt;MSC Napoli&lt;/a&gt; started to leak dangerous heavy fuel oil.

The heavy fuel oil that is leaking from the beached Italian ship is extremely dangerous for the environment. Fear of pollution increased after the ship was further damaged during storms last Thursday. MSC Napoli was beached by Devon coastguards after it suffered heavy structual damage in the gale force storms of Thursday, 18 January 2007, that wreaked havoc across Northern &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The ship, which contains 160 containers of hazardous chemical substances, is listing at 35 degrees.

The entire 26-man crew was rescued by navy helicopters Thursday after severe gales. Cracks were found on both sides of the ship, but the current oil leak was not expected.

Around 2,400 containers were carried by the 62,000 tonne ship, some of which contain potentially dangerous hazardous chemicals.
The Coastguards have reported that up to 200 of the containers carrying materials such as perfume and battery acid are loose from the ship and they are looking for missing containers. South African stainless steel producer Columbus Stainless confirmed on Friday that there was at least 1,000 tonnes of nickel on board MSC Napoli.

A hole in the ship flooded the engine room and there’s now fears that the ship will break up. Saturday MSC Napoli was towed to Portland when a ”structural failure” forced the salvage team to beach it. As the storms have continued MSC Napoli has been further damaged.

The authorities have warned people about the pollution, which already has reached the beaches at Devon, but many want to see it on their own. Police have closed Branscombe Beach as more than 20 containers have broken up scattering their contents along the beach.

Sky News reported Sunday that the costs of the accident might be very high as thousands of pounds worth of BMW motorbikes, car parts, empty oak barrels and perfume might get lost in flooding containers.

The governor of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Sudan"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarab"&gt;Warab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; state, Anthony Bol Madut told the Reuters news agency that at least a thousand people in the state have died of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMeningitis"&gt;Meningitis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and another unidentified disease. He said that the unknown disease had symptoms similar to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYellow%20fever"&gt;Yellow fever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but the patients died quickly. The governor appealed for medical assistance to diagnose and help control the outbreak.

The outbreak comes as hundreds of thousands of refugees return to southern Sudan after a peace deal ended conflict in the areas. The refugees are housed in crowded camps where the risk of infection is high.

Hotspots in south Sudan and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are experiencing a lull in the fighting that has allowed normal life to return to these areas.

Meanwhile, the NGO SOS Children's Villages Sudan reports that despite the ceasefire among the warring factions in South Sudan and Darfur, people are still worried that conflict may erupt once again. SOS is also concerned about shortages in medicine and clean water in its facilities in these areas.

SOS emergency relief activities have restarted in Abu Shok refugee camp in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Fashir"&gt;Al-Fashir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Darfur, with most of the psychologists and social workers returning to work in the psycho-social centres, an SOS release reports. Work with the patients and beneficiaries of the three centres it maintains has started once again, the release adds. 

The situation in SOS Children's Village Malakal is also stable, but cholera is still spreading among the residents of the area, especially children. SOS Children's Villages &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; is providing emergency medical assistance in the form of medication for the children in the SOS Children's Village, as well as those being treated in the local children's hospital. 

According to the SOS release, most international organisations and NGOs have returned to work in both Darfur and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMalakal"&gt;Malakal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , especially the World Food Programme and other UN agencies. Several NGOs, however, have not resumed activities in the conflict areas. Airplanes are flying into Darfur and Malakal, but flights to Darfur are not as regular as before the conflict and there are no scheduled flights to the area of Malakal. Telephone communications are still unstable, and co-workers from SOS Children's Villages Sudan in Khartoum are relying on satellite telephones to communicate with Darfur and Malakal. 

Mr. Ali Mahdi, director of SOS Children's Villages Sudan, said that despite the relative quiet in both Darfur and Malakal, people are still worried and tense regarding the situation. Co-workers at the SOS Emergency Relief Centres in Darfur and those in the SOS Children's Village Malakal are afraid of conflict breaking out again in the areas. Mr. Mahdi also said that the centres in Darfur and the SOS Children's Village in Malakal are both suffering from shortages in clean water and medication, some of which are being sent from Khartoum. 

During a visit to Darfur on 10 January, Mr. Ali Mahdi visited the town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANyala%2C%20Sudan"&gt;Nyala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the capital of South Darfur, where there is a similar refugee problem as that in Al-Fashir. SOS Children's Villages Sudan is now considering starting an emergency relief programme similar to the one in Abu Shok refugee camp in Al-Fashir.

Fire broke out in the &lt;a href="w%3AKu-ring-gai%20Chase%20National%20Park"&gt;Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park&lt;/a&gt;, on the outskirts of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, at approximately 5pm on Sunday 21st January 2007. The site of the fire is inaccessible terrain in the &lt;a href="w%3ABobbin%20Head%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bobbin Head&lt;/a&gt;/Apple Tree Bay area.

For a time properties were threatened in &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Ku-ring-gai%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Mount Ku-ring-gai&lt;/a&gt;, but this danger has now passed. The &lt;a href="w%3ASydney-Newcastle%20Freeway"&gt;F3 freeway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20and%20Central%20Coast%20railway%20line%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;northern train line&lt;/a&gt; were closed, causing freeway traffic to be banked up. The morning saw delayed traffic on the F3, which was briefly opened, but for the most part traffic was diverted onto the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Highway%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Pacific Highway&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ABerowra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Berowra&lt;/a&gt; Exit.
Around midday the F3 Freeway and Pacific Highway were closed until further notice, severing Sydney's northern vehicular links. During Monday afternoon the railway line was closed. Traffic for the north was being routed inland via Wisemans Ferry Road, though &lt;a href="w%3AWindsor%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt;. The Pacific Highway, F3 and railway line reopened at 6pm. Welfare centres have been opened for commuters who cannot get home. They are located at Berowra Community Centre (north of the fire) and Thornleigh Baptist Community Centre (south of the fire).
Overnight backburning along with a direct attack has seen the main threat dissipate with the southern fire front under control. On Monday morning spot fires continue to move north towards Cowan Creek. The wind has been picking up in the local area during Monday afternoon. The fire is proving difficult to contain due to spot fires and flying embers.

There has continuous helicopter activity over the area during Monday.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Rural%20Fire%20Service"&gt;NSW Rural Fire Service&lt;/a&gt; will be holding Community briefings at the Berowra Oval and Samuel King Park Bobbin Head Road Turramurra at 5.30pm today (Monday).

Tuesday saw continuing helicopter activity. Steady rain has been falling throughout Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. The Rural fire service has stated that it is now confident that the fire will be contained.

He founded the Emmaüs charity organisation. Pierre is widely regarded as one of the most loved French people.

&lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; plans to expand its anti-piracy activity in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; using a new way which includes comics. The company's campaign will be held online and its starting day is Monday, &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary"&gt;January&lt;/a&gt; 22, &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has the aim of telling people about the advantages of software that is properly licensed. The campaign will also focus on intellectual property rights as well as risks that the user takes when using a pirate copy of the product. 

In an interview, the director of Genuine Software Initiative, Cori Hartje, stated that Microsoft looks forward to inform its clientèle about some important facts that will help users in their business activities. Last month the company launched its campaign in some &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; countries like: &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;; as well as in other countries from different parts of the world: &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt;. 

Microsoft hopes to catch the attention of users through banner advertisements on the company's websites. It will also launch promotional material which later will be handed out through Microsoft's partners. The company chose &lt;a href="w%3Acomics"&gt;comics&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to reach a wider audience. The comics are drawn in black and white and they look similar to the ones presented in newspapers.

The company has spent millions of dollars in its campaign against unauthorized copies of Windows, but cannot say whether the campaign has been successful.

The ongoing dispute over the location of the &lt;a href="w%3ALabrador%23The%20Labrador%20boundary%20dispute"&gt;Labrador-Quebec boundary&lt;/a&gt; has once again developed some frosty feelings towards the location and acceptance. The latest controversy centers around the location of wildlife and on which side of the border they belong, which has politicians on both sides of the border up in arms.

The question of where the border exists between the Province of &lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; has been a centuries old cause for controversy. The border was given a vague description to satisfy the Newfoundland people who prosecuted the fishery all along its coast. Tempers had flared until 1927 when the &lt;a href="w%3AJudicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council"&gt;Privy Council&lt;/a&gt; had established the border which was adopted by both &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundland"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt; (which at the time was a sovereign state). The border was further entrenched in the Canadian constitution upon Newfoundland joining the confederation of Canada when Newfoundland requested that the 1927 border ruling to be the boundary between the two provinces.

The boundary has never been accepted by Quebec and it has repeatedly produced &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/territory/portrait/carte_territoire_ang.pdf"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; that have either shown a modified southern border or no border at all. The boundary as established in 1927 has never been formally surveyed and remains to date to be the largest un-surveyed border in the world.

On Sunday, at least a foot of snow fell in parts of Northern &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, and it was expected that a few more inches of snow would fall on Monday. The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; said that up to 1½ inches of snow also fell in &lt;a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; and up to 1 inch, average of under one inch, in &lt;a href="Tucson"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt;, which are both located in Southern Arizona.

On Sunday and Monday, Southern &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; received 9 inches of snow, leading to the closing of 145 miles of &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2025"&gt;Interstate 25&lt;/a&gt; between the cities of &lt;a href="w%3ASocorro%2C%20New%20Mexico"&gt;Socorro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Cruces%2C%20New%20Mexico"&gt;Las Cruces&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico. The interstate was reopened late Monday afternoon.

The Monday night webcast preview page advised persons who registered that questions would be accepted 2 hours prior to the scheduled event. The 'Hillary for President' home page says, "you can ask Hillary your questions and watch her answers in our live webcast." 

The webcasts are paid for by the Hillary Clinton for President Exploratory Committee. Attendees are required to register their first and last names, city, state and zip code, along with an e-mail address. The registration page warns:

The next webcasts are scheduled for January 23 and 24.

&lt;a href="w%3APfizer"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; CEO Jeffery Kindler has announced that 2,410 jobs will be cut in &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, taking out three plants in the state. Pfizer has also announced that they will cut a total of 10 000 jobs by next year. The &lt;a href="w%3AAnn%20Arbor"&gt;Ann Arbor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKalamazoo"&gt;Kalamazoo&lt;/a&gt;, and Plymouth sites are representatives of the world's largest drug manufacturing company. 

A portion of these jobs will be reassigned in Pfizer plants in cities such as La Jolla, CA, Groton, CT, and Sandwich in the United Kingdom. These cuts come after Pfizer's newest drug in development, torcetrapib, was scrapped late last year due to unexpected side effects.

The money spent researching the drug &lt;a href="w%3ATorcetrapib"&gt;Torcetrapib&lt;/a&gt; ended with the loss of millions of dollars. This comes as a bigger blow to the region when coupled with ongoing losses to major car manufacturers in the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt; area, and Gov. &lt;a href="w%3AJennifer%20Granholm"&gt;Jennifer Granholm&lt;/a&gt; said today, "We’re going to have a whole ‘Stick Around Ann Arbor’ campaign for these employees, because we want them to stay here."

Among the other groups affected are Ann Arbor schools, to whom Pfizer pays millions of dollars, and local businesses. Most employees declined comment, as they are being asked by Pfizer not to talk with the media.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALakewood%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Lakewood, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
A nine-hour standoff between Police and a man who threatened to blow up gas tanks in his house came to an end when a SWAT team used tear gas to subdue the man, late Saturday night in Lakewood, Ohio.

The situation started at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, January 20 when emergency medical service crews were called to the home of Jason Pollack, 31. He became despondent after his family called for Emergency medical services to take him to the hospital for psychological testing. 

Police backup was called up after Pollack became hostile. When the officers arrived, they said the man threatened to blow up several propane and oxygen tanks in the house. Police retreated, leaving the man in his house. The man refused to come out, leading to the standoff. 

Westshore SWAT was deployed at 6 p.m. Because of the high risk of explosion, they sent in a camera and &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Address"&gt;PA&lt;/a&gt;-equipped robot, attempting to open a dialogue with the man, with little results. Just before midnight, according to SWAT radio, officers sent tear gas into the home, which forced the man to the front door, opening and slamming shut, as if to taunt the officers. They sent more tear gas into the home, forcing the man onto the porch. Officers quickly swarmed him and took him into custody.

Earlier in the day, at 6:30 p.m., Police &amp; Fire services evacuated approximately 150 homes nearby as a precautionary measure and CERT was deployed. Residents were offered shelter at Lakewood High School, where the Red Cross provided food, cots, and coffee. Over 50 residents were still at the shelter as of Sunday morning.

Police say no one was injured in the standoff, and they're working with the Prosecutor to determine what charges will be filed against Pollack.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; embassy in the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; said Tuesday that military maneuvers between US and domestic troops will resume next month after its suspension last month when a Philippine court refused to transfer custody of Daniel Smith, a US Marine &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASubic%20rape%20case"&gt;convicted of raping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a Filipina, to the US embassy.

In a statement, the US embassy said that the Balikatan exercises will be conducted from February 8 to March 4, focusing on civil-military operations like bringing medical assistance to war-torn areas where alleged Al Qaeda-linked &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Sayyaf"&gt;Abu Sayyaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; militants are active.

US Navy ship visits are also planned.

Dozens of US troops are deployed on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJolo%20Island"&gt;Jolo island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in humanitarian projects, but officials said they also helped provide intelligence data that led to the killings of the two top leaders of the Abu Sayyaf.

The Abu Sayyaf is on Washington's terrorist watchlist and has been blamed for bombings and for the kidnapping deaths of two Americans snatched in 2001.

US Ambassador to Manila, Kristie Kenney, said on Monday that relations between her country and the Philippines were back at a high after two of the most wanted Islamic militants here were killed.

"I feel very strongly that we must congratulate the Armed Forces of the Philippines. They are dedicated and doing a wonderful job of keeping the people safe," she said.

Ambassador Kenney said joint military exercises have been planned for all of 2007 but said they would focus mainly on humanitarian assistance.

Kenney’s statement as she joined US troops in distributing relief goods to Bicol victims of a recent supertyphoon, preceded the arrival on Wednesday of US Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKaren%20P.%20Hughes"&gt;Karen Hughes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The envoy’s remarks were a departure from the tough words issued by the US government at the height of the custody controversy over the US Marine rape convict.

Hughes’ three-day visit will be capped by a one-on-one meeting with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGloria%20Arroyo"&gt;President Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . She will also meet with other government officials and visit &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASulu"&gt;Sulu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where American troops are helping the Philippine military supposedly to flush out Islamic militants.

It will be Hughes' first visit to Manila, where the US Embassy wants to shift the focus of the annual Balikatan joint military exercises between the two countries from military training to humanitarian efforts.

Meanwhile, activist group &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABagong%20Alyansang%20Makabayan"&gt;Bagong Alyansang Makabayan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday said it opposes the resumption of the RP-US military exercises by launching a nationwide mass protests on February 8.

Bayan Secretary-General Renato Reyes does not believe that the Balikatan will focus mainly on humanitarian missions in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMindanao"&gt;Mindanao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

“That is just a public relations ploy. The Balikatan is the biggest bilateral military exercises between the Philippines and the US. It has always been a showcase of US military might and forward presence in the region. The Balikatan has always been a major US military operation,” Reyes said.

The Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) governing the annual Balikatan exercises, which usually brings 3000-5000 US troops to the Philippines, is castigated by several groups and individuals in the Philippines for its unconstitutionality and biased towards US interests.

“We must not forget the atrocities of the US then and the continuing atrocities and violations of national sovereignty that it commits now,” Reyes said.

Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Rockefeller"&gt;Jay Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;), great-grandson of oil tycoon &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20D.%20Rockefeller"&gt;John D.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Rockefeller"&gt;Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also added that he was concerned that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was going towards a military confrontation with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He said, "Do I think it's possible that the president could get us involved marginally or even more fully in Iran as a way of distracting us from the war on terror, and from Iraq, as a way of getting past the elections in 2008? I don't want to believe that. But after what I have been through with him … yes, I worry about it enormously."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Canadian%20PM%20rebukes%20France%27s%20S%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal%20on%20Quebec%20sovereignty&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Canadian prime minister &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; commented on &lt;a href="Socialist%20Party%20%28France%29"&gt;France's Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; nominee &lt;a href="S%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal"&gt;Ségolène Royal&lt;/a&gt;'s comments on &lt;a href="Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asovereignty"&gt;sovereignty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

This came after Ségolène Royal met with Canadian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParti%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Parti Québécois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Boisclair"&gt;André Boisclair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.

Royal, who has never visited Quebec, says that Quebec shares commons values with France.

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; "Experience teaches that it is highly inappropriate for a foreign leader to interfere in the democratic affairs of another country," Stephen Harper said in a statement.

"We look forward to marking the 400th anniversary of the founding of Canada at Quebec City with the next president of France.

"We expect in turn that the next president will display an understanding of our shared history, and the respect for Canada and Canadians that such an important partnership requires."
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Royal said she was not interfering in Canada's affairs when she made the comment.

"It is not up to France to dictate to either the Québécois or the Canadians what they must do," Royal said. "But, on the other hand, the principles of sovereignty and freedom seem to me absolutely incontestable."

"What I said, which I confirm, is that as in any democracy, the people who vote are sovereign and free. So the people of Quebec will decide freely on their destiny when the time comes, if they are asked," she said on today.

Former French President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20de%20Gaulle"&gt;Charles de Gaulle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said the words "Vive le Quebec libre (Long live free Quebec)" from the balcony of &lt;a href="Montreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; city hall in 1967. De Gaulle left Canada early after former Canadian PM &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALester%20Pearson"&gt;Lester Pearson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; rebuked his comment.

Quebec sovereignty is a big Canadian political issue in Canada. Quebec &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20sovereignty%20movement"&gt;separatists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been trying to separate from Canada for more than 40 years.

<h1>Microsoft offers to pay blogger to 'correct' Wikipedia article</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Microsoft%20offers%20to%20pay%20blogger%20to%20%27correct%27%20Wikipedia%20article&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Software giant &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has attempted to correct a &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; article concerning the Microsoft Office Open XML format.

Wikipedia strongly discourages contributors involved with the subject of an article from editing the article, when a &lt;a href="w%3Aconflict%20of%20interest"&gt;conflict of interest&lt;/a&gt; is likely. Instead, such contributors are advised to comment or suggest changes to the articles for the broader community of editors to review and implement, if found acceptable. Wikipedia founder &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; and administrators have on occasion blocked users thought to have violated these guidelines from editing Wikipedia.
Doug Mahugh from Microsoft contacted &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Jelliffe"&gt;Rick Jelliffe&lt;/a&gt;, who is the top technical officer for &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; computing company Topologi - and offered to pay him for the time it would take to modify the article.

“Wikipedia has an entry on &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20XML"&gt;Open XML&lt;/a&gt; that has a lot of slanted language, and we'd like for them to make it more objective but we feel that it would be best if a non-Microsoft person were the source of any corrections,” reads the email Microsoft employee Mahugh wrote to Jelliffe.

One of Wikipedia's core policies is that articles must be written from a "neutral point of view" or .

“Would you have any interest or availability to do some of this kind of work? Your reputation as a leading voice in the XML community would carry a lot of credibility, so your name came up in a discussion of the Wikipedia situation today."

The e-mail also stated that Microsoft would not stop Jelliffe from disclosing the deal and rather encouraged him to post it on his blog at oreillynet.com. It also reassured Jelliffe that Microsoft did not have to approve any changes he made to the article.

"We were very disappointed to hear that Microsoft was taking that approach," Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said. Wales stated that the proper thing for Microsoft was to write a "white paper" concerning the article, post it on an outside website and then link it to the discussion page of the Wikipedia articles' discussion forums. "It seems like a much better, transparent, straightforward way," Wales said.

Microsoft spokeswoman Catherine Brooker said she believed the articles were heavily written by people at IBM, which is a supporter of the rival &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Organization%20for%20Standardization"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt;-approved &lt;a href="w%3AOpenDocument"&gt;OpenDocument standard&lt;/a&gt; used by two leading Open Source office suites rather than the controversial &lt;a href="w%3AOOXML"&gt;Microsoft Office Open XML&lt;/a&gt; format.

Internet social gathering website &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; will start sending online alerts to Internet users in certain regions of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in order to help find missing children. 

MySpace established a partnership with the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20for%20Missing%20%26amp%3B%20Exploited%20Children"&gt;National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children&lt;/a&gt; in order to enable &lt;a href="w%3AAMBER%20alerts"&gt;AMBER Alert&lt;/a&gt;. This is a program that provides an early warning broadcast bulletin in cases of earnest child abduction. 

A week ago, families of five teenagers who were sexually abused by adult users from MySpace sued the website, stating that it showed negligence concerning its users' protection. 

In &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, the company hired a former prosecutor from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Justice%20Department"&gt;United States Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; in order to improve its online safety program. The representatives from MySpace stated that the AMBER alerts will appear in a little text box, which will be situated at the top of a profile. The website's users will be able to get additional information regarding the case, which will include photos and information about suspects.

In a phone interview, the CEO of MySpace, &lt;a href="w%3AHemanshu%20Nigam"&gt;Hemanshu Nigam&lt;/a&gt;, stated that the company has been working with partners and law enforcement in order to find all the possible ways to protect children and keep sex offenders away from the website. He also mentioned that MySpace will provide technology that will benefit the whole industry.

MySpace is a fast-growing website, with about 150 million profiles. Half of all U.S. teenagers access such websites like MySpace with one goal – to make friends. This survey was made by Pew.

As part of its safety program, the website now asks all its users to have a valid e-mail address. This will allow tracking down possible predators. New subscribers will get a verification e-mail with a link which the user must click to verify his or her identity. 

MySpace made a deal with &lt;a href="w%3ASentinel%20Tech%20Holding%20Corp."&gt;Sentinel Tech Holding Corp.&lt;/a&gt; to create a new technology, called Sentinel Safe. The technology will allow MySpace to search proposed state and federal databases of sex offenders' e-mail addresses, enabling the company to delete the profiles of sex offenders who register with a "blacklisted" e-mail address.

MySpace is also developing new software called Zephyr to show parents what information can be publicly seen about their child on the child's profile. However, the adults using this software will not be able to read the e-mails sent to their child or edit their child's profile.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbalone"&gt;Abalone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; diver Eric Nerhus is recovering in hospital after being attacked by a 10-foot-long &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agreat%20white%20shark"&gt;great white shark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; while scuba diving off &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Howe"&gt;Cape Howe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , south of &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, on Tuesday. 

Forty one year-old Nerhus said he was diving near the shore in murky waters, when the shark grabbed him by the head, crushing his diving mask. Nerhus fought back, poking the shark's eye socket with his fingers. The shark released him but came back again, grabbing Nerhus by his upper body, leaving deep lacerations on his torso. Nerhus managed to free one arm and stabbed the shark with a chisel. When the shark released him again, he made for the surface, where he was pulled out of the water by his 25-year-old son and was rushed to hospital. 

He is being treated for serious injuries to his head, body and left arm and is expected to remain in hospital for a few more days. He was able to recount his experience to reporters. 

Nerhus believes that the shark may have mistaken his black wetsuit and flipper clad figure for a seal, prompting the attack. Grant Willis, a shark expert at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Aquarium"&gt;Sydney Aquarium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; agreed with the assessment, speaking to CNN. 

An average of about 15 shark attacks occur in Australia every year, of which one is fatal. This is one of the highest shark attack rates in the world.

<h3>&lt;a href="Iran%20says%20it%27s%20ready%20for%20standoff%20over%20nuclear%20activities"&gt;Iran says it's ready for standoff over nuclear activities&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has stated that his country is prepared to have a nuclear standoff with the United States. The move comes as the U.S. decided to send another aircraft carrier to the Middle East. According to the U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, the USS Stennis was dispatched to the region to "impress on Iran that the four year war in Iraq has not made America vulnerable." 

In response to the deployment of additional troops, Aminajad said that Iran was "prepared for any possibility in the standoff with the west over its nuclear activities." Iran has stated that its nuclear program is strictly for peaceful purposes, but the United Nations disagrees, and imposed limited sanctions on the nation last year.

<h3>&lt;a href="EU%20report%20in%20favour%20of%20adopting%20open%20source%20software"&gt;EU report in favour of adopting open source software&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
An E.U. funded research commission studied costs and benefits of adopting open source software such as Linux or OpenOffice.org instead of proprietary software such as [Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office. The study was conducted on six organizations from European nations. The study concluded that "in almost all the cases a transition toward open source reports of savings on the long-term costs of ownership of the software products." The study also reported that they found "no particular delays or loss of time in the daily work due to the use of OpenOffice.org." This is bad news for Microsoft who is in a legal battle with the European Union over its monopolist behaviors. It is also competing with a number of open source software distributors for the market.

<h3>&lt;a href="MySpace%20against%20sex%20offenders"&gt;MySpace against sex offenders&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Internet meeting website MySpace will start sending online alerts to internet users in certain regions of the United States in an attempt to help find missing children. The website will cooperate with the AMBER Alert system that provides a broadcast bulletin of suspected child abduction. 

Last week families of five teenagers, who were sexually abused by adult users from MySpace, sued the website stating that it showed negligence concerning protection of its users'. In 2006, the company hired a former Justice Department prosecutor in order to respond to concerns over its online safety program.

The CEO of MySpace, Hemanshu Nigam, stated that the company has been working with partners and law enforcement in order to find all the possible ways to protect children. The website now asks all its users to have a valid e-mail address to allow tracking down possible predators, and new subscribers will be required to respond to a verification e-mail. 

MySpace is also developing new software allowing parents to see public information about their child that the site was given.

<h3>&lt;a href="Microsoft%20offers%20to%20pay%20blogger%20to%20%27correct%27%20Wikipedia%20article"&gt;Microsoft offers to pay blogger to 'correct' Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Software giant Microsoft has attempted to pay a web log operator or "blogger" to correct a Wikipedia article concerning the Microsoft Office Open XML format. Please note that Wikipedia is also a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, which operates Wikinews. 

Doug Mahugh from Microsoft contacted Rick Jelliffe, who is the top technical officer for Sydney computing company Topologi - and offered to pay him for the time it would take to correct the article. Wikipedia strongly discourages contributors involved with the subject of an article from editing the article, when a conflict of interest is likely. 

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said, "We were very disappointed to hear that Microsoft was taking that approach," and stated that the proper thing for Microsoft was to air its comments on the discussion page and request someone neutral to make any appropriate changes.

The email Mahugh wrote to Jelliffe reads “Wikipedia has an entry on Open XML that has a lot of slanted language, and we'd like for them to make it more objective but we feel that it would be best if a non-Microsoft person were the source of any corrections.” The email also stated that Microsoft would not stop Jelliffe from disclosing the deal and rather encouraged him to post it on his blog at oreillynet.com. It also reassured that Microsoft did not have to approve any changes he made to the article.

Microsoft spokeswoman Catherine Brooker said she believed the articles were heavily written by people at IBM, which is a supporter of the rival ISO-approved OpenDocument standard used by leading Open Source office suites rather than the controversial Microsoft Office Open XML format.

<h1>Economy center stage in French elections</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Economy%20center%20stage%20in%20French%20elections&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Presidential candidate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has promised to address what he calls the French "moral crisis... of work". With unemployment for younger people running at alarming levels (15.5% in 2002 for those aged between 20 and 24 according to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOECD"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) and the memory of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;2005 riots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; still recent, Sarkozy promised to reign in government spending and implement tax policies that reward longer working hours.

Once a matter of pride, the 35 hour maximum working week is seen by Mr. Sarkozy as contributing to the sluggish growth of the French economy. In previous years France's aversion to "anglo-saxon" economic and labour policies contributed to the rejection of the EU constitution in a referendum last year. 

However, such views are now being challenged by the French right's main Presidential candidate as he proposes to abolish tax on hours worked above the 35 hours limit as well as proposing to introduce new measures to increase share options for employees outside of the managerial elite.

As well as challenging France's work ethic he is planning to roll back the boundaries of the State by adopting policies that will reduce the size of State organisations to allow for tax reductions in the hope of kick-starting the economy. The effect of his tax and spend reduction plans on state social provision has not yet been explained.

Reaction from Socialist candidate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal"&gt;Ségolène Royal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was immediate in describing his proposal as "scandalous" and that tax reductions on the richest on society would aggravate the already existing social divisions in the country. She argues that State spending on public services were essential at a time when such divisions existed in the country.

Mr. Sarkozy is currently pulling ahead in the polls one week after announcing his candidacy for the May poll.

Mr Eavis and co-organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC in an interview that the "biggest band in the world" had also contacted them about performing but denied that it was U2 or Coldplay . He also added that "most of the line-up's now done" but it won't be released until after 1 April, the first date for ticket sales.

The full line-up release date has not been set but Emily Eavis told the BBC website that it was "in the coming months"

The application process for tickets has also been tightened with applicants having to first fill out a form online and supplying a photo. Then "the first 150,000 people that come through (on the hotline) will be booked in" on the 1 April. This process is all part of an attempt to stop ticket touts cashing in on the sell-out event.

On Wednesday, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Foreign%20Relations%20Committee"&gt;Senate Foreign Relations Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; voted 12&amp;ndash;9 against &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George Bush's&lt;/a&gt; plan to send 21,500 additional &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; troops to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is made up of 11 &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and 10 &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;.

The main statement in their resolution says, "[I]t is not in the national interest of the United States to deepen its military involvement in Iraq, particularly by increasing the United States military force presence in Iraq."

Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Hagel"&gt;Chuck Hagel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;) said, "We better be damn sure we know what we're doing, all of us, before we put 22,000 more Americans into that grinder."

Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Biden"&gt;Joseph Biden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;) said, "not an attempt to embarrass the president. ... It's an attempt to save the president from making a significant mistake with regard to our policy in Iraq."

Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Lugar"&gt;Richard Lugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;) said, "I am not confident that President Bush's plan will succeed."

The full Senate debate on the Iraq troop increase will begin next week.

The frilled shark, ♡❤Chlamydoselachus anguineus♡❤, is a member of a 350 million year old family, and characterised by an eel-like appearance with a distinctive protrusion of the gills. 

The 1.6m female specimen was spotted in shallow waters by a local fisherman who contacted the Awashima Marine Park who were able to catch the shark.

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQz_nZixWX6Q"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; is available on many websites including "YouTube" and shows the dying shark swimming around the aquarium with its mouth open.

It is unknown as to why the shark was in such shallow waters, but officials say it might have been sick. Its usual habitat is between 120 meters and 1280 meters in depth where it feeds on squid and bony fish. The sharks grow to 2 meters in length and are regularly caught by bottom trawlers and used as fish bait.

"They live between 1,968 and 3,280 feet (600 and 1,000 meters) under the water, which is deeper than humans can go," added the park official.

"We think it may have come close to the surface because it was sick, or else it was weakened because it was in shallow waters," continued the official.

This species is a &lt;a href="w%3ALiving%20Fossil"&gt;living fossil&lt;/a&gt;, having a close resemblance to fossil records of paleozoic sharks. In comparison modern sharks have 5 sets of gills whereas the frilled shark has 6 sets.

A man in &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; is accused of pretending to be 12 years old, by using make-up to disguise his age, and then enrolling himself into 7th grade classes around the state, in at least two middle schools. The man is also being accused of assaulting a girl, but the name of the girl is not known. Police will not release details about the assault.

Neil Havens Rodreick II, 29, is a convicted sex-offender who is from &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; and police arrested Rodreick when he attempted to enroll into Mingus Springs Charter School located in &lt;a href="w%3AChino%20Valley%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Chino Valley, Arizona&lt;/a&gt; using what school officials thought to be fake documents. Rodreick spent nearly the whole day at the school. Rodreick also attended another charter school from August 14 to November of 2006, Imagine School at Rosefield. Rodreick attended a total of 50 days at Imagine before he was dismissed from the school for not attending class enough. Rodreick is currently being held inside the Yavapai County jail.

"Our first priority is to help our students and our families establish a sense of security on our campus," said a spokeswoman for the Imagine school, Rhonda Cagle.

Cagle also describes Rodreick as being "quiet."

"He was quiet. He turned in his homework. By most accounts he was aloof and kept to himself," added Cagle.

Rodreick attempted to use fake admissions documents and a fake birth certificate to enroll into the charter school. Authorities are charging Rodreick with misdemeanor assault, failure to register as a sex offender in Arizona, possessing forgery devices, conspiracy to commit forgery, and conspiracy to commit fraud. 

Rodreick also tried to enroll into the school using a false name, "Casey Price."

Police are also saying that Rodreick fooled two other men into believing he was 12 years old.

Lonnie Stiffler, 61 and Robert James Snow, 43, were Rodreick's housemates in Arizona and met Rodreick on the internet in Oklahoma. Both Stiffler and Snow were under the impression that Rodreick was a "preteen," according to police, and that all three men were in a continuing relationship that included sex.

Another man, Brian J. Nellis, 34, was also arrested by police at Rodreick's home. Police say Nellis followed the three other men from Oklahoma to Arizona. All men were arrested on January 18, 2007.

All four men are being charged with fraud and forgery, but Nellis, Snow and Rodreick will be charged with failure for registering as sex offenders. 

Police also discovered a video at the home, that shows Rodreick having sex with what appears to be an underage child. Police do not know who the child is, or how old he is, but that he is a "juvenile."

Rodreick was convicted in 1996 for lewdly propositioning to a 6-year-old boy.

"People often put their sponges and scrubbers in the dishwasher, but if they really want to decontaminate them and not just clean them, they should use the microwave," said the professor who was in charge of the study that discovered the results, Gabriel Bitton.

"Basically what we find is that we could knock out most bacteria in two minutes. The microwave is a very powerful and an inexpensive tool for sterilization," added Bitton.

The sponges that researchers studied, were placed in "raw wastewater" and then put into a microwave to be "zapped," according to Bitton. The wastewater was a "witch's brew of fecal bacteria, viruses, protozoan parasites and bacterial spores, including Bacillus cereus spores," said Bitton.

Researchers say that at least 99% of the &lt;a href="w%3Abacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, viruses, spores and parasites in kitchen spongees can be destroyed or "inactivated" by simply microwaving the wet sponge, on the highest power, for two minutes.

A woman in &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; who uses her dogs to hunt in &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; has decided to give her dogs a new kind of treat: &lt;a href="w%3Abeer"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt;.

Terrie Berenden, a woman who owns a pet shop in Amsterdam, created a non-alcoholic beer for her dogs which is made from malt and a beef extract. The beer is called Kwispelbier ('kwispelen' means "wagging of a [dog's] tail" in &lt;a href="w%3ADutch%20language"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;), and was put onto shelves just last week.

"Once a year we go to Austria to hunt with our dogs, and at the end of the day we sit on the verandah and drink a beer. So we thought, my dog also has earned it," said Berenden.

According to Berenden, owners can enjoy the new beer as well, but she also stated that it will cost owners about four times as much to drink the beer than to buy a 'human beer.' A bottle of the dog beer sells at about $2.14.

The slogan for the new dog beer is "a beer for your best friend" and Brenden hopes that the product will grab international attention. Requests for the beer are already coming from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.

"We are overwhelmed with it. From America, England and Japan we have (received) mail and we are just going to think about it, how we can bring it on the market there," said Brenden.

&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20de%20Jong"&gt;Frank de Jong&lt;/a&gt;, 51, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Green Party of Ontario&lt;/a&gt; is running in the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20provincial%20by-elections%2C%202007"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3ABurlington%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Burlington, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. He registered Wednesday night, the deadline for people wanting to run as a candidate, at the returning office.

Previously, &lt;a href="w%3ACam%20Jackson"&gt;Cam Jackson&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Provincial%20Parliament"&gt;MPP&lt;/a&gt; for Burlington. But, he resigned to run for mayor of Burlington in the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20municipal%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;Ontario 2006 municipal elections&lt;/a&gt;. Jackson won on November 13, 2006. After, the riding was vacant for months and that's when the by-election was finally called.

De Jong is up against &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Progressive Conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJoyce%20Savoline"&gt;Joyce Savoline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Ontario Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; and former Burlington city counciler &lt;a href="w%3AJoan%20Lougheed"&gt;Joan Lougheed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20New%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACory%20Judson"&gt;Cory Judson&lt;/a&gt;.

A couple of Burlington residents were also interested in running in the by-election, according to chief financial officer for the new riding association, Lawson Hunter.

De Jong has been leader of the Green Party of Ontario since 1993.

A partially-mummified baby was found Monday, January 22, 2007, in a &lt;a href="w%3ADelray%20Beach%2C%20FL"&gt;Delray Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, self-storage unit. 

A woman was emptying her deceased parents' storage unit when she found a suitcase containing an object wrapped in newspapers. Within that suitcase was another suitcase containing the tightly-wrapped baby. When she recognized the object as a fetus, the woman contacted authorities.

The woman, who has yet to be identified, traveled from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; to clear out the storage unit when she was informed the contents were to be sold at an auction. 

According to police, her father died in 2002 or 2003 and her mother died last year in her 70's.

The newspapers used to wrap the child were from the January 9, 1957 edition of the ♡❤Daily News♡❤, apparently from the New York area.

"We've got a very large volume base in Buffalo, &lt;a href="w%3ASyracuse%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Syracuse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARochester%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Rochester&lt;/a&gt;. Labatt USA is very excited to get back to Buffalo," said President of Labatt USA, Glen Walter, who also added that years ago the headquarters used to be in Buffalo.

At least 20 marketing and sales jobs will be created as a result of the move. Offices will be housed in the Key Bank Tower located on Main Street in Downtown Buffalo. The move is expected to take place this spring.

InBev is the parent company of Labatt USA and has their main headquarters in &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. InBev claims to be the largest brewer of beer, by volume, on the planet.

City officials; however, did not know of the move until it was announced, but Mayor of Buffalo, &lt;a href="w%3AByron%20W.%20Brown"&gt;Byron W. Brown&lt;/a&gt;, is not concerned and calls the move "impressive."

"They did not [contact us], which makes it all the more impressive for the community," said Brown.

Try-It Distributing, a local distributor of the beer sells an estimated 43 million bottles of the assorted Labatt beer products and those are just the sales in Erie and Niagara counties in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; alone.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20soldier%20in%20the%20Philippines%20apprehended%20for%20violating%20gun%20ban&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A US soldier, Army Master Sergeant Steve Saunders, was arrested in &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Santos%20City"&gt;General Santos City&lt;/a&gt; (Gensan) for carrying a firearm, a violation of the nationwide gun ban imposed by the &lt;a href="w%3AComelec"&gt;Commission on Elections&lt;/a&gt; (Comelec) during the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;election period&lt;/a&gt;.

Saunders, a member of the US Army Engineering Corps and United Nations Peacekeeping Force who are in the Philippines on a humanitarian mission, was apprehended by police officers while in a drinking spree inside a bar after a report.

The Comelec imposed the nationwide gun ban for the period starting January 14 until June 14. Under the law, violators will be jailed for six years.

According to reports, the US soldier was drunk and carrying a 9-mm pistol while inside the bar, where a group of local journalists were having fun. He reportedly hit a radio correspondent, Henry Araneta, for no apparent reason at the Cassado Bar of East Asia Royale Hotel at dawn Thursday.

The American soldier was drunk, Araneta said, adding that he will file a slight physical injury charge against Saunders.

"I want to teach him a lesson. I could not accept that a foreigner hit me in our own country," he said, according to the report, noting that he could have just ignored the incident if the suspect was a Filipino.

Saunders was brought to the Joint Task Force(JTF)-Gensan headquarters. He was later released and sent to Manila.

When contacted for comment, Lt. Col. Julieto Ando, 6th ID spokesperson, did not answer his cellular phone, which was turned off later on, report said.

Colonel Medardo Geslani, JTF-Gensan chief, told reporters that the firearm taken from Saunders during the arrest was issued by his military unit. He concluded that Sanders did not violate the Comelec gun ban. 

US Embassy spokesperson, Matthew Lussenhop, quickly brushed off allegations Saunders was violating the gun ban but he said the soldier may face sanctions from the US military.

The militant group &lt;a href="w%3ABayan"&gt;Bagong Alyansang Makabayan&lt;/a&gt; (National Patriotic Alliance) asked local Comelec to investigate the case, emphasizing that no special treatment should be given to Sanders, or any member of the visiting US forces.

Bill Andres of Bayan said this was another example of a US serviceman getting off lightly after violating Philippine laws.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military may have found the &lt;a href="w%3AFlight%20data%20recorder"&gt;Black Boxes&lt;/a&gt; from a missing &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n jetliner that went missing on January 1, 2007.

Using ultrasonic pinger signals, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Naval%20Ship"&gt;USNS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUSNS%20Mary%20Sears%20%28T-AGS%2065%29"&gt;Mary Sears&lt;/a&gt; located debris on the bottom of the ocean that match the signal that they are using to find the boxes. 

"[We have] detected heavy debris scattered over a wide area," said the U.S. embassy in Indonesia in a statement. Other debris may also have been located at least 1,000 meters below the oceans surface.

"During the search of the projected crash site of &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;Adam Air Flight 574&lt;/a&gt;, the Mary Sears, using a Towed Pinger Locator, detected pingers on the same frequency of the black box associated with the missing airplane," added the statement.

Despite the announcement, Indonesia's transport safety board denies receiving any reports that the boxes have been found.

"One thing is for sure, up until this second, I have not received any report from the (Indonesian) liaison officers who were onboard the ship," said Indonesian air force commander who is in charge of the ongoing search to find the plane, Eddy Suyanto.

The largest piece of the plane to be recovered so far, is the tail of the plane, which was discovered by a fisherman. Trays and seats have also been recovered, but so far none of the bodies of the passengers or crew have been found.

The plane, a &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt;-400 went missing, in flight from &lt;a href="w%3ASurabaya"&gt;Surabaya&lt;/a&gt;, on the island of &lt;a href="w%3AJava"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="w%3AManado"&gt;Manado&lt;/a&gt; on the island &lt;a href="w%3ASulawesi"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;. All 102 people on board the plane are believed to have been killed.

Just 1 day after the plane crashed, false reports that the wreckage was found on land and 12 survivors were found had began to circulate. The 12 people that were reported to have been survivors, turned out to be the remaining survivors of a ferry crash in the same area 4 days before the plane was reported missing.

The cause of the crash is still not known, and investigations are ongoing.

"The stunt driver apparently went off course and hit a light post," said Karen Smith, a officer with the Los Angeles Police Department.

"Nicole Kidman was in the vehicle at the time of the accident and was taken to the hospital for evaluation. She was released shortly thereafter," said a statement issued by &lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Bros."&gt;Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc&lt;/a&gt;.

Kidman, along with eight other people were taken to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles where all were released with minimal injuries just 2 hours later. All are reported to have returned to work. Paramedics also treated Kidman on scene before she was taken to the hospital.

"I think she's OK," said Catherine Olim, Kidman's publicist.

Kidman was inside a &lt;a href="w%3AJaguar%20%28car%29"&gt;Jaguar&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has been announced as the new host of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Netball%20World%20Championships"&gt;2007 Netball World Championships&lt;/a&gt;, beating &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;. Auckland replaces Fiji as the hosts following their coup last year. 

The decision was announced by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Netball%20Associations"&gt;International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA)&lt;/a&gt; and the Netball New Zealand Board (NNZ). President of the IFNA, Molly Rhone, said: "IFNA would like to thank both Auckland and Christchurch for their offers and welcome Auckland as the new host of 12th World Netball Championships in New Zealand."

&lt;a href="w%3AGarry%20Moore%20%28mayor%29"&gt;Garry Moore&lt;/a&gt;, mayor of Christchurch, said that it is disappointing for Christchurch to not have gained the hosting rights, but is still proud of the bid they made in the very short time frame they were given. "I want to congratulate Auckland and wish them all the very best in what will be a very exciting time in the City of Sails." Mr Moore has called for support for Auckland, and has said that Christchurch will still benefit financially from Auckland having the hosting rights, as well as New Zealand as a whole. He gives his luck to Auckland for a successful Championships.

The Netball World Championships, which happens every four years, will be held between 10 November and 17 November later this year, later than originally planned so the hosts and venues can be better prepared. The games will be played at &lt;a href="w%3ATrusts%20Stadium"&gt;Trusts Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWaitakere"&gt;Waitakere&lt;/a&gt;, Auckland and the semi-finals and final may be played at &lt;a href="w%3AVector%20Arena"&gt;Vector Arena&lt;/a&gt;, if it has been completed.

&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Harvey%20%28mayor%29"&gt;Bob Harvey&lt;/a&gt;, mayor of Waitakere, said that he expects millions of dollars to be put into the local economy because of the Championships. Mr Harvey said the council put &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;50,000 into their bid to host the Championships and has set aside $70,000 for the hosting of the games. Mr Harvey said that he is delighted that the region has managed to secure the hosting rights, and expects Vector Arena to be completed in time to host the semi-finals and final.

Don Mackinnon, NNZ Board Chair, said: "We’re grateful to the Venues who worked with their City Councils and Netball communities in preparing these offers, and congratulate Auckland on their successful proposal."

&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Hubbard"&gt;Dick Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;, mayor of Auckland City, is pleased that the hosting rights were given to Auckland, the "home to 25,630 registered netball players." "Auckland City recognises the hugely important role netball plays in our community and is excited about showing our passion for the game to the world." Mr Hubbard said that the Championships will also provide a good start for Auckland in the lead up to the &lt;a href="w%3A2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2011 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

Ruth Aitken, coach of New Zealand's netball team, &lt;a href="w%3ASilver%20Ferns"&gt;Silver Ferns&lt;/a&gt;, said that it will be good for her players that the Championships are being held in Auckland. She said that playing at home is a wonderful opportunity.

Mr Mackinnon has announced that a new organisation will be formed to help with the preparation of the Championships, along with the work NNZ has already done.

Ms Rhone, said that it was major benefit for the Championships that NNZ was willing to make the dates and venues final so quickly, as it means that preparation can now get started for the venues and the 16 participating netball teams. 

"Running a world class event in a compressed timeframe will be a challenge, but with the support of the Auckland community, we know that New Zealand will be able to host an excellent World Netball Championships," Mr Mackinnon said.

Mr Mackinnon said that he and NNZ are looking forward to hosting the championship, which he described as the pinnacle event of Netball.

One of the reasons that Christchurch did not gain the hosting rights this year might have been because in 1999, Christchurch hosted the event.

Villagers near the town of Goroka in the jungle-covered highlands about 400 kilometres north of the capital Port Moresby in &lt;a href="w%3APapua%20New%20Guinea"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; killed four women they believed to be witches. They tortured the women by stabbing them with hot rods so they would confess to causing a road crash using sorcery. The accident had resulted in the death of three prison guards. The villagers hid the bodies in an old pit. 

With the help of some village elders, police have now discovered these murders which occurred in October of last year. BBC News reports human rights campaigners saying that it is not uncommon in Papua New Guinea for women suspected of engaging in black magic to be killed, often by hanging or burning.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Yahoo%27s%20new%20Internet%20ad%20sales%20system%20is%20a%20progress&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The introduction by &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo"&gt;Yahoo Inc.&lt;/a&gt; of its new &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; ad sales system was successful. The company's new feature may turn out to be very useful for Yahoo's shares, since investors are betting on rapid growth of the company's revenue. 

When Yahoo stated that it will launch on February 5 a full version of its new system, entitled Panama, the company's shares rose by 8 percent on Wednesday. The system, being introduced in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, will be launched a month earlier than &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; expected.

The ad system is to bring the company in closer league with the number one search engine &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google Inc.&lt;/a&gt; Yahoo's technology will permit various advertisers to pay for specific search terms, which are based on their popularity.

Panama will also help advertisers in targeting ads that are sent to a specific audience on the Internet. The system will allow rotating ads in accordance with their effectiveness. &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have been offering these features for several years. 

&lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Pyykkonen"&gt;Martin Pyykkonen&lt;/a&gt;, who is the analyst at &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Crown%20Capital"&gt;Global Crown Capital&lt;/a&gt;, said that Yahoo was not as successful as Google but it still continues to strengthen its position as number 2. Although Google had a stronger &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20software"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; platform, Yahoo continues to register good results, which is worth something.

Pyykkonen also mentioned that he is not forecasting any shifting in wholesales, and especially a sudden fall of Google, but he is sure that Yahoo will not be far behind Google; in fact the company is to shorten the gap between the two. 

The ability of Yahoo's new system, to draw more ad dollars from customers, should boost the company's growth in this year's second half. Yahoo is also dealing with a potential drop in prices regarding its key branded advertising sales. This is due to the competition provided by &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace.com"&gt;MySpace.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Microsoft sales go higher than expected in last quarter</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Microsoft%20sales%20go%20higher%20than%20expected%20in%20last%20quarter&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The sales of the &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Corporation has increased considerably during the latest quarter, having brought more profit than predicted by &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;. However, the delay in arrival of the major new products resulted in spoiled financial results.

The quarter that finished in December marked the increase by 6 percent in the Microsoft sales, having reached the revenue of $12.5 billion. The delayed products - the latest versions of &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Vista"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%202007"&gt;Office 2007&lt;/a&gt; - are to be launched next week. 

Microsoft's video game business grew considerably in the quarter - its revenue increased by 75 percent, to the mark of $2.96 billion. The success of the business is explained by steady sales of its &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; console and highly demanded games like the critically acclaimed &lt;a href="w%3AGears%20of%20War"&gt;Gears of War&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2006. 

The noteworthy results have been gained by Microsoft in selling its server software applied in corporate data centers. It brought the revenue up 17 percent, to $2.85 billion. As for the operating profit, it increased by 35 percent, to over $1 billion. Following the most profitable Windows and Office, the server group, including databases, operating systems, and back-end programs used for e-mail systems, presently represents the third major product line of the Corporation. 

Net income witnessed 28 percent decrease, to $2.63 billion to be compared to $3.65 billion dollars during the same period of time the previous year.
To solve the problem of the product delay and support the personal computer industry, Microsoft provided free or discount coupons for upgraded versions of Windows Vista and Office 2007. Consequently, &lt;a href="w%3APC"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; makers sold new computers during the last period of 2006 promising their customers that they would be able to acquire the new Microsoft products, thus preventing PC sales from standing at still point. 

The coupon program was initiated by Microsoft in October with expectations of approximately 1.5 billion dollars in revenue to be deferred. However, with better PC sales Microsoft received the $1.64 billion.
Microsoft pays attention towards development of the consumer electronics business. In the end of 2006 the company launched a digital media player called Zune, a product to compete with &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; produced by &lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;. However, Microsoft's section of consumer entertainment and devices is not profitable yet.

As for Microsoft’s on-line business, it also leaves much to be desired, especially considering Internet searches. In the latest quarter there was a decline in the Microsoft's market share in searching. Still, the company continues to invest into this business segment. 
The revenue brought by on-line services, including web advertising and search-linked ads, increased by 5 percent in the quarter, to $624 million.

Ângelo A. Chora ♡❤et. al.♡❤ are reporting in the &lt;a href="w%3AJournal%20of%20Clinical%20Investigation"&gt;Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/a&gt; this week that &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20monoxide"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; (CO) and the &lt;a href="w%3AHeme%20oxygenase"&gt;heme oxygenase-1 protein&lt;/a&gt; protect against the symptoms of &lt;a href="w%3Amultiple%20sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) in the related mouse model of &lt;a href="w%3AExperimental%20autoimmune%20encephalomyelitis"&gt;experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis&lt;/a&gt; (EAE).

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20nervous%20system"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt; (CNS). Although many patients are largely unaffected by their disease, MS can cause impaired mobility and disability in more severe cases.

The research group from the Gulbenkian Institute in &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; used the EAE mouse model of MS to study the effects of the Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein encoded by the HMOX1 gene.

HO-1 &lt;a href="w%3AKnockout%20mouse"&gt;knockout mice&lt;/a&gt;, lacking both copies of the gene (not producing the &lt;a href="w%3Aprotein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;), showed a more severe progression of the disease compared to wild-type mice, having normal levels of the protein. The symptoms of the disease were reversed when the HO-1 protein expression was induced using cobalt &lt;a href="w%3APorphyrin"&gt;protoporphyrin&lt;/a&gt; IX.

During MS attacks the body's own &lt;a href="w%3AImmune%20system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; destroys the &lt;a href="w%3AMyelin"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt; surrounding &lt;a href="w%3ANeuron"&gt;nerve cells&lt;/a&gt; in the brain and spinal cord. Pathogenic &lt;a href="w%3AT%20helper%20cell"&gt;T helper cells&lt;/a&gt; are triggered by &lt;a href="w%3Aantigen-presenting%20cell"&gt;Antigen-presenting cell&lt;/a&gt; (APCs) within the brain stem. The disease can cycle between attacks (relapses) followed by remission, suggesting that there is an underlying regulatory system. The HO-1 protein had been identified previously as a possible candidate for a protective gene.

HO-1 degrades excess &lt;a href="w%3Aheme"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt; within the body acting as the rate controlling step when under inflammatory conditions. The HO-1 heme degradation pathway produces as products equal amounts of free heme, carbon monoxide and &lt;a href="w%3Abiliverdin"&gt;biliverdin&lt;/a&gt;.

Carbon monoxide was also shown to limit the effects of the disease. Mice were exposed to a high concentration of CO for 20 days within a chamber. Mice exposed to CO had limp tails, but were more mobile than the mice in the control experiment which displayed hind limb &lt;a href="w%3Aparalysis"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt;.

It is still unknown exactly how carbon monoxide slows down the symptoms of EAE, possibly through the mopping up of &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20radicals"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt;, or through promoting the binding of iron to heme (decreasing radical production).

The experiments found that HO-1 did not affect the development or function of &lt;a href="w%3Aregulatory%20T%20cells"&gt;regulatory T cells&lt;/a&gt;. For a beneficial effect HO-1 needed to be expressed in &lt;a href="w%3Adendritic%20cells"&gt;dendritic cells&lt;/a&gt;, causing inhibition of &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20histocompatibility%20complex"&gt;MHC-II proteins&lt;/a&gt;, involved in presenting antigens, and inflammatory cytokines (&lt;a href="w%3AInterferon-gamma"&gt;IFN-γ&lt;/a&gt;).

These experiments open up new possibilities for MS therapies, involving the expression of HO-1 in suppressing the development of MS.

The article went online on the 25th January 2007 and will be printed in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in February.

A &lt;a href="w%3Aturquoise"&gt;turquoise&lt;/a&gt; colored &lt;a href="w%3AUFO"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt; was reported by locals and an officer in and around &lt;a href="w%3ACharlotte"&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Jim Neal said that the object was, "Bright blue-green ball with a white tail." Julie Bigham said that the object was, "A greenish-like light low in the sky. We thought a small plane or helicopter was going to crash." David Whitesides said that the object was, "A slow-moving bluish glow." Brett Lay said that the object was, "Large, bright green ball. Had a haze about it." Amy Bromberg said that, "Almost looked like a flare. Kind of creepy."

An officer, who had been dispatched to confirm the object, said that object was visible and moving.

&lt;a href="w%3APsychologist"&gt;Psychologist&lt;/a&gt; Granville Angell, who is also a former military pilot, said that, "It was like a ball that grew a tail. It was about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. Uh, and it came from west to east. It was like a shallow arc across the sky and descended down. It was a very shallow descent and a glowing flare as it went down. It was visible for about, oh, 10-15 seconds. Heaven only knows what it could be, but some type of a UFO. I'm not saying an alien but something." He noted that he initially thought it was an airplane crashing but noticed that the colors weren't right and he said it could not have been a comet because it moved too slowly.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; said they received more than a dozen calls about the object. All planes and helicopters in the area were accounted for.

<h1>Aussies ignore flag ban at Big Day Out festival</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Aussies%20ignore%20flag%20ban%20at%20Big%20Day%20Out%20festival&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Despite pleas from &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Day%20Out"&gt;Big Day Out&lt;/a&gt; promoters to leave the &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Australia"&gt;national flag of Australia&lt;/a&gt; at home, many of the 55,000 music lovers have turned up to the Sydney event covered in it. 

Co-promoter Ken West caused a stir when the flag was "banned" from this year's Big Day Out in Sydney after organisers branded it a "gang colour" and symbol of hate. Organizers of the rock festival had planned to confiscate any flag or bandanna bearing the national symbol at the gate. The organizers defended their action claiming Sydney was "a hot bed of racism." They had already moved the event from the traditional time, Australia Day, to avoid these "nationalistic overtones." The Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; responded by declaring that the Big Day Out should have been cancelled unless organisers reversed their decision to ban the flag. 

After widespread outrage on talkback radio, and condemnation of their action by the Prime Minister and state Premiers, Australians have literally worn their hearts on their sleeves by draping the Aussie flag over their shoulders or wearing t-shirts, tattoos or bikinis with it printed on it. Event organisers allowed hundreds of fans to bring Australian flags to the event, backing down on their earlier call to leave the emblem at home. 

Melissa-Rose Heap, 18-years-old, of &lt;a href="w%3AKogarah"&gt;Kogarah&lt;/a&gt;, said she and her friends had fashioned the Australian flag into dresses after the banning controversy.
"We made them into dresses because they said we weren't allowed to, and that's not right," she said. "They shouldn't be able to tell anyone that we can't be proud of Australia."

Friday &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the government apologized to deportation victim &lt;a href="w%3AMaher%20Arar"&gt;Maher Arar&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2002, Syrian-born and Canadian &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware%20engineer"&gt;software engineer&lt;/a&gt; Maher Arar was arrested by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; officials and deported to &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; after the U.S. suspected that he was a terrorist. Arar was held in a Syrian prison where he was regularly tortured for a year. He came back to Canada in October 2003.

The affair became very public in Canada. Arar is banned from the United States and the Canadian government says they will try to talk with U.S. officials. Harper is calling on the U.S. government to take Arar off the no-fly and terrorist watchlists. Arar was "wrongly" accused of being a terrorist.

The Canadan PM gave him an apology for Canada's role in the affair and offered a $10.5 million compensation package to Arar and his family. Arar gladly agreed to the package.

"I try to see how I'm still being portrayed on the Internet and in the media. And I'll be open with you -- I get very upset when I read the words 'terror suspect', 'former terror suspect' because it always reminds the reader of this link that never existed. I'm very excited when I see people referring to me as a Canadian computer engineer," Arar said Friday in a news conference in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; responding to the governments apology. 

"The struggle to clear my name has been long and hard," he said. "I feel now I can put more time into being a good father, and to being a good husband and to rebuilding my life."

"This struggle has taught me how important it is to stand up for human rights," he said. "I feel proud as a Canadian and I feel proud of what we've been able to achieve."

Arar currently lives with his wife &lt;a href="w%3AMonia%20Mazigh"&gt;Monia Mazigh&lt;/a&gt; and two children in &lt;a href="w%3AKamloops%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

The Central Bank of the Republic of &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; recently published a job advertisement that asked for a male document officer. A member of &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Turkey%29"&gt;SHP&lt;/a&gt;, a mainstream Turkish political party, criticized the ad, stating that 
Trying to defend their position, the Central Bank officials stated that the job of a document officer is not a desk job, that it requires physical power, and that it is not suitable for women. They stated that they published the ad as it was in order not to give false hopes to prospective female job applicants. 

Although the traditional, patriarchal approach in Turkey does not regard women's employment positively, &lt;a href="w%3AFeminism"&gt;feminist&lt;/a&gt; organizations are actively working to end gender discrimination in Turkey.

Two &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; students have been insulted when their exam papers were returned to them with rude remarks on them. However one student received a positive comment on a paper that he got a merit in, the second highest mark possible.

The two students were from and both participating in the 2006 level three (National Certificate of Educational Achievement) external exams.

Josh Potter, 17-years-old, was one of the students who were insulted. When Mr Potter opened the package containing his exam papers he saw on his not-achieved media studies paper, the large words: "GOOD ONE DICK!!" written in blue felt tip pen. When he first saw it he said that he had to do a double take, "It is not the right sort of thing to be seeing on your exams."

"I was quite surprised. When I told my dad, he thought it was a joke at first but then he was quite shocked," Mr Potter said.

The other student, Sanjay Narayan, had a nice compliment on one of his papers he passed: "NICE ONE MATE," and the other paper, which he failed, said: "You useless sack of poo." The two papers were in statistics and calculus.

The two boys say that they did not hand in the papers with the words written on them. (New Zealand Qualifications Authority) also confirmed this because markers had a duty to report any broken rules, which includes writing notes on exam papers.

Mr Potter's and Mr Narayan's parents have both complained to the NZQA, the authority that manages NCEA.

Mr Potter's mother said: "Luckily, Josh is the sort of person who has taken it quite well, but imagine if it had gone to a student who was more sensitive."

Mr Potter said that neither he, nor his friends, wrote the messages.

NZQA has asked for all of the papers from both of the students as they are launching their own investigation into the "serious issue." NZQA are already confident that it was not performed by a marker, which has raised concerns by Mr Potter, who asks how easy it would be for someone to gain unauthorized access to an exam, and tamper with it. NZQA declined to comment on this issue.

A royal decree published in &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; Royal Gazette has endorsed the lifting of martial law in 41 of the country's provinces. Martial law has been in place in the country since a coup on September 19 that ousted populist Prime Minister &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;.

The remaining 35 provinces will remain under martial law. This includes the south of the country which has been experiencing a separatist insurgency, and parts of the country where support for the ousted Prime Minister is still strong.

Indications that the restrictions put in place by the army appointed government would be lifted came as early as October last year when current Prime Minister &lt;a href="Surayud%20Chulanont"&gt;Surayud Chulanont&lt;/a&gt; mentioned the possibility during a visit to &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indian%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has won the third match of the series against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChennai"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by three wickets. 

India started batting first as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Lara"&gt;Brian Lara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; chose to field first after winning the toss. India made an impressive start after losing their first wicket in the second over in the form of Gautam Gambhir.

Robin Uthappa made the innings highest score, 70 runs in just 41 balls by hitting 11 fours and 2 sixes. Middle order batsmen, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, performed well and made a hundred-run partnership. But, after losing the captain's wicket India only made 36 runs loosing 7 wickets to end the innings.

India set a target of 269 in 50 overs for West Indies. West Indies lost their first wicket in the first ball of the innings. But, a 127 run partnership for the fourth-wicket between Lara and Samuels helped to capture the match on their side. However, West Indies lost their last three wickets only adding eight runs to the innings total.

Man of the match &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarlon%20Samuels"&gt;Marlon Samuels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; made 98 runs in just 95 balls with 12 fours and one six. He did an impressive job of bowling and took one wicket, giving just 41 balls in 10 overs.

Overall India is leading the four match series by 2-1 and the final match at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVadodara"&gt;Vadodara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on January 31 will be crucial for both teams. India would need to win the match to win the series, whereas to level the series West Indies must-win the match.

Fights between students in &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut%20Arab%20University"&gt;Beirut Arab University&lt;/a&gt; esacalated into clashes across the city on January 25, between groups supporting and opposing the Lebanese government. Four people were killed while and over a hundred and fifty were injured in the fighting, as youths armed with makeshift weapons clashed, threw rocks and damaged vehicles. The Lebanese army deployed armored vehicles and fired shots in the air to disperse the fighters. An overnight curfew was imposed to stop the fighting.

Scuffles broke out between Sunni and Shiite students, who were respectively support and oppose of the current government, in the university's cafeteria and soon attracted local supporters of both groups. 

Coming on the heels of mass demonstrations and a general strike called by Hezbollah calling on the &lt;a href="w%3AFouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt;-led government to step down, the clashes has raised fears of renewed civil conflict along sectarian lines in Lebanon.

<h1>Technology developed to detect fake drugs quickly</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Technology%20developed%20to%20detect%20fake%20drugs%20quickly&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A recent improvement of an old technique in &lt;a href="w%3Aspectroscopy"&gt;spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; sparks hope for detection of counterfeit drugs, an article in the journal ♡❤Analytical Chemistry♡❤ published by American Chemical Society said. Such technique could make fake drugs detection a lot easier and faster than it is currently practiced, according to the article.

A group of scientists at the &lt;a href="w%3ARutherford%20Appleton%20Laboratory"&gt;Rutherford Appleton Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; have tested a method called spatially offset &lt;a href="w%3ARaman%20spectroscopy"&gt;Raman spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; (SORS) on a range of over-the-counter drugs, like &lt;a href="w%3Aibuprofen"&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aparacetamol"&gt;paracetamol&lt;/a&gt;, to show how to test whether they are fake or not without destroying the packaging.

Current practice, using conventional Raman spectroscopy, in spotting fake drugs are not applicable when they are encapsulated or enclosed in bottles or blister packs. This difficulty makes analysis of suspect drug tedious as drug testers have to open the package and bring out the chemicals.

Charlotte Eliasson and Pavel Matousek tested the drugs without removing them from their packages. They then compared the result with the known characteristics of the drugs and with the result obtained using conventional method. They reported that, unlike conventional method, SORS could identify the drugs.

Eliasson and Matousek's recent paper concluded that "the new approach is particularly beneficial in situations where the conventional... method is hampered or fails because of [interfering signals] emanating from the packaging that contaminates the much weaker signals of the drug chemicals held in the product."

"These interfering signals can be effectively suppressed by SORS," the paper ended.

SORS technology is currently under development for commercial release. A company is being set up in Didcot to develop SORS for use in the anti-counterfeit industry. 

The technology is also envisioned to be used to monitor drugs as they go through the manufacturing process. The technique could save the industry substantial amounts of money both from counterfeit drugs and in drug production.

Anti-war demonstrations were held in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; and other cities around the world on Saturday to call an end to the &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt; and to bring back home the troops stationed there. Among the 1,400 organizations included in the protest were the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20for%20Peace%20and%20Justice"&gt;United for Peace and Justice Coalition&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href="w%3AStudents%20for%20a%20Democratic%20Society"&gt;Students for a Democratic Society&lt;/a&gt;(SDS).

In Washington, D.C., celebrities including &lt;a href="w%3AJane%20Fonda%23Opposition%20to%20the%20Iraq%20War"&gt;Jane Fonda&lt;/a&gt;, a half dozen members of Congress, and thousands of demonstrators coming from all over the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; joined together in protest against the war. One of the speakers during the protest, 12-year-old Moriah Arnold from &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, said to the crowd of protesters, "Now we know our leaders either lied to us or hid the truth. Because of our actions, the rest of the world sees us as a bully and a liar." A week earlier at her school, she had organized a petition drive against the war in Iraq.

A bloc of about 300-1000 protesters from mostly SDS stormed up to the final set of stairs to the capital where they had a stand off with the Capitol police. They stood at the stairs for an hour before going to the rear of the Capitol in an attempt to occupy the building. They later returned after going into the main march. They left in their wake a good amount of political graffiti on the Capitol Building.

Representative &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;John Conyers (D)&lt;/a&gt; said he would use congressional spending power in order to stop the war in Iraq, "George Bush has a habit of firing military leaders who tell him the Iraq war is failing. He can't fire you. He can't fire us. The founders of our country gave our Congress the power of the purse because they envisioned a scenario exactly like we find ourselves in today. Not only is it in our power, it is our obligation to stop Bush."

26-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; Staff Sgt. Tassi McKee, an intelligence specialist at &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Meade"&gt;Fort Meade&lt;/a&gt;, said she had initially joined the Air Force to become a patriot, so she could travel, and so she could get money for college. But she added, "After we went to Iraq, I began to see through the lies."

72-year-old Frank Houde, who served in &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; as an Air Force pilot, wore a hat that said, "Veterans for peace." He said that, "The fact is war doesn't work. Iraq is not going to work. The war was started for reasons that turned out to be false." 

A small protest against the anti-war demonstrations was held, with AP reporting approximately 40 attendees.

Jordan will stand trial on eight counts. The charges include cruelty, maltreatment of prisoners, disobeying a superior officer, willful dereliction of duty and making false statements. Jordan is the only U.S. officer charged in the Abu Ghraib case -eleven soldiers were previously sentenced up to 10 years in prison.

50-year-old Jordan, a reservist from &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, ran the interrogation center in Abu Ghraib, the notorious prison just outside of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. Under his command, soldiers photographed naked prisoners in demeaning poses. The officer himself was not present in any of the pictures. Jordan faces a maximum sentence of 22 years for the eight charges combined.

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s official radio, Voice of Islamic Republic of Iran (&lt;a href="w%3AIRIB%20World%20Service"&gt;IRIB World Service&lt;/a&gt;), failed to include on its English-language web site any reports about the adoption Friday of the U.N. resolution condemning Holocaust denials. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;-drafted resolution was adopted without a vote with 103 of the world body's 192 member states signed on as co-sponsors. &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20of%20America"&gt;Voice of America&lt;/a&gt; (VOA) reported Iran was the only country indicating opposition to the measure. An Iranian diplomat at the U.N. described the intent of the resolution's sponsors as "mischievous." 

Iran's radio did report extensively on an international cartoon competition in Tehran designed to show drawings with anti-Israel, Holocaust-denial, and pro-Palestinian themes.

While silent about the U.N. resolution, the Iranian radio provided extensive coverage of an earlier international conference in Tehran which questioned the Holocaust. The conference was organized at the initiative of Iran's President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;. Iranian officials argue that meetings such as last month's Tehran conference serve a scholarly purpose, and accused Israel of manipulating the Holocaust for political purposes. 

&lt;a href="w%3AFreeMediaOnline.org"&gt;FreeMediaOnline.org&lt;/a&gt; commented that the failure of Iran's official radio to report promptly on the U.N. resolution against Holocaust denials is typical of media organizations controlled by regimes which suppress freedom of expression and journalistic independence. FreeMediaOnline.org pointed out that journalists in countries like Iran are unable to report on many issues without specific directives from political or religious leaders.

The UN resolution "urges all member States unreservedly to reject any denial of the Holocaust as a historical event," according to the UN Radio website. The resolution designates January 27 as an International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust.

The new UN Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; issued the following statement through a spokesperson, "The Secretary-General welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly today [Friday] of a resolution unequivocally condemning any denial of the Holocaust. This reflects the prevailing view of the international community. The Secretary-General reiterates his conviction that the denial of historical facts such as the Holocaust is unacceptable. He expresses his strong desire to see this fundamental principle respected both in rhetoric and in practice."

The &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;n government has denied reports in the press that the country is working with &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; to better their nuclear programs and said that the press is spreading "lies" in an attempt to ruin the country's reputation.

Earlier this week, media outlets began to report that &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; was attempting to help &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; test their own nuclear weapon underground and that Iran was preparing for that test.

"The Iranians are working closely with the North Koreans to study the results of last year's North Korean nuclear bomb test. All the indications are that the Iranians are working hard to prepare for their own underground nuclear test," said an unnamed &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; dilpomat on January 24, 2007.

North Korea immediately denied all reports that any cooperation between the two countries, in regards to nuclear material, was taking place.

"[The] assertion is nothing but a sheer lie and fabrication intended to tarnish the image of (North Korea) by charging it with nuclear proliferation," said a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry of N. Korea.

"[North Korea] will continue to sincerely honor its duty it had assumed before the international community in the field of nuclear nonproliferation as a responsible nuclear weapons state," added the statement.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIAEA"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; has also denied that there is any evidence to suggest that Iran and North Korea are working together to better their nuclear programs.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, however, has stated in the past that N. Korea and Iran helped each other with missile programs, but that it is not known if they are cooperating in other areas of study.

"Whether that cooperation has extended into other areas, I don't have any information for you," said &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McCormack"&gt;Sean McCormack&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20State"&gt;Department of State.&lt;/a&gt;

According to a 2002 email exchange obtained by lawyers in an &lt;a href="w%3AIowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; case, &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; executives wanted to "whack" &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; because it was focusing on &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; deals a little too much. 

The first email by Bill Veghte, currently a company vice president, describes a Linux panel where a Dell executive explains their plans to increase Linux in the enterprise market. The responses to his email start in a worried tone over market competition but quickly escalates as Paul Flessner, a senior vice president in Microsoft's server applications unit, states: 

Paul Flessner then goes on to describe the advantages to promote Linux over Windows for Dell:
A recent study funded by the EU Commission concluded that "in almost all the cases, a transition toward open source reports of savings on the long-term costs of ownership of the software products." In addition, Microsoft has long been at the center of &lt;a href="w%3ACriticism%20of%20Microsoft"&gt;criticism and allegations&lt;/a&gt; over its alleged unfair and anticompetitive business tactics in Europe and elsewhere.

An informal internet poll by &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; showed that a large majority of respondents selected yes to the multiple choice question of whether &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; should be &lt;a href="w%3AImpeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;impeached&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the poll question, "Do you believe President Bush's actions justify impeachment?", 87 percent of respondents, so far chose the option that there is "plenty to justify putting him on trial", including "secret spying" and "deceptions leading to war". 

A total of 10.6 percent, so far, stated Bush should not be impeached, with 6.2 percent of total respondents, so far, saying he has done "absolutely nothing wrong" and the other 4.4% agreeing that he may have made a few "missteps" but not the "high crimes and misdemeanors" that calls for an impreachment.

Over 400,000 responses were recorded by Sunday. An online poll is not a scientific survey and may not represent the views of the public at large.

No government officials have commented on this poll at the time of publishing. The poll was on-going as thousands of protesters marched Saturday in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C&lt;/a&gt; asking for an end to the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20war"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt;. The poll is still "live" and taking votes.

&lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; political party &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Future%20New%20Zealand"&gt;United Future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has called for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWaitangi%20day"&gt;Waitangi day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to be changed back to New Zealand day, as it once was.

Waitangi day is on February 6, each year and celebrates the Waitangi signing of New Zealand's founding document, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20of%20Waitangi"&gt;Treaty of Waitangi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Te Tiriti o Waitangi).

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Dunne"&gt;Honourable Peter Dunne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , leader of the United Future party, has said that the recent celebrations of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20day"&gt;Australia day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has shown that New Zealand really does need its own celebrations of that kind. "Across the ditch, Australians celebrate a day that is about one thing only – the celebration of their country and of being a citizen of that country."

However co-leader of rival political party, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori%20party"&gt;Māori party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APita%20Sharples"&gt;Doctor Pita Sharples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has said to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A3%20News"&gt;3 News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, that Waitangi day is very important, and if we need to have a New Zealand day, then that needs to be something different.

Dr Sharples has also called for more respect in terms of what the foundation of Waitangi day is and educating the public that the Treaty of Waitangi is a positive thing for New Zealand.

However, Peter Dunne said: "There is no doubt the Treaty of Waitangi has an important place in New Zealand’s history, but having the Treaty the centre and indeed holding the naming rights for our day of national festivities, just politicises the day and invites unnecessary racial tension."

Sharples also says that there is no point in looking across the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATasman%20Sea"&gt;Tasman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at what &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is doing because we have our own identity, own founding document, our own nation. Thus, we should go forward together.

Peter Dunne said: "The timing is right for New Zealand to actively and positively advance our national identity – starting with a new national day." He claims quite a lot of support for a change to the name in 2008.

&lt;a href="David%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt; Conservative Party, has outlined his vision for the future of a multicultural Britain in an article published in the &lt;a href="w%3AObserver"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt; on January 28, 2007.

In a sharp criticism of the efforts launched by the Labour government to promote national identity - which include among other things a &lt;a href="w%3ABritishness"&gt;Britishness&lt;/a&gt; test for those wanting to become UK citizens - he advocates "a common culture defined by pluralism and tolerance and a distinctively British approach (calm, thoughtful, reasonable) to potentially incendiary issues."

Cameron agrees that there is a substantial alienation and division in the UK today and that "many thousands, maybe millions, feel shut out, under attack." However, he underlines that the way forward is not bullying people into Britishness but inspiring them to feel British. 

According to him, this can only be achieved by offering equal opportunities and a quality education to everybody without denying anyone the chance to escape poverty and to fulfill their dreams.

Under the theme ♡❤Turn everything off!♡❤, they're asking people to turn off their electricity for five minutes on February 1st, between 7:55pm and 8:00pm CET. With the initiative, they hope to remind others, the media and politicians (such as the candidates for the upcoming &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20presidential%20election%2C%202007"&gt;French Presidential elections&lt;/a&gt;) of the ongoing waste of energy. Everyone should turn off the light, as well as all electrical appliances -maybe a good moment for a candlelight dinner, they suggest.

The "five minutes of silence" are believed to put pressure on world governments to discuss the topic more seriously on an international scale. Since the first call various similar international groups have stated their support and currently promote the idea on their websites and newsletters.

The date was originally chosen to match the release of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; fourth climate change report, in which 2,500 scientists from more than 130 countries present their latest findings. The report however has been delayed and will now be released on February 2nd.

In &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, non-profit organizations such as &lt;a href="w%3AOxfam"&gt;Oxfam&lt;/a&gt; support the action. The consortium is working with the power distribution company to prevent any negative impact a sudden drop of energy demand might have on the electricity network.

According to an official of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; Interior Ministry, U.S. military and &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20army"&gt;Iraqi army&lt;/a&gt; troops killed an estimated 250 militants in heavy fighting over control of the &lt;a href="w%3AShia"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; holy city of &lt;a href="w%3ANajaf"&gt;Najaf&lt;/a&gt;. According to an Iraqi Major General, 10 militants were captured. The dead and captured were part of a group of 600 militants based outside of the city who planned to take Najaf, attack pilgrims coming for the Shia holiday of &lt;a href="w%3AAshoura"&gt;Ashoura&lt;/a&gt;, and kill senior Shi'ite clerics, &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Ayatollah%20Ali%20Sistani"&gt;Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani&lt;/a&gt; among them. 

During the fighting, gunmen crashed a U.S. military helicopter with a missile. The two crew members were killed, and their remains were later recovered, according to a military statement. Three members of the Iraqi forces were killed in the fighting, and 15 were wounded, according to an Iraqi police colonel.

Kerry "maxduck" is trying to sell his letterbox on the popular &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; auction site, &lt;a href="w%3ATradeMe"&gt;TradeMe&lt;/a&gt;, after his street was suspended from post being delivered to by &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Post"&gt;New Zealand Post&lt;/a&gt;.

Earlier last week New Zealand Post announced that it would temporarily stop delivering mail to three streets in &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; due to gang violence. The three streets includes 120 houses on Tennyson Road, Dryden Road, and Emerson Place, all the streets are located in &lt;a href="w%3AFairfield%2C%20Hamilton"&gt;Fairfield&lt;/a&gt;. Fiona Mayo, spokeswoman for New Zealand Post, said that if they had allowed posties to continue with services then they wouldn't be acting responsibly as an employer.

Ms Mayo said that most residents living within the banned streets have understood why the ban was put in place. She adds that Kerry "has a good sense of humour."

New Zealand Post have said that they will review the ban tomorrow.

Kerry said: "This letterbox is still in good condition, has survived a couple of tags, ash from &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Ruapehu"&gt;Ruapehu&lt;/a&gt; volcanic eruption and more recently the well publicised 'GUN BATTLE' of Hamilton."

As of writing the current bid is at &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;25.00, made by Kelley "superwiner".

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Beckham"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt; has been portrayed as a fairytale prince as part of a new promotion for &lt;a href="w%3ADisney"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;.

The footballer took on the role of Prince Philip from Disney's &lt;a href="w%3ASleeping%20Beauty"&gt;Sleeping Beauty&lt;/a&gt; in photographs for a new advertising campaign for the company. In the specially commissioned shots, Beckham is shown in battle with a fire-breathing dragon.

The pictures were taken by America's foremost celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, in the former England captain's current home of Spain, where he plays for football club Real Madrid.

Beckham described the experience as unique, saying: "I am the Prince and I am sort of slaying a dragon which is something I've never done before, obviously, and it's a very exciting project.

"When I was called about it and asked to do it, I was very honoured and really looking forward to it especially with Annie doing the pictures. I think that she always takes great pictures of everybody and she's always taken great pictures of me."

The portrait was taken months before Beckham signed his multi-million deal with football club LA Galaxy. It is part of an advertising campaign that will be seen across America. The publicity has added further frenzy to Beckham's high-profile arrival to the country, which is already being compared to that of the Beatles.

Leibovitz believes the 31-year-old footballer will grace Hollywood with more than just sporting skills.

"I think he would like to act and it was sort of a stepping-stone to that and I think he would actually make a great actor. He took it very seriously and when he wielded the sword on the horse, he really was very very serious about it and I love that."

Although it is not clear what else may be in the Hollywood pipeline for David and Victoria Beckham, Los Angeles and the United States seem to have already embraced the celebrity pair. Waxworks of the couple have been unveiled at Madame Tussaud's in New York, the Beckham's have launched their own perfume and they recently acquired newly-wed Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes as very close friends.

An officer of the regional chapter of &lt;a href="w%3ABagong%20Alyansang%20Makabayan"&gt;Bagong Alyansang Makabayan&lt;/a&gt; (Bayan) in &lt;a href="w%3ATacloban%20City"&gt;Tacloban City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALeyte"&gt;Leyte&lt;/a&gt; survived an assassination attempt last Saturday January 27 at around 8 o'clock in the evening.

Flor Acbo, 54, was believed to be the primary target of unidentified motorcycle-riding men who fired shots right in front of the Bayan's regional office in Eastern Visayas and wounded the leg of a man nearby.

Acbo said in an interview that the incident failed to douse his conviction, and condemned the "cowardly attempt on his life".

"It just shows how effective my work in exposing anomalies in government as well the abuses being perpetrated by the military. Instead of being cowed, this would strengthen my conviction to fight for the rights of the oppressed," he proudly voiced out.

The police have yet to complete their investigation.

Acbo, 54, is Bayan regional information officer for two years now.

He said he and his friend Bobby Bongcaras had just alighted from a passenger jeepney, a few meters from his house when one of two men riding a motorcycle fired at them.

According to a report, Acbo and Bongcaras ran towards their respective houses, while the two assailants fled towards the downtown area of this city.

The bystander who was hit was identified as Eric de Guzman, 27, also a resident of the same area. De Guzman, who was hit on his left foot, was brought to the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center for treatment, report said.

Police Superintendent Anaclito Limbo, Tacloban City police chief, said the gunman used a .45 caliber pistol. The police were investigating the shooting as of press time, Limbo was quoted saying.

Limbo said they had yet to determine whether the attempt to kill Acbo could be due to his involvement with Bayan.

Acbo ran and lost as mayor of Pinabacdao town in Samar during the 1988 elections under the banner Partido ng Bayan.

He also worked as the town's sanitary inspector and was once connected with the Commission on Population regional office.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -led protesters took to the streets to block all major highways throughout &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. This was a result of the country's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFouad%20Siniora"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; not meeting his opposition's demand to abdicate.

Thousands of police and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALebanese%20Armed%20Forces"&gt;troops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were deployed across the country. They worked together in opening roads, negotiating with some of the protesters, but refrained from using force.

The riots and clashes left three dead, including two bodyguards for former Member of Parliament, Fares Soaid, who is also a member of Lebanon's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarch%2014%20Alliance"&gt;March 14 majority&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Over a hundred and thirty other people were injured. Clean up operations were on their way, while the Internal Security Forces (ISF) imposed a curfew.

&lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt;, the Irish political party widely regarded as the political wing of the &lt;a href="Provisional%20IRA"&gt;Provisional Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt;, has voted to accept the &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20Service%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Police Service of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; at an ♡❤ard fheis♡❤ (party conference) held in Dublin. 982 party members voted on the motion at the conference, where over 2,500 people were in attendance. 

Surprisingly, over 90% voted in support of the motion after leadership forced a vote to cut short a six hour debate. Sinn Féin president &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt; called the decision was truly historic, saying, "Today you have created the potential to change the political landscape on this island forever."

The vote is historic due to the fact that Irish republicans viewed the police and the legal system in Northern Ireland as a unit of British rule since the partition of Ireland in 1921. In fact, from the start of &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20troubles"&gt;the troubles&lt;/a&gt; to the ceasefire in the late 1990s, the Provisional IRA had fought the PSNI's predecessor, the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Ulster%20Constabulary"&gt;Royal Ulster Constabulary&lt;/a&gt;.

Last Monday, a report released by &lt;a href="w%3ANuala%20O%27Loan"&gt;Nuala O'Loan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20Ombudsman%20for%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; confirmed collusion between the RUC and the loyalist paramilitary &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Volunteer%20Force"&gt;Ulster Volunteer Force&lt;/a&gt;.

He also he was also willing to meet with dissident Irish republicans such as the &lt;a href="w%3AContinuity%20IRA"&gt;Continuity IRA&lt;/a&gt; and it's political wing, &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Sinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Republican Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt;; and also the &lt;a href="w%3AReal%20IRA"&gt;Real IRA&lt;/a&gt;, who was responsible for the 1998 Omagh bombing, saying " However, Adams also claimed at a rally on Friday, he felt, "In my opinion, there is only one IRA, and that's the one which fought the British for a very long time." 

However, the Continuity IRA and Republican Sinn Féin rejected Adams' offer. &lt;a href="w%3ARuair%C3%AD%20%C3%93%20Br%C3%A1daigh"&gt;Ruairí Ó Brádaigh&lt;/a&gt;, the Republican Sinn Féin president said, "Ultimately, it is the British government which will recruit, it is the British government which will train, motivate, and above all who will pay and give the orders to such a police force."

A statement from Downing Street said that &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the "historic decision and recognised the leadership it has taken to get to this point". Irish &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; called the vote a "landmark decision," and that it "has opened the way to Northern Ireland power-sharing."

Blair and Ahern will meet at Downing Street tomorrow.

Sinn Féin's support of policing was one of the obstacles to the devolution process, the other is &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; commitment to power-sharing. The acceptance of the police is what Blair and Ahern believe is crucial to persuade the DUP into setting up a new government.

Ian Paisley said his stand "forced Sinn Féin to recognize support for the police and the rule of law as an issue of paramount importance for which there can be no other way" and that "Sinn Féin must now walk this road, the time for true, visible and open support for the police and law enforcement has arrived."

Some Democratic Unionists believe that Sinn Féin had only made a commitment in words only and that people in Sinn Féin power bases would not report crimes. 

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hain"&gt;Peter Hain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20secretary"&gt;Northern Ireland secretary&lt;/a&gt; said the vote was a breakthrough. PSNI Chief Constable &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Hugh%20Orde"&gt;Sir Hugh Orde&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the decision also. Professor Sir Desmond Rea, the chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Policing%20Board"&gt;Northern Ireland Policing Board&lt;/a&gt; hoped to see Sinn Féin join the board. 

&lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Reg%20Empey"&gt;Sir Reg Empey&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Ulster Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; said it was "a massive step change in the republican psyche."

&lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic and Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Durkan"&gt;Mark Durkan&lt;/a&gt; said "They now need to sign with no ifs or buts. As Gerry Adams now accepts, nationalist areas need policing."

The transitional assembly at &lt;a href="w%3AStormont"&gt;Stormont&lt;/a&gt; is due to be dissolved tomorrow in preparation for elections on March 7. However, if the process goes astray and no election occurs, the assembly will be dissolved and remain dissolved indefinitely.

Finally, the Indepdent Monitoring commission is due to release a report on the IRA's commitment to the peace process according to the British and Irish governments.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said that on Friday at 10:18 a.m., &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Bulusan"&gt;Volcano Bulusan&lt;/a&gt; erupted for about 6-minutes, releasing ash one kilometer into the air. The institute has issued an Alert Level 1, advising people from entering the permanent danger zone extending for four-kilometers around the volcano.

The Institute said that for a period of 24 hours before the volcano exploded, their &lt;a href="w%3Aseismic"&gt;seismic&lt;/a&gt; instruments had acquired 38 high frequency and 2 low frequency &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquakes"&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; at the volcano. Due to a thick cloud cover, direct visual observation of the volcano was not possible.

&lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; has announced it will share the revenue, yielded due to video clips placed at the site, with their copyright owners. At present day YouTube represents the most popular site sharing on-line video. In &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; it was acquired by Google Inc. As it was mentioned by &lt;a href="w%3AChad%20Hurley"&gt;Chad Hurley&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube's co-founder, at the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Economic%20Forum"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt;, held in , &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the idea of paying amateur &lt;a href="w%3Avideographers"&gt;videographers&lt;/a&gt; was suggested by the desire to motivate and reward creativity. 

The revenue-sharing naturally implies the site's administrators will have to prescreen the video clips before presenting them at the site to guarantee their authenticity. The task is a complicated one, as about 100 million videos are submitted by 70 million users to YouTube every day. It also implies the clips taken by the users from movies, music videos and TV shows will not be accepted as they used to be up to the current time.

It is quite a turn for the company as its initial success was built upon placing all the clips without prescreening them. However, it enables YouTube to avoid confrontation with videos' copyright holders. To fulfill the task of video prescreening, YouTube will have to apply the image-identifying technology elaborated by &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s best specialists. 

It is difficult to forecast whether the overall plan will bring further success to YouTube. Consider the competing site Revver that still has considerably less users is found among the first who shared its ads revenue, and &lt;a href="w%3AGUBA"&gt;GUBA&lt;/a&gt;, the site provided with image-recognition screening technology, also does not reach the popularity enjoyed by YouTube.

&lt;a href="w%3ABarbaro"&gt;Barbaro&lt;/a&gt;, winner of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Kentucky%20Derby"&gt;2006 Kentucky Derby&lt;/a&gt;, was euthanized on the morning of January 29, according to co-owner Roy Jackson. Barbaro suffered a major injury to his right hind leg shortly after the start of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Preakness%20Stakes"&gt;2006 Preakness Stakes&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Jackson, "We just reached a point where it was going to be difficult for him to go on without pain. It was the right decision, it was the right thing to do. We said all along if there was a situation where it would become more difficult for him then it would be time."

Barbaro's right hind leg was shattered in the opening lengths of the Preakness race. Three bones in the leg were broken - the &lt;a href="w%3Acannon%20bone"&gt;cannon bone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Asesamoid%20bone"&gt;sesamoid bone&lt;/a&gt;, and the pastern bone. &lt;a href="w%3ALaminitis"&gt;Laminitis&lt;/a&gt; took hold in the left hind leg as a result of the extra weight borne on the leg by the horse. It appeared for a while that Barbaro would recover; however, earlier this month, the horse suffered two significant setbacks that greatly reduced his ultimate chances for survival.

The three-year-old &lt;a href="w%3Acolt"&gt;colt&lt;/a&gt; underwent emergency surgery on May 20 to fuse two joints in the damaged right leg. Further surgery was required on January 27 to insert two steel pins into one of the healed bones. The latest procedure was especially risky because it because it transferred more weight on to the leg, with the foot resting on the ground not bearing any weight. The right rear hoof was already deteriorating, having developed a painful abscess earlier in the week.

Locals said they saw &lt;a href="w%3AUFO"&gt;UFOs&lt;/a&gt; in the sky over &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; at 6:20 p.m. The &lt;a href="w%3AKHON"&gt;KHON 2&lt;/a&gt; television station was able to catch the objects in the sky using their SkyCam. The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; said that no objects appeared on their radar at the time the objects were witnessed. The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; said that they also did not pick up anything unusual on their radars.

The U.S. military had conducted a missile defense test off of Kauai on the same day, but the event did not start until 7:20 p.m.

According to KHON 2 news, Peter Hollingworth, a resident of Honolulu, described the objects as two circling lights about 45 degrees above the horizon. Hollingworth, who was surfing with his son when the objects appeared, said that, "These two little fireballs with a stream behind it. Looked kind of like a shooting star but it just kept going. They changed directions a few times, at first it was coming in then it turned, then it went out then it came back in again. I was a little concerned. I told him come over and sit with me - this might be the last surf session we ever have together because this thing's coming straight for Honolulu. It looked deadly to me it was kind of spooky.”

Astronomy professor Gareth Wynn-Williams, from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Hawaii"&gt;University of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, told KHON 2 news, "It's probably a contrail of some kind. The air is very cold so the water condenses and forms like drops very quickly and then these drops stay behind the plane until eventually they warm up and they evaporate.”

The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; have taken a new approach by launching a new ad campaign. It is aimed at the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;.

The ads, which will frequently be aired during next weekend's Canadian broadcast of the &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, criticizes Dion as a leader and also criticizes his past in the government, as Canada's environment minister. They also feature clips from the Liberal leadership debate last fall. The ads are in English but another set of ads will air in French speaking &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, Dion's home province.
Dion, who was elected Liberal leader in December, responded to ♡❤CBC News♡❤ saying that it will "backfire" on &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;.

"[Harper] wants to spend all this money to try to attack me in a very negative way, and it'll backfire," Dion said. "Canadians will not be impressed by that." "Mr. Harper has nothing positive to say about his own record."

One ad says that air quality deteriorated when Dion was environment minister. The second ad says that he wants to go back to the previous Liberal government. The third ad says that he is not a leader.

The main ad is entitled "Stéphane Dion Is Not A Leader".

<h1>Primary camera on Hubble Space Telescope shut down</h1>

The camera on the telescope, known as the "&lt;a href="w%3AAdvanced%20Camera%20for%20Surveys"&gt;Advanced Camera for Surveys&lt;/a&gt;" or ACS, can be reactivated but will be restored to only one-third of its operating capacity. The restoration will probably take place in mid-&lt;a href="w%3AFebruary"&gt;February&lt;/a&gt;. The camera shut down over the weekend, probably due to a failure of its backup power supply. It was the third such shutdown of the camera in the past calendar year. The camera had been operating on its backup power since &lt;a href="w%3AJune"&gt;June&lt;/a&gt; 30, &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, when engineers switched from the primary power supply ("Side A") to the backup ("Side B") due to a malfunction. A review board was convened on &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary"&gt;January&lt;/a&gt; 29 to assess all options and to decide on a course of action. Their findings will be reported to NASA on &lt;a href="w%3AMarch"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt; 2, 2007.

The ACS, developed jointly by four &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; agencies, was installed in March of &lt;a href="w%3A2002"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;. It is a system of three cameras, filters, and dispersers which act to detect wavelengths of light ranging from near-infrared to &lt;a href="w%3Aultraviolet"&gt;ultraviolet&lt;/a&gt;. It is a system that was designed to last five years, according to &lt;a href="w%3APreston%20Burch"&gt;Preston Burch&lt;/a&gt;, associate director and program manager for the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA also indicated that the other four main systems on the telescope remain unaffected and functioning normally. Research work will resume this week using those systems.

A scheduled mission to the space telescope in &lt;a href="w%3A2008"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; is expected to deliver instruments to further upgrade the capabilities of the telescope. It is not known what the effect of the ACS failure will have on the scheduled mission. Burch said in a press release posted on the NASA main website, "It is important that the review board conduct a thorough investigation that will allow us to determine if there are any changes needed in the new instruments that will be installed on the upcoming servicing mission so that we can be sure of maximizing the telescope's scientific output. We are continuing to make excellent progress in our preparations for the servicing mission, which is presently targeted to fly in September 2008."

&lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the country plans to expand its military and economic ties with &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, and that there are plans to build a branch of the Iranian Nation Bank in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;.

Hassan Kazemi Qumi, Iran's ambassador to Baghdad has stated to ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ that the country plans to reconstruct Iraq and offer military training and supplies to the Iraqi military force for "the security fight." Qumi said the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; failed in the reconstruction of Iraq.

"We have experience of reconstruction after war. We are ready to transfer this experience in terms of reconstruction to the Iraqis," said Qumi.

In a first public statement, Qumi said that 2 Iranian men who were captured inside Iraq by U.S. forces and then later freed, were indeed part of the Iranian security force, which is in accordance with what the U.S. had always thought. Qumi, however, denied that the men were doing anything illegal, and were in fact in Iraq to conduct "legitimate" talks with the government of Iraq and they "should not have been detained" by U.S. forces.

"They worked in the security sector in the Islamic Republic, that’s clear," added Qumi.

In regards to opening an Iranian Nation Bank in Baghdad, Qumi stated that a license has been granted and issued to the government of Iran to allow a bank to be built in Baghdad. Hussein al-Uzri, a senior official for Iraq's national bank confirmed that a license has been issued and that "[the bank] will enhance trade between the two countries." Qumi says that several more banks will follow including agricultural banks and private banks.

In regards to cooperating through the economy, Qumi states that electricity and &lt;a href="w%3Akerosene"&gt;kerosene&lt;/a&gt; will be supplied to Iraq and that agriculture cooperatives will also be built.

Qumi states that he will not reveal "specific details" of military operations or plans in Iraq, but did say that border patrols along the Iran-Iraq border will increase and that a "joint security committee" will also be formed.

The U.S. has not commented directly on Qumi's statement, but a spokesman for the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20State"&gt;Department of State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McCormack"&gt;Sean McCormack&lt;/a&gt;, says that any Iranian influence or activity in Iraq is "a negative role in many respects."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Postal%20suspension%20lifted%20in%20Hamilton%2C%20New%20Zealand&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The two-day postal delivery suspension placed on three streets in &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has been lifted by &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Post"&gt;New Zealand Post&lt;/a&gt; and the posties are back to work delivering mail.

The suspension of deliveries applied to Tennyson Road, Dryden Road, and Emerson Place, which are located in &lt;a href="w%3AFairfield%2C%20Hamilton"&gt;Fairfield&lt;/a&gt;. New Zealand Post came to the decision on Friday to put the ban in place because of recent gang violence/conflict. Along with the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt;, New Zealand Post reviewed the current situation, and also drove along the streets, they came to the conclusion that the situation has now "cooled down," according to New Zealand Post spokesperson, Fiona Mayo and postal delivery general manger, Matthew Nant.

The residents on those streets came out to greet the postie, who was accompanied by business leader Brendon Coker, as she delivered the residents mail. Martha Rollo, Tennyson Road resident for 13-years, said that she was thrilled that her mail was once again being delivered after the "senseless" gang violence had temporarily stopped post. "Why should the rest of the locals suffer because of the gangs. We don't need this hassle." Ms Rollo said that the gang activity has only recently happened.

Vicky Roughan and Kevin Roughan, 12-year residents of Dryden Road, said that the post suspension, vandalism, and gang activity has been a problem for them. Mr Roughan claims that children from the age of nine and up are drinking late at night. "You don't know what the hell's going to happen."

Mr Nant has apologised to the affected, inconvenienced residents.

New Zealand Post state they are going to continue to monitor the situation, however and also have on-going discussion with the local council and police "to make sure we're abreast of any developments in the area."

The gang violence/activity New Zealand Post are referring to is, on the previous Thursday the &lt;a href="w%3AArmed%20Offenders%20Squad"&gt;Armed Offenders Squad&lt;/a&gt; was called out where they raided three homes following a shooting, eight people were arrested, and a large number of firearms were seized.

Despite post not being delivered, newspapers were still being delivered, waste collection was still happening, and electricity meter readers were also going around house to house, checking the meters.

&lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori%20Party"&gt;Māori Party&lt;/a&gt; co-leader, &lt;a href="w%3APita%20Sharples"&gt;Doctor Pita Sharples&lt;/a&gt;, has said that gangs are again starting to imping on on society like in the 1970s. He says we should include gangs into society, instead of disrupting them.

Wikinews previously reported on a letterbox for sale on New Zealand internet auction site, &lt;a href="w%3ATradeMe"&gt;TradeMe&lt;/a&gt;, which has now reached a bid of $26.03 by Eliz "polysstew".

The head of the Melo Commission announced they had recommended that retired Maj. Gen. Jovito Palparan Jr. and other commanders be "held responsible for the extrajudicial killings in their respective areas during their tours of duty".

Melo commission, formed in August 2006 by the president to look into the spate of politically related killings after local and international clamor, submitted the 89-page report of the commission to the president last week but the findings have not yet been made public.

Retired Supreme Court Justice Jose Melo said holding military commanders responsible for extrajudicial killings was one of the recommendations in the final report.

Melo reportedly said the investigation of the four-member panel showed that “majority of the victims were leftist-activist-militants” and that the suspected assailants belonged to the military.

He clarified though that they "don’t want to tag the whole military establishment", adding that "only elements of the military who were allowed to do their thing without supervision from higher officers."

He attributed "some of the killings to politicians, some to the security guards of landlords," but Melo pointed to the military elements for majority of the killings.

Earlier, another member of the commission, Butuan City Bishop Juan de Dios Pueblos, on Saturday said the military was involved in some attacks of leftists.

"We have identified that there are killings really perpetuated by the military," he said.

He remarked that the Melo Commission has recommended to President Arroyo that military commanders be held criminally liable if one of their subordinates were found guilty of political murders.

"We are suggesting the criminalization of the command responsibility in order to put more teeth in the aspect of peace and to stop the killings," the Bishop said.

Commission head Melo also confirmed, report said, that among those mentioned in the fact-finding report was Palparan, who retired in September 2006. Leftist groups had labeled Palparan “berdugo” (butcher) for the spate of killings during his tenure as commander in &lt;a href="w%3AMindoro"&gt;Mindoro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASamar"&gt;Samar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ANueva%20Ecija"&gt;Nueva Ecija&lt;/a&gt; provinces.

"He has said he inspired them. You can hook the fish through the mouth,” Melo said, referring to a media interview given by Palparan where he admitted he had "inspired" some people to "punish" suspected communist New People’s Army rebels who had committed crimes in their communities.

Palparan was one of four military officials who testified before the commission. They were the only witnesses who responded to the commission’s summonses.

Leftist groups and families of victims had boycotted the hearings of the commission, saying it lacked credibility and independence.

For his part, Jovito Palparan admitted on Monday that some soldiers could be involved in extrajudicial killings of left-wing activists.

"It's possible," Palparan was heard saying in a radio interview, noting that "some [soldiers] are victims so it's not surprising that some get angry because it's their lives on the line."

Meanwhile, human rights group Karapatan called on the Melo Commission on Monday to recommend punishment for the masterminds and perpetrators of extrajudicial killings, which, it said, mostly came from the military.

Dorris Cuario, secretary general of regional chapter of Karapatan in Southern Tagalog, said the initial report of the commission was not enough to solve the unabated political killings in the country. Southern Tagalog covers the province of Mindoro where Palparan's assignment as military commander coincided with escalation of human rights violations reportedly perpetrated by military elements.

"We hope [the report] is not just a facade of the commission to make people believe it was doing something," she said.

Cuario challenged the Melo Commission "to serve justice" by demanding for the punishment not only of the low-ranking policemen and soldiers but also of &lt;a href="w%3AArmed%20Forces%20of%20the%20Philippines"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt; generals and even Ms. Arroyo, whom Cuario and other militant groups point to as the masterminds of the killings.

Aside from Melo and Bishop de Dios Pueblos, the other commission members were National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Director Nestor Mantaring, Chief State Prosecutor Jovencito Zuño, and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20the%20Philippines"&gt;University of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; Regent Nelia Gonzales.

<h1>Wikinews exclusive: 'speed not behind New Zealand's road toll'</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikinews%20exclusive%3A%20%27speed%20not%20behind%20New%20Zealand%27s%20road%20toll%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Rachael Ford, co-ordinator for &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;'s Candor Trust reveals in a Wikinews exclusive what Candor asserts is the hidden cause of deaths on New Zealand's roads.

Candor Trust is an organisation based in New Zealand that helps educate New Zealanders about the dangers of driving under the influence of drugs.

Candor Trust says that the message that "Speed kills" is the "number one road safety threat".

In 2000, the number of road accidents causing injuries was 7,447. Last year, this rose to 10,738 - the highest since 1995. Statistics provided by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Ministry%20of%20Transport"&gt;Ministry of Transport&lt;/a&gt; show that in the same period, the number of hospitalisations too rose by about a quarter (25%), to 7,427.

Saying that the general level of safety on New Zealand's roads has "gone down the gurgler", According to the Trust, the "unjustified emphasis" on speed, which it says is far from the greatest factor in fatalities, only serves to distract from bigger issues."

Candor Trust urges a rethinking of the "Speed kills" message, pointing out that it does not predict that record numbers of hospitalisations accompanying the record numbers of speeding tickets issued.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAccident%20Compensation%20Corporation"&gt;Accident Compensation Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (ACC) and &lt;a href="w%3ALand%20Transport%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Land Transport New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; (LTNZ) both say that a one percent decrease in the mean speed will cut the death toll by four percent and the injury rate by two percent. 

Dr. Patrick Meffen has told transport officials from the Ministry of Transport that factors other than the drop in average speeds are responsible for the drop in the death toll.

Provisional figure for 2006 show a four percent decrease of the mean speed from 101 km/h to 97 km/h coinciding with an ♡❤increase♡❤ of people being seriously injured. The number went up by 330, a 15% increase from the 2000 figure of 2,243.

Candor Trust says that it is incredible that other agencies, including LTNZ, are continuing to spread the message that speed kills, even when an experiment to show what happened when users took party pills and then drove was stopped when no fatalities occurred, just concern over adverse effects.

Candor Trust said: "The survival of road users depends on the goodwill of planners who need to come clean and admit the 'reduced harm correlates to reduced average speeds' hypothesis is disproven in the present NZ context."

Ms Ford said: "It is not OK that the damning Breen report [a review of road safety to 2010 strategy] expressed concerns [that] our road safety policy is not sufficiently evidence based, and yet we carry on doing as we've always done." She said that because of this, the road victim disability services are overloaded and unable to meet the needs of the victims.

The speed theory is based on a formula called 'Ashtons formula'. Ashtons formula is based on demonstrated association, which is said to need the weakest scientific evidence, but Candor Trust says that it does not account for variables such as the vehicle standards.

Dr. Meffen told the LTNZ that it is not true if a crash occurred at 95 km/h and another at 105 km/h, the slower one would be more survivable. He said that the media releases are misleading people, making them believe in a false sense of security. "An important spin off from the misuse of these statistics has been the concept promoted by media of survivable accidents at or near open road speeds. In reality the chances of surviving around the open speed limit are low and purely random."

Candor Trust said: "Speed control must stop dominating policy - over limit speed is only present at 18% of fatal crashes. Safety has nothing to do with legality, and putting all our eggs in the speed basket as it's easily 'enforceable' has been a mistake." Over half of all fatal crashes the speed is under 60km/h, and fatal side-on crashes occur at speeds usually below 40 km/h.

In 2005 and partly 2006, $2,385,000 NZD was spent on advertising to prevent speeding, the majority of the advertising budget. Speeding teenagers, who are of the most concern, do not make up the bulk of the toll.

Candor Trust said the most important issue that could end up saving lives is the use of 1990-dated imports in cars that are being used by the under 25-year-olds on New Zealand roads, or as Candor Trust described the roads, "State Goat Tracks."

Candor Trust calls for an immediate review and reconstruction of how the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; deals with crashes, and want information on inattention and drug intoxication to be collected following a crash. A police source told Candor Trust that there are often times when crash investigators argue with the police when the police try to tick the speed box, because they are "overly keen". Candor Trust want a better and more effective road safety policy, especially when it comes to speed.

Also in the latter half of this month, January, 19 fatal crashes occurred and 16 of those were the result of a centreline cross, which usually occur because a driver is fatigued or otherwise impaired, and they move the steering wheel; or "run off road events." Ministry of Transport statistics shows that a head-on collision in which one of the cars is travelling 80 km/h or more will most likely result in a fatality. Research conducted in America also showed that mobile phones are not a major cause of deaths when compared to other causes. In the 3 seconds before a crash, 80% of drivers are inattentive and local studies implicate fatigue or drug abuse as the main risk factors for that.

This Monday &lt;a href="w%3AHewlett-Packard"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt; is to announce that it is expanding its partnership with &lt;a href="w%3ASAP%20AG"&gt;SAP&lt;/a&gt;. The partnership will be working with &lt;a href="w%3ANetWeaver"&gt;NetWeaver&lt;/a&gt; around several new services. The company is also expected to mention about its new enterprise solutions that are currently in development.

Hewlett-Packard will offer its clients services for upgrading servers, storage and NetWeaver – SAP's application builder platform meant for integrating business processes throughout different systems. Among other services that the company is going to provide comprise assessment, governance and some architecture services for R3.

The manager of Worldwide Packaged Applications for Enterprise Applications Services at HP Services Consulting &amp; Integration, Tim Treat, stated that the company first of all looks at servers, storage and management and only afterwards it makes a proposal regarding the things that are to be updated. He mentioned that when Hewlett-Packard will work on upgrading servers and management, it will turn its attention towards &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;. 

After performing all the upgrades, the company is going to offer its clientele a variety of services package options that are related to NetWeaver. The services offered by Hewlett-Packard will include: enabling the service, design and implementation, application development and management.

Tim Treat said that adaptive &lt;a href="w%3Ainfrastructure"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; is one of the company's new things that are to come. Recently the company's clients have put in place enough hardware capacity and infrastructure with the goal of supporting peak or quarter-end processes. However, a big amount of that capacity is unused till peak times. This is why Hewlett-Packard looks forward to bring solutions that are to allow users pay for the things they really use.

Treat also outlined the fact that, besides its new services, the company is to announce business-process consulting together with IDS Scheer - software and consulting company, which is one of the leading providers of Business Process Management and IT solutions.

The Suns had been on fire for the entire month of January. Unfortunately for them, Kevin Garnett was holding the extinguisher when the Suns came into the Target Center on Monday night.

Garnett posted a double-double, scoring 44 points and snaring 11 rebounds, as the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Phoenix Suns 121-112. The loss prevented the Suns from posting a perfect record in the month of January, and ended the Suns' season-high 17-game winning streak.

The Suns had problems answering Garnett's scoring prowess, but it was the Minnesota defense that doomed the Suns, limiting them to 17 points in the final quarter after allowing 95 from Phoenix in the first three periods. Steve Nash had 20 points and 18 assists, but in the fourth quarter he was only able to score 3 points and provide one assist.

In the fourth quarter, it was simply the Kevin Garnett show.

Garnett scored 15 points in the fourth quarter, with 13 of those points coming in the final 6:20 of the period. "It's just about being a presence," Garnett said. "It's about making them have to deal with me. I will continue to take that approach." In addition to his 44-point night, Garnett helped his team by not turning the ball over at all during the game.

Such a performance was not the case for Steve Nash, who turned the ball over an uncharacteristic five times during the game. The Suns had 14 turnovers as a team. It was a case of Garnett and the Timberwolves taking full advantage of the mistakes the Suns made and turning it into an opportunity to win.

However, the loss certainly didn't leave the Suns or their coach, Mike D'Antoni, discouraged.

"We'll start another [streak]. This is fun."

&lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;, a popular Web network, has announced the decision to provide its database to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20for%20Missing%20%26amp%3B%20Exploited%20Children"&gt;National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC)&lt;/a&gt;. The database is comprised of about 50 &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state registries on convicted sex offenders. NCMEC hopes that its use of the national database as well as the support of authorities, MySpace and other on-line communities will contribute to the efficient work of the center.

At present time the data contained in the MySpace database is gathered by a number of state authorities. The site, in conjunction with &lt;a href="w%3ASentinel%20Tech%20Holdings%20Corp."&gt;Sentinel Tech Holdings Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, a company involved into background verification, has amplified a technology that united all the registries. It is claimed that the technology will assist police in keeping track of about 600,000 convicted sex offenders.

MySpace and Sentinel Tech Holdings Corp. has been involved in developing the database since December, 2006. The database has been used for identifying, blocking or deleting the accounts of convicted sex offenders on the MySpace service. The database contains special software tools to match photos and allows authorities to cross-reference photos or characteristics of sex predators against registered offenders.

MySpace's provision of its database, however, has not proven sufficient for some critics of MySpace who allege that the network fails to protect minors from adult predators. A member of a coalition of prosecutors from 39 U.S. states, which is demanding MySpace verify the ages of all of its members, has stated that the provision of the database is not sufficient protection for minors using the website. The member threatened unspecified legal action if MySpace continues to refuse to verify its members' ages.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Oversight%20and%20Government%20Reform"&gt;Committee on Oversight and Government Reform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; held a hearing today on the accusation that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush%20administration"&gt;Bush Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had interfered with data regarding climate change in order "to mislead the public by injecting doubt into the science of global warming." On January 23, 2007, Chairman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Waxman"&gt;Henry Waxman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20M.%20Davis"&gt;Tom Davis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) had requested documents from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20on%20Environmental%20Quality"&gt;Council on Environmental Quality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but were denied access.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Waxman"&gt;Waxman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that, "The committee isn't trying to obtain state secrets or documents that could affect our immediate national security. We are simply seeking answers to whether the White House's political staff is inappropriately censoring impartial government scientists. We know that the White House possesses documents that contain evidence of an attempt by senior administration officials to mislead the public by injecting doubt into the science of global warming and minimize the potential danger."

During the hearing, two private advocacy groups, one of which was the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20of%20Concerned%20Scientists"&gt;Union of Concerned Scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , also presented a survey to the panel that revealed that 279 scientists working for the government had been pressured into minimizing the threat of global warming in their reports. Almost half of the 279 said that they were told to delete any references to "global warming" or "climate change" in their reports. The scientists in the survey all worked for a wide array of government agencies: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Energy"&gt;Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Commerce"&gt;Department of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Interior"&gt;Department of Interior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h1>Senator Arlen Specter challenges President Bush</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Senator%20Arlen%20Specter%20challenges%20President%20Bush&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The response comes after Bush declared that he is "the decision-maker" when it comes to war.

"I would suggest respectfully to the president that he is not the sole decider. The decider is a shared and joint responsibility," said Specter.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Judiciary%20Committee"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt; began the groundwork today in order to block &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;’s plan to send 21,500 more US troops to &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, or set limits on the war.

During the Congressional hearing today, attorneys told Senators that they do have the power to stop the sending of troops to Iraq and even to stop the war altogether.

"I think the constitutional scheme does give Congress broad authority to terminate a war," said one of those lawyers present during the hearing, Bradford Berenson.

"It is ultimately Congress that decides the size, scope and duration of the use of military force," said another attorney who was also present during the hearing, Walter Dellinger.

Not everyone agrees that Congress has the authority. University of Virginia School of Law teacher, Robert Turner says that "in the conduct of war, in the conduct of foreign affairs, the president is in fact the decider."

The explosion occurred at 10:50 a.m. [EST] at the Flat Top Little General Store, and fire officials say that the cause may have been from a nearby &lt;a href="w%3Apropane"&gt;propane&lt;/a&gt; tank that was leaking. The gas station was completely wiped out. Officials say that a full investigation will be launched to determine exactly what caused the blast.

The company that stocks the tank with gas had sent out a representative, who officials believe was killed in the explosion.

Fire and rescue squads are continuing to search for victims.

Witnesses say that the explosion could be felt as far as 1 mile away. Ben Monast, who owns a ski shop about a mile away from the scene, said that he "thought we got struck by lightning. The whole building shook and the power went off."

An elementary school that is close to the scene was not damaged, but students were kept inside for safety purposes.

Scientists have uncovered the largest &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANeolithic"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; settlement in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADurrington%20Walls"&gt;Durrington Walls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and believe that the village was inhabited by the people who built the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStonehenge"&gt;Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; monument.

Scientists say that the village was built around 2,600 B.C., roughly when Stonehenge was believed to have been constructed, and housed over 100 people.

Inside the areas which would have been the interior of houses at the time, scientists also found outlines of what they think were beds and cupboards or dressers. Pieces of pottery and "filthy" rubbish around the site. Animal bones, arrowheads, stone tools and other relics were also discovered.

"We've never seen such quantities of pottery and animal bone and flint. In what were houses, we have excavated the outlines on the floors of box beds and wooden dressers or cupboards," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASheffield%20University"&gt;Sheffield University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="archaeologist"&gt;archaeologist&lt;/a&gt; Mike Parker Pearson.

So far, the dig has revealed at least 8 houses roughly 14-16 feet square, but scientists say that they think there may have been at least 25 altogether.

The site was likely to have been occupied only seasonally rather than year-round and evidence suggests that a lot of "partying" went on at the location. 

"The animal bones are being thrown away half-eaten. It's what we call a feasting assemblage. This is where they went to party - you could say it was the first free festival. The rubbish isn't your average domestic debris. There's a lack of craft-working equipment for cleaning animal hides and no evidence for crop-processing," added Pearson.

The Durrington Walls are approximately 2 miles from the Stonehenge site.

A unmanned &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Launch"&gt;Sea Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AZenit%203SL"&gt;Zenit 3SL&lt;/a&gt; rocket which was supposed to carry a satellite to an orbit around Earth, has exploded on its &lt;a href="w%3AOcean%20Odyssey"&gt;Ocean Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; launch pad, just seconds before it was scheduled to launch. The engine had just been started when the rocket appeared to fall downwards, and was engulfed in a fireball. The rocket's payload, the NSS-8 communications satellite, for &lt;a href="w%3ASES%20NEW%20SKIES"&gt;SES New Skies&lt;/a&gt;, is believed to have been destroyed in the incident.

Sea Launch has confirmed that all launch personnel are safe. During launch operations, they routinely are aboard another ship, the &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Launch%20Commander"&gt;Sea Launch Commander&lt;/a&gt;, located approximately three miles away. The extent of damage to the ♡❤Odyssey♡❤ platform is unclear at this stage.

This is the ninth launch failure of the Zenit rocket, and the third for a 3SL variant, operated by Sea Launch.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAbraham%20Lincoln"&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; Bicentennial Commission in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; has endorsed singer Greg Cherone's children's song "A Man Named Abraham Lincoln". Released in anticipation of Lincoln's birthday, the song is intended to inspire children and adults to learn more about the sixteenth president. "Introducing Lincoln to any child is the reward in itself," says &lt;a href="Boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; singer-songwriter Cherone.

The Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission was established by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; to plan a "fitting and proper" national celebration of the 16th president's 200th birthday in 2009. Its members, appointed by the president and congressional leaders, include political leaders, jurists, historians, and collectors. The Commission aims to renew Americans' appreciation of Lincoln's ideals of freedom, democracy, and equal opportunity, and to encourage all people to "live the legacy."

<h1>Sweden to open embassy in Second Life</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sweden%20to%20open%20embassy%20in%20Second%20Life&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; has plans to open a virtual embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Life"&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt;, the virtual world home to thousands of &lt;a href="w%3Anetizens"&gt;netizens&lt;/a&gt;. Companies like &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; are already selling computers via the virtual world, but Sweden would become the first country to have a cyber-embassy in Second Life.

The embassy would not provide visa or perform diplomatic tasks, but would provide information on how and where to get these documents in the real world, as well as giving cultural and tourist information about the country. Visitors will also be able to chat with embassy personnel. A spokesperson explained that it would be an easy and cheap way to reach young people. The idea came from &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Institute"&gt;The Swedish Institute&lt;/a&gt;, an agency of the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Sweden%29"&gt;Foreign Affairs Ministry of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; with providing information about Sweden as a key purpose.

The "&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Sweden"&gt;House of Sweden&lt;/a&gt;" as it will be called, will be modelled on the new Swedish embassy in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; with the same name. The opening is expected in a few weeks.

Second life has over 3 million registered accounts. On an average day, the maximum of people logged in at the same time peaks at 25,000. In September 2006, Second Life was reported to have a gross domestic product of $64 million. Some schools in the United States and Canada have virtual classrooms on the site. People like Ailin Graef a.k.a. &lt;a href="w%3AAnshe%20Chung"&gt;Anshe Chung&lt;/a&gt; have developed virtual businesses in Second Life, and earn thousands of real dollars there.

<h1>January floods wreak havoc in Singapore</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=January%20floods%20wreak%20havoc%20in%20Singapore&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Floods during the month of January have devastated &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. A major &lt;a href="w%3Aflood"&gt;flood&lt;/a&gt; occurred from January 11 to January 12, 2007, during which almost 24 cm of rain fell, resulting in a &lt;a href="w%3Alandslide"&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt;. A second major flood recently occurred at &lt;a href="w%3AKota%20Tinggi"&gt;Kota Tinggi&lt;/a&gt;, leaving 17 people and 12 monkeys dead. As of January 31, 30,000 people still reside in relief centers in &lt;a href="w%3AJohor"&gt;w:Johor&lt;/a&gt;.

Almost 24 cm of rain fell in two days in northern Singapore, disrupting business operations in the area and triggering a landslide in Jalan Anak Bukit. The continuous rainfall, over 18 hours on Thursday, January 11 and Friday January 12, resulted in a landslide which caused the closure of a road that heads toward the Pan Island Expressway.

The MacRitchie Reservoir station recorded 216.7 millimeters of rainfall during the 24 hour period, accounting for 90 percent of the January average of 241 millimeters.

Recent flooding of the Johor river has caused vast destruction in Kota Tinggi. According to a Malaysian official, the flooding may be due to the land reclamation efforts made by Singapore. The reclamation project has reportedly narrowed the mouth of the Johor river, slowing the flow of water into the Johor Straits. About 100,000 people have been evacuated from their homes because of flooding during December and January.

In 2002, Singapore began land reclamation at the Johor Straits in an effort to reclaim Pulau Tekong. Malaysia opposed the project and sought international arbitration proceedings during October of 2003. Malaysia has reported that the project has hurt their interests by narrowing shipping lanes at the Johor Straits. Singapore expects the reclamation to be finished by 2010.

Malaysia has provided about US$430 million of aid by sheltering flood victims and rebuilding roads and schools. Flood water as high as four meters has caused 17 deaths and restricted access to many villages and towns.

<h1>New Zealand exam insulter revealed</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%20exam%20insulter%20revealed&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The person who left rude remarks on at least five students' returned &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Certificate%20of%20Educational%20Achievement"&gt;NCEA (National Certificate of Educational Achievement)&lt;/a&gt; exam papers has been identified as a temporary &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Post"&gt;New Zealand Post&lt;/a&gt; worker, and ex-student of &lt;a href="w%3ACashmere%20High%20School"&gt;Cashmere High School&lt;/a&gt;, the same school the students went to.

The insulter said that the remarks, which one included a positive remark congratulating a merit, were meant to be joke on the students he knew at his old &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;-based school.

The comments he placed on different papers included "GOOD ONE DICK!!", "You useless sack of poo," and the positive comment was "NICE ONE MATE."

The former New Zealand Post employee was employed to process mail, but had left New Zealand Post about a week before the insulting comments were discovered.

Dave Turnbull, principal of Cashmere High School, said that it is regrettable and disappointing that an ex-student of Cashmere High School was the offender, "even if they thought it was a joke." "I am pleased the NZQA and NZ Post have pursued this issue and resolved it quickly. It was not a joke for the students concerned."

Peter Fenton, chief executive of the postal services, said that he does not see what is funny about the remarks. He has apologised to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Qualifications%20Authority"&gt;NZQA (New Zealand Qualifications Authority)&lt;/a&gt;, the authority that manages NCEA; and will also send a letter apologising to the affected students.

Mr Fenton said that the damage the temporary worker has done to New Zealand Post's reputation is concerning.

Activist groups in the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href="w%3ABagong%20Alyansang%20Makabayan"&gt;Bagong Alyansang Makabayan&lt;/a&gt; (New Patriotic Alliance) or Bayan are set to submit "cabinet level documents" as evidence to international bodies purportedly showing that the office of the President, &lt;a href="w%3AMalaca%C3%B1ang"&gt;Malacañang&lt;/a&gt; sanctioned the series of extrajudicial killings in the country.

The evidence is to be presented to the Permanent People's Tribunal and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights"&gt;United Nations Special Rapporteurs&lt;/a&gt;, which is scheduled to visit the country this year.

In a press statement, Bayan expressed disappointment with the &lt;a href="Philippine%20commission%20holds%20retired%20general%20responsible%20for%20killings"&gt;report of the Melo Commission&lt;/a&gt; saying that "the report merely tells us what we already know, and that the report stops short of finding the roots of the extra-judicial killings."

"Everyone knows that Palparan is involved in the killings," said Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes Jr., asking that "why is it that after Palparan retired [in September 2006], the killings continued?"

Reyes concluded that "this only shows that the killings go beyond Palparan. We have repeatedly said that there is a national policy involved which sanctions the assassination of activists. The Melo Commission seems to have conveniently ignored this reality and has limited its report to Palparan's responsibility and shielded the administration from any culpability."

The documents, Reyes said, detail a "step-by-step matrix" on how to "neutralize" legal organizations. He added that the document was presented to the Arroyo Cabinet.

Meanwhile, the group challenged Malacañang to abide by the fact-finding commission's recommendation to file charges against retired Major General Jovito Palparan and other military field commanders for their involvement in the killings.

He also said President Arroyo, as commander-in-chief, should "take responsibility for the killings."

Human rights group Karapatan recorded more than 700 leftist activists, farmers, community organizers and journalists killed since Mrs. Arroyo came to power in 2001.

The latest victim, Dominador L. De Luna, 51, an employee of the National Food Authority (NFA) in &lt;a href="w%3ASamar"&gt;Samar&lt;/a&gt;, was gunned down just when the necrological mass for Jose Maria Cui, a professor at University of Eastern Philippines who was shot in front of his students, was being held last January 29. 

<h2>International pressure imperative</h2>
Dita Indah Sari, head of the National Front for the Indonesian Labor Struggle and 2001 recipient of the &lt;a href="w%3ARamon%20Magsaysay%20Award"&gt;Ramon Magsaysay Award&lt;/a&gt; for emerging leadership, yesterday said the Philippine government should implement the recommendation of the Melo Commission to hold top generals responsible for the assassination of hundreds of leftist activists.

Just like in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, the Philippine government, according to her, seemed afraid to take its military brass to account on the basis of command responsibility. She said international pressure was imperative at this point to move concerned governments to make appropriate moves regarding human rights cases based on recommendations by a fact-finding body.

"The international pressure will humiliate the government," Sari added.

Making one general accountable would not solve the extrajudicial killings in the country, according to America Vera-Zavala of Sweden's Left International Forum.

"I'm quite sure this extreme [number] of people killed is not due to one single general. It would be a unique country if only one general is responsible for all this," she said.

Vera-Zavala said the European Union was aware of the series of killings in the country and was continuing to monitor the matter.

<h2>Arroyo to seek Europe help</h2>

In a related report, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo yesterday said she would ask the European Union to assist in the commission's work, declaring that she had "no tolerance for human rights violations."

She issued a statement containing detailed instructions after meeting with retired Supreme Court Justice Jose Melo in Malacañang. The instructions were not clear though on how she intended to address the latter's recommendation to hold Palparan accountable for the killings.

&lt;a href="w%3AArmed%20Forces%20of%20the%20Philippines"&gt;Armed Forces of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) Chief of Staff Gen. Hermogenes Esperon Jr. said [Palparan] could be brought to court if indeed there is evidence.

"But since he is already retired, we cannot take him under our jurisdiction," Esperon added.

<h2>Militant lawmaker suspects whitewash</h2>

"The Melo Commission failed in its public vow to get to the bottom of the killings: its report, based on Justice Melo's statement to the media, is indicative of a whitewash," &lt;a href="w%3ABayan%20Muna"&gt;Bayan Muna party-list&lt;/a&gt; Rep. Satur Ocampo said in reaction to Melo's statements.

He disclosed plans of filing a case against retired Maj. Gen. Jovito Palparan with the International Criminal Court, "for command responsibility under international humanitarian law."

"Melo is silent on GMA's (President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's) role. The killings go on even with Palparan out, so what has [the commission] accomplished?" Ocampo said in a phone interview.

In a text message, Rep. Teodoro Casiño, also of Bayan Muna, said "the report merely scratches the surface and tells us what we already know."

He said the Melo Commission missed the whole point because "the institution of policies on counterinsurgency like Oplan Bantay Laya are crucial in allowing the likes of Palparan to wreak terror on a national scale."

&lt;a href="w%3AAnakpawis"&gt;Anakpawis party-list&lt;/a&gt; Rep. Rafael Mariano said the Melo Commission had "consciously avoided the responsibility of the President, the Cabinet Oversight Committee on Internal Security and the counterinsurgency program Oplan Bantay Laya in its report."

"Like we said before, the Melo Commission is a whitewashing machine," he said.

Mariano also said "the killings of activists was integral to the Arroyo administration's counterinsurgency policy," predicting that "the killings won't stop as long as the mastermind is not punished."

His colleague in Anakpawis, Rep. Crispin Beltran, who is still detained for rebellion charges, saw in the Melo report a move to make it "appear that it was a mere matter of negligence of command that set off the spate of extrajudicial killings."

Ocampo emphasized their "demand that Malacañang immediately make public the full 89-page report for scrutiny by all parties, including the media."

"[The Melo Commission] must adhere to established UN protocols and &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;'s recommendations on such an independent commission."

The &lt;a href="w%3APetrol"&gt;petrol&lt;/a&gt; price reductions seen across most of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have been short-lived for those living in the regional &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt;. An investigation by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has discovered retailers in Bathurst were late to lower petrol pricing and have been amongst the first to increase them.

Following a threat by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to publically shame fuel retailers and oil companies, most fuel outlets across Australia reduced prices by 5 to 10 cents per litre. The ACCC argued that the wholesale cost of petrol was around 10 cents per litre higher than the &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; market, which Australia benchmarks itself against.

On January 24, the price of &lt;a href="w%3AUnleaded"&gt;Unleaded&lt;/a&gt; fuel in Bathurst dropped only 2 cents from 119.9 cents to 117.9 cents. Today, Coles Express on Durham Street has increased the price of their unleaded fuel to the previous level of 119.9 cents.

Wikinews has discovered in its investigations that the price of unleaded petrol at sites in the &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Mountains%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Blue Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney's&lt;/a&gt; Inner-West have either stabilised or reduced by a further 1 to 2 cents following the initial mid-January price cuts.

Unleaded petrol 93 km from Bathurst at &lt;a href="w%3AMedlow%20Bath%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Medlow Bath&lt;/a&gt; was a whopping 12 cents per litre cheaper, at 107.7 cents. Fuel in Sydney's Inner-West was only 2 cents per litre less than Medlow Bath, despite being a similar distance apart. Curiously, the price of fuel in Medlow Bath has been stable, while the price in Sydney's Inner-West has actually dropped by 1 to 2 cents.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has won the 4-match Pepsi cricket series against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indian%20cricket%20team"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by 3-1 today in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVadodara"&gt;Vadodara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

India won the match by a huge difference of 160 runs. India made 341 runs in 50 overs by losing 3 wickets. Sachin Tendulkar completed his 41st century in only 76 balls. Mahendra Singh Dhoni made 40 runs in just 20 balls, hitting 1 four and 3 sixes.

West Indies played under pressure and lost their wickets in regular intervals. The highest-run partnership of the West Indian innings was of 65 runs between Samuels and Ramdin. The team were all out on 181 runs in 41.4 overs. Agarkar and Kumble took 2 wickets each.

Player of the match as well as player of the series, Sachin Tendulkar, performed well. He made his 41st ODI century which is the highest by any player in the One-Day international. He made 191 runs (avg 63.66) and took 3 wickets (avg 37.33) in 4 matches in the series.

Officials from &lt;a href="w%3ATAG%20Heuer"&gt;TAG Heuer&lt;/a&gt; have announced that the company received the iF product design award, which was given away by the jury from the International Forum Design. TAG Heuer received the award for its concept &lt;a href="w%3Awatch"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt;, called Monaco Calibre 360 (Linear Second) Concept Chronograph.

The jury that gives away the iF product design awards each year consists of leading design experts from all over the world gathered in one place. The iF awards are presented in &lt;a href="w%3AHanover"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Forum%20Design"&gt;International Forum Design Hannover GMBH&lt;/a&gt;. There are a number of fields and disciplines which have their own awards. 

TAG Heuer's Monaco Calibre 360 LS Concept Chronograph has won the award in the Leisure/Lifestyle category. The timepiece was chosen from over 2,200 watches from 35 countries. This prestigious award was given to the company for the second time in two years. Last year the winner in the same category was TAG Heuer's Professional &lt;a href="w%3AGolf"&gt;Golf&lt;/a&gt; Watch, designed together with &lt;a href="w%3ATiger%20Woods"&gt;Tiger Woods&lt;/a&gt;. 

This year's winning timepiece from TAG Heuer has a mechanical movement, which represents the first in the history of watchmaking to reach a precision of 1/100th of a second. The watch itself is to be seen at the iF design exhibition &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, held in Hanover, from &lt;a href="w%3AMarch"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt; 15 till &lt;a href="w%3AAugust"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Confirmed bird flu death in Nigeria</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Confirmed%20bird%20flu%20death%20in%20Nigeria&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A woman, one of three people who recently died of flu like symptoms, in Lagos, Nigeria, has tested positive for the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of Avian influenza.

It is the first &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; since the strain arrived in Nigeria a year ago. H5N1 was confirmed in blood samples tested in Rome and London from the three recent deaths.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; stated that while the threat from avian flu has decreased from last year, there still remains flare-ups around the world, urging countries to "remain vigilant and fully cooperate with international organizations".

<h3>Avian influenza</h3>
Bird flu is spread by wild birds for whom the virus is a stomach disease and, generally, not fatal.

Although the disease has killed 164 people, it has only been out of 269 cases, this gives the disease around a 60% fatality rate compared to the 1918 &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20Flu"&gt;'Spanish flu' pandemic&lt;/a&gt; which had a mortality rate of around 5%.

<h4>Structure</h4>
The outer coat of the &lt;a href="w%3Avirus"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; particle is characterised by two types of &lt;a href="w%3AGlycoprotein"&gt;glyco-proteins&lt;/a&gt;, neurominidase and haemagglutinin, both of which interact with &lt;a href="w%3ASialic%20acid"&gt;sialic acid&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AHemagglutinin"&gt;Haemagglutinin&lt;/a&gt; has sixteen forms, H1 to H16, and binds to sialic acid on the target cell, facilitating the entry of the virus.

&lt;a href="w%3ANeuraminidase"&gt;Neurominidase&lt;/a&gt; is found in nine forms, N1 to N9, this protein allows the progeny viri to escape the infected cell by cleaving sialic acid.

<h4>Anti-viral drugs</h4>
The two main drugs against bird flu currently on the market, &lt;a href="w%3ATamiflu"&gt;Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARelenza"&gt;Relenza&lt;/a&gt;, both target the sialic acid binding pocket of neurominidase. Neither of these drugs will cure the disease, but will stop its spread through the body. As such they have to be administered within 48 hours of symptoms appearing. In all 9 sub types of neurominidase, the structure of the target area for the drugs is the same. There is also a &lt;a href="w%3AFlu%20vaccine"&gt;flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; but the current flu vaccine does not protect against H5N1.

<h3>Catching the disease</h3>
Human to human &lt;a href="w%3ATransmission%20and%20infection%20of%20H5N1"&gt;transmission&lt;/a&gt; is very rare, at the moment bird flu can only be caught from prolonged exposure to infected birds, specifically their droppings from which the bird flu virus has been crystallized and parts of the structure solved. 

Unlike diseases such as smallpox and measles, for which their are effectively protecting &lt;a href="w%3Avaccine"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, the flu virus constantly &lt;a href="w%3Amutation"&gt;mutates&lt;/a&gt;. Each year the virus is slightly different from the last, this is the &lt;a href="w%3Agenetic%20drift"&gt;genetic drift&lt;/a&gt; of the virus - small point mutations on the surface, causing an evasion of our &lt;a href="w%3Aimmune%20system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the problems arise when there is a &lt;a href="w%3AAntigenic%20shift"&gt;major shift&lt;/a&gt; of the surface proteins, for instance when a different subtype appears, such as H5. 

There are three strains of human influenza circulating around the globe; &lt;a href="w%3AH1N1"&gt;H1N1&lt;/a&gt; first isolated in 1933, &lt;a href="w%3AH2N2"&gt;H2N2&lt;/a&gt; first isolated in 1957 and &lt;a href="w%3AH3N2"&gt;H3N2&lt;/a&gt; first isolated in 1968. Other than humans; pigs, seals and horses have various strains of influenza, however only wild birds have all the known subtypes of haemagglutinin and neurominidase. Of the 144 combinations of N(1-9) and H(1-16) we have had three.

Tata paid investors 608 pence a share, whereas the Brazilians final offer in an auction by the U.K.'s Takeover Panel was 603 pence.

The deal triples Tata Steel's capacity to almost 28 million tons a year. Tata: "This is the first step in showing that Indian industry can step outside its shores into an international market place as a global player." 

Corus, which was created from the merger of British Steel and Hoogovens, currently employs 47,300 people worldwide. Last year the company was the ninth-largest steel maker worldwide. 

The takeover may start a round of consolidation in the fragmented steel sector.

Police were called to the &lt;a href="w%3AHighgrove%20House"&gt;Highgrove House&lt;/a&gt;, the home belonging to &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales"&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href="w%3ACamilla%2C%20The%20Duchess%20of%20Cornwall"&gt;Camilla&lt;/a&gt;, on Tuesday night after police received a call that there was an intruder on the property.

"He was detained within the grounds and did not gain access to any buildings," said a spokesperson for the police, Tony Rymer.

A spokesperson for the estate refused to comment to the media calling it "a matter for the police" and that any comments on the intrusion should be given through them.

According to a Gloucester Police spokeswoman, a man from &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; was arrested after wielding a pitchfork around the property. The name of the 55-year-old has not been released, but police charged him with trespassing. He was later released after posting bail.

Camilla and Charles, who were both present and sleeping on the estate at the time, were not injured.

The movie entitled ♡❤Bride Has Massive Hair Wig Out♡❤ that was released on the 18th of January shows a woman who is going to get married within hours, but instead she cuts off all her hair. 

First, the woman, named Jodie, who has just got her hair done at the hairdressers', comes back to a hotel room where three bridesmaids are doing last-minute preparations. She runs in and falls to the ground screaming that her hair is ugly. They try to comfort her, but that isn't enough for the so called "Bridezilla": she cuts off her hair with a pair of scissors while the bridesmaids watch, taping it all on video camera.

The video, which is still on the main page of YouTube, has been watched over 2 million times. The person who posted the video, wigoutgirl, claims to be 25 and from &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. It is speculated that the video was shot in a &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; hotel room.

Some YouTube users are saying that it is fake, some say it's real.

<h2>Poster was a student at Toronto's Ryerson University</h2>

On February 1, 2007, the original poster, wigoutgirl, removed the video from YouTube. She is a student at &lt;a href="w%3ARyerson%20University"&gt;Ryerson University&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070201/You_tube_folo_070201/20070201%3Fhub%3DTopStories"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The 22-year-old, Jodi Behan, did cut her hair. The video was filmed by Ingrid Hass, a Ryerson University graduate.

They did it to promote their acting skills.

"I mean, there's going to be lots of different things you're going to have to do for acting parts so why hold out?" said Jodi Behan. "We're all actors so we're really excited for all the opportunities for everyone."

American singer, &lt;a href="w%3ABrandy%20%28entertainer%29"&gt;Brandy Norwood&lt;/a&gt;, known for her role as a judge on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%27s%20Got%20Talent"&gt;America's Got Talent&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ amongst other roles, has been sued for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;50 million by the family of a woman who was killed in a car crash.

California Highway Patrol (CHP) said that Brandy, 27, should be charged with a misdemeanor count of vehicular manslaughter for being part of the fatal car crash that killed Awatef Aboudihaj, 38.

Aboudihaj's family lawsuit accuses Noorwood, known as Brandy, of "reckless driving".

Brandy, in a &lt;a href="w%3ALand%20Rover"&gt;Land Rover&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASport%20utility%20vehicle"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; on December 30, 2006, bumped into the &lt;a href="w%3AToyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; which had Awatef Aboudihaj in it. The Toyota slammed into another vehicle and slid on the freeway's center divider. Aboudihaj was sent to Providence Holy Cross Medical Centre but died the next evening.

"The accident was a terrible tragedy, and Brandy's heart goes out to Awatef Aboudihaj's family," spokeswoman, Kelly Mullens, said in a statement. "But for legal reasons we cannot comment on this lawsuit."

If Brandy is charged, she could face one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Corp."&gt;Microsoft Corp.&lt;/a&gt; is establishing, in &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, a center for research and development. The center will work on the company's &lt;a href="w%3AMSN"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt; service. It will be Microsoft's first research and development center of this kind outside the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; 

Microsoft decided to take this step because of several setbacks that occurred in its online services working in China. One of the company's setbacks concerns the resignation of Luo Chuan, who was Microsoft's top executive responsible for the Chinese &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Live"&gt;Windows Live&lt;/a&gt; unit. 

The company's new research and development center is to be established in Shanghai's Zizhu Science Park. At this location, where another giant, &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; Corp, already has its research office, Microsoft plans to develop &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt;.

The center is estimated to cost $ 20 million. It will have a special technical support team that will work on Microsoft's MSN Messenger. The company hopes to make its online communication tool popular among Chinese teenagers and young professionals.

Microsoft already has an R&amp;D center in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. However, the software giant lacks a facility to work with its well-known MSN service. Investing in its communication tool may strengthen the company's leading position on the Chinese market.

Setting up the MSN research and development center in Peoples Republic of China implies that Microsoft looks forward to taking advantage of the Chinese market, which represents a quite flexible environment. This statement was made by Doug Crets, who works at Media Partners Asia as a &lt;a href="w%3AHong-Kong"&gt;Hong-Kong&lt;/a&gt;-based analyst.

&lt;a href="w%3AJ%20K%20Rowling"&gt;J K Rowling&lt;/a&gt;, the author of the "&lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;" series, has revealed the release date of the seventh and final installment - &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Deathly%20Hallows"&gt;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%2021"&gt;July 21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. Mary GrandPre, the illustrator of the first six books, will return to illustrate the new novel. 

The book will be released worldwide at midnight by the publisher Scholastic. Huge crowds are expected around the world, and the book, since its first appearance on Amazon.co.uk, had risen to the number one sale for pre-orders. After the new book was announced, Amazon.com reported a surge of traffic occurred on their website. Amazon.com has called the novel "one of the most eagerly awaited books of all time".

J K Rowling recently wrote the following about her new book: "I'm now writing scenes that have been planned, in some cases, for a dozen years or even more, I don't think anyone who has not been in a similar situation can possibly know how this feels: I am alternately elated and overwrought. I both want, and don't want, to finish this book (don't worry, I will.)"

Technology giant &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; is reportedly looking into cutting prices on &lt;a href="w%3APlaystation%203"&gt;Playstation 3&lt;/a&gt; gaming consoles. 

Even though Sony loses about (U.S.) $200 for each unit sold, the company believes that selling units for less will increase sales of games and peripherals, which is apparently where the company makes the most profit. By reducing prices on Playstation 3 units, Sony's gaming division is looking to break even by 2008. 

The report is not indicative that Sony will reduce the price of the console, only that it is looking into doing so.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20Columbia%20government%20gives%20Canadian%20sextuplets%20blood%20transfusions&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Last Friday the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; government gave blood transfusions for two of the four surviving &lt;a href="w%3APremature%20birth"&gt;premature&lt;/a&gt; babies in spite of the &lt;a href="Canadian%20sextuplets%20could%20get%20blood%20transfusion%2C%20religion%20forbids%20it"&gt;parents' beliefs&lt;/a&gt;. Two babies had died from being premature: one a couple days after it was born, the other a couple of weeks after.

The B.C. government applied Section 30 of the B.C. Child, Family and Community Service Act in an attempt to save the babies born in &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. The decision was only made public yesterday.

If doctors feel that the infants are in immediate need, they may ask for intervention.

The parents, who are unnamed due to a court order, are &lt;a href="w%3AJehovah%27s%20Witnesses"&gt;Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;/a&gt; who object to blood transfusions on religious grounds. When asked by Canadian reporters why they are against blood transfusions, a spokesman for the Jehovah's Witnesses cited a Bible passage:

"And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people," Leviticus 17:10-14.

The parents have accused the B.C. government of violating their children. They have asked the court to block future transfusions.

B.C. premier &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Campbell"&gt;Gordon Campbell&lt;/a&gt; said yesterday, "We act, I think, with the children's best interest in mind, and we will continue to do that," 

The father of the sextuplets said in a court affidavit, "(My wife) and I could not bear to be at the hospital while they were violating our little girl,"; "We took our immense sadness and grief and tried to console each other in private."

The babies were back in the parents' custody since the transfusions were finished.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Senate has approved a bill that will increase the federal minimum wage to $7.25 [USD] over a period of two years. If passed and signed into law, this will mark the first time the minimum wage has been increased in 10 years. The measure will also decrease the amount of taxes that small businesses pay by about 8.3 billion dollars, which will balance out the cost to raise the minimum wage.

"[This is] a victory for the American people. Passing this wage hike represents a small but necessary step to help lift America's working poor out of the ditches of poverty and onto the road toward economic prosperity" said Edward Kennedy (D) the representative of the state of &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.

The measure passed with 94 votes. Three votes were cast against the bill.

Despite the approval, the full &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; and the full Senate must agree on the measure before the bill is to be signed into law by president &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

The current federal minimum wage is $5.15 [USD].

&lt;a href="w%3ADavao%20City"&gt;Davao City&lt;/a&gt; militant leaders known as Davao 8 announced last Monday, January 29, their vindication from the rebellion charges thrown against them March last year as police officers release a notarized apology and retraction letter last week.

In a press conference headed by &lt;a href="w%3ABagong%20Alyansang%20Makabayan"&gt;Bagong Alyansang Makabayan&lt;/a&gt; (BAYAN) Southern Mindanao, the militants are glad with what they described as a "tactical victory of the street parliamentarians in the struggle for justice and in the assertion of the rights and welfare of
the ordinary Filipinos."

Last year, eight local progressive leaders were linked to rebellion charges filed against &lt;a href="w%3ABayan%20Muna"&gt;Bayan Muna party-list&lt;/a&gt; Rep. Joel Virador in the heat of the crackdown against progressive groups during the pronouncement of the State of National Emergency or Presidential Proclamation 1017.

In reaction to the accusations, Davao 8 filed before the People's Law Enforcement Board an administrative case against two (2) Criminal Investigation and Detention Group Region 11 (CIDG-11) operatives April 6 last year.

BAYAN secretary general Ariel B. Casilao, Bayan Muna party-list regional coordinator Jeppie Ramada, Kalipunan ng Damayang Mahihirap (Urban Poor Union, KADAMAY) Davao City chairperson Editha Duterte, Samahan ng mga Maralitang Kababaihang Nagkakaisa (United Urban Poor Women, SAMAKANA) Davao City Chapter chairperson Corazon Espinoza, Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (Peasant Movement of the Philippines, KMP) regional chairperson Antonio Flores and then Anakbayan (Youth of the Nation) leader Lorie Ann A. Cascaro filed affidavit-complaints attached with a copy of the false and perjured affidavit of Police Officer 3 Franco Duca and Chief Investigator 2 Rex Rodriguez both officers of the CIDG-11, Camp Leonor, San Pedro St., Davao City for their false, baseless and malicious accusation hurled against the eight leaders of progressive organizations in Davao City.

The said police officers of the CIDG submitted an apology and retraction letter duly notarized to the accused progressive leaders and the case was amicably settled.

Casilao said that the result of the case is a tactical victory for progressive organizations in the city. "Our vindication proves that what we fight for are the legitimate demands and causes of the people," he added.

He cited this as proof that the police and the military are crafting charges against them to discredit their organizations despite the continuing crackdown against progressive militant leaders across the country.

"All they could produce are fabricated cases against us to blind the people from the truth. They continue to discredit us, tag us terrorists, when the real terrorists are being coddled in &lt;a href="w%3AMalaca%C3%B1ang"&gt;Malacañang&lt;/a&gt;, with its fascist, anti-people and pro-US policies," Casilao said.

<h2>Arroyo uses "communist fronts" tag for the first time</h2>

In her speech Wednesday, Arroyo said there was a discrepancy with the figures presented by PNP Task Force Usig and the "front organizations of the communists". She was referring to the statistics on extrajudicial killings which spurred international outcry.

Arroyo's latest statement angered militant group Bayan declaring Thursday they will not cooperate in any &lt;a href="w%3AMalacanang"&gt;Malacanang&lt;/a&gt;-initiated investigation into extrajudicial killings after &lt;a href="w%3AGloria%20Macapagal%20Arroyo"&gt;President Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; uses "legal communist fronts" tag for the first time.

"Her pronouncement shows the government's official attitude towards legal activist organizations. She herself has encouraged the killings of activists just by referring to them as communist fronts," Reyes said.

In a press statement, Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes Jr. said "Mrs. Arroyo's pronouncement of a new investigation is meant to appease the growing outrage of the international community. However, the truth remains that the Arroyo administration has masterminded and encouraged the killings on a nationwide scale."

"Arroyo wants us to cooperate yet in the same breath she calls us front organizations of communists. How can you cooperate with that?" he added.

Reyes vowed their group "can never cooperate with murderers nor with a government that has sanctioned death squads."

The ban includes no smoking in hospitals, airports, schools, places of employment and any public area that is "closed or covered." Eleven months from now, the ban will include restaurants and cafes.

Some members of France's Parliament are surprised to see how quick the ban was enacted.

"Nobody, not even I, thought a year-and-a-half ago that France would abandon tobacco so fast," said member of Parliament (&lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt;) and an advocate of the prohibiting of smoking, Yves Bur.

Police and other law enforcement agents are required to fine anyone who violates the ban. Fines for smoking in banned areas could be as much as $88.00 [USD]. Employers who do not enforce the smoking ban could be fined at least $174.00 [USD].

At least 15 million people who live in France smoke cigarettes, but a poll conducted by the French government had shown that 76% of the country's population was in favor of the ban. 74% of the population also backs the restaurant and cafe ban to take place in one year.

The Prime Ministers of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;, have been banned from travelling to Fiji following the discovery of Ms Clark's and Mr Howard's names on an immigration list by &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20Television"&gt;Fiji Television&lt;/a&gt;.

The Immigration Department list bans people from entering Fiji, and bans some people from leaving Fiji. The list also contains the names of civil and political activists, businessmen, politicians, and trade union officials.

Ms Clark says that self-appointed Fijian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Bainimarama"&gt;Voreqe "Frank" Bainimarama&lt;/a&gt; is only digging himself a bigger hole and that it would be unwise to listen to anything that Mr Bainimarama had to say.

Mr Bainimarama said that if he can't visit their countries, then they shouldn't be allowed to visit his country.

Both Australia and New Zealand had already put a ban in place preventing high ranking politicians and officials from entering either country because of their disapproval of the recent Fijian coup which Mr Bainimarama led. The two countries have also imposed other sanctions.

An advertising campaign for shows on &lt;a href="w%3AAdult%20Swim"&gt;Adult Swim&lt;/a&gt;, a programming block on Cartoon Network, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting, gave local and federal law-enforcement a scare when devices were discovered on eight different bridges and roads.

The U.S. city of &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; was snarled in traffic jams January 31 as police investigated devices with flashing lights representing a cartoon character were placed around bridges and other areas throughout the city. 

Different governmental agencies were brought in to help deal with the problem, which was later found to be no threat, as described by Boston Police Department spokesperson Eddy Chrispin. A bomb squad was deployed under supervision of the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;, Boston police, the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;US Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and different federal agencies. 

The advertising campaign, for the widely popular program &lt;a href="w%3AAqua%20Teen%20Hunger%20Force"&gt;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&lt;/a&gt;, featuring characters from that series, was in place for two to three weeks in Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and many other major US cities.

Two people have been arrested for alleged participation in this incident. 
Turner Broadcasting Systems hired New York marketing firm Interference Inc. which in turn hired individuals in the various cities to place the devices promoting the cartoon's fifth season, scheduled for a February 23 premiere. Road and rail traffic was disrupted by police as they investigated and removed the devices.

The mostly flat devices resemble two-foot-square &lt;a href="w%3ALite-Brite"&gt;Lite-Brite&lt;/a&gt;s with batteries attached to the bottom and visible wires.

&lt;a href="w%3AG4TV"&gt;G4TV&lt;/a&gt; has dubbed the incident "&lt;a href="w%3AAquagate"&gt;Aquagate&lt;/a&gt;" on its broadcast of &lt;a href="w%3AAttack%20of%20the%20Show"&gt;Attack of the Show&lt;/a&gt; segment &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Feed"&gt;The Feed&lt;/a&gt;.

It is not known why the devices took police several weeks to notice, nor why the devices were believed to be dangerous.

&lt;a href="w%3ASony%20Ericsson"&gt;Sony Ericsson&lt;/a&gt; announced on Wednesday that it will produce low-cost mobile handsets featuring color screens and music capability in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The company has reached agreements with Singapore and Taiwan based companies, &lt;a href="w%3AFlextronics"&gt;Flextronics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFoxconn"&gt;Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; to manufacture the phones.

Sony Ericsson said that besides competitive prices, Sony Ericsson mobile phones will provide customized features, including local content and a customized keypad for the Indian market, in a press statement.

The company achieved success and became the fourth biggest cell phone producer in the world with premium phones that included such features like &lt;a href="w%3ACybershot"&gt;Cybershot&lt;/a&gt; digital cameras and Walkman music players. The analysts say that if the company looks forward to become number three producer of mobile phones it needs to focus on low cost phones. Providing mobile phones for customers with lower income is a strategy that analysts consider to be quite useful for Sony Ericsson.

Speaking at a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3AChennai"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt;, the president of Sony Ericsson, &lt;a href="w%3AMiles%20Flint"&gt;Miles Flint&lt;/a&gt;, said that manufacturing in India will result in improved cost efficiencies and enable the company to provide attractive cell phones at competitive prices. 

A Japanese-Swedish joint venture, Sony Ericsson surpassed the third largest mobile phone maker &lt;a href="w%3ASamsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; in terms of revenue in the fourth quarter, through sales of its upmarket line of phones.

According to the unnamed official, Franken said that he is planning to run for the senate in 2008 during a conversation.

The director of Franken's Midwest Values Political Action Committee has refused to comment on the reports, and Franken has made no official announcement himself.

Earlier this week, Franken announced on his ♡❤Air America♡❤ Radio show that he will no longer be hosting the show, but also said that he would make a decision about the senate race in the near future.

The &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; government faces a censure motion filed by &lt;a href="w%3APanhellenic%20Socialist%20Movement"&gt;PASOK&lt;/a&gt; opposition party which doubts the governmental program and demands parliamentary elections. As PASOK party leader, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Andreas%20Papandreou"&gt;George Papandreou&lt;/a&gt; stated today at the &lt;a href="w%3AGreek%20Parliament"&gt;Greek Parliament&lt;/a&gt;,
Mr.Papandreou condemned government and Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AKostas%20Karamanlis"&gt;Kostas Karamanlis&lt;/a&gt; personally, as being responsible for poor governmental performance in economy and public sector. In her speech, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AKKE"&gt;Greek Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (KKE), &lt;a href="w%3AAleka%20Papariga"&gt;Aleka Papariga&lt;/a&gt; expressed the opinion that the whole discussion will end in political deadlock and blamed the two major parties for "hypocrisy". 

The Greek Parliament decided to host a three-day discussion between the parties which will end on Sunday with a vote of all the 300 members. In their first speeches today, PASOK MPs including &lt;a href="w%3AEvangelos%20Venizelos"&gt;Evangelos Venizelos&lt;/a&gt; as well as opposition's parliamentary representative, MP Charis Kastanidis, attacked the government and asked for immediate elections. In his response today at the parliament, &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20the%20Interior%2C%20Public%20Administration%20and%20Decentralisation%20%28Greece%29"&gt;Minister of Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AProkopis%20Pavlopoulos"&gt;Prokopis Pavlopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, blamed PASOK for its past years of governance and stated that elections will not take place until the end of government's job. The &lt;a href="w%3Aconservative"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democracy"&gt;New Democracy&lt;/a&gt; party was elected in government in &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; after 11 years of continuing PASOK governance.

At least 19 people have been killed in central &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href="w%3ALady%20lake%2C%20Florida"&gt;Lady Lake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APaisley%2C%20Florida"&gt;Paisley&lt;/a&gt; after severe storms and a tornado ripped through the cities in the middle of the night. Eleven of those killed were in Paisley and three were in Lady Lake.

The death toll is expected to rise as rescue crews resume tomorrow morning.

Volusia, Sumter, Lake and Seminole counties have all been declared a state of an emergency as dozens of houses, mobile homes and a church were destroyed. Clothes and furniture are scattered around the wrecked houses and pieces of trees are scattered about. Cars are reported to have been turned over or thrown around in the air.

"Our priority today is search and rescue," said Gov. of Florida, &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Crist"&gt;Charlie Crist&lt;/a&gt;. Rescuers are still looking through the wreckage to find survivors of those who might have been killed.

A spokeman for the emergency response team of Lake county, Chris Patton calls the damage "devastating" and worse than "hurricanes in 2004."

"We have complete devastation of homes, of businesses, religious institutions. It was unlike even perhaps the hurricanes of 2004 when we had minor roof damage, screen damage, pool damage. This is way far more devastating," said Patton. 

The storms hit at about 3:15 [EST] a.m. on Friday morning. At least 20,000-30,000 people are without power.

Yesterday, &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; was told by &lt;a href="w%3AViacom"&gt;Viacom Inc.&lt;/a&gt; to remove over 100,000 video clips thought to possibly feature content produced by Viacom owned companies after the two failed to reach an agreement for revenue sharing. Viacom said its content posted without permission on YouTube generate about 1.2 billion video streams, based on a study from an outside consultant.

Viacom owns popular American companies such as &lt;a href="w%3AMTV%20Networks"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Entertainment%20Television"&gt;Black Entertainment Television&lt;/a&gt; (BET) and &lt;a href="w%3ANickelodeon"&gt;Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt;.

Many users on YouTube upload copyrighted videos without permission everyday, sometimes unknowingly.

"YouTube and Google retain all of the revenue generated from this practice, without extending fair compensation to the people who have expended all of the effort and cost to create it," said Viacom in a statement.

"It's unfortunate that Viacom will no longer be able to benefit from YouTube's passionate audience which has helped to promote many of Viacom's shows," a YouTube spokesperson said. "We will continue to work with content partners large and small to provide them with a platform to promote their content and engage and grow their audiences."

Companies such as &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; have reached deals with YouTube over using their content.

After deliberating for 11 hours a jury found Joya Williams, now former Executive Administrative Assistant for &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Coca-Cola%20Company"&gt;Coca-Cola Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, guilty of plotting to steal Coke's secrets to sell them to &lt;a href="w%3APepsi"&gt;Pepsi Inc&lt;/a&gt;.

Williams, 41, took confidential documents and unreleased samples of products to Ibrahim Dimson and Edmund Duhaney in an attempt to sell the items to Pepsi for about US$1.5 million. Dimson and Duhaney also pleaded guilty.

Williams claimed in court that even though she brought the documents and unreleased samples to her home, Dimson and Duhaney went into her home and took them. Duhaney denied the statement and said Williams gave the documents and unreleased samples to them.

In May 2006, Coca-Cola received a letter from the &lt;a href="w%3APurchase%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Purchase, New York&lt;/a&gt; based company Pepsi stating that a person had offered to sell samples and other confidential information regarding Coke products to Pepsi.

The former secretary could face up to 10 years in prison.

At 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, 10-15 &lt;a href="w%3AUFO"&gt;UFOs&lt;/a&gt; were spotted over north &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; in the inner-city district of &lt;a href="w%3AIslington"&gt;Islington&lt;/a&gt;. The Islington police said they started receiving phone calls only minutes after the objects started appearing.

34 year-old market stall trader Alix McAlister, who witnessed the objects, said that, "I just picked up my son from nursery in Bredgar Road. I had just come out of the door when I noticed what was going on in the sky. There were a group of them - 10 to 15 of them moving together. My first impression was that they reminded me of a squadron of aeroplanes in formation. But they didn't have a proper formation and they were all moving at the same speed. I thought for a while that something was happening in the centre of London. Bombs and planes crossed my mind. But I realised very quickly that they didn't look like any aircraft I'd seen before. They were coming from the north and moving south. And then they kind of stopped and they were hovering. There was no sound. They seemed to fade away and I saw more coming and then they stopped. It lasted about 10 minutes."

The &lt;a href="http%3A//contactinternationalufo.homestead.com/"&gt;Contact International UFO Research&lt;/a&gt; organization was informed about the event by the Islington police and one of the witnesses. A spokesmen for the organization said that the witness had told them, "He told me he was picking his daughter up from school and he saw many people looking up in the air. Traffic had stopped and people were staring. He said he saw between 12 and 15 orange lights travelling across the sky. Then they would stop and then they went upwards."

A &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Apache military helicopter has been shot down in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad, Iraq&lt;/a&gt; says a military spokesman.

Reports say that the chopper went down near the U.S. air base, Taji, located just north of downtown Baghdad.

"I can confirm that we are looking into reports that a helicopter went down north of Baghdad," said Lt. Col. Josslyn Aberle, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military. 

At least 2 soldiers were on board the aircraft, but their condition is not known.

Witnesses near the scene and police say that at least 2 Apaches were flying together when insurgents began to shoot at the choppers, shooting one of them down and hitting the other, but the helicopter still managed to fly away. The helicopters were believed to have been escorting a U.S. military convoy on the ground when shots were fired.

"I saw smoke coming out of the tail. The chopper was swinging around before it hit the ground one kilometer away from me and I heard a big explosion," said local farmer, Hashim Assafi who also said that he had to find shelter as shots were fired in the direction of the helicopters.

In a statement posted on an Al-Qaeda in Iraq website, insurgents claim responsibility for shooting down the helicopter.

"We say to the enemies of God that the sky of the Islamic state of Iraq is forbidden just like its land," said the statement.

This is the fourth helicopter operated by the U.S. military to crash or be shot down in two weeks.

1,000 turkeys in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; have been confirmed by UK government officials as dying of a strain of avian flu and a further 1,600 have died since the infection was initially reported. The birds, believed to be from a &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Matthews"&gt;Bernard Matthews&lt;/a&gt; owned farm in &lt;a href="w%3ASuffolk"&gt;Suffolk&lt;/a&gt; fell ill and died this week after contracting the H5 strain of the flu. It is likely that all other poultry on the farm will be culled.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs"&gt;Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/a&gt; confirmed on Saturday (3rd February 2006), that the turkeys had contracted the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of the virus. (See &lt;a href="H5N1%20hits%20Britain"&gt;H5N1 hits Britain&lt;/a&gt;) .
The &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs"&gt;Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/a&gt; were told of the turkeys condition on Thursday (1st February 2007) and instantaneously ordered restrictions to be placed on the farm. The department were swift in carrying out a full investigation and sent samples to be tested at facilities in Weybridge.

This report comes less than a year after a mass culling of 50,000 birds in &lt;a href="Norfolk"&gt;Norfolk&lt;/a&gt; after an outbreak of the H7 strain.

For the protection directives in place on the infected area, see &lt;a href="H5N1%20hits%20Britain"&gt;H5N1 hits Britain&lt;/a&gt;.

The project, which examines urban decline in cities across the globe is sponsored by Germany's Federal Cultural Foundation. 

♡❤Shrinking Cities♡❤ includes contributions from more than 200 artists, architects, researchers, filmmakers, journalists, culture experts, and sociologists aimed not only at showing the effects of this global phenomenon but also exploring how to deal with it.

The project, which began in 2002, involves local teams from four cities: &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, USA, &lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, Britain, &lt;a href="w%3AIvanovo"&gt;Ivanavo&lt;/a&gt;, Russia and &lt;a href="w%3AHalle%2C%20Saxony-Anhalt"&gt;Halle&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ALeipzig"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;, Germany. The teams examined the negatives and the positives of urban decline. Along with the exhibit contribution of the team and international idea competition was launched.

♡❤Shrinking Cities♡❤ premiered in Berlin in 2004 and later traveled to Halle and Leipzig Germany. In Detroit it will run from 3 February until 1 April. &lt;a href="w%3ACranbrook%20Art%20Museum"&gt;Cranbrook Art Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the newly founded &lt;a href="w%3AMuseum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%20Detroit"&gt;Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit&lt;/a&gt; will cohost the exhibit, with buses running in between the two.

&lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;, the deadly strain of bird flu that has already claimed many lives in Asia, was confirmed this morning as the strain that killed 2,600 turkeys on a farm in &lt;a href="w%3ASuffolk"&gt;Suffolk&lt;/a&gt;. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ADefra"&gt;Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/a&gt; (DEFRA), conducted further tests to determine the strain after it was found that most of the turkeys on a &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Matthews"&gt;Bernard Matthews&lt;/a&gt; farm showed signs of illness and tested positive for &lt;a href="w%3Aavian%20flu"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt; in preliminary tests.

As a further precaution, 159,000 turkeys from the same farm will be culled.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20council"&gt;European Council&lt;/a&gt; issued a directive stating that a protection zone (a zone where all birds are to be kept indoors and biologically tested for the flu) should be set up on a 3 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometer"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; radius from the infected farm. They also ordered a 10 km radius "surveillance" zone whereby the sale of birds at markets is banned, water used by domestic and wild birds is to be kept separate, pedestrian movement is limited, an increased awareness of the symptoms of affected birds and birds are not to be transported unless being transported to slaughter.

Officials are confident that the outbreak has been contained but ask people to be vigilant.

<h3>Help lines</h3>

Suffolk County Council also set up a helpline for people with queries or if they find birds showing signs of malaise: 08456 032 814.

Defra has also made general advice on avian-flu available on its
helpline: Defra Helpline - 08459 33 55 77

Fire destroyed a building that hosted the Five Spot night club in Philadelphia’s historic &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20City%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Old City&lt;/a&gt; section. No one was injured in the blaze,

Firefighters battled for two hours to control the flames and people were evacuated from nearly buildings. Reports indicate that at least one wall inside the group of buildings that make the Five Spot collapsed, causing major structural damage. The fire was contained to three buildings, authorities say.

The Five Spot brought an eclectic mix to Philadelphia’s &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20City%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Old City&lt;/a&gt; section where the business had thrived for 11 years. 

During an interview the owner said, "It was just time. We were looking to sell ... to somebody who would carry on the tradition." 

Lovett Hines, a longtime guru of the Philadelphia Jazz music scene said the club was a creative caldron of sorts for the neo-jazz genre. Cohen of Gloucester City said, “It was heart-wrenching; A lot of us were in tears.”

Conflicting media reports say that at least 128 people have been killed and over 220, possibly over 350, were injured in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad, Iraq&lt;/a&gt; after a truck packed with at least a ton of explosives blew up inside the Sadriyah market. 

Officials say that the death toll will likely climb, and officials for the Iraqi Health Ministry say that 105 have been killed and over 330 injured.

The truck was supposed to be delivering food, oil and flour to the market when the driver detonated the explosives. 

"It was a suicide attacker who entered the market at a time when it was packed with people. There are still bodies under the rubble," said head of the Interior Ministry explosives department, Major General Jihad al-Jabiri.

"It was a strong blow. A car exploded. I fell on the ground," said a young man with a bandaged head who was in the explosion.

Victims were trapped under piles of rubble, and the surrounding area was completely destroyed. At least 10 buildings have been leveled as a result of the blast.

No claim of responsibility for the blast has been made.

A curfew has been issued for the surrounding area which is set to expire at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday. All roads leading into and out of the area have been shut down.

This is the biggest attack to take place since November 23, 2006 when at least 215 people were killed when insurgents &lt;a href="w%3A23%20November%202006%20Sadr%20City%20bombings"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; a Sadr City Shiite slum.

CNN had recently confirmed that 373 people were injured, along with 128 (currently) killed.

An airplane, a &lt;a href="w%3APiper%20Cherokee"&gt;Warrior PA28&lt;/a&gt; that went missing at 1700 GMT may have been found Saturday night, February 3rd as rescuers searching for the airplane have discovered wreckage about a mile from South Shore near &lt;a href="w%3ABlackpool"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

The pilot of the air plane reported to Blackpool Tower that he was low on fuel before 5 pm Saturday evening and disappeared from radar screens shortly afterwards.

There is no news about the two men who were on board the airplane. The weather conditions on parts of the coast are described as foggy.
Three lifeboats, two coastguard teams and an RAF helicopter are searching for the airplane which was believed to have been traveling from Exeter to Blackpool, says Lancashire Police.

Fourteen houses have been destroyed and another 3 damaged by a bush fire burning in Jarrah forests and farmland near the historical timber town of &lt;a href="w%3ADwellingup%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Dwellingup&lt;/a&gt; 70km south east of &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. 

The fire has also destroyed approximately 100 power poles, leading to a loss of telecommunication services to the town and affecting water supplies. Mobile generators have been installed for emergency power. 

Steve Slavin, spokesman for Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC), said that 250 fire-fighters are containing the fire with crews concentrating on the southern front, which is now within 3 &lt;a href="w%3Akilometer"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; of the town. 

Mr Slavin said "Our concern is that winds this afternoon will be swinging around to the south and increasing in intensity." 
"It's making us nervous. The advice we're giving to people in Dwellingup is if they've decided that they will leave, this would be a good time to do it" 

In separate fires near &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Yunderup%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;North Yunderup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGreenfields%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Greenfields&lt;/a&gt; and Parkland have affected transmission lines supplying power to approximately 56,000 properties. 

Additional fires are burning near &lt;a href="w%3AToodyay%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Toodyay&lt;/a&gt; 85km north east of Perth, Another fire is burning near &lt;a href="w%3AWilliams%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt; approximately 160 south east of Perth and 90Km east of Dwellingup. And in the southern rural suburb of &lt;a href="w%3AForrestdale%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Forrestdale&lt;/a&gt;. These fires are reported to be under control.

Western Australian Police Arson squad are investigating these fires as some appear to be deliberately lit. The Police are also investigating the death of a women in her mid 20's who died on Saturday after her car rolled while fleeing the fire near Toodyay.

The won against the in a 29-17 victory at a rain-soaked &lt;a href="w%3ADolphin%20Stadium"&gt;Dolphin Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Gardens%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami Gardens, Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Quarterback was named the game's &lt;a href="w%3AMost%20Valuable%20Player"&gt;Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt;.

Colts coach became the first African American to coach an American football team to &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; championship, now in its 41st year. He also became the third person, after &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Ditka"&gt;Mike Ditka&lt;/a&gt; and , to win a Super Bowl as both a coach and as a player: Dungy was on the 1978 Pittsburgh Steelers team that won Super Bowl XIII.

Indianapolis did not look like a winning team early in the game. After Chicago won the coin toss, &lt;a href="w%3ADevin%20Hester"&gt;Devin Hester&lt;/a&gt; returned the opening Indianapolis kickoff for a 92 yards for a touchdown, giving Chicago the fastest lead in Super Bowl history. 

On the Indianapolis first drive of the game, Peyton Manning threw an interception to Bears defensive back &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Harris"&gt;Chris Harris&lt;/a&gt;. However, Chicago could not capitalize on the turnover and punted back to Indianapolis. 

Manning seemed to get comfortable on the next possession, and burned the Bears defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to &lt;a href="w%3AReggie%20Wayne"&gt;Reggie Wayne&lt;/a&gt;. Indianapolis did not convert the touchdown, after punter/holder &lt;a href="w%3AHunter%20Smith"&gt;Hunter Smith&lt;/a&gt; fumbled the snap on the extra point attempt.

This was the first of many weather-induced errors for both teams. Indianapolis's &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Mathis"&gt;Robert Mathis&lt;/a&gt; forced a turnover after Chicago tight end &lt;a href="w%3AGabe%20Reid"&gt;Gabe Reid&lt;/a&gt; fumbled &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Vinatieri"&gt;Adam Vinatieri's&lt;/a&gt; bouncing kickoff. But on the next play, Indianapolis gave it back when running back &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Add"&gt;Joseph Addai&lt;/a&gt; fumbled a handoff and defensive end &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Anderson"&gt;Mark Anderson&lt;/a&gt; recovered it.

Chicago scored the next touchdown when &lt;a href="w%3ARex%20Grossman"&gt;Rex Grossman&lt;/a&gt; threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to receiver &lt;a href="w%3AMuhsin%20Muhammad"&gt;Muhsin Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;, giving his team a 14-6 lead. After forcing a punt, Chicago lost another turnover when &lt;a href="w%3ACedric%20Benson"&gt;Cedric Benson's&lt;/a&gt; fumble was recovered by Colts lineman &lt;a href="w%3ADwight%20Freeney"&gt;Dwight Freeney&lt;/a&gt; on the Bears 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field goal attempt.

Following a Chicago punt, Indianapolis drove 47 yards and scored with Vinateiri's 29-yard field goal to make the score 14-9. Chicago was forced to punt again on their next drive. On the next Indianapolis drive, &lt;a href="w%3ADominic%20Rhodes"&gt;Dominic Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last, a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16-14 lead with 6:09 left in the second quarter. 

After another Chicago punt, the Colts advanced to the Bears 36-yard line before defensive back &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Tillman"&gt;Charles Tillman&lt;/a&gt; ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from receiver &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Fletcher"&gt;Bryan Fletcher&lt;/a&gt;. But on the next play, Grossman fumble a snap and defensive back Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With 2 seconds left, Vinateiri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left and the score remained 16-14 at halftime.

Vinatieri redeemed himself in the second half, kicking two field goals in the third quarter to make the score 22-14. Chicago kicker Robbie Gould made a 44-yard field goal to cut the score to 22-17, but they were the last points Chicago would score in the game. On Chicago's next drive, Colts defensive back Kelvin Hayden intercepted a pass intended for Muhsin Muhammad and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown, to make the score 29-17.

The Colts managed to tame the Bears offense for the remainder of the game. Colts defensive back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass on the next Chicago drive. After trading possessions, Chicago got the ball back one last time with 1:42 in regulation, but it was not enough for Grossman.

Rhodes finished with 113 rushing yards and a touchdown, while Addai rushed for 77 yards and caught 10 passes for 66 yards. Wilkins returned 4 kickoffs for 183 yards and 3 punts for 42 yards. Jones was the Bears top rusher with 112 yards, while also catching 4 passes for 18 yards. Tight end Desmond Clark was the Bears top receiver with 6 receptions for 64 yards. Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown, with 2 interceptions. The Colts finished with 430 total net yards while the Bears only had 265.

In &lt;a href="w%3ACatania"&gt;Catania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, a police officer has died as a consequence of &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20%28soccer%29%20hooliganism"&gt;football violence&lt;/a&gt;. In the hospital 40-year-old Filippo Raciti succumbed to his injuries. A small explosive device had struck him in the face. Several hooligans have been arrested but no suspect has been arrested for the death of Raciti yet.

Clashes erupted after the &lt;a href="Serie%20A"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASicilian%20derby"&gt;Sicilian derby&lt;/a&gt; between Catania and &lt;a href="w%3APalermo"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt;. The match, which started earlier because of public safety concerns, had already been interrupted once, after 58 minutes. After a controversial goal from &lt;a href="w%3AAndrea%20Caracciolo"&gt;Caracciolo&lt;/a&gt; (which may or may not have been &lt;a href="w%3AOffside%20%28football%29"&gt;offside&lt;/a&gt;), fans started rioting and tear gas drifted onto the field. "We had to go back to the changing rooms because we couldn't breathe. If we cannot get into our heads that football is a sport we cannot live in the world of football." said Palermo coach &lt;a href="w%3AFrancesco%20Guidolin"&gt;Francesco Guidolin&lt;/a&gt; reacted.

After 40 minutes the players were able to resume the match, which Palermo won 2-1. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Di%20Michele"&gt;Di Michele&lt;/a&gt; used his hand to score the winning goal, which the referee didn't notice. After the game was over, aggression continued outside the football stadium, with dozens of injured taken to the hospital.

In response to the ongoing football violence in Italy and after this particular incident, &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Football%20Federation"&gt;Italian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; commissioner &lt;a href="w%3ALuca%20Pancalli"&gt;Luca Pancalli&lt;/a&gt; suspended all professional, amateur and national team matches. He had warned about such a measure earlier last Sunday after riots in several cities. Catania chairman and owner Antonino Pulvirenti stated his intention to leave the football world. In a reaction to the events, Maurizio Zamparini, chairman of the Palerma football team, called for stricter football laws, such as in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20minister%20of%20Italy"&gt;Italian prime minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt; stated: "...we need a strong and clear signal to avoid the degeneration of this sport which we are seeing more dramatically and more often."

The day after the events, graffiti appeared in the headquarters of local newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AIl%20Tirreno"&gt;Il Tirreno&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALivorno"&gt;Livorno&lt;/a&gt; and in the city of &lt;a href="w%3APiacenza"&gt;Piacenza&lt;/a&gt;, hailing the events as revenge for the death in 2001 of anti-globalization activist &lt;a href="w%3ACarlo%20Giuliani"&gt;Carlo Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;. Giuliani was killed during demonstrations against a &lt;a href="w%3AGroup%20of%20Eight"&gt;Group of Eight&lt;/a&gt; summit in 2001.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGeological%20Survey%20of%20Canada"&gt;Geological Survey of Canada&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that there is a higher probability that a major earthquake could strike the south coast of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; within the next week. The alert comes after seismologists began monitoring a grouping of small tremors moving north along the cascadia subduction zone from nearby &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington State&lt;/a&gt;. 

The phenomenon is called &lt;a href="w%3AEpesodic%20Tremor%20and%20Slip"&gt;Epesodic Tremor and Slip&lt;/a&gt; (ETS), and it occurs on average every 14 months. ETS is causing the fault to begin moving in the opposite direction, in this case, &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Island"&gt;Vancouver Island&lt;/a&gt; is actually shifting to the west, instead of to the east. This causes an added pressure on the strained fault line, and leads to the higher probability that a major earthquake could occur.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACascadia%20subduction%20zone"&gt;Cascadia subduction zone&lt;/a&gt;, running from Vancouver Island to northern California is one of the most volatile &lt;a href="w%3Ageologic%20fault"&gt;geologic fault lines&lt;/a&gt; in the world. Unlike the well known San Andreas fault, which has the potential of generating earthquakes in the 7&amp;ndash;8 range, the Cascadia fault line has the potential of releasing mega quakes in the magnitude 9 range - the size of the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;Sumatra quake&lt;/a&gt; that killed over 250,000 people, mostly from the tsunamis it triggered. 

A quake of that magnitude could devastate a wide area, including &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Victoria, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%2C%20Washington"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, a denselypopulated area with close to 6 million residents.

The Canadian geological survey points out, however, that this is only a higher probability, and the chances of a cataclysmic earthquake in the next week is still relatively low.

Vancouverites often are unaware of the potential risk right below their feet. 

"Living in Los Angeles, we always got those little reminders every time the ground rumbled. We are indeed living in Earthquake Country. Up here, though, we don't get them as often, so I think people really forget that we live in an earthquake zone. And because we don't get those little shocks from time to time, that stress is just building and building, and who knows, these little tremors we're getting now, might be the straw that breaks the camel's back."

<h1>Scholar says Jehovah's Witnesses wrong about blood transfusions</h1>

Bible scholar Professor Michael Duggan, who teaches biblical literature at the Catholic &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Mary%27s%20University%20College%2C%20Calgary"&gt;St. Mary's University College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary, Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, says the &lt;a href="w%3AJehovah%27s%20Witnesses"&gt;Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;/a&gt; have taken a bible reading out of context which the parents of Canada's first sextuplets used to back up their belief. 

His comment is regarding the following text from &lt;a href="w%3ALeviticus"&gt;Leviticus&lt;/a&gt; 17:10-14:

Duggan says the passages refer to the blood of slaughtered animals. He also argues the "way the Jehovah's Witnesses read the biblical text is simply wrong."

"The point that I make to the physicians is none of these texts has to do with human blood," said Duggan. "Certainly, they never had to do with transfusions." 

"What they have to do with is the handling of animals that are slaughtered and the cooking and the procedures in cooking the meat so as to be free of contamination and disease."

The parents of the sextuplets tried to stop the hospital from giving their babies a blood transfusion. The &lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Assembly%20of%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Government of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; gave four of them transfusions. It only became public on Friday.

Two of the infants have died from ailments that physicians argued could have been helped by blood transfusions.

The parents are now asking the B.C. government for an apology, as their right to practice their religion has been interrupted.

&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; – 
Cell phones, cigarette lighters and &lt;a href="w%3Alightstick"&gt;glowsticks&lt;/a&gt; are raised in tribute as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACircle%20of%20Life"&gt;Circle of Life&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ begins playing. Soon cheers drown out the song as the multicoloured performers appear on stage. A somewhat unusual introduction; but this is no ordinary show, and these are no ordinary attendees. This is &lt;a href="w%3AFurther%20Confusion"&gt;Further Confusion&lt;/a&gt;, the second largest &lt;a href="w%3Afurry%20convention"&gt;furry convention&lt;/a&gt; in the world.

The volunteer organizers have something to cheer about, too; have gathered from far and wide at the DoubleTree Hotel to indulge their love of &lt;a href="w%3AAnthropomorphism"&gt;anthropomorphics&lt;/a&gt;, and Further Confusion's 9th year is its largest, with a paid attendance of 2061. Their gains mirror those of , a similar convention held in &lt;a href="w%3ASchaumburg%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Schaumburg, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; which grew 35% last November.

Both events feature art shows and auctions, live puppetry performance, masquerades, variety shows, games and parades, as well as panels that range from science and technology to society, sex and spirituality. Filling out the schedule, the hotel walls are lined with announcements of public and private room parties for separate groups. At night, the disco floor fills with dancing cats, dogs, and dragons.

For some, dressing up plays a large part of the convention - almost 300 brought a full costume. There are few professional mascots here, though, and only one or two of the costumes would be recognized by even the most avid cartoon-watcher. Instead, each act is planned and performed by other attendees, wearing "&lt;a href="w%3AFursuit"&gt;fursuits&lt;/a&gt;" of their own design. Many play off the year's secret-agent theme — "Fur Your Eyes Only".
Other fans seem content to restrict themselves to small accessories — perhaps some combination of paws, ears, or tail. Each fur bears a 3"x2" badge detailing their personal character, or "". Often these characters are better-known than the people who play them.

It may seem lighthearted, even frivolous, but these conventions are becoming big business. Furry fans spent over $180,000 for lodging during the five days (Jan 18-22) of Further Confusion, and another $50,000 at the art auction. Attendees also purchase all manner of merchandise from attending dealers and artists, from on-the-spot art commissions and comic books of all ratings to prints, sculptures, and plush toys - even their very own fluffy tail.

Of course, any business has risk, and conventions can drain wallets when the sums just don't add up. The first furry con, &lt;a href="w%3AConFurence"&gt;ConFurence&lt;/a&gt; in Southern California, ran successfully for over a decade, but cost its new organizer an estimated $60,000 in its last four years due to falling attendance before folding in 2003.

&lt;a href="w%3AAnthropomorphic%20Arts%20and%20Education"&gt;Anthropomorphic Arts and Education&lt;/a&gt; board member says that won't happen to Further Confusion. Indeed, the convention ran a healthy surplus of almost $30,000 on $125,000 revenue last year, allowing it to pay off the last of its old debts and save for the future. As Torkelson explains: "The idea is if for some reason, say an earthquake happens, and it cripples the revenue stream, the convention will be able to survive into the next year. It does help our staff to know that we have [a reserve]."

The reserve also gives AAE the financial flexibility to fund charities throughout the year, a big part of its &lt;a href="w%3A501%28c%29%283%29"&gt;501(c)(3)&lt;/a&gt; mandate. Over the nine years of the convention, attendees have raised over $60,000 for a variety of &lt;a href="w%3Aanimal%20sanctuary"&gt;animal sanctuaries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Awildlife%20refuge"&gt;wildlife refuges&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AComic%20Book%20Legal%20Defense%20Fund"&gt;Comic Book Legal Defense Fund&lt;/a&gt;.

Further Confusion's hopes for the future are high. Chairwoman Laura Cherry noted that, unlike previous years, the board has "gone all out" for next year's tenth anniversary, booking as many rooms as the hotel could offer. The host for 2009 has yet to be decided, but for many fans the question was not whether the current hotel will reach a limit, but when - and where - the convention will find a new home.

A tribunal setup by the &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n government has pronounced its verdict on a century-old dispute between the two south Indian states of &lt;a href="Karnataka"&gt;Karnataka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Tamil%20Nadu"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; regarding the sharing of water from the &lt;a href="w%3ACauvery%20River"&gt;Cauvery River&lt;/a&gt;.

The federal government's Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal was created 17 years ago to resolve the dispute. The tribunal's ruling today allotted approximately 60% of the water flowing through the Cauvery river to the downstream state of Tamil Nadu. 

Police in Karnataka's capital city of &lt;a href="Bangalore"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; have taken preventative measures against possible riots over the verdict. Over 700 people were taken into preventive custody on Monday morning prior to the tribunal's announcement. Additionally, over 16,000 policemen have been deployed, particularly in areas with large Tamil populations.

Many offices, schools and retail stores in Bangalore have shut down early today, in anticipation of trouble.

<h2>Identification of tourists killed in Chile hotel fire underway</h2>
The identity of eight of the ten tourists killed in a fire in a hotel in Punta Arenas, Chile on Saturday have been established by authorities. 

They are Jennifer Kusell, 23; Philippe Bayer, 27; Peter Konig, 55; and Maria Katharina Konig, 51 from Germany and an Argentinian family Esteban Omar Torales, 28; Jorgelina Andrea Diaz, 24; and their children Franco Esteban, 6, and Facundo Sebastian, 8. Authorities say the other two victims are Canadian and Australian women, and not Dutch as previously reported. 

A fire department spokesperson said most of the victims had apparently died of suffocation. The cause of the fire was being investigated, and investigators say the hotel's rooms did not have fire detectors.

In the aftermath of the bush fires around &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; the Western Australian government has offered a $A200,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of an &lt;a href="w%3AArson"&gt;arsonist&lt;/a&gt;.

Premier &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Carpenter"&gt;Alan Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;, who is visiting the area of the Dwellingup fires said, "It is almost inconceivable that anybody could be so stupid and so criminally, willfully damaging to the community as to go about setting a fire deliberately in these circumstances".

Further fires were lit today near &lt;a href="w%3AYanchep%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Yanchep&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Forrest%20National%20Park"&gt;John Forrest National Park&lt;/a&gt; both fires are believed to be deliberately lit as they had multiple ignition points. 

Earlier this morning the Dwellingup fire, assisted by strong easterly winds , broke containment lines and threatened the town of &lt;a href="w%3ACoolup%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Coolup&lt;/a&gt;. Additional flareups and spot fires from embers have now been contained. This fire has burnt more then 11,000 hectares so far. 

Spokesman for the Department of Environment and Conservation, Murray Mitchel says that firefighters were trying to consolidate the fire in preparation for Wednesday's expected 40C (104F) temperatures. A fire weather warning has been issued for the south west of Western Australia.

The return of &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Dell"&gt;Michael Dell&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;Chief Executive Officer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3Acomputer"&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt; making giant &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; marked a series of changes. In his memo to the employees of the company he founded, Michael Dell said that there will be no bonuses and that the company will reduce its management in an effort to cut costs.

2006 was not a financial success for Dell. It lost its leading market position to &lt;a href="w%3AHewlett-Packard"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ASEC"&gt;SEC&lt;/a&gt; started investigating Dell for possible accounting improprieties. Several executives also left during recent months. 

The daily newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AAustin%20American-Statesman"&gt;Austin ♡❤American-Statesman♡❤&lt;/a&gt; reported the Rollins memo and posted on its website a copy of the e-mail. The e-mail was confirmed by Dell's spokesman for the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤. 

Michael Dell's memo also outlined the fact that all bonuses would be replaced by so-called "limited discretionary awards". The beneficiaries of such awards will be all but senior management. There will also be a shortening in the period of stock investing.

General Dan McNeil, the highest-ranking U.S. general, will soon lead NATO forces in Afghanistan.

Following a year of increasing violence in the south of &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; forces began to attack the heartland of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;. NATO Commander General McNeil is expected to enact a more aggressive policy towards militants than his predecessor, British General &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Richards%20%28general%29"&gt;David Richards&lt;/a&gt;. General Richards supported a peace agreement in the city of Musa Qala, but his plan of action failed when an estimated 200 &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; fighters overran the town on Thursday. McNeil was appointed two weeks after the Defense Department extended the tour of 3,200 10th Mountain Division soldiers. 

Col. Tom Collins, a spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt;, said that McNeill's arrival and increased troop levels underscored American commitment in Afghanistan. Today there are 26,000 troops in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; compared to 9,500 troops in 2002. About 14,000 of these troops are under &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; command, 12,000 of whom train Afghan forces in the area. McNeil, who served in Afghanistan in 2002-2003, said "We will quit neither post nor mission until the job is done or we are properly relieved."

"We were called at around 9.40 this morning to reports of a suspect package at a business address in Victoria Street," said a spokesperson for Scotland Yard.

Victoria Street has been shutdown from &lt;a href="w%3AWestminster%20Abbey"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt; to Scotland Yard while rescuers and police investigate the incident.

"Officers are attending the scene to establish the circumstances. As a precaution, a cordon has been put in place around the scene," said another police spokesperson.

The bomb was inside a "jiffy bag" which held the letter which was contained inside a padded envelope. The explosion occurred inside the office's mailroom.

The woman who was injured was not believed to be the target. Police will not say to whom the letter was addressed.

There are no reports of other injuries or deaths so far.

"We are not in a position to discuss who may or may not be responsible at this stage," said police.

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n prosecutors have charged a school headmaster with using pirated copies of &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; software on school computers. The teacher, Mr. Alexander Ponosov, pleaded not guilty and claimed that he did not know that the purchased computers were loaded with pirated software. 

The Russian president criticized the move against the teacher, saying it was "ridiculous" to arrest someone for using computers and that the distributors of pirated software should be targeted rather than users.

Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also urged Microsoft to intercede in the case, asking Microsoft's mercy for the teacher and adding that the teacher, if convicted, may face "imprisonment in Siberian camps". 

Mr. Gorbachov said that many people in Russia regard this scandalous case as trumped-up, launched on the initiative of Microsoft corporation to set a precedent.

A group of almost 150 prominent British Jews has launched a new organisation, &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Jewish%20Voices"&gt;Independent Jewish Voices&lt;/a&gt;, and criticized the British Jewish establishment for its uncritical views on &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. An open letter titled "A Time to Speak Out: Independent Jewish Voices" was published in Monday's edition of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATimes%20of%20London"&gt;Times of London&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and reprinted on the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGuardian"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡s online site, stated that the group has "come together in the belief that the broad spectrum of opinion among the Jewish population of this country is not reflected by those institutions which claim authority to represent the Jewish community as a whole" and that the leaders of Britain's Jewish community, the &lt;a href="w%3ABoard%20of%20Deputies%20of%20British%20Jews"&gt;Board of Deputies&lt;/a&gt;, has "consistently put support for the policies of an occupying power above the human rights of an occupied people," referring to Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip areas, which have been occupied and illegally settled by Israel since 1967.

The letter was signed by over 140 prominent writers, actors, academics and intellectuals including author and writer &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Fry"&gt;Stephen Fry&lt;/a&gt;, academic &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Klug"&gt;Brian Klug&lt;/a&gt;, historian &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Hobsbawm"&gt;Eric Hobsbawm&lt;/a&gt; and film director &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Leigh"&gt;Mike Leigh&lt;/a&gt;.

Klug, in an article published in ♡❤the Guardian♡❤ announcing the launch of the group, argues for its necessity by asserting that the Board of Deputies actions in defence of Israel "suggests that British Jewry, speaking with one voice, stands solidly behind the Israeli government and its military operations," despite the fact that, according to Klug, "Jews were deeply divided over Israel's campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon last year."

The launching of the new group comes on the heels of a dispute within the American Jewish community after the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Jewish%20Congress"&gt;American Jewish Congress&lt;/a&gt; published an essay titled "Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism" in which criticism by liberal Jews of Israel was criticized as facilitating antisemitism.

Former &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;federal Liberal&lt;/a&gt; leadership contender &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; will run in the next federal election in &lt;a href="w%3AParkdale%E2%80%94High%20Park"&gt;Parkdale—High Park&lt;/a&gt;, the same riding he represented in the provincial legislature until earlier this year. This will be the former Ontario Education minister's first run for a seat in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Canadian House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;.

The federal riding was held by fellow Liberal &lt;a href="w%3ASarmite%20Bulte"&gt;Sarmite Bulte&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20election%2C%202006"&gt;last year's federal election&lt;/a&gt; when she was defeated by &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeggy%20Nash"&gt;Peggy Nash&lt;/a&gt;. The NDP's &lt;a href="w%3ACheri%20DiNovo"&gt;Cheri DiNovo&lt;/a&gt; also took the provincial riding, formerly held by Kennedy, in a &lt;a href="w%3Aby-election"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt; last year. 

Bulte had hoped to try to retake her seat for the Grits but is expected to step aside and allow the Liberal nomination to go to Kennedy. Bulte and Kennedy have announced a press conference to be held on Tuesday to make an "important joint announcement".

Two other former leadership contenders without seats in the House of Commons, &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMartha%20Hall%20Findlay"&gt;Martha Hall Findlay&lt;/a&gt; are also eying Toronto area ridings. Both of them are reported to have hopes of running in the safe Liberal seat of &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Centre"&gt;Toronto Centre&lt;/a&gt; now held by former interim party leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt; who is considering retirement. CTV News has reported that Liberal leader &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Dion"&gt;Stephane Dion&lt;/a&gt; may offer Rae the Liberal nod in the riding of &lt;a href="w%3AMississauga%E2%80%94Streetsville"&gt;Mississauga—Streetsville&lt;/a&gt; currently held by &lt;a href="w%3AWajid%20Khan"&gt;Wajid Khan&lt;/a&gt; who sat as a Liberal until he &lt;a href="w%3Acrossing%20the%20floor"&gt;crossed the floor&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year to join the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AMehmet%20Okur"&gt;Mehmet Okur&lt;/a&gt; scored 12 of the last 14 points for the &lt;a href="w%3AUtah%20Jazz"&gt;Utah Jazz&lt;/a&gt; in the final minutes of their game against the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Bulls"&gt;Chicago Bulls&lt;/a&gt; on Monday night, propelling the Jazz to a 100-95 win against the Bulls. Okur finished with 20 points and was the high scorer for the Jazz, who now have won three in a row. He played most of the fourth quarter despite picking up a fifth foul early in the final period. In addition to Okur's contribution, &lt;a href="w%3ADeron%20Williams"&gt;Deron Williams&lt;/a&gt; contributed 18 points and 13 rebounds in the effort.

&lt;a href="w%3AKirk%20Hinrich"&gt;Kirk Hinrich&lt;/a&gt; was the game's leading scorer with 26 points, and &lt;a href="w%3ALuol%20Deng"&gt;Luol Deng&lt;/a&gt; contributed 23. However, the Jazz shot 50% from the field and dished out 24 total assists. The Bulls could not match those numbers, only shooting 40% and earning 15 assists. The lack of ball movement was obvious early on, as the Bulls committed three offensive fouls in the second quarter - all as the result of Bulls players attempting to drive the ball rather than pass and try to break the effective zone of the Utah Jazz. Ben Gordon also picked up a flagrant foul early in the second quarter, starting off what would be an ugly twelve minutes for the visiting Bulls. The Bulls were outscored 33-18 in the second quarter, leaving them down 57-43 at the half.

It almost wasn't enough of a lead for the Jazz, as the Bulls were able to fight back and cut the lead to three with a three-point shot from &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Duhon"&gt;Chris Duhon&lt;/a&gt; with 1:20 remaining in regulation time. However, the Jazz answered right back with an Okur three-point field goal, and the Bulls could not recover. While the Bulls would answer back with another field goal, the Jazz would score the next four points and pull away with the victory.

Jalal Sharafi, An &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; diplomat has been kidnapped by men wearing &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; army uniforms who also had official Iraqi defense ministry ID badges. The abduction took place outside the Iranian state-owned Bank Melli in Baghdad.

Several men who were also in possession of official ID badges for the Iraqi Defense Ministry were captured by Iraqi Security Forces after a small gun battle, ♡❤BBC News♡❤ reports. The car which was carrying the abducted diplomat was not caught.

According to an unnamed Iraqi official, the ID badges were in fact "authentic," but it was not known if the men were released from the ministry or the army. The uniforms appeared to be from the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion, which is under the direction of the U.S. military.

Iran called the abduction a "terrorist act" and accuses the U.S. of being directly involved with the abduction and has arrested several Iraqis.

"Based on reliable information, the group which has committed this completely terrorist act, are active under the supervision of the American forces and some of them have been arrested. There is a record of their previous acts," said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mohammad Ali Hosseini who also said that the U.S. will be directly responsible for the life of the diplomat.

"The Islamic Republic of Iran holds the American forces in Iraq responsible for the life and safety of the Iranian diplomat and condemns this action strongly and wants the quick release of the Iranian diplomat," added Hosseini.

No comment has been released by the U.S. military, but they deny any involvement in the abduction and cannot confirm the diplomat has been abducted.

Last month US forces detained five Iranians working for an informal consulate in northern Iraq. Iranian diplomat Faridoun Jihani was 2004 detained south of Baghdad by a Sunni group.

Official pressure on the &lt;a href="w%3AHare%20Krishna"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt; community near Almaty in &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; is mounting, according to Norwegian religious rights organisation &lt;a href="w%3AForum%2018"&gt;Forum 18&lt;/a&gt;. Following on from the demolition of homes at the end of last year three more home owners have been issued with demolition notices. If the owners fail to demolish their own houses the authorities have warned they will do so themselves and charge them for the cost.

Thirteen homes owned by members of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Society%20for%20Krishna%20Consciousness"&gt;International Society for Krishna Consciousness&lt;/a&gt; were bulldozed last November, although other homes in the village owned by non-Hare Krishna residents were not touched. Gauhar Beyeseyeva of the Kazakh Foreign Ministry is quoted as saying (to the members of the Hare Krishna commune) "We were denied the &lt;a href="w%3AOSCE"&gt;OSCE&lt;/a&gt; chairmanship specifically because of you people." 

Amanbek Muhashov, the chair of the committee for religion under the justice ministry told the Kazakh daily ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstanskaya%20Pravda"&gt;Kazakhstanskaya Pravda&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that some of the group members acquired land for the settlements by giving misleading information and thus the property did not conform to local regulations. This is refuted by the members of the community.

The OSCE's Advisory Council on &lt;a href="w%3AReligious%20freedom"&gt;Freedom of Religion&lt;/a&gt; or Belief examined the dispute in detail last year and concluded that "state sponsored action has been focused upon members of the Hare Krishna community in a manner that suggests they have been targeted on the basis of their religious affiliation," and that "this raises serious issues regarding the enjoyment of the freedom of religion and belief." The Advisory Council also stated its "willingness to meet with the Kazakh authorities in order to discuss the situation and to extend its good offices to assist in the resolution of that dispute". The Kazakh authorities have thus far given no official answer to the Advisory Council's 27 November 2006 offer.

A. Kravchenko, the head of the prosecutor-generals denied any "religious implications" in the legal proceedings.

On 29 January Viktor Golous, Chair of the Hare Krishna Community, was summoned to a court hearing to continue the case on the ownership of the commune's farm. At the same time, demolition notices were served on three more Hare Krishna home owners, who were told that they must demolish their own homes within five days. According to &lt;a href="w%3AForum%2018"&gt;Forum 18&lt;/a&gt; no previous notices had been given to any of the three Hare Krishna targets in regards to any claims filed against them, court hearings or court rulings. Thus they were unable to file an appeal and defend their property. 

Golous appeared in court on January 30th with request that that – due to the short notice given – the hearing should be adjourned at least until lawyers were able to appear. Judge Jurhan Zhailybayev accepted the application for an adjournment and told Golous that he could leave as notice of the new date of the hearing would be sent to him. However, after Golous left the court, Judge Zhailybayev ruled – with only one of the three defendants present – that the Hare Krishna-owned farm should, in fact, be confiscated.

Members of the 'Sri Vrindavan Dharm' community in Karasai district question who is benefiting from the confiscation of their property?

Rati Manjari of the Hare Krishnas told Forum 18 on January 20th that "by this new claim the authorities are preparing to cancel a 2005 Supreme Court decision that the Hare Krishna community are the bona fide purchaser and user of the land." She suggested that the authorities plan - "after they win this case" – to appeal to the Supreme Court to annul the Hare Krishna community's purchase and thus ownership of the land.

&lt;a href="Apple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; announced Monday it has settled its decades-long trademark dispute with the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Beatles"&gt;Beatles&lt;/a&gt;' record company, &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Corps"&gt;Apple Corps&lt;/a&gt;. Under this new agreement, Apple Inc. will own all Apple trademarks and will license some to Apple Corps, and will continue to use its name and logo on its &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; music service.

This new settlement replaces the 1991 agreement between the two companies, which defined the context in which the two companies could use the Apple trademark.

"We love the Beatles, and it has been painful being at odds with them over these trademarks," said Apple Inc. CEO &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;. "It feels great to resolve this in a positive manner, and in a way that should remove the potential of further disagreements in the future."

"The years ahead are going to be very exciting times for us," said &lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Aspinall"&gt;Neil Aspinall&lt;/a&gt;, manager of Apple Corps. "We wish Apple Inc. every success and look forward to many years of peaceful co-operation with them."

It was not disclosed whether the Beatles' music catalog was part of the deal.

Mulally says that Ford's decision to name all their cars with the letter F was a lackluster move, and makes their names easily forgettable. As a result, Mulally plans on reviving many respected Ford nameplates, the Taurus being one of them, and the Falcon possibly in the future.

The Ford Taurus was originally introduced in 1986, and was a revolutionary car that rewrote the rules for creating a sedan, and pushed the other American automakers to follow suit, leading to a design revolution that completely rid Detroit of the "boxy" cars of the 70s and 80s. The Taurus survived for four generations, selling over 7,500,000 units. The Taurus was discontinued in October 2006, after a brief run of 2007 models destined for fleet customers.

"How can it go away?" Alan Mulally remembered asking, "It's the best-selling car in America."

While it is not expected for the name change to turn the Five Hundred into a 400,000 plus units a year blockbuster like the Taurus, it is expected to make sales more solid, and to make the car well known, since the Taurus is a well known nameplate around the country.

&lt;a href="w%3AGarth%20Turner"&gt;Garth Turner&lt;/a&gt; Member of Parliament (MP) for &lt;a href="w%3AHalton%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Halton&lt;/a&gt;, has joined the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; after months of being an &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20%28politician%29"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt; MP.

Turner was elected with the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; in the January 2006 election, but was suspended in October from the Party after posting critical blog posts. After, there was some speculation the he would join the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt;, which has 0 elected MPs in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, the nations capital.
"Garth Turner is an exceptional Member of Parliament, known across Canada for his passion and accomplishments," said Liberal leader &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt; speaking in Ottawa today with Turner. "He is an outspoken advocate for fiscal prudence, progressive values and environmental sustainability, and I know Mr. Turner’s constituents of Halton will only be better served by his decision today."

"As a former &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Progressive Conservative&lt;/a&gt; MP and Cabinet Minister, I believe in being careful on money issues, but also generous on social ones," said Mr. Turner. "I have found Mr. Harper’s party to be too far right for my community of Halton, while the Liberal Party of Stéphane Dion now closely reflects those progressive values I’ve always believed in."

Now there is only one independent MP in the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; being &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Arthur"&gt;André Arthur&lt;/a&gt; for the riding of &lt;a href="w%3APortneuf%E2%80%94Jacques-Cartier"&gt;Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier&lt;/a&gt; in French speaking &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;.

Turner now has a video posted on &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Video"&gt;Google Video&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about joining the Liberals. See external links section below to watch.

In the video he says the Conservatives have an extreme right-wing agenda. He also adds that it is better to be in a Party than being independent.

Romney has spent the last few months rallying support around the country. Romney is the first of several &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;front runners&lt;/a&gt; to formally declare his candidacy.

Romney's record as a &lt;a href="w%3Amoderate"&gt;moderate&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="w%3ALatter-day%20Saint"&gt;Latter-day Saint&lt;/a&gt; faith are expected to be his primary campaign challenges.

Romney, born in Detroit, the son of former &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Michigan"&gt;Governor of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Romney"&gt;George W.

Romney ran against senior Massachusetts senator and Kennedy family member, &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. Romney won 41% percent of the vote against Kennedy in the closest election in Kennedy's entire tenure in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt;. Romney was also CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee which was in charge of planning the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;2002 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; from 1999 to 2002, he took charge after the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Winter%20Olympic%20bid%20scandal"&gt;2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3APrinceton%20University"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; has decided to join &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s project to digitise the book collections of major libraries to enable online searches of the texts, becoming the 12th major library to partner with Google. 

The officials from Google stated that Princeton University is to digitize about 1 million public domain books. These books are no longer under copyright. 

Princeton's 250 years old library has a collection of more that 6 million printed works, as well as about 5 million manuscripts and around 2 million nonprint items.

Together with Princeton's library system Google is to determine specific parts of the collection that will afterwards be digitized. 

Google's &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Book%20Search"&gt;Library Project&lt;/a&gt; is rather young, being introduced in late 2004. It started with a group of several major library systems. Among them there were: &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Public%20Library"&gt;New York Public Library&lt;/a&gt;, and several academic libraries of &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOxford"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStanford"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Michigan"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;.

The second flow encompassed library systems from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California"&gt;University of California&lt;/a&gt;, which was later followed by the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20Compultense%20of%20Madrid"&gt;University Compultense of Madrid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20library%20of%20Catalonia"&gt;Catalonia's National Library&lt;/a&gt;. Among others to join the second round were the universities of &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, Madison, &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin"&gt;Texas University&lt;/a&gt; at Austin.

The works that remain covered by the copyright law were digitized only at the libraries of Michigan and Texas. Google was sued in October 2005 by several major U.S. publishers. While the case is yet to come to trial, the publishers' goal is to block Google's plans to make a storage of copyrighted works that is free-to-use.

Even with six players in double figures, the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Celtics"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt; fell to the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Pistons"&gt;Detroit Pistons&lt;/a&gt; 109-102 on Tuesday night. The loss extends the franchise-record losing streak of the Celtics to 15 games.

The Celtics could not keep up with the Pistons during the game, falling behind 16 points at halftime and 22 points after three periods. A rally by the Celtics in the fourth period gave Boston a glimmer of hope but Detroit's starters returned to hold off the Celtics.

Pistons coach &lt;a href="w%3AFlip%20Saunders"&gt;Flip Saunders&lt;/a&gt; was not pleased by the effort his team gave in the fourth quarter. "Your main guys should have the opportunity to sit down and ice in the fourth quarter of a game like that," he said. "We had to bring those guys back with five minutes left to make sure we won the thing." A 16-2 run by the Celtics midway through the final quarter brought the team back to within 10 points of the Pistons, but the Detroit starters returned after a timeout to quash the burgeoning Celtics rally.

&lt;a href="w%3ADoc%20Rivers"&gt;Doc Rivers&lt;/a&gt;, Celtics coach, was less enthused by his team's late run.

"I'm not going to put a lot of stock in that. I'm not sure how much the other team was still competing at that point." Adding to the team's woes was the news that star &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Pierce"&gt;Paul Pierce&lt;/a&gt; was sent home by team doctors with an infection in his left elbow. This latest development will push Pierce's return to the lineup beyond the All-Star break. Pierce has missed the last 23 games with a foot injury.

While the Celtics trailed by only 5 points after one quarter, the Pistons shot 72% from the field in the second quarter, led by &lt;a href="w%3AAntonio%20McDyess"&gt;Antonio McDyess&lt;/a&gt; with 10 points. Rivers attributed the problem to the team's bench play. "The bench really put us in a hole in the second quarter - it was a five-point game when they went in there."

The Pistons are next at home against the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Lakers"&gt;Los Angeles Lakers&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, while the Celtics return home to face the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Heat"&gt;Miami Heat&lt;/a&gt; this evening.

The United States Army has confirmed that private security guards of the North Carolina security services company &lt;a href="w%3ABlackwater%20USA"&gt;Blackwater USA&lt;/a&gt; were employed in Iraq by military subcontractors, reversing earlier statements in which army officials denied knowledge of the contracts. 

Four security guards employed by Blackwater were killed by &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i militants in March 2004. Their families have sued the company, claiming the suit was the only way to disclose the events surrounding the deaths.

Locating the contract awarded to Blackwater has proved difficult -- the Pentagon has denied repeatedly that such a contract exists. The contract was extremely deeply nested beneath other contracts, obscuring its existence: KBR, a Halliburton subsidiary, has subcontracted to ESS Support Services Worldwide, which provides dining services. ESS hired Blackwater, but only indirectly, through a third company.

This was confirmed yesterday by Army secretary Francis Harvey, in a letter to Representatives Henry Waxman and Chris Val Hollen. This reverses earlier statements by Harvey, for example, in July he stated that KBR "has queried ESS and they are unaware of any services under the ... contract that were provided by Blackwater USA."

Van Hollen said, "This ongoing episode demonstrates the Pentagon's complete failure to safeguard taxpayer dollars."

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has scheduled a hearing on the Blackwater contract, to take place next Wednesday.

The winner of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; television reality show &lt;a href="w%3ACelebrity%20Big%20Brother"&gt;Celebrity Big Brother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AShilpa%20Shetty"&gt;Shilpa Shetty&lt;/a&gt; expressed her gratitude to Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; during a meeting at the U.K. Houses of Parliament.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABollywood"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt; actress observed prime minister's question time in the Commons before meeting Mr Blair himself. She thanked him for his support, describing him as "very sweet."

The visit took place following an invitation by Labour MP for Leicester South, &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Vaz"&gt;Keith Vaz&lt;/a&gt;, who led calls for action against the treatment of Ms Shetty during her stint on the reality TV show. Celebrity Big Brother was criticised by public and politicians alike last month after Ms Shetty's treatment by other contestants erupted in an international race row.

Today, she told reporters she had thanked the PM for his support "to me and my country".

Her visit drew widespread media attention and she was greeted at Parliament by a media scuffle, including over 20 reporters from her native &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.

"To see how so much respect has been bestowed upon me has truly been an honour," she added.

According to organisers, the Commons chef had even prepared a special dessert in her honour "Shilpa's delight" and she was also introduced to Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell. 

The actress was crowned winner of Celebrity Big Brother, following confrontations with fellow housemates Jade Goody, Jo O'Meara and Danielle Lloyd who were accused of bullying and racism. Despite denying the claims, all three lost most of their major endorsements and Jade and Danielle's partners are said to have left them.

Politicians became embroiled in the proceedings when media regulator Ofcom received more than 40,000 complaints from viewers.This resulted in the row reached both the House of Commons and India, where chancellor Gordon Brown's bridge-building visit was overshadowed by controversy caused by the programme.

In the evening, Ms Shetty travelled to the city of Leicester to meet with members of Keith Vaz' constituency. Reena Combo, editor of British Asian entertainment magazine Ikonz, was one of the guests. Ms Combo felt the visit would boost a sense of belonging amongst Leicester-South's largely Asian population.

"I think it's wonderful to see Shilpa Shetty taking the time to visit the people of Leicester. There has been a great deal of national interest in Shilpa since her appearance on Big Brother but many of the people here, especially the Asian community, have been fans of the Bollywood star for much longer so it’s nice to see her rewarding her loyal supporters."

"She has over the last few weeks become an inspiration to many and become very much a part of British life."

As yet, the Bollywood actress continues her tour of the country as an unofficial ambassador for the Indian film industry and has been invited to attend a Commonwealth reception at London's Marlborough House on March 12, where she will be meeting with the Queen.

A federal court has upheld a ruling given in 2004 granting &lt;a href="w%3Aclass%20action"&gt;class action&lt;/a&gt; status for a suit against the American retail giant &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt;. As many as 1.6 million or more women employees might file &lt;a href="w%3ALawsuit"&gt;civil suits&lt;/a&gt; alleging Wal-Mart discriminated against their sex.
Six women in 2001 claimed that the company paid them less than men. 

"It is time for Wal-Mart to face the music," said Brad Seligman, a lawyer representing the female plaintiffs. "Two courts now have ruled that Wal-Mart is going to have to face a jury ... We fully expect Wal-Mart to keep appealing but we're very confident now that two courts have upheld this (class) certification."

"Factual evidence, statistical evidence and anecdotal evidence present significant proof of a corporate policy of discrimination and support plaintiff's contention that female employees nationwide were subjected to a common pattern and practice of discrimination," said Judge Martin Jenkins.

This lawsuit only counts for female workers that have worked for the company since December 26, 1998.

A &lt;a href="w%3ACH-46%20Sea%20Knight"&gt;CH-46 Sea Knight&lt;/a&gt; helicopter crashed in the Al-Anbar province of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; approximately 20 miles outside of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. The helicopter was carrying seven passengers and crew at the time of the crash. No survivors were reported at the site. 

Major General William B. Caldwell, a spokesman for the U.S. military told reporters in Baghdad , "A quick-reaction force is on site and the investigation is going on as we speak." He did not specify whether mechanical failure or ground fire had brought it down. 

Witnesses at the crash site report seeing gunfire from the ground. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group of several Sunni insurgent groups, including &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; in Iraq, has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying one of its "air defense brigades" had shot it down.

Including Wednesday's most recent attack, the U.S. military has suffered five such helicopters crashes, resulting in the loss of 28 servicemen in the past 3 weeks. Since May 2003 the U.S. has lost 55 helicopters to mechanical failure and being shot down.

At the time of the crash the helicopter was conducting "routine operations". 

In response to recent losses the U.S. military has begun to implement new changes in flight operations. Although they would not stipulate the exact changes, General Caldwell insured the military was "making adjustments in our tactics and techniques and procedures as to how we employ our helicopters".

&lt;a href="w%3AGarth%20Turner"&gt;Garth Turner&lt;/a&gt; made his question period debut Wednesday in the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons"&gt;Canadian House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;.
Turner, again, asked the prime minister to put byelections in &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Emerson"&gt;David Emerson's&lt;/a&gt; riding of &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Kingsway"&gt;Vancouver Kingsway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWajid%20Khan"&gt;Wajid Khan's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMississauga%E2%80%94Streetsville"&gt;Mississauga—Streetsville&lt;/a&gt;. Emerson accepted an offer to join the &lt;a href="w%3AConservatives"&gt;Conservative Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; after he was elected as a Liberal last January. Khan in January, who was a special advisor to prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; for the Middle East and South Asia, also crossed the floor to the Conservatives.

Turner also said he would run again in his riding of &lt;a href="w%3AHalton%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Halton&lt;/a&gt; if Harper were to call a byelection. He added that he wants an immediate byelection if that were to happen.

"I will assure the member for Halton if he wishes to see a byelection in Halton, it's fully within his control. He can resign today, I'm sure we would comply," said House leader &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Van%20Loan"&gt;Peter Van Loan&lt;/a&gt;.

Turner promised yesterday at the weekly Liberal caucus meeting that he will not reveal secrets nor criticize his new Party.

A new version of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACanada%27s%20Food%20Guide"&gt;Canada's Food Guide&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was announced by Canadian Health Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Clement"&gt;Tony Clement&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 5, 2007. The guide has helped Canadians with healthy eating habits since 1942 but was last updated in 1992. It is the Canadian government's most-requested publication after income tax forms.

Changes to the Food Guide include:

<ul>
BULLET::::- a first-time recommendation to include a small amount of unsaturated fat in regular diets;
BULLET::::- physical activity to complement healthy eating;
BULLET::::- advice for some people to take vitamin supplements;
BULLET::::- an advisory to limit foods with excess salt, sugar, fat and calories, which is considered an unprecedented caution regarding &lt;a href="w%3AJunk%20food"&gt;junk food&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<h2>Criticism</h2>
Although many observers welcomed the new Guide, some complained that it does not adequately promote weight reduction. Other critics charged that there is undue food industry influence on the Guide's contents.

For a summary of the allegations of food industry involvement and a detailed discussion of the purported nutritional deficiencies of the new Guide, please see &lt;a href="http%3A//bmimedical.blogspot.com/2006/11/canadas-food-guide-to-unhealthy-eating.html"&gt;Canada's Food Guide to Unhealthy Eating&lt;/a&gt;.

Heavy snow has caused disruption in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; with airports and schools closed and delays on the road network.

Snowfall was highest near Worcester with 9cms of snow falling. The snow has caused hundreds of school closures and major disruption to airports with Birmingham, London Gatwick and City, Bristol and Cardiff runways closing although these have now re-opened. However the runways at Luton and Stanstead remain closed due to the bad weather.

The road network has also been affected with some snow settling and accidents occurring causing major congestion in some areas, althought gritting by the Highways Agency and local authorities has limited the effect on trunk roads and motorways.

Schools were closed in Birmingham, Solihull and Dudley, while some remained open in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, East Anglia and Wales, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire.

Drivers are being warned that driving conditions will continue to be adverse and are being advised only to travel if absolutely necessary.

Train services by Midland Mainline and Virgin as well as the London Underground are affected, with delays, reduced services and cancellations.

The overall economic effect of the snow is predicted to cost the British economy approximately £400 million due to loss of work hours.

There has also been loss of power in some areas of Wales including Abergaveny, Llandeilo and Blaenporth.

The snow fall is expected to continue into the evening but may turn to sleet in some areas. Also cold temperature tonight will mean that there is a high chance of ice forming on the road network. Up to 15 cm of snow is expected through the day in some hilly areas but wetter and milder weather is expected over the weekend.

<h1>China vows effective fight against internet piracy</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=China%20vows%20effective%20fight%20against%20internet%20piracy&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Under criticism from its Western trading partners, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; is working toward an effective resolution of issues regarding illegal downloading of movies and videos protected by &lt;a href="w%3Acopyright%20law"&gt;copyright law&lt;/a&gt;. Reports state that 205 websites were closed recently because of their illegal &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; activity.

Chinese officials state that in the period between &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember"&gt;September&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary"&gt;January&lt;/a&gt; they have investigated 436 cases of Internet piracy and ordered 361 Internet offenders to stop infringement of the copyright law. Overseas organizations requested investigation of 130 cases. 

Yan Xiaohong, who is currently the deputy director of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Copyright%20Association"&gt;National Copyright Association&lt;/a&gt;, mentioned at a news conference that Internet piracy in China caused serious damage to the interests of the copyright owners. This, he says, leads to a number of disputes, which, in their turn lead to disruption of the orderly functioning of the Internet.

Most of the investigated cases involved sites that offered a free download of software, movies, music and textbooks. The main reasons why Chinese people actively download pirated works are the high prices on authorized copies and restrictions on cultural imports set by the Chinese government.

According to the numbers provided by Chinese officials, China has around 843,000 websites and 140 million users, which means that China is the second largest Internet market in the world. Mr. Yan Xiaohong outlined the fact that due to the quick pace of China's development, it may take some time to effectively fight Internet piracy.

Birks was recently announced as the "Official Supplier of Jewelery" for the 2010 Vancouver-Whistler Olympics. The company will create licensed products with the logos of the 2010 Olympic Games, 2010 Paralympic Games, and the Canadian Olympic team emblem, including necklaces, earrings, pendants and rings.

The partnership was announced at an employee celebration in Vancouver, to mark the centenary of Mayors Jewelers Inc., an American company Birks acquired in 2002.

The six-year sponsorship includes the rights to the Canadian Olympic team logo during the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympic Games.

Thomas A. Andruskevich, president and CEO, Birks &amp; Mayors stated in a press release:

The products will be launched in early 2008.

<h3>Wines to toast Olympic "Esprit"</h3>
Also released today is information that Jackson-Triggs Esprit will be a special line of wines, created to celebrate the athletic event. The Vincor Canada wine is named in relevance to "spirit", both the spirit of the Olympians, and alcoholic beverage usage of the word.

President and CEO of Vincor Canada Jay Wright said, "We are thrilled to have this opportunity to honor our Canadian athletes while affirming our role as Canada’s wine industry leader. Like our Olympic and Paralympic athletes, Vincor Canada shares a passion and determination towards excellence. This agreement is by far Vincor Canada’s most ambitious and broad-reaching sponsorship and will be great for the Canadian wine industry. I hope Canada will join us in the excitement that we feel regarding this exceptional opportunity to position Canadian wine brands on the world stage."

The wines, featuring Olympic logo, will be distributed to liquor stores and restaurants across the country this summer. Proceeds from each bottle will go towards the Canadian Olympic Team.

Both the Chardonnay and Merlot will retail for CDN$11.95 MSRP. Inniskillin Wines' vineyards, harvested since 1975, in either the Niagara Peninsula in Ontario pr the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia will create the wine.

<h3>Other promotions</h3>

Within the past few weeks, the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC) has announced a Omega-brand countdown clock that will tour British Columbia events, as the company is the "Official Olympic Timekeeper". Canadian Pacific was named official rail freight services provider, and the Royal Canadian Mint announced they will create circulation and collector coins to mark the occasion.

There are 1099 days until the XXI Olympiad, according to the official website of the event.

This Sunday, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Animated%20Film%20Association"&gt;International Animated Film Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Association International du Film d'Animation) or ASIFA will hand out the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnnie%20Awards"&gt;Annie Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGlendale%2C%20California"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . As animation's highest honor, the crowd is always a who's who of direction, art design, character design, layout, visual effects, and voice artists.

There are 23 award categories in the Annies, sorted into Individual Achievement and Production categories.

Perhaps the most competitive category is "Best Animated Feature", which will be a fight between ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACars%20%28film%29"&gt;Cars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APixar%20Animation%20Studios"&gt;Pixar Animation Studios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHappy%20Feet"&gt;Happy Feet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Bros.%20Pictures"&gt;Warner Bros.

♡❤Cars♡❤, ♡❤Happy Feet♡❤, and ♡❤Monster House♡❤ are all nominated in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Awards"&gt;Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the same category, perhaps signifying an edge up in the competition.

Direct-to-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADVD"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; releases are eligible for the "Best Home Entertainment Production".

Only ♡❤No Time for Nuts♡❤ is up for an Oscar, which has significantly different rules. "Best Animated Television Commercial" will go to either an advertisement for Candy Factory, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AESPN"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHilton%20Hotels%20%26amp%3B%20Resorts"&gt;Hilton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Zoo"&gt;St. Louis Zoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Notably, no non-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; films or productions have been nominated for any of the awards.

<h3>Started in 1972</h3>
ASIFA is a non-profit worldwide organization dedicated to preserving and promoting animation, which maintains national branches in 55 countries, as far away as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUlanBaatar"&gt;UlanBaatar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMongolia"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Annies are awarded by its California chapter ASIFA-Hollywood.

The awards were started in 1972, after voice actress &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJune%20Foray"&gt;June Foray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; noticed the industry lacked a formal way to acknowledge its achievements. Performing in over 202 productions, Foray's most known characters are &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARocket%20J.%20Squirrel"&gt;Rocket J. Squirrel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARocky%20and%20Bullwinkle"&gt;Rocky and Bullwinkle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGranny%20%28Looney%20Tunes%29"&gt;Granny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALooney%20Tunes"&gt;Looney Tunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤).

ASIFA also hands out "Juried Awards" to various notable figures in animation. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Plympton"&gt;Bill Plympton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGenndy%20Tartakovsky"&gt;Genndy Tartakovsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Deja"&gt;Andreas Deja&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will each win the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWinsor%20McCay%20Award"&gt;Winsor McCay Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in recognition of lifetime or career contributions to the art of animation. Bill Matthews, Michael Fallik, Marc Deckter, and Eric Graf will each win a Certificate of Merit. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJune%20Foray%20Award"&gt;June Foray Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will go to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Worth"&gt;Stephen Worth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , for his "significant and benevolent or charitable impact on the art and industry of animation." The Ub Iwerks Award and Special Achievement award will not be handed out.

<h3>Coverage upcoming</h3>
Professional photographer John Mueller will attend the ceremony on behalf of Wikinews, taking photos of nominees and the rest of America's animation elite. Mueller was selected from a wide pool of professionals offering their services. The photos from the event will be released under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons%20By%20Attribution"&gt;Creative Commons By Attribution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; license, which allows them to be used by anyone for any purpose.

<h1>Anna Nicole Smith dies</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Anna%20Nicole%20Smith%20dies&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Paramedics are reported to have performed &lt;a href="w%3ACPR"&gt;CPR&lt;/a&gt; on the actress and had to have breathing equipment inserted into her chest after a nurse found her passed out in her hotel room and witnesses say that Smith was receiving CPR while the ambulance took her to the hospital around 2:00 p.m. [EST]. Smith's bodyguard is reported to have given Smith "cardiopulmonary resuscitation" before paramedics arrived.

"I can confirm that she is deceased. It's as shocking to me as to you guys. I don't know what the cause was. This is just tragic and that's all you can say right now and I don't know anything further," said one of Anna Nicole's lawyers, Ron Rale.

Smith was taken by ambulance to Memorial Regional Hospital and "checked in Monday [to the hotel] at 8 p.m. as a guest. She was due to check out tomorrow," said cafe spokeswoman, Danielle Giordaano.

"Our rescue crews got there, and they were escorted to a bedroom, where they found a female alone in her room and unresponsive. We then began our normal protocol for dealing with a non-breathing individual. The victim never regained consciousness and we continued with CPR and all life-support methods right up until the time we delivered her to the hospital and then the hospital takes over," said a spokesman for the responding paramedics team. Smith was pronounced dead at the hospital at 2:49 p.m. [EST].

According to Broward County Medical Examiner's Office investigator, Edwina Johnson, an autopsy will be performed on Smith on Friday and that her death is currently being investigated. Authorities are not yet treating her death as a crime.

One of Smith's attorneys, &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20K.%20Stern"&gt;Howard K. Stern&lt;/a&gt;, is reported to have been staying with Smith in her room, but authorities have yet to locate Mr. Stern. Mr. Stern is identified by ♡❤TRIMSPA♡❤ as Smith's husband.

"He was here with her. I don't know where he's at right now," said Charlie Tiger the chief of the &lt;a href="w%3ASeminole"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt; Police Department also adding that Smith's 5 month old baby was not with them.

Smith was a spokeswoman for the company ♡❤TRIMSPA♡❤ when she passed, and TrimSpa has removed all content from their site for now, shutting it down and posting only a message in response to her death.

"Today, Anna Nicole Smith’s grief stricken and tumultuous personal life came to an end. Anna came to our Company as a customer, but she departs it as a friend. While life for Anna Nicole was not easy these past few months, she held dear her husband, Howard K. Stern, her daughter, Dannielynn Hope, her most cherished friends, beloved dogs, and finally, her work with TRIMSPA. Anna knew both the joy of giving life, and the heartache of losing a child. We pray that she is granted the peace that eluded her more recent days on earth, and that she find comfort in the presence of her son, Daniel," said the statement on TRIMSPA's website posted by Alex Goen, CEO and Founder of TRIMSPA.

Smith was rushed to the hospital in November of 2006 after she was suffering from symptoms of &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;. Smith's son, &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Wayne%20Smith"&gt;Daniel Smith&lt;/a&gt;, died on September 10, 2006 shortly after Anna gave birth to a baby girl 5 months ago.

Smith was shopping for a new boat in Florida and reports say she felt ill and had a fever for at least a day.

Two top US Officials will be meeting with their counterparts in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; on February 23.

Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; and Homeland Security Director &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chertoff"&gt;Michael Chertoff&lt;/a&gt; will meet with Foreign Affairs Minister &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20MacKay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt;, Public Safety Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStockwell%20Day"&gt;Stockwell Day&lt;/a&gt;, Trade Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Emerson"&gt;David Emerson&lt;/a&gt;, and their Mexican counterparts.

The top agenda item is expected to be border security, as American officials are concerned with Canada's slow progress in implementing new secure forms of identification. 

Currently, with the approval of the U.S. government, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and nearby &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20State"&gt;Washington State&lt;/a&gt; have a pilot project that involves upgraded drivers' licences. 

Besides border security issues, the meeting is expected to address other issues like trade.

The family of a Chinese-Canadian imprisoned in China on terror-related charges say that the prisoner, &lt;a href="w%3AHuseyincan%20Celil"&gt;Huseyin Celil&lt;/a&gt; is being tortured by Chinese police in order to make him sign a confession.

Celil has Canadian citizenship, which China has refused to recognize. Consular officials and his Canadian lawyer have not been permitted to meet him and his wife Kamila Telendibaeva hasn't seen him in almost a year. 

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said that Celil is being tried in accoordance with Chinese laws and that consular access does not apply since Celil is a Chinese citizen.

Huseyin Celil's sister, mother and older brother say that they are speaking out despite fears that the police would arrest them.

The family says that if Celil, who fled China in the 1990s and sought refuge in Canada, living in &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, does not sign the confession, he would be "put in a hole and buried alive." Celil was arrested in Uzbekistan in 2005 and extradicted to China. Chinese authorities say he is a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Turkestan%20Islamic%20Movement"&gt;East Turkestan Islamic Movement&lt;/a&gt;, which China and the United States consider to be a terrorist organisation.

Celil alleged that he has been tortured during a court appearance during which his sister and son were present. Canadian officials were not permitted to be present at the trial. 

This issue has caused friction between Canada and China, with Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; questioning China's human rights record. The issue was also brought up when Harper spoke with Chinese President &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Vietnam last November. 

Canadian media report that Canadian federal officials have been dispatched to China and will stay in the country. 

China's assistant foreign affairs minister He Yafei said Celil is suspected of involvement in terrorist activities.

The leading political parties in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; have agreed on a work program, part of an effort to form a coalition government after the splintered verdict of the elections held in November 2006. The parties have yet to agree on who gets the top jobs in government.

The main parties of the left, the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; (PvdA) and &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; (SP) won 58 seats in the 150 strong &lt;a href="w%3ATweede%20Kamer"&gt;Tweede Kamer&lt;/a&gt;, the lower house of parliament, while the more splintered right wing parties led by the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Appeal"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (CDA) and &lt;a href="w%3AChristianUnion"&gt;ChristianUnion&lt;/a&gt; (CU) won 47 but with probable support from the 9 members of the &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20for%20Freedom"&gt;Party for Freedom&lt;/a&gt; (PVV).

The parties announced their plans on Wednesday reaching a deal on the main issue of the election campaign, Mortgage Interest Relief, which split the SP from the other coalition partners. Mortgage Interest Relief, which is a significant factor in most people’s finances, with a marginal rate of 52%, had been threatened by the SP manifesto, but the compromise deal announced by the parties left Mortgage Interest Relief unchanged in return for a continuation of the tight legal restrictions on rent increases that had been threatened by the previous government.

In another key concession, the CDA reversed the hard line asylum policy that it introduced with its previous coalition partners, the VVD, and introduced an amnesty of all illegal immigrants who arrived in the country before 2001.

The publication of the government agenda (the “Coalitieakkoord”) outlines policies in a number of main areas:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Retirement♡❤♡: the CDA conceded changes to retirement benefit to introduce taxation on retirees with pensions over EUR 18,000 from 2011.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Work♡❤♡: the government will allocate EUR 700 million to facilitate unemployed and disabled people finding jobs.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Education♡❤♡: more money will be made available for schools in poorer areas or schools with substantial immigrant populations but, in return, the government will force everyone under 27 to either be in education or have a job. Those in high school education will be forced to gain a diploma before leaving high school and take a three-month “social internship” before leaving school.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Health♡❤♡: the CDA has compromised on Health too in reversing the 2003 policy of excluding dental care from basic health insurance and more money will be made available for staffing of health care outlets. The CDA’s stated policy of cutting budgets in a new government will be restricted to cost savings from elimination of waste and red tape.

</ul>
Following the nomination of &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Peter%20Balkenende"&gt;Balkenende&lt;/a&gt; as ♡❤formateur♡❤ of the new government the haggling of cabinet and government jobs will be the last element in sealing the deal. Balkenende will continue as Prime Minister for the CDA with &lt;a href="w%3AWouter%20Bos"&gt;Wouter Bos&lt;/a&gt; (leader of the PvdA) likely to become Finance Minister and CU leader &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Rouvoet"&gt;André Rouvoet&lt;/a&gt; becoming Youth Minister.

The developers of a new video game genre hope to promote the idea of boosting the psychological health of gamers. Today, fun and violence are staples of the gaming industry and several groups in different countries are working on and promoting games to strengthen people's self-esteem and emotional health. 

One of such groups is Dimple Entertainment, based in &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. The group's representatives stated that in &lt;a href="w%3AMay"&gt;May&lt;/a&gt; they will start the production of ♡❤“DS Therapy”♡❤. In this unconventional game, players can see an evaluation of their mental health by answering several light-hearted questions on various topics in the game. 

Launched in Japan, the game will be available on a hand-held DS Player developed by &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;.

Mark Baldwin, a psychology professor at the &lt;a href="w%3AMcGill%20University"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; hopes to use games to make people feel good about themselves. Together with his crew, Baldwin hs developed a game called ♡❤“MindHabits Booster”♡❤ based on their research in the field of social psychology. The game idea is built upon their observations that they can use repetitive components from video game play to shape humans' perceptions as well as their ways of thinking.

The researchers working at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Rochester"&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/a&gt; outlined that both children and adults play video games because they have several psychological needs like: opportunities for achievement, freedom and a sense of connection.

The first large-scale trial of a vaccine for &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; has been launched in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. About 3,000 HIV-negative people will be administered the test vaccine MRKAd5 HIV-1 created by the pharmaceutical company &lt;a href="w%3AMerck"&gt;Merck&lt;/a&gt;. The study will examine if the vaccine prevents infection or lowers HIV levels in those who do get infected. 

A parallel study will also be conducted in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, to compare the vaccine's effectiveness on various strains of HIV. The vaccine's functioning in a heterosexual population and its effectiveness among women will also be studied. Preliminary trials for the vaccine have been conducted in the Americas and &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; as well as in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;a href="AIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; is estimated to have killed 25 million people worldwide since 1981, and between 33 and 46 million more are estimated to be infected with HIV, more than half of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. Between three and six million people are thought to have been infected in 2005.

The trial, named the Phambili ("Going forward") Trial, is being conducted by the International HIV Trials Network and the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI).

The vaccine has been developed from an &lt;a href="w%3AAdenovirus"&gt;adenovirus&lt;/a&gt;, a type of virus that causes the common cold. The virus has been &lt;a href="w%3Agenetically%20engineered"&gt;genetically engineered&lt;/a&gt; to prevent it from causing the flu or from passing on from person to person. Instead, three &lt;a href="w%3Agene"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; of the HIV virus have been introduced into the adenovirus. When the vaccine containing these genes is injected into the body, it is hoped that the body's &lt;a href="w%3AImmune%20system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; will learn to recognise and kill cells that contain the vaccine, thereby also developing an immune response against the HIV virus, which also contains these three genes. 
The three genes, called ♡❤gag♡❤, ♡❤pol♡❤ and ♡❤env♡❤ contain information needed to make the structural proteins for the &lt;a href="w%3ACapsid"&gt;capsid&lt;/a&gt;, the "shell" of the HIV viron. The vaccine does not contain the remaining six HIV genes that cause HIV to infect cells, replicate and cause disease.

The vaccine does not contain any live HIV and therefore cannot cause any infection, SAAVI said in a press release, adding that the vaccine was found to be safe and produced an immune response against HIV in earlier trials. 

SAAVI has expressed its commitment to the "highest level of preventive care" for those who take part in the trial, promising "extensive, state-of-the-art" counselling as well as some forms of medical care and for those taking part, through the duration of the trial. 

The trial starts a week after a different trial, involving a &lt;a href="w%3Amicrobicide"&gt;microbicide&lt;/a&gt; gel called Ushercell was stopped after more women who used the gel were found to be infected compared to those who were given a dummy gel as &lt;a href="w%3Aplacebo"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. Eleven previous trials of the gel had not shown any problems, the chief scientist for the trial in South Africa told ♡❤Business Day♡❤. 

The trial is expected to cost $35 million and SAAVI will be supported by Eskom and the South African government.

New legislation introduced in the New York State Senate today would effectively ban the use of all electronic devices on the streets of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;.

Senator Carl Kruger (D-Brooklyn) has plans to introduce the bill to the State Senate floor. The legislation would ban the use of any electronic device while crossing a street. The impetus for the legislation is the recent deaths of three people in Brooklyn and Manhattan, all of which were attributed to the distraction caused by the use of electronic devices.

The opening date for a memorial to &lt;a href="w%3AMayerthorpe%20Incident"&gt;four fallen Alberta Mounties&lt;/a&gt; has been pushed back for a second time. The Fallen Four Memorial Park in &lt;a href="w%3AMayerthorpe%2C%20Alberta"&gt;Mayerthorpe, Alberta&lt;/a&gt; was originally slated to open next month on the two year anniversary of four officers were gunned down during a standoff. The organization first said slow donations and a lack of federal funding pushed the opening until June.

But Fallen Four Society President Jurgen Preugschas says it won't open until June of 2008. He says there's still no funding from the federal government, and only $1 million has been raised through donations—leaving $500,000 to go.

The rising cost of construction and October snow have also slowed progress.

<h1>Palestinians, Israelis clash in Jerusalem over construction at Temple Mount</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Palestinians%2C%20Israelis%20clash%20in%20Jerusalem%20over%20construction%20at%20Temple%20Mount&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Violent clashes have broken out between &lt;a href="w%3APalestinians"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i police near the &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Aqsa%20Mosque"&gt;al-Aqsa Mosque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATemple%20Mount"&gt;Temple Mount&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, from controversy over Israeli construction near the site, which is holy to both Muslims and Jews.

The construction work reportedly is to repair a pedestrian bridge that leads to the Mugrabi Gate, the entrance to the mosque used by Palestinians, and runs over the Jewish &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Wall"&gt;Western Wall&lt;/a&gt; area of the complex. The earthen ramp bridge leads to a hilltop compound known as the Temple Mount to Jews and as the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims. The bridge collapsed in 2004 and was temporarily replaced with a wooden bridge which Israelis say is weakening and unsafe. Israel has controlled the contentious compound since the 1967 Mideast War,

The construction involves excavation work and digging at the site, which Palestinian leaders contend is part of an attempt to dig under the mosque to find evidence of the Jewish &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Temple"&gt;Second Temple&lt;/a&gt; and/or to deliberately weaken the foundation of the mosque. Muslims dispute that the Temple was located at the site. Some artifacts have been salvaged from the digging work.
Israeli forces locked down Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem in anticipation of backlashes from the construction. The Old Jerusalem city limits were blockaded, allowing only Palestinians over 45 years old from entering and only on foot. Palestinians from the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; were completely barred. Opponents have declared the blockades and the construction work a deliberate act to prevent Muslims from accessing the holy site. The mass of protesters at the site have in turn blocked Jewish access to the Western Wall.

Palestinian president &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; declared the construction and blockade as "hostile measures" against Muslims. Palestinian chief justice Tayssir al-Tamimi declared a "day of anger" and called on Palestinians to defend the mosque. 

Arab and Muslim countries including &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; criticized Israel for the controversial work and urged it to halt construction. Israeli defense minister &lt;a href="w%3AAmir%20Peretz"&gt;Amir Peretz&lt;/a&gt; also warned against starting construction. The leader of the &lt;a href="w%3APML-N"&gt;Pakistan Muslim League&lt;/a&gt; urged Muslim countries to freeze diplomatic ties with Israel in protest of the work.

Around 150 Muslims were inside the mosque for morning prayers when the construction and blockade began. An Israeli Muslim journalist reported that the worshippers were unable to leave and received loud messages from Israeli loudspeakers.

The al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, having once been the central point of prayer (&lt;a href="w%3Aqibla"&gt;qibla&lt;/a&gt;) for Muslims and allegedly the place where &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; ascended into heaven. Conventional &lt;a href="w%3AJudaism"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt; believes it is also the historic site of the First and Second Temples, the holiest temple in Judaism, which is prophesised to be rebuilt ahead of the coming of the &lt;a href="w%3AMessiah"&gt;Messiah&lt;/a&gt;.

No deaths have been reported in the clashes, which simmered by evening.

Demonstrations also took place at mosques throughout the Muslim world, including &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and Jordan. Protests were expected later in the day in &lt;a href="w%3ANazareth"&gt;Nazareth&lt;/a&gt;.

The incident comes only a few days after rival Palestinian political factions, &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt;, came to an agreement for a unity government aimed at restoring international support of Palestine and a return to Israeli negotiations.

A training program in which officers observe volunteers who may be high on drugs, and is used in 30 &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; states, has the Edmonton Police Service and the &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; (RCMP) in a public relations nightmare. 

Acting police chief Mike Bradshaw says "the training is meant to help police officers identify how people behave when they are on drugs."

Bradshaw is also quoted saying police did not provide the men and women - some of them prostitutes - with any drugs during a training session in December. 

Cpl. Wayne Oakes of the RCMP clarified the issue of who gave the volunteers the drugs, claiming the police officers were not even present when the drugs were administered, the volunteers used their own drugs.

Bradshaw says the police asked the Metis Child and Family Services Society to provide the nine volunteers, however not all of them were aboriginal. They may or may not have been high during the session.

The volunteers were anonymous and were not promised anything in return for their participation. 

An internal investigation has been launched into the program because of one complaint -- not from any of the volunteers -- although police said that's a standard procedure.

In big cities, finding land for new &lt;a href="w%3Apark"&gt;parks&lt;/a&gt; is less of an expedition than an all-out land-rights battle with &lt;a href="w%3Aproperty"&gt;property&lt;/a&gt; owners. But some cities across the U.S. have found a slightly easier way to add to their greenspace. By utilizing the state's air rights to the space above freeways that run below at ground level, cities can acquire 5 or 10 &lt;a href="w%3Aacre"&gt;acres&lt;/a&gt; of parkspace essentially for free, such &lt;a href="w%3AFreeway%20Park%20%28Seattle%29"&gt;Freeway Park&lt;/a&gt; which occupies 5.5 acres above a freeway in downtown Seattle.
Of course, this free "land" is actually nothing more than open air above a &lt;a href="w%3Afreeway"&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt;, requiring cities to pay the high construction costs of capping the roadway with land. 

Such projects are currently being planned in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Dallas and San Diego. A recent article in Governing Magazine looks at more than two dozen highway deck parks that have been built or are under construction in the U.S. The article finds that even though the price of constructing parks on top of freeways can rise upwards of $500 per square foot, property values and local development boom once they are completed.

Junior &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; officially announced his presidential candidacy, today, in &lt;a href="w%3ASpringfield%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Springfield, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. Obama's speech was given from the same spot that &lt;a href="w%3AAbraham%20Lincoln"&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; gave his "House divided" speech over 125 years ago and from the place where Obama began his elected career 10 years ago.

Obama is the second major Democrat to announce his candidacy, after &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. If elected, Obama would be the first &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; president of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.
Obama placed topics such as healthcare reform, ending poverty, re-building labor unions, energy independence, repairing the US's global image, and the &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; in the context of generational change. Obama spoke against keeping troops in Iraq, saying that "all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq . . . America, it's time to start bringing our troops home. It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war."

The announcement kicks off a weekend of rallies and events that will take Obama from Springfield to &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; and then on to Chicago before he wraps up Monday in &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;.

Obama broke onto the national scene with his popular speech at the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Democratic%20National%20Convention"&gt;Democratic National Convention&lt;/a&gt;. Born in &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, Obama graduated from &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; before receiving his JD from &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20School"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt;. In 1996, Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate, before rising to his current position in the US Senate in 2004.

Members of &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;'s Conservative government said Friday that the government of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; may ignore an upcoming House of Commons bill to respect the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20accord"&gt;Kyoto accord&lt;/a&gt;. The Liberal-sponsored Bill C-288 requires the government to table a plan within 60 days explaining how they would meet climate change commitments. 

The final vote on the bill is expected on Wednesday. Earlier votes passed with the support of all three opposition parties. Transport Minister &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Cannon"&gt;Lawrence Cannon&lt;/a&gt; says the government does not feel bound by the terms of the bill, adding that the government will "act [...] instead of adopting an empty piece of legislation

Officials within the Canadian and United States Governments have previously criticised the Kyoto Accord for exempting the People's Republic of China and India, two of the largest world carbon emitters.

Rona Ambrose (at the time Canada's Environment Minister) voiced Canada's interest in participating in U.S. sponsored Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. "We've been looking at the Asia-Pacific Partnership for a number of months now because the key principles around [it] are very much in line with where our government wants to go," Ambrose told reporters in 2006.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.cbc.ca/news/story/2006/04/25/ambrose060425.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Liberals say ignoring the bill would be a "coup d'etat" and would trigger a constitutional crisis. 

Pablo Rodriguez, Liberal MP from Montreal and sponsor of the bill, says that if the bill becomes law, the government will have to respect the Kyoto Accord or call an election. However the legislation is not being considered a confidence matter, and therefore would not bring down the government on the vote itself.

Experts are saying the government has a democratic obligation to follow laws. Ned Franks, a professor at Queen's University believes the government would need to produce a plan and have money value attached to it. 

Stewart Elgie, a professor at the University of Ottawa, confirmed that if passed and no action is taken, the government would be breaking the law and could be taken to court.

According to Lewiston police Sgt. Frank J. Previte, at least two students saw Donatelli use the end of at least two pen caps to "repeatedly" scoop cocaine out of the green colored bag and inhale the drug into her nose, while she was teaching the class. The students were sitting no less than five feet from the teacher's desk at the time of the incident.

The children who reported the incident are being called "credible."

"First of all their candor, their account of everything in stating what they saw. They were very specific about the color of the bag, the color of the pencaps that were used, which all again, we were able to back up," added Previte.

Previte also stated that Donatelli admitted to using the drug only after police searched the classroom and found trace amounts of cocaine on her desk. Donatelli then got rid of the evidence and drugs by throwing the items out in a trash bin inside a bathroom.

"She stated that she had a problem, that she has an addiction, something she's been struggling with," stated Previte.

The superintendent of Lewiston-Porter Central Schools, Don Rappold, sent a letter home to parents of the students saying:

"On Thursday, February 1, 2007, it was reported that a substitute teacher in your child's classroom may have a substance abuse problem. This letter is to inform you that the Lewiston-Porter School District responded to the report by advising the police. The matter is now under investigation, and the District is fully cooperating with the authorities. Pending the outcome of the investigation, the substitute teacher has been prohibited from being on our campus."

Donatelli is being charged with at least two counts of endangering the welfare of children and seventh-degree criminal possession of an illegal substance. She is expected to appear in the Lewiston Town Court on February 21, 2007. More counts of endangering the welfare of children may be added, but only after police can confirm that other students in the class witnessed the incident.

Despite all the attention &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; gets in the world media and despite a resurgence of interest towards Russia in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, there was no English-language publication about the country. ♡❤Russia!♡❤ intends to fill this gap, now set to hit bookstores.

However, the approach the publishers chose for this 132-page glossy magazine is somewhat unorthodox. On the magazine's website publishers state that most of the names one would expect to find in the publication, such as &lt;a href="w%3AMaria%20Sharapova"&gt;Maria Sharapova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALeo%20Tolstoy"&gt;Leo Tolstoy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, are not mentioned in the magazine. The reason for that is, according to the magazine, that "there are much more interesting things about Russia."

In the inaugural issue of ♡❤Russia!♡❤ readers can find stories on hidden treasures of &lt;a href="w%3AIvan%20IV%20of%20Russia"&gt;Ivan the Terrible&lt;/a&gt;, photos of young women chopping wood, discussions of the free speech and homosexuality and photographic journey to Russia’s far east.

The magazine is published quarterly by Press Release Group, a New York-based marketing and communications company.

Recent tests have shown that an inexpensive drug may be able to kill cells in humans. &lt;a href="w%3ADichloroacetate"&gt;Dichloroacetate&lt;/a&gt;, a drug generally used to treat rare metabolic disorders, has shown the potential to assist in the treatment of brain, lung, and breast cancers, researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Alberta"&gt;University of Alberta&lt;/a&gt; in Edmonton, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; say. 

Dr. Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada found that that DCA causes tumor regressions in animals with human cancers. Testing showed that DCA attacked cancer cells but did not attack healthy cells. 

The researchers and the Alberta Cancer Board and Capital Health do not advise the use of DCA to treat cancer yet, as clinical trials for the drugs use to treat cancer have not been performed yet. 
Unlike healthy cells, cancerous cells do not convert food molecules into energy in the &lt;a href="w%3Amitochondria"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, they rely on a process 
known as &lt;a href="w%3Aglycolysis"&gt;glycolysis&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place in the main body of the cell, while the mitochondria are "shut down", researchers believe possibly due to the lack of oxygen supply to cells in the middle of a tumor.

This means that another key function of the mitochondria - to activate an abnormal cell's self-destruct mechanism, &lt;a href="w%3AApoptosis"&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt; - is also blocked. 

When Dichloroacetate (DCA) enters a cancer cell, it restarts the mitochondria which in turn activate apoptosis, and the cancerous cell destroys itself.

DCA is known to be relatively safe, although pain, numbness and gait disturbances may occur. The drug is also expected to be cheaper to manufacture than other drugs since there is no patent for it.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Virginia%20public%20smoking%20ban%20snuffed%20again%20by%20House%20sub-committee&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; legislature's House General Laws committee, a subcommittee of the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20House%20of%20Delegates"&gt;House of Delegates&lt;/a&gt;, tabled a &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20of%20Virginia"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;-passed bill banning public smoking by not voting on it Thursday last week. By tabling the bill, the proposed legislation banning smoking in restaurants, bars and public establishments cannot move to the lower house of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Virginia%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; for a vote. 

The move by the 6-member subcommittee leaves the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20House%20of%20Delegates"&gt;House of Delegates&lt;/a&gt; two-weeks in the current legislative session to work out a compromise between the tabled SB 1161 Senate bill, and compromise proposals, that could form new indoor smoking laws in the state.

The dichotomy that exists between Virginia's rural areas and its northern sections plays a part in the legislative proposal by delgate H. Morgan Griffith that would require public places that allow smoking to post signs at the entrance that say something as simple as, "Smoking allowed here". 

Smaller mom-and-pop businesses could be affected negatively by a state-wide ban sponsored by public health groups that advocate for a smoke free environment. "Think about your small bars, your local bars -- places where everyone has been going for 20 years and everybody in the place smokes," said co-owner of Henrico County's Sharky's Bar &amp; Billiards in January. 

"The subcommittee's intent was to give SB 1161's sponsor, Sen. Brandon Bell, R-Roanoke County, time to work out a compromise with Del. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, who sponsored a different smoking bill approved by the subcommittee last month," according to Mason Adams of Roanoke.com. 

The Virginia Senate voted 23-16 on Monday last week to pass the smoking ban legislation, garnering two additional votes in favor of the measure than in the previous year.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=India%20sends%20first%20all-woman%20peace%20keeping%20force%20to%20Liberia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

]&lt;/small&gt;
An &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n all-female United Nations peacekeeping unit has arrived in &lt;a href="Liberia"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt;, the first such team to be sent on a foreign mission.

More than a hundred female officers and about 20 men engaged in logistics work flew into Liberia on January 30, where they will receive additional training before starting their mission to strengthen the rule of law and maintain peace in the country. U.N. officials hope an all-female unit can inspire and help Liberian women. 

Last year, Liberia elected &lt;a href="w%3AEllen%20Johnson-Sirleaf"&gt;Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf&lt;/a&gt; as the first female head of state in Africa after two civil wars in the 1990s devastated the country, displacing hundreds of thousands of people. The country now has to rebuild its basic infrastructure and economy as well as come to terms with the violence of the civil wars. 
Commanding officer of the unit, Seema Dhundia told reporters that the attention her unit has received makes her "a bit apprehensive because now we have to exert more to prove our worth, to prove ourselves,"

Eighty-two female U.N. police officers currently serve in Liberia, as part of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Mission%20in%20Liberia"&gt;United Nations Mission in Liberia&lt;/a&gt; (UNMIL). 

The UNMIL Police Commissioner Mohammed Alhassan hoped that the all-female contingent will serve "as an incentive and an attraction to encourage young Liberian women to join the Liberian National Police". 

The team has served before in troubled areas in central India and &lt;a href="w%3AKashmir"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;. Dhundia herself has been a peace-keeper for 19 years and says her team are well trained and experienced and will be able to handle the situation. 

A U.N. spokesman viewed the role of the all-female unit to not be particularly different from that of the Jordanian, Nepalese and Nigerian units that have been working in the country. The armed unit is to specialize in controlling difficult crowd situations. 

"We hope that the presence of this all-female contingent will serve as an incentive and an attraction to encourage young Liberian women to join the Liberian National Police," said UNMIL Police Commissioner Mohammed Alhassan. The U.N. has set up a special education programme to help women join the police force.

Hopes have been high that the presence of the all-female contingent will encourage victims of rape - which is rampant in the country - to report the crime and that it will make more women interested in becoming police officers and peacekeepers.

U.N. peace-keepers have also been accused of sexual exploitation in the past, and Joanna Foster, the gender adviser to the UN Mission told BBC News that missions employing more women had reported fewer such problems.

At some time before 11 AM, local time, a fire started in Bar Apache on the popular &lt;a href="w%3APhi%20Phi%20Islands"&gt;Phi Phi Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.
By eleven it had spread to neighbouring shops and restaurants along the main road. 

Since there is no fire brigade on Phi Phi, locals and tourists formed a bucket chain to help put out the fire. An eye witness, Simon Vestling, says there were over 300 people helping out with putting out the fire and tearing down buildings.

To stop the fire from spreading to other nearby buildings, which are closely grouped together, they were forced to pull some of them down using nothing but man power. This managed to stop the fire from spreading to the rest of the island, but 10 buildings were still burnt down, mostly small shops and bars.

Boats were brought over from local &lt;a href="w%3AKrabi%20Island"&gt;Krabi Island&lt;/a&gt; in case an evacuation was needed, but that was not the case. The cost of the damage is estimated to be Bt2million.

Two Swedes sustained minor injuries from the smoke, but were treated with oxygen at a nearby dive center. No other injuries have been reported at this time.

Thousands of people were evacuated from Northtown Mall, in &lt;a href="w%3ASpokane%2C%20WA"&gt;Spokane, WA&lt;/a&gt; following complaints that unknown fumes were causing throat irritation and blocked throats at around 3:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time"&gt;Pacific Time&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. 
Eight people were moved to hospital by ambulance while others reached hospital on their own. None are believed to be in a life-threatening condition.

Firefighters on scene used specialized equipment to attempt to identify air contaminants, but initial tests were "unconclusive". Hazardous materials crews continued to investigate the nature of the fumes during the later afternoon after closure of the mall. 

Firefighters have deemed the mall safe, and mall security allowed certain staff to perform the mall closing operations. The mall is expected to open as usual on Monday.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Life%20Church%2C%20Colorado"&gt;New Life Church&lt;/a&gt; in Colorado Springs, Colorado has reached a financial settlement with its founder (and former head of &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20Evangelicals"&gt;National Association of Evangelicals&lt;/a&gt;) pastor &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Haggard"&gt;Ted Haggard&lt;/a&gt;. Haggard stepped aside as senior pastor in the Church in November 2006, when a male prostitute claimed that he had engaged in a three year relationship with Haggard and that the two used &lt;a href="w%3AMethamphetamine"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt;.

Haggard, who was publicly critical of homosexuality, has agreed to leave the church he founded and led for two decades with a promise that he will not discuss the scandal, will move out of Colorado Springs, and will not reveal how much his financial settlement is.

On February 4th, Haggard sent an e-mail to New Life members stating, "We all wanted to know why I developed such incongruity in my life. Thankfully, with the tools we gained there, along with the powerful way God has been illuminating his Word and the Holy Spirit has been convicting me and healing me, we now have growing understanding which is giving me some hope for the future." 

Rev. Tim Ralph said, after Haggard completed a three-week counseling program, "He [Haggard] is completely heterosexual."

However, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Jones%20%28personal%20trainer%29"&gt;Mike Jones&lt;/a&gt;, the man who had allegedly had a 3 year relationship with Haggard publicly replied, "Give me a break." Adding, "He’s been performing oral sex on me for three years. You don’t change that in three weeks." And "Until he’s honest with himself, he’ll never be happy." Jones is currently writing a book detailing his relationship with Haggard due out in summer 2007. 

According to interim senior pastor &lt;a href="w%3ARoss%20Parsley"&gt;Ross Parsley&lt;/a&gt;, at services on Sunday February 18 the panel will "provide any necessary clarification of (Haggard's) restoration process and give us a report on the New Life staff."

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has attacked &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidate &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; on his pledge to introduce a bill that would withdraw American troops from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; by March 2008.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Howard said the move would hand victory to insurgents in Iraq. "I think that would just encourage those who wanted completely to destabilise and destroy Iraq, and create chaos and victory for the terrorists to hang on and hope for (an) Obama victory," Mr Howard said.
"If I was running al-Qaeda in Iraq, I would put a circle around March 2008, and pray, as many times as possible, for a victory not only for Obama, but also for the Democrats."

Mr Obama dismissed Howard's comments as "empty rhetoric", unless he was to send another 20,000 Australians to fight in Iraq. "So, if he's (inaudible) if to fight the good fight in Iraq, I would suggest that he calls up another 20,000 Australians and sends them to Iraq. I would also note that we have close to 140,000 troops on the ground now, and my understanding is that Mr Howard has deployed 1,400", said Mr Obama.

The Australian government said its contribution to the war in Iraq was appropriate given Australia's population and military size and that Obama's response failed to address the "substance of the issue". Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; said 20,000 troops would be "half of our army".

Mr Howard, considered a close ally of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20State"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government, has faced attacks and support from US politicians.

&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; Terry McAuliffe said "Firstly, the Prime Minister has been a great friend of George Bush's. He has been with him lock-step from day one on this war in Iraq."

Republican presidential candidate Duncan Hunter said Howard had earned a right to comment about Obama's policy "I think the Aussies have earned a right to comment on the world stage about their partner in this endeavour, because they've been fighting side-by-side with us in Iraq," said Hunter.

"And so I think that John Howard, while it wasn't a very complimentary statement, he is basically stating the truth and that is that what we say on the Senate floor on or the House floor goes to a world audience."

"And it has an impact on not only our allies, but also our adversaries."

Roy Ryden, another US Democrat said Mr Howard's comment was "bizarre" and accused the Prime minister of interfering with US politics "The most charitable thing you can say about Mr Howard's comment is bizarre. You know, we'll make our own judgements in this country with respect to elections and Barack Obama is a terrific public servant."

Mr Howard has drawn criticism from some conservative &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; with John Cornyn saying Howard should stay out of US domestic politics.

The Australian Prime Minster further defended his statement today, claiming Obama's plan threatened Australia's national security.

"If the United States were to withdraw her combat units from Iraq by the early part of next year it could only be represented as a defeat for the United States in Iraq," he said.

"I hold the strongest possible view that it is contrary to the security interests of this country for America to be defeated in Iraq."

Australia's strong links to the United States and its support for the U.S.-led war on Iraq were key issues for Howard's fourth straight election win in late 2004. The Australian opposition has used the comments as an opportunity to attack the government. Opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; said Howard needed to avoid taking sides in American politics as it was important for the Australia-U.S. alliance that leaders could deal with each other despite their political affiliations.

On Sunday the representatives of &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;International Business Machines Inc.&lt;/a&gt; said that the company will launch its new desktop &lt;a href="w%3Asoftware"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; system for businesses. IBM's new product is called “Open Client Offering”. The company hopes that its product will put &lt;a href="w%3AMacintosh"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; software on a more equal footing with &lt;a href="w%3AWindows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;.

The Open Client Offering software was developed by IBM in-house, as well as with partners like &lt;a href="w%3ANovell%20Inc."&gt;Novell Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Hat"&gt;Red Hat Inc&lt;/a&gt;. It is to answer the questions regarding the cost-effectiveness of managing Linux or &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Inc."&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; desktop personal computers alongside Windows PCs. 

IBM officials stated that Open Client Offering will allow enterprises to use the same software on Windows, Linux or Apple's OS X. It will be unnecessary for companies using Open Client to pay &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; for licenses for operations because these will no longer rely on Windows-based software.

Scott Handy, IBM's vice president of Linux and open source, stated that the company worked together with the open source community and in the end found a way to develop a software that is able to function regardless of the operating system.

To create an alternative to Microsoft, IBM is going to offer &lt;a href="w%3AOpenDocument"&gt;Open Document Format&lt;/a&gt; software that the company developed for word processing, spreadsheets or presentations, instant messaging and blog tools and Internet Explorer's long time rival – &lt;a href="w%3AFirefox"&gt;Firefox Web browser&lt;/a&gt;. 

The software developers at IBM believe that the usage of Open Client Offering can cut the cost of managing applications as well as maintenance and cost regarding customer support on company networks that require other software rather than Windows.

&lt;a href="w%3APSA%20Peugeot%20Citroen"&gt;PSA Peugeot Citroen&lt;/a&gt;, being the second largest car manufacturer, signed a multi-year agreement with Novell, which is the provider of Linux software, to run Linux on its 20,000 desktop PCs. In addition Linux will be installed on 2,500 server computers. 
RedMonk's analyst, Stephen O'Grady, said that today there is a strong appetite for Windows alternatives. However, he said, this doesn't mean that the alternatives are to displace Windows wholesales. O'Grady outlined that no one is going to significantly damage the desktop dominance of Microsoft.

During a press conference yesterday, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military and intelligence officials presented material they say link weapons used by &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; fighters to &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. Defense Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt; told reporters in Madrid on Friday that the there was "pretty good" evidence that Iranians are supplying either weapons or technology to Iraqi militants. No recording devices of any kind were allowed during the press conference. 

Reacting to the U.S. claims, Iran's President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; said in a television interview that the allegations were "excuses to prolong the stay" of the U.S. military in Iraq, and that the U.S. was pointing fingers at others in an effort to "hide its defeats and failures"; however in an interview with Diane Sawyer on February 12th, Ahmadinejad refused to address accusations that his country was supplying weapons to insurgents in Iraq. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hossein termed the accusations baseless propaganda and said that the U.S. had a long history of "fabricating evidence". 

American officials displayed weaponry including &lt;a href="w%3AExplosively%20Formed%20Penetrator"&gt;Explosively Formed Penetrators&lt;/a&gt; (EFPs) and thermal detectors used for remotely exploding bombs. Some of the weapons parts bear the markings that the officials associated with Iranian manufacture. The officials claimed that such sophisticated weaponry could not have been assembled by the Shia militia and said that it must have been supplied from neighbouring Iran. The U.S. view is that only a state arms company would have the ability to manufacture weapons of this kind and the officials maintained that the weapons were smuggled in to Iraq by the &lt;a href="w%3AQods%20Force"&gt;Qods Force&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Revolutionary%20Guard%20Corps"&gt;Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&lt;/a&gt; (IRGC) and have estimated that such an operation was known to the Iranian government and encouraged by it, but did not present any evidence to support the claims.

The U.S. evidence is being met with close scrutiny, after the experience of pre-Iraq war U.S. intelligence estimates of &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;'s weapons capability and links with &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, which were found to be inaccurate. When asked why this information was being released at this specific moment, even though the information had accumulated since 2004, the officials explained that they saw a near doubling of EFP attacks in 2006.

The U.S. claims that the such weapons have killed at least 170 troops and a much higher number of Iraqi civilians. Secretary Gates said that the EFPs did not form a large proportion of roadside bombs but that they were "extremely lethal". Improvised explosive devices have been a big killer of both Iraqi civilians and Allied forces in Iraq. Tens of thousands of civilians and over 3000 Allied troops have died in the nearly four-year-old Iraq war.

The exchanges come during a period of heightened tension between Iran and the U. S. over Iran's nuclear programme. The U.S. deployed a second aircraft carrier strike force in the Persian Gulf last month.

♡❤Cars♡❤ drove home the big prize last night, from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A34th%20Annual%20Annie%20Awards"&gt;34th Annual Annie Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The animation industry's highest honor, ASIFA-Hollywood's Annies recognise contributions to animation, writing, directing, storyboarding, voice acting, composing, and much more.

As mentioned, Pixar took home the big prize last night, after facing stiff competition from four other ♡❤Happy Feet♡❤, ♡❤Monster House♡❤, ♡❤Open Season♡❤, and ♡❤Over the Hedge♡❤.

But the biggest winner of the night didn't get a "Best Animated Feature" nod at all. ♡❤Flushed Away♡❤ won five feature animation categories including Animated Effects (Scott Cegielski), Character Animation (Gabe Hordos), Production Design (Pierre-Olivier Vincent), Voice Acting (Sir Ian McKellan as Toad), Writing (Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais, Chris Lloyd, Joe Keenan, and Will Davies).

♡❤Over The Hedge♡❤ won awards for Directing (Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick), Storyboarding (Gary Graham), and Character Design (Nicolas Marlet).

Of little surprise, Randy Newman won an Annie for ♡❤Cars♡❤ in the "Music in an Animated Feature Production" category. Newman has won many Oscars for his movie music, and has a nomination this year for the song "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOur%20Town%20%28song%29"&gt;Our Town&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ". Newman didn't attend the Annies, instead picking up a Grammy for "Best Song Written For Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media".

DisneyToon Studios' ♡❤Bambi II♡❤ won "Best Home Entertainment Production", while "Best Animated Short Subject" went to Blue Sky Studios' ♡❤No Time For Nuts♡❤, which is based on ♡❤Ice Age♡❤.

"Best Animated Video Game" went to ♡❤Flushed Away The Game♡❤, while a United Airlines ad named "Dragon" won a "Best Animated Television Commercial" Annie for DUCK Studios.

<h2>Foster an Annie fav on TV</h2>

Not only did ♡❤Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends♡❤ take home "Best Animated Television Production", but it also saw wins for Music (James L. Venable and Jennifer Kes Remington for ♡❤Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends♡❤ episode "One False Movie") and Production Design (Martin Ansolabehere for ♡❤Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends♡❤ episode "Good Wilt Hunting"), 

Other ASIFA Television animation statuettes were handed out for writing (Ian Maxtone-Graham for ♡❤The Simpsons♡❤ episode "The Seemingly Neverending Story"), Voice Acting (Eartha Kitt as Yzma, for ♡❤The Emperor's New School♡❤ episode "Kuzclone"), Storyboarding (Li Hong for ♡❤The X's♡❤ episode "You Only Sneeze Twice"), Directing (Giancarlo Volpe for ♡❤Avatar♡❤ episode "The Drill"), Character Design (Mike Kunkel for ♡❤The Life &amp; Times of Juniper Lee♡❤ episode "Party Monsters"), and Character Animation (Yu Jae Myung for ♡❤Avatar♡❤ episode "The Blind Bandit").

ASIFA also hands out "Juried Awards" to various notable figures in animation. Bill Plympton, Genndy Tartakovsky, and Andreas Deja will each win the Winsor McCay Award, in recognition of lifetime or career contributions to the art of animation. Bill Matthews, Michael Fallik, Marc Deckter, and Eric Graf will each win a Certificate of Merit. The June Foray Award will go to Stephen Worth, for his "significant and benevolent or charitable impact on the art and industry of animation." The Ub Iwerks Award and Special Achievement award will not be handed out.

The awards were started in 1972, after voice actress June Foray noticed the industry lacked a formal way to acknowledge its achievements. Performing in over 202 productions, Foray's most known characters are Rocket J. Squirrel (♡❤Rocky and Bullwinkle♡❤) and Granny (♡❤Looney Tunes♡❤).
