<h1>Thais head to the polls for snap election</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Thais%20head%20to%20the%20polls%20for%20snap%20election&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today sees the snap election for the lower house of &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s parliament. With only one of the parties with seats contesting the election it is seen more as an attempt by current caretaker Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; to shore up his position in the face of mass protests and accusations of &lt;a href="wikt%3Amalfeasance"&gt;malfeasance&lt;/a&gt;.

The snap election was called on February 24 by the beleaguered PM, approximately one year after the previous election where his &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party took 377 of the 500 seats in the lower house making it the first party to have been able to form a government without entering into a coalition.

With the main opposition parties, &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat%20Party%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;Democat Party&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Pak Prachatipat♡❤), &lt;a href="w%3AMahachon%20Party"&gt;Great People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Phak Mahachon♡❤), and &lt;a href="w%3AChart%20Thai%20Party"&gt;Thai Nation Party&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Phak Chaat Thai♡❤) boycotting the election the results may not carry the legitimacy that Thaksin is seeking. Along with the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), the main opposition parties have called upon voters to mark their ballot as an abstention. With over 150 Changwats (constituencies) having a single Thai Rak Thai candidate on the ballot, some may not reach the required 20% of the eligble votes to be returned. This would leave the parliament short of its 500 seat requirement and unable to reconvene and ratify the appointment of a Prime Minister.

Allegations of corruption centre on the Prime Minister's family's involvement in the sale of &lt;a href="w%3AShin%20Corporation"&gt;Shin Corp.&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ATemasek%20Holdings"&gt;Temasek Holdings&lt;/a&gt;, described by Wikipedia as the investment arm of the &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; government. On January 23, the PM's family sold their 49.6% share in the company tax-free for US$1.88 billion. Whilst protests and allegations had been made prior to the sale, it was a catalyst that provoked mass rallies in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; demanding the PM's resignation.

With polls opening at 8 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AUTC%252B7"&gt;local time&lt;/a&gt; (0100 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), the BBC reports that voting has been steady and that the PM and his children voted a couple of hours after the polls opened. Some have used the poll as an opportunity to protest, with one university lecturer arrested for completing his ballot paper in blood.

Polling closed at 3 p.m. local time (0800 UTC) with unofficial results expected later in the day.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;United States Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Secretary"&gt;Foreign Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt; have made a surprise visit to &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; to meet Iraqi officials.

The pair, who have been together for the past few days as part of Rice's visit to the United Kingdom, arrived at 10:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AUTC%252B4"&gt;local time&lt;/a&gt; (0630 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) to visit Iraqi Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20Jaafari"&gt;Ibrahim Jaafari&lt;/a&gt; and Iraqi President &lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Mr. Jaafari, who is of the majority &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20Alliance"&gt;Shia Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, is under increasing pressure to stand down after failing to gain adequate support from the opposing &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKurd"&gt;Kurd&lt;/a&gt; minority groups.

According to leading Shia politicians, who are also losing faith in the Prime Minister, the US Ambassador to Iraq &lt;a href="w%3AZalmay%20Khalilzad"&gt;Zalmay Khalilzad&lt;/a&gt; has claimed that &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; "doesn't want, doesn't support, doesn't accept" Mr. Jaafari's decision to stay at his post. Mr. Jaafari responded by claiming the comments undermine President Bush's commitment to a democratic Iraq.

The unannounced visit comes after her brief trip to Jack Straw's &lt;a href="w%3Aconstituency"&gt;constituency&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABlackburn"&gt;Blackburn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, where she faced anti-war protests. At one speech, she admitted that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; had made "thousands of tactical errors" in Iraq, but later dismissed the comments as being made purely figuratively.

<h2>Comments</h2>
On the formation of a united Iraqi government, Condoleezza Rice said she considered it a "matter of urgency." Speaking to reporters in Baghdad, she said that, "The fact that we're going out to have these discussions with the Iraqi leadership is a sign of the urgency which we attach to a need for a government of national unity."

Jack Straw is reported to have said that, "We're committed to Iraq, very committed. But we need to see progress."

Ambassador Khalilzad said last Saturday that the prospective government "...needs to have a good programme to govern from the centre and needs good ministers who are competent." He made a damning comment regarding the speed of the process by claiming that, "Iraq is bleeding while they are moving at a very slow pace."

Several explosions occurred at &lt;a href="w%3Apolling%20stations"&gt;polling stations&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, during the current snap election. Narathiwat is one of the country's southern &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;-majority provinces. 
Two &lt;a href="w%3Apolicemen"&gt;policemen&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href="w%3Asoldiers"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt; were injured. The area is a often seen as a hotbed of activity as a result of the resident &lt;a href="w%3Aseparatist"&gt;separatist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Arebels"&gt;rebels&lt;/a&gt;. More than 1,200 people have died in clashes and revenge killings in the troubled southern region, all directly linked to the insurgents, who are mainly spread across three of the main Muslim provinces.

The election has been called three years early because &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, who is accused of corruption and abuse of power, has been the subject of increasing discontent in several anti-government protests across the country.

In protest of the election, three of the rival parties in the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Thailand"&gt;Thai Parliament&lt;/a&gt; have begun a &lt;a href="w%3Aboycott"&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of reducing the number of seats able to be filled in the Parliament to below the 500 required for a government.

Thaksin, who is a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party, has promised to stand down from the Prime-Ministerial post if his party gains less than 50% of the vote in the election. Results are expected later today.

The two crew-members of a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAH-64%20Apache"&gt;Apache helicopter&lt;/a&gt; which went down near &lt;a href="w%3AYoussifiyah"&gt;Youssifiyah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; are said by U.S. officials to be presumed dead after several failed searches for their bodies in the surrounding area.

A statement by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; officials said yesterday that early reports suggested that the AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopter crashed at around 5:30pm local time on Saturday, near the town of Youssifiyah, located approximately 12 miles southwest of the Iraqi capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. The statement went on to say that the aircraft had been on "combat air patrol" at the time of the incident.

The statement, which was vague in its details, did not specify a definite crash site. Regarding current efforts to find the wreckage (and presumably the bodies), it was merely stated that "Two pilots are presumed dead, but recovery efforts continue following the crash." The identities of the two victims are known; they are being withheld until their families are notified.

No other details regarding the crash were released, and the cause of the crash is unknown at the present time, but Youssifiyah has been the site of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20insurgency"&gt;insurgency&lt;/a&gt; in the past. As of 3 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AGMT"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt; today, the US military have announced that they believe the aircraft was shot down.

Claims in the British newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sunday%20Telegraph"&gt;The Sunday Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that senior military officers of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; will meet with government officials on Monday to discuss a &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-led assault on &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; have been denied by the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;.

However, the Defence Correspondent for the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; Paul Wood said that "US plans for a possible strike are thought to be at an advanced stage." This echoes reports made in December by the influential German magazine ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADer%20Spiegel"&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that, according to a report by &lt;a href="w%3Amilitary%20intelligence"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; expert Udo Ulfkotte, during a &lt;a href="w%3ADecember%202005"&gt;December 2005&lt;/a&gt; visit to &lt;a href="w%3AAnkara"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; Director &lt;a href="w%3APorter%20Goss"&gt;Porter Goss&lt;/a&gt; asked Turkish Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARecep%20Tayyip%20Erdogan"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdogan&lt;/a&gt; for support in a potential air strike against the Iran's recently infamous &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear"&gt;nuclear&lt;/a&gt; facilities, including the &lt;a href="w%3Aenriched%20uranium"&gt;enrichment facility&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ANatanz"&gt;Natanz&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Der Spiegel♡❤ goes on to say that, "More specifically, Goss is said to have asked Turkey to provide unfettered exchange of intelligence that could help with a mission."

While speaking on British &lt;a href="w%3Atelevision"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; channel &lt;a href="w%3AITV1"&gt;ITV1&lt;/a&gt; during her recent visit to the UK, &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;US Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; said, "We believe that diplomacy has a chance to work but we are going to work with whomever we can, in whatever form we can, diplomatically, to try and bring the Iranians around. Iran is not &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. I know that's what's on people's minds. The circumstances are different." However, she then added, "The president of the United States doesn't take his options off the table."

Also on the programme with Rice was &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;, the British &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Secretary"&gt;Foreign Secretary&lt;/a&gt;. After admitting that &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; was uneasy regarding the Iran issue, he said, "They are worried about the possibility of the Iranians stirring up trouble for them, but they also share our high suspicions that Iran may be using its civil nuclear capability to develop a &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20weapon"&gt;nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; and they do not want that."

In the initial article, ♡❤The Sunday Telegraph♡❤ stated that "a high-level meeting will take place on Monday in the Ministry of Defence at which senior defence chiefs and &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20government"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; officials will consider the consequences of an attack on Iran." The Ministry of Defence, (often abbreviated to ♡❤MoD♡❤), later denied all the claims, and made it clear that there were absolutely no plans for a meeting of the kind described in the newspaper.

However, the article also went on to claim that an attack centred around removing Iran's nuclear capabilities was inevitable if &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; failed to accept the demands of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. Somewhat surprisingly, the MoD failed to comment on this point, merely stressing the false nature of the claims regarding the meeting supposedly set for tomorrow (Monday, April 3).

Regarding his country's nuclear program, Iranian President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; is maintaining his defiant stance, alluding to the fact that Article IV of the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council%20calls%20on%20Iran%20to%20suspend%20uranium%20enrichment"&gt;was reaffirmed&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; in its March 29, 2006 presidential statement, implies that Iran has as much right to press on with such technologies as any other nation which is party to the NPT.

A report from the British government concludes that the &lt;a href="w%3AOccupation%20of%20Iraq"&gt;occupation of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; motivated the men that performed the suicide bombings of London summer 2005. Other motivating factors are identified: economic deprivation, social exclusion and a disaffection with the society in general.

According to many published reports and TV sources, &lt;a href="w%3AHerb%20Sendek"&gt;Herb Sendek&lt;/a&gt;, who is under fire at &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina%20State%20Unversity"&gt;North Carolina State Unversity&lt;/a&gt; in his role as the basketball head coach, has accepted the job of head coach at &lt;a href="w%3AArizona%20State%20University"&gt;Arizona State University&lt;/a&gt; (ASU), for reportably at least a seven-figure contract. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AArizona%20Republic"&gt;Arizona Republic&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that Sendek will be named head coach on Monday, and school officials did not deny it.

Sendek went 170-118 (.590) during his 10-season stay at NC State, and this past year went 22-10 overall, and 10-6 in the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Coast%20Conference"&gt;ACC&lt;/a&gt;. Sendek is replacing Rob Evans, who was fired on March 10. Evans went 119-120 in eight years at ASU.

Not only do the citizens of the cities near rivers with rising water in Germany have sleepness nights - the flood also means more work for TV and radio stations as well. At 04:00 UTC the river &lt;a href="w%3AElbe"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt; had risen to a level of 7.36 meters, with the river continuing to rise. &lt;a href="w%3ARTL"&gt;RTL&lt;/a&gt;, a local news agency, along with several other agencies have positioned themselves at critical points along the river in order to provide TV and radio users with information.

The media can be found at these critical points along the river where they expect something unusual to happen, or where efforts are being made to protect cultural assests of the city. Equipped with satellite uplinks, video editing tools, and other means to make the filmed clips ready for broadcasting, RTL has positioned itself near the "Radeberger Schankwirtschaft" at the Brühlsche Terrassen. Helpers there have tried for the past few days to keep the water away from the restaurant, using a dam of sandbags.

A report titled: ♡❤Managing Excess Deaths in an Influenza Pandemic♡❤ dated March 22, 2006, leaked from the Home Office in the United Kingdom states that the U.K. is preparing 'mass graves' in the event that the &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; [Bird Flu] mutates. It also states that, "there are likely to be substantially more deaths than can be managed within current timescales." and that as many as 320,000 people could die if the virus mutates.

"Common [mass] burial stirs up images of the burial pits used in the great plague of 1665 — where in London 70,000 people died," the report added. It suggests that ways can be found for large-scale burial to provide recognizable individual gravesites in order to counter this association. 

"Prudent precautionary planning is under way across all elements of the response, including the health service, other essential services and local authorities," said a Home Office spokesman. However; at the moment, the virus only infects humans who have been in close or direct contact with infected poultry. The U.K. also reports that it has stockpiled at least 14.6 million doses of anti-viral medication.

The report cautions that vaccines against the virus "will not be available in the first wave of a pandemic" and that the vaccines would not be a "silver bullet." It also states that the local officials are prepared to handle only 48,000 deaths in &lt;a href="w%3AWales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; for a pandemic lasting 15 weeks, however; the reports states further that, "even with ramping local management capacity by 100%, the prudent worst case of 320,000 deaths is projected to lead to a delay of some 17 weeks from death to burial or cremation."

<h2>Arabs express interest in Kosher Phones</h2>

Mirs, an Israeli manufacturer, has created a mobile phone that blocks sex numbers, images, and other "worldly temptations." The phones do not have text messaging, videos, or a camera. The company, a subsidiary of Motorola, has sold 20,000 of them. They were originally intended for Orthodox Jews who scorn television and radio but see mobile phones as a modern necessity. Arabs have expressed interest in the phones, via Jordanian businessmen, also for religious reasons, though they are not of the same religion. Jordan is one of the few Arab countries that has a peace treaty with Israel.

<h2>Alcatel announces Lucent Technology purchase</h2>

French company &lt;a href="w%3AAlcaltel"&gt;Alcatel&lt;/a&gt; said this weekend that it will buy &lt;a href="w%3ALucent"&gt;Lucent Technologies&lt;/a&gt; for $13.4 billion. The merger will cut costs by dropping 8,800 employees, approximately 10% of their combined workforce. Lucent's CEO &lt;a href="w%3APatricia%20Russo"&gt;Patricia Russo&lt;/a&gt; will serve as the CEO of the new company, to be based in Paris. Russo said that research and development costs are a primary reason for the merger.

Today marks the beginning of the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori"&gt;Māori&lt;/a&gt; Electoral Option. The Māori Option process is held by law every five years following the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Census%20of%20Population%20and%20Dwellings"&gt;Census&lt;/a&gt;, giving voters of Māori descent the choice of being on the general roll or the Māori roll. Once Māori electors have decided which roll they are on, the Representation Committee will begin the process of redrawing the electoral boundaries. 

The Māori roll does not generally affect the proportionality of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Parliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, which is determined by the party vote (♡❤see &lt;a href="w%3AElectoral%20system%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Electoral system of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;♡❤). However the size of the Māori roll does determine how many Māori seats there are, and it is possible (through what is known as an &lt;a href="w%3Aoverhang"&gt;overhang&lt;/a&gt;) for a party to win more seats than its share of all votes should allow. Also if a party wins a seat, it does not have to meet the 5% party vote threshold to be represented in Parliament. The &lt;a href="w%3AMaori%20Party"&gt;Māori Party&lt;/a&gt; benefited both ways from the Māori seats in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;2005 election&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ADr.%20Don%20Brash"&gt;Dr. Don Brash&lt;/a&gt; said the option was promoting a "racially-divided electoral system" and National accused the Government of state-sanctioned separatism.

Brash says getting rid of the Māori Seats is an important policy for his party and that the taxpayer should not have to pay the $4.5 million bill.

&lt;a href="w%3AMaori%20Party"&gt;Māori Party&lt;/a&gt; co-leader, &lt;a href="w%3ATariana%20Turia"&gt;Tariana Turia&lt;/a&gt; said that National may need the Māori Party after the next election, and that she is "sick to death" of political opportunism.

Sometime during the night of Friday, January 28, 15 year-old Jenissa Ryan was assaulted and raped in &lt;a href="w%3AAlice%20Springs"&gt;Alice Springs&lt;/a&gt;. She was discovered near the entrance of Centralian Senior Secondary College around 10:30 a.m., and a college employee called an ambulance. The attack was not reported in the mainstream national media until this week, when it became known that the victim was the great-granddaughter of famous &lt;a href="w%3AIndigenous%20Australians"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; artist &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Namatjira"&gt;Albert Namatjira&lt;/a&gt;.

In an article published in Saturdays &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Morning%20Herald"&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;, Russell Skelton said that the fact that she was an Aborigine, and the location of her bashing, contributed to her death. "If Jenissa had been white, she might be alive today, though the scars of her brutal bashing and rape could never be erased. If she had been bashed and left for dead almost anywhere else, assistance would have been immediate and the outrage strident." He also said that if her connection to Namatjira had been known, Jenissa's death would have been a "national scandal."

<h3>Assault and rape</h3>
Police believe that she was attacked by a number of youths her own age while walking home. She continued to walk home, but collapsed unconscious near the entrance to the college. Here, according to police, she was found by three teenage boys, who dragged her out of view and raped her.

Jenissa was still alive when found. Skelton considered it likely that people had seen her during the morning but done nothing. "That means a number of residents of middle-class Grevillea Drive probably noticed. The white T-shirt and striped tracksuit pants were hard to miss," he said.

She was taken to Alice Springs Hospital, and then flown to Adelaide's Women and Children's Hospital.

<h3>Charges</h3>
On February 13 Northern Territory Police charged a 16 year-old male and a 15 year-old female with assaulting Jenissa Ryan. Three other males, aged 14, 15, and 16, have been charged with having unlawful sexual intercourse with Jenissa Ryan. Police expressed gratitude for the assistance they had received from members of the public.

<h3>Aftermath</h3>
Father Asaeli Raass said that both indigenous and non-indigenous people were in denial about the incident. "Yes, it's a painful thing, but people are sweeping it under the carpet when they should be confronting the big issues Jenissa's death raises," he said. He also said that the initial wave of publicity "never travelled outside Alice Springs."

Jenissa's mother, Carmel Ryan, said that her daughter wanted to be a painter, like her great-grandfather. "She wanted to be like him, to make a creative contribution we would all be proud of. Tragically that can never be, but I feel nothing but sorrow for the parents of the children involved in this terrible event," she said.

&lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, on the recommendation of the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Prime Minister of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, announced today that she had approved the appointment of &lt;a href="w%3AAnand%20Satyanand"&gt;Judge Anand Satyanand&lt;/a&gt; as the next &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Governor-General of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. He will take office on August 4.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; says, "Judge Satyanand will bring many personal strengths to the role of Governor-General, including a broad knowledge of the workings of government and the law, as well as a deep appreciation of the different groups and communities which make up contemporary New Zealand."

His experience makes him well suited to carry out the very important functions of Governor-General..."

Dame Silvia Cartwright will complete her term on 4 August 2006, and Judge Satyanand will be sworn in as Governor-General at "a date to be determined thereafter".

Anand Satyanand is of &lt;a href="w%3AIndo-Fijian"&gt;Indo-Fijian&lt;/a&gt; descent and a former New Zealand &lt;a href="w%3Alawyer"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Ajudge"&gt;judge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aombudsman"&gt;ombudsman&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has entered into a "nuclear safeguards agreement" which will allow it to purchase &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Under the conditions of the agreement, China must not use Australian uranium for military purposes.

The agreement was signed by Australia's Foreign Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and his Chinese counterpart, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALi%20Zhaoxing"&gt;Li Zhaoxing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the presence of their leaders Australian Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Chinese Premier &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Australia will not allow uranium to be exported to any country which has not entered into a nuclear safeguards agreement. A requirement of this agreement is that the country wishing to purchase uranium must also be a signatory to the UN's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Alexander Downer stated that China needs the uranium for its nuclear energy program. He said "Given China's high projected growth in electricity demand over the coming years, there are clear environmental benefits in diversifying from fossil fuels to low greenhouse-emission technologies such as nuclear power."

China is expected to build between 40 to 50 nuclear plants over the next 20 years.

Ian Macfarlane, Austalia's Resource Minister said that exports should begin within four years and that the agreement was only the beginning of the export process. He told ABC Radio "The signing of this agreement is really only the start of the process,

We need to move forward, there needs to be commercial negotiations between companies in Australia that are producing uranium and companies in China that wish to purchase it" he said.

It is believed that Australia, which holds 40 percent of the world's uranium, may need to increase production. At present, Australia produces 10,000 tonnes per year. It is expected that China will require 20,000 tonnes a year from Australia.

"Uranium will only be sold by contract to utilities, it cannot be used for military purposes, China will also be subject to international atomic energy safeguards and that means inspections," Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has stated and continued "Thirdly, there will be a system that will track Australian nuclear material."

Kevin Rudd, Australian Opposition's foreign affairs spokesman said that he supported the agreement. Labor's foreign affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd supports the deal.

"If we have with China effective bilateral safeguards arrangements then there should be no impediment," he said. 

Professor Ian Lowe from the Australian Conservation Foundation said in response to the deal that "This is no time to be increasing the amount of fissile material in the world."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Milne"&gt;Christine Milne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has commented "Make no mistake &amp;mdash; selling Australian uranium to China will make the world less safe."

The plane was carrying 17 people.

♡❤ABC News♡❤ reported no fatalities, but Allen Metheny, assistant director in the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;, said that some were injured and taken to the hospital; the extent of the injuries was unknown. At least 10 people have been reported to have been taken to BayHealth hospital.

The plane crashed about 6:45 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (1045 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) and broke into three separate sections. 

The C-5 Galaxy is the largest plane in operation in the U.S. military.

On Sunday, &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; tested its second underwater missile, the &lt;a href="w%3AFajr-3_rocket"&gt;Fajr-3&lt;/a&gt;. The underwater missile, Iran claims, can evade sonar.

"The missile carries a very powerful warhead that enables it to operate against groups of warships and big submarines. Even if an enemy's warship sonar can detect the missile, no warship can escape from this missile because of its high speed," said General Ali Fadavi of the Revolutionary Guards. He said the missile can travel at 328 feet a second.

If Iran's claims are correct, it would make this missile the fastest underwater missile in the world. The second fastest missile would be the &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVA-111%20Shkval"&gt;VA-111 Shkval&lt;/a&gt;, which was developed in 1995.

Iran successfully tested its first missile on March 31, 2006, and claims that it can "evade radar and it can evade anti-missile missiles," said Hossein Salami, head of the Revolutionary Guards Air Force. "This technology is completely new, without copying any other missile systems that may exist in other countries" and also says it can carry several warheads.

It is also reported that more missiles will be tested during war games later in the week.

High winds and multiple &lt;a href="w%3Atornadoes"&gt;tornadoes&lt;/a&gt; caused destruction across the American &lt;a href="w%3AMidwest"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, killing 18 people when they hit five states in the early evening, although that figure is expected to rise.

In &lt;a href="w%3ADyer%20County"&gt;Dyer County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; alone, 12 people were killed, and in &lt;a href="w%3AGibson%20County"&gt;Gibson County&lt;/a&gt;, Tennessee, a further three were lost, bringing the death toll up to 15 in that state alone. The remaining three lives were lost in &lt;a href="w%3AMissouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; as a result of high winds, although the freak weather also hit the states of &lt;a href="w%3AArkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.

When asked about the storms which caused chaos in Tennessee, Dyer County &lt;a href="w%3ASherriff"&gt;Sherriff&lt;/a&gt; Jeffrey Holt said, "This hit about 7:40 last night, so the warnings were out. They were being tracked all the way across Arkansas and Missouri as it was coming in. We had plenty of warnings, I think, just the amount of destruction in the area is what caused our fatality count to get so high. Destruction is almost absolute total destruction along some of the path of this. There's just nothing left of houses but foundation."

Numerous &lt;a href="w%3Apower%20failures"&gt;power failures&lt;/a&gt; were reported across the affected areas, with some county authorities reporting that the blackouts may go on for several days.

A dispatcher in &lt;a href="w%3APemiscot%20County"&gt;Pemiscot County&lt;/a&gt;, Missouri informed the press that, as of Monday morning, some people were still trapped in their houses as a result of the storms.

In Illinois, tornadoes touched down across at least seven counties according to local emergency officials, but no-one was severely injured or killed. The Emergency Management spokesperson for Illinois Patti Thompson reported that a large storm front which spanned the breadth of &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; from Illinois southwards was the cause of last night's dramatic weather.

In the state of &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AWilmington"&gt;Wilmington&lt;/a&gt;-based meteorologist informed members of the Associated Press that "In every county in southwest Ohio there has been some type of damage."

Repair costs for damage across the affected area are expected to be six-figure sums, and extensive work to replace destroyed segments of the infrastructure such as &lt;a href="w%3Agas"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Apower"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; supplies is already underway, said officials in all seven of the states hit this morning. The current death toll is expected to rise today, with at least one more unconfirmed death reported in Missouri already.

&lt;a href="w%3ALucent%20Technologies"&gt;Lucent Technologies&lt;/a&gt; (USA) and &lt;a href="w%3AAlcatel"&gt;Alcatel&lt;/a&gt; (France) announced a merger yesterday. The currently-unnamed entity will be a global corporation based in Paris, France and will become the second largest telecommunications equipment company behind &lt;a href="w%3ACisco"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, pulling ahead of &lt;a href="w%3AEricsson"&gt;Ericsson&lt;/a&gt;.

Sixty percent of the new company's shares will be held by Alcatel, but &lt;a href="w%3APatricia%20Russo"&gt;Patricia Russo&lt;/a&gt; of Lucent will serve as CEO. &lt;a href="w%3ABell%20Labs"&gt;Bell Labs&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;-based research and development holding of Lucent also being acquired by Alcatel, will keep their US headquarters, and a US-based entity will be set up from Bell Labs to manage sensitive US government contracts. The new firm will employ over 26,000 researchers.

However, 8,800 employees, or roughly 10% of the combined personnel, are set to be let go with the merger, after Russo's halving of the Lucent workforce. &lt;a href="w%3ACFDT"&gt;CFDT&lt;/a&gt;, the main French &lt;a href="w%3AAlcatel"&gt;Alcatel&lt;/a&gt; union involved in the deal, called a meeting of the French and European &lt;a href="w%3AWork%27s%20council"&gt;Work's council&lt;/a&gt; (Comité d'entreprise) in opposition to this move.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; launched a new crime-fighting agency to deal with "brutal and sophisticated" crimes by organised gangs. The agency's mandate and powers have been compared to that of the United States' &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASerious%20Organised%20Crime%20Agency"&gt;Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA)&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, has approximately 4,200 "law enforcement officers", some of whom are ex-&lt;a href="w%3Aspies"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt;, and will use their £400m annual budget to fight &lt;a href="w%3Acounterfeiting"&gt;counterfeiting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Afraud"&gt;fraud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIllegal%20drug%20trade"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Apeople-trafficking"&gt;people-trafficking&lt;/a&gt;.

The agency was created out of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Crime%20Squad"&gt;National Crime Squad&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Criminal%20Intelligence%20Service"&gt;National Criminal Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; and investigative staff from the &lt;a href="w%3AImmigration%20Service"&gt;Immigration Service&lt;/a&gt;. SOCA is chaired by ex-&lt;a href="w%3AMI5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt; chief &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Lander"&gt;Sir Stephen Lander&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>New Powers</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3ASOCA"&gt;SOCA&lt;/a&gt; will take advantage of new powers which have been brought in by the Blair government to help tackle serious and organised crime. The main four are:

♡❤♡Queen's Evidence♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="w%3AProsecutors"&gt;Prosecutors&lt;/a&gt; are now able to offer formal statutory deals, such as immunity or a reduced sentence, to those who testify against other accused criminals.

♡❤♡Financial reporting orders♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
Courts can compel criminals to supply their &lt;a href="w%3Abank%20statements"&gt;bank statements&lt;/a&gt; of up to 20 years past, to demonstrate that they have had no crime related earnings.

♡❤♡Disclosure notices♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
Courts can limit the suspect's &lt;a href="w%3Aright%20to%20remain%20silent"&gt;right to remain silent&lt;/a&gt;, by ordering prison terms or fines if the suspect refuses to testify or provide documents.

♡❤♡Law enforcement officers♡❤♡&lt;br&gt;
SOCA officers are empowered to exercise multiple powers, that of the &lt;a href="w%3Apolice"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aimmigration"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Acustoms"&gt;customs&lt;/a&gt; officials.

<h2>Blair's Comments</h2>
When Prime Minister Tony Blair announced SOCA yesterday, he made several comments regarding the nature of &lt;a href="w%3Aorganised%20crime"&gt;organised crime&lt;/a&gt; today and the disorganised and underpowered police force expected to combat it. After announcing that SOCA would make life "hell" for what he dubs "criminal Mr. Bigs", he continued to outline what he believed to be the type of crime Britain was dealing with today.

"The level of sophistication, the level, frankly, of brutality with which many of these gangs operate today means that we have to do it differently. Organised crime is a chain, the bottom link of which is the consumer and the individual victim. Even an apparently invisible and victimless crime like defrauding a financial institution has ramifications for ordinary people. Organised crime, like most crimes, tends to make victims of the poor as least as much, if not more, than the wealthy. So there is an imperative to act."

After declaring that he would introduce any necessary new powers to help the new agency achieve its goals, he said, "There is absolutely nothing, in my view, that should come before the basic liberties of people in this country to be freed from the tyranny of this type of organised crime."

Five people are dead and three are injured after a &lt;a href="w%3Aroadside%20bomb"&gt;roadside bomb&lt;/a&gt; blew up a minibus in rural &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. According to a security officer, who has chosen to remain anonymous, a mother and her 5-year-old child are among the dead.

They were travelling in a minibus, which was on a dirt track in the village of Tata Khel, approximately 25km west of the town of &lt;a href="w%3AMiran%20Shah"&gt;Miran Shah&lt;/a&gt;. Of the eight individuals thought to be in the vehicle at the time, three died in the explosion, two died later in hospital and the remaining three are injured.

This attack comes at the same time as another similar incident, this time in the village of Ghulam Khan. In this bombing, the vehicle was damaged but there were no casualties. Another recent attack involved two militants who attacked troops with a grenade in the town of Mir Ali. Five soldiers were killed, and the two assailants were subsequently shot. All three incidents occurred in the troubled northern region of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Waziristan"&gt;North Waziristan&lt;/a&gt;.

The Pakistani authorities have deployed thousands of troops to the affected area over the past few years, but as of yet any positive effects are hard to see.

According to unofficial estimates by &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20News%20Agency"&gt;the Thai News Agency (TNA)&lt;/a&gt;, 10 million voters chose the "none of the above" option in Sunday's election. These estimates put the party-list vote for incumbent Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai (TRT)&lt;/a&gt; party at 16 million. (Thai Rak Thai means, literally, "Thais Love Thais" &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AThai_Rak_Thai"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) Shinawatra cited a total vote of 28 million, compared to 32 million in the previous general election.

Reporting the PM's appearance on national television, TNA quoted him as saying he might resign to achieve better national unity. "I'm ready to have a break in politics if ...". His offer is conditional on the return by major players in the anti-Thaksin People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) to their prior roles, and on the participation of opposition parties in the next general election.

Choosing to emphasise Thaksin's claim of victory, an article in the Thai publication ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Nation%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, written in the English language, included passages portraying the PM less favourably. "Tell me how the country would be better off without me", Thaksin challenged at a party meeting. "The 16 million should be told how the country will be reconciled if I step down."

Sunday's poll passed fairly peacefully, although three bomb blasts injuring six persons were reported in &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt;, one of the southern provinces where Malay separatist tensions have seen over 1,000 killed since January 2004.

A &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; federal fuckin' damned jury found that self-confessed &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaida"&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt; conspirator &lt;a href="w%3AZacarias%20Moussaoui"&gt;Zacarias Moussaoui&lt;/a&gt; may, according to U.S. law, be put to death after deciding that his statements to &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; agents led directly to at least one death in the &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorist"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; attacks on &lt;a href="w%3ASept.%2011%2C%202001"&gt;September 11, 2001&lt;/a&gt;. 

Moussaoui is alleged to have had prior knowledge of the &lt;a href="w%3A9/11"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt; attacks, but did not inform FBI agents of it. Evidence of Moussaoui's knowledge of 9/11 attacks are based on Moussaoui's own testimony, and some &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaida"&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt; members have said that "he knew nothing" and is "boasting" of it and that &lt;a href="w%3ARamzi%20Binalshibh"&gt;Ramzi Binalshibh&lt;/a&gt; is the actual '&lt;a href="w%3A20th%20hijacker"&gt;20th hijacker&lt;/a&gt;'. Aaron Zebley, one of the FBI's two chief case agents on the Moussaoui investigation, also testified that "Moussaoui knew nothing about some key elements" of the 9/11 plot.

Moussaoui is the only person to face charges in connection with the 9/11 attacks. It was not expected that Moussaoui would testify on his own behalf during the trial, but he changed his mind and testified in the last week of March that he was supposed to fly a plane with the "shoe bomber" on 9/11. Moussaoui's lawyers said that his claim was absurd and that Moussaoui was intentionally trying to elicit an execution for martyrdom purposes.

Moussaoui refused to stand and prayed silently as the &lt;a href="w%3Averdict"&gt;verdict&lt;/a&gt; was read. "You'll never get my blood, God curse you all," Moussaoui said after the jurors had left the courtroom.

The jury took four days to arrive at the verdict. "By this verdict, the jury has found that death is a possible sentence in this case," a court spokesman said. On the key question before the jurors, they answered yes on whether at least one victim died on 9/11 as a direct result of Moussaoui's actions.

If the jury had voted against his eligibility for the death penalty, Moussaoui would have been sentenced to life in prison.

The jury began weighing Moussaoui's fate last Wednesday. During its deliberations, jurors asked only one question, seeking a definition of a "weapon of mass destruction." One of the three convictions for which Moussaoui could be put to death is conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction.

The jurors were told that a plane used as a &lt;a href="w%3Amissile"&gt;missile&lt;/a&gt; (the tactic employed on 9/11) qualifies as a weapon of mass destruction.

Moussaoui pleaded guilty April 2005 to conspiring with al-Qaida to hijack aircraft and other crimes. At the time, he denied being part of the 9/11 plot, saying he was being trained for a separate attack, but he changed his testimony when he took the stand and claimed he was supposed to have flown a &lt;a href="w%3Ahijacked"&gt;hijacked&lt;/a&gt; jetliner into the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; that day.

Moussaoui was in jail at the time of the attacks, but prosecutors argue federal agents would have been able to stop or at least minimize the attacks if he had revealed his al-Qaida membership and his terrorist plans when he was arrested and interrogated by federal agents.

The last people &lt;a href="w%3Aexecuted"&gt;executed&lt;/a&gt; without killing anyone were Julius and Ethel &lt;a href="w%3AJulius%20and%20Ethel%20Rosenberg"&gt;Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; fifty years ago.

<h2>Next phase of the trial</h2>
Now that this first phase of the trial to decide possible penalties is established, the jury of nine men and three women will hear more testimony, expected last as long as 3-months, on whether the 37-year-old Frenchman will face life imprisonment or &lt;a href="w%3Aexecution"&gt;execution&lt;/a&gt;. 

Testimony will include the families of 9/11 victims who will describe the human toll of the al-Qaida operation, in which four passenger airliners were taken over and two were flown to New York City and crashed into the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;, a third airplane struck the &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;, and the last crashed in a field near Shanksville, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; apparently, after passengers intervened.

Court-appointed defense lawyers, whom Moussaoui has tried to reject, will summon experts to suggest he is schizophrenic after a cruel childhood during which he faced racism in France over his &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Moroccan&lt;/a&gt; ancestry.

On Friday, Judge Robert Simpson Jr. threw out a petition challenge brought by Jane Faust against &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Murphy%20%28politician%29"&gt;Patrick Murphy&lt;/a&gt;, a candidate for the 8th Congressional District in &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. Josh Nanberg, Murphy's campaign manager, stated, "We won."

The case centered on objections to Murphy's nominating papers. The judge threw the case out due to a part of the law which requires that any objections must be raised at least seven days prior to the court case to allow the defendant time to collect evidence. The objections in this case were brought the day of the trial.

Jen Paski, a spokeswoman for the &lt;a href="w%3ADCCC"&gt;Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&lt;/a&gt; said, “We were very distressed by this challenge and we are absolutely thrilled that it failed."

The lawyer who filed the challenge on behalf of Faust has stated that he will continue the case, and will attempt to bring it to the &lt;a href="w%3Astate%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;state Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Pennsylvania Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;.

According to various news reports, former &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMajority%20Leader%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Majority Leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt; (R-Texas) will announce his withdrawal from the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congressional&lt;/a&gt; race on Tuesday, April 4, 2006.

In an interview on Monday, April 3, 2006, DeLay spoke with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Magazine"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Magazine's &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; correspondent Mike Allen, revealing his plans to give up his bid for re-election to the House seat representing the 22nd District in &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, DeLay said that he plans to leave Congress in the next few months, though he has not yet decided on the date.

DeLay's office released a taped statement to media outlets on April 4, 2006 that addressed his decision to resign from Congress. "I will make that resignation effective sometime before mid-June, but largely dependent on the congressional calendar. I plan to begin focusing on the next phase of my life as a private citizen." DeLay's statement points to "negative, personal campaign[ing]" by "liberal Democrats" as a reason behind his resignation. He plans to determine "new ways from various arenas outside of public office that will allow me to continue to contribute to and engage in the policy, political, and cultural issues of national importance to the conservative majority." DeLay will be moving from Texas to his property in Virginia in order to be closer to Washington, DC. 

DeLay has served in Congress for 11 terms. He temporarily gave up his seat as House Majority leader in 2005 after he was indicted in Texas on money laundering charges and then permanently relinquished his House leadership position in January 2006. DeLay has &lt;a href="w%3ATom_DeLay%23Jack_Abramoff"&gt;allegedly been linked&lt;/a&gt; to lobbyist &lt;a href="Jack%20Abramoff"&gt;Jack Abramoff&lt;/a&gt;, who in January 2006 entered a guilty plea to charges of conspiracy to corrupt public officials, &lt;a href="w%3Amail%20fraud"&gt;mail fraud&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Atax%20evasion"&gt;tax evasion&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has successfully tested the Kowsar land-to-sea missile, and a "flying boat", Iran state media report.

According to the country's state television service, "A super-modern flying boat was successfully tested in the 'Great Prophet' war game in Persian Gulf waters. Because of its hull's advanced design, no radar at sea or in the air can locate it. It can lift out of the water. It is wholly domestically built and can launch missiles with precise targeting while moving."

Iran says that the Kowser missile can be used to sink enemy ships in the Gulf. Iran also announced that the missile's onboard systems could not be scrambled by enemy action.

Brian Whitman, a spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, said, "We know that the Iranians are always trying to improve their weapons system by both foreign and indigenous measures. It's possible that they are increasing their capability and making strides in radar-absorbing materials and technology. [However] the Iranians have also been known to boast and exaggerate [in] their statements about greater technical and tactical capabilities."

On Friday, Iran tested its Fajr-3 missile, which Iran says can evade radar and can carry many warheads. On Monday, Iran tested in the Straits of Hormuz a torpedo that the country claims can evade sonar.

It is estimated that at least 1500 ships and aircraft, and at least 17,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops, are participating in a week-long war games exercise in the Gulf.

Rumours in London and Merseyside have linked &lt;a href="w%3ACollyer_brothers_%2528game_designers%2529"&gt;Paul and Oliver Collyer&lt;/a&gt;, creators of the football management series &lt;a href="w%3AChampionship%20Manager"&gt;Championship Manager&lt;/a&gt;, with a possible bid for Premiership football team &lt;a href="w%3AEverton%20F.C."&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt;.

The Goodison Park club, under the chairmanship of former &lt;a href="w%3ACoronation%20Street"&gt;Coronation Street&lt;/a&gt; actor &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Kenwright"&gt;Bill Kenwright&lt;/a&gt;, were subjects of a failed takeover bid in August 2004. After suffering the blow of failing to get beyond the qualifying stage of the &lt;a href="w%3AChampions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, Kenwright is known to have recently sought additional investments in the club.

While a move is not thought to be imminent, the recent takeover of the brothers' games development company &lt;a href="w%3ASports%20Interactive"&gt;Sports Interactive&lt;/a&gt; by game giant &lt;a href="w%3ASEGA"&gt;SEGA&lt;/a&gt; could well prove the catalyst for action by the lifelong Evertonians. The company's PR guru &lt;a href="w%3AMiles%20Jacobson"&gt;Miles Jacobson&lt;/a&gt; was forced into an official denial of the story soon after the takeover news broke on Tuesday morning. The Collyers themselves have as yet been unavailable for comment.

&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, announced his resignation in a national telecast on Tuesday, April 4, 2006. His statement included an apology to his supporters and a hope that his resignation will help heal divisions in the country &amp;mdash; "Our house is broken and it needs to be put back together." He will not continue as prime minister when Parliament reconvenes; however, he will continue as a member of Parliament and as &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai (TRT)&lt;/a&gt; party leader. The process to select his successor will begin in the first new session of Parliament.

Only the previous day, Monday, Thaksin had expressed his intention to continue as Prime Minister, following his party's election win. The reversal came after an audience with King &lt;a href="w%3ABhumibol%20Adulyadej"&gt;Bhumibol Adulyadej&lt;/a&gt; 

Although Thaksin's TRT party won the April 2nd election, the results were disappointing, with over one-third of voters choosing 'none of the above'. After the election there had been continuing calls for his resignation. 

Thaksin's standdown will likely end months of calls for the dissolution of his government which has been charged by protesters of corruption and misuse of authority. In October 2005, he sued &lt;a href="w%3ASondhi%20Limthongkul"&gt;Sondhi Limthingkul's&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, the Phujatkarn Daily, over corruption allegations. Sondi's move to open-air shows where he detailed further corruption allegations grew into the PAD (People's Alliance for Democracy) and following the &lt;a href="w%3AShin%20Corporation"&gt;Shin Corp&lt;/a&gt; sale, PAD protests forced Thaksin to call a snap election.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Florida"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Gators beat the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUCLA"&gt;University of Calfornia, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Bruins 73-57 in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARCA%20Dome"&gt;RCA Dome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last night. The win gave the Gators their first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANCAA"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abasketball"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; championship. The Gators, a number three seed in the tournament, spent most of the night dominating the Bruins on both offense and defense.

Joakim Noah, center for the Gators, recorded 16 points, nine rebounds, and a NCAA tournament championship game record 6 blocks. Noah said, "It's like I'm in a cloud. Not only does this feel good, but it smells good and it tastes good. I can't even describe it."

In the previous two games the Bruins allowed only a combined 90 points, but they never seemed to get organized on defense. Florida's early lead stayed throughout the game, with the Bruins unable to re-take the lead.

Joakim Noah's father &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYannick%20Noah"&gt;Yannick Noah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was a French tennis player (now a singer) who won the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoland%20Garros"&gt;Roland Garros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tennis tournament. His grandfather was a soccer professional. It's the first time a french basketball player has been part of a winning &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANCAA"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abasketball"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; championship team. He'll join &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Parker"&gt;Tony Parker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the French national basketball team.

Roughly translating to "idiot", "cretin", or "fool" in English, it is Italian slang for "testicles", it is as rude as the term "prick-head".

&lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union%20Commission"&gt;European Union Commission&lt;/a&gt; President and opponent of Berlusconi, was quick to criticize his use of the term, stating, "With all the respect I have for (Berlusconi's) voters I would never use that anatomical term we heard today used about us."

Berlusconi later defended himself, stating that his comments were supposed to be "ironic" and that his opponents were manipulating what he said.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADanube%20River"&gt;Danube River&lt;/a&gt;, running from &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, is currently at 859&amp;nbsp;cm (28 ft 2 in) higher than its normal level in &lt;a href="w%3ABudapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. Climatologists are predicting that the river will crest as high as 865&amp;nbsp;cm (28' 5"). This places the crest higher than in 2002, when floods swept across all Europe. The Danube crested at 860&amp;nbsp;cm (28' 3") high then. 

According to officials, 11,000 buildings are in danger of flood damage, and 172 hectares (475 acres) of land are currently under water. Officials also placed the country under a Level 3 Alert (on a 3 level scale).

&lt;a href="w%3AMargit%20Island"&gt;Margit Island&lt;/a&gt; is completely under water, with 3500 sandbags giving it protection. The riverside is no less under water, and the underground number 2 (M2) is currently in danger of being closed since one of its stations, Battyány tér, is flooded. 

According to Hungarian Water engineers, a flood of this magnitude hasn't occurred since 1838 when ice coming down the river blocked the Danube, creating a natural dam which caused the water to flood everything behind it.

General elections are on Sunday in Hungary. The election is heated with MSZP and FIDESZ in a virtual dead heat with polls rating both at 45%. Other smaller parties are voicing concern about gaining a 5% toe-hold to gain a seat in Parliament. It is not yet clear how the flood will impact the final campaign.

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; government has received reports that a family of six people from the &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Papua"&gt;West Papua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are camping on Bamboo Island in the Torres Strait. The Australian customs service is trying to verify the accuracy of the reports.

It is believed that the group consists of a union activist, his wife and four children. One of the children is believed to be two months old.

A spokesman for Australian immigration minister Amanda Vanstone said that the government were aware of the reports but that it is an operational matter and no further comment will be made.

The Australian Customs Service cannot confirm the reports and are seeking assistance from other authorities in the area. A customs spokesperson said that the area they are searching is massive with hundreds of islands, and that he was unaware of any island called Bamboo.

Father Yus Mawengkang, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholicism"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; priest in Papua, said the family had been transported to the island on fishing boats and hoped that they would be collected by Australian authorities. He was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying, "They cannot stay there for too long… they only have some packets of instant noodles and canned fish only to survive for a few days."

The latest group of Papuans are believed to be from the town of Merauke, the same town where 43 people left to seek political asylum in Australia two months ago. All but one of that group were granted refugee visas, sparking a diplomatic row between Australia and Indonesia.

&lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has released an application that limits the volume produced from its &lt;a href="w%3Aipod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; portable music players. The software update, iPod Software 1.1.1, works with the iPod Nano and the Video version. Apple released the program in response to complaints that it had not taken necessary measures to prevent hearing loss in iPod users. 

In California, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Apple in January over claims of hearing loss from iPod use.

Apple's worldwide vice-president of marketing for the iPod, Greg Joswiak, indicated that this patch is available for people who want "an easy-to-use option to set their own personal volume limit." It is available for free download.

The software also has the option of being used with &lt;a href="w%3Aparental%20control"&gt;parental control&lt;/a&gt;s to prevent children from modifying the volume.

iPods sold in France already have the volume limited, as the law forbids a sound louder than 100 &lt;a href="w%3ADecibel"&gt;decibels (dB)&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Speech%20Language%20Hearing%20Association"&gt;American Speech Language Hearing Association&lt;/a&gt; published a study where it appears that iPod's (and mp3 players's) power is 120 dB, comparable to a live concert. A gunshot is 140 dB.

One and a half weeks after a broken sewer line in the Waikiki district of &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; spilled 48 million gallons of raw sewage, health officials for the state of &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; removed warning signs today from Waikiki beaches after water samples taken yesterday indicated that bacterial levels had returned to normal.

The sewage spill into the Ala Wai Canal forced the closure of Waikiki beaches when bacterial levels from the spill reached hazardous levels. Officials credit improved weather and the return of trade winds for the rapid dissipation.

Beaches in nearby Ala Moana Park near the mouth of the Ala Wai Canal remain closed for the time being. Water quality at the spill site on the Ala Wai continues to improve, and the bacterial levels in the canal are expected to return to normal within a week.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has announced a five year plan costing AU$1.8 billion to address issues with the country's mental health system. The plan follows a commitment made at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting in February.

The federal government will improve access to clinical and health services, increase the number of mental health professionals in Australia, create mental health work teams consisting of GPs, psychiatrists, psychologists and mental health nurses, provide respite services for people suffering mental illness and their carers, and introduce new programs for community awareness.

Mr Howard said the plan addresses issues which fall into its area of responsibility. He hopes that the states and territories will complement the federal government's package by investing in supported accommodation, hospital and emergency services, crisis care services and the provision of mental health care in gaols.

Under the federal government's plan, psychologists will play a greater role in the mental health system. From November, Patients will be able to claim a rebate from &lt;a href="w%3AMedicare%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; (Australia's universal healthcare scheme) for the services of psychologists if they have been referred by a GP or psychiatrist. At present patients pay around $100 for a standard 30 minute consultation.

Mr Howard claims that there is an issue for mental health professionals in treating patients with a substance abuse problem and mental illness. To address this the government will provide extra funding for drug and alcohol rehabilitation services.

The government will increase the mental health workforce by funding an additional 400 mental health nursing and 200 clinical psychology places. 900 personal helpers and mentors will also be employed.

The government has promised increase funding for telephone counselling and suicide prevention services, living skills programs and additional support for those with a mental illness who are having difficulty finding or keeping work.

The government will also provide 900 personal helpers and mentors, increase funding for living skills programs and provide additional employment assistance to those who have difficulty finding or retaining employment due to their illness.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; researchers, tests performed on &lt;a href="w%3Acat"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt; at Rotterdam's Erasmus Medical Center by &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; show that cats could play a key role in transmitting &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20influenza"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; to humans.

Reports have noted that there are increased deaths in &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAsia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; involving cats that are carrying the deadly disease and also say that cats could play a key role in allowing mutation of bird flu so it can be transmitted between humans.

"Apart from the role that cats may play in &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; virus transmission to other species, they may be involved in helping the virus to adapt to efficient human-to-human transmission," said researchers.

The experiments were performed on eight cats, all of which were exposed to the H5N1 virus in three different ways. In all three cases, the cats became infected. The researchers said that most domestic cats became infected with the H5N1 virus when they came in contact with wild and or domestic birds. In some cases, those cats transmitted the virus to other cats.

However, researchers said that their research was performed experimentally with infected cats and that those experiments did not show a mutation in the virus but did say that "such mutations cannot be ruled out."

Researchers have strongly suggested that cats be kept indoors, but also said that this measure would be "impossible" in some parts of the world.

Researchers also say that cats need to be included in any precautionary measures against the virus.

"We have to take a number of precautionary measures. We need to keep in mind that mammals can be infected and that they can spread the disease, in principle. The potential role of cats should be considered in official guidelines for controlling the spread of H5N1 virus," said Dr. Albert Osterhaus, of &lt;a href="w%3AErasmus%20University"&gt;Erasmus University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARotterdam"&gt;Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.

The "girl" was, in fact, an undercover detective mounting a &lt;a href="w%3Asting%20operation"&gt;sting operation&lt;/a&gt;.

He was charged with 23 felony counts. These included seven counts of using a computer to seduce a child and sixteen counts of transmitting harmful materials to a child. In chats with the "girl", Doyle stated that he worked for the DHS and gave her his work and government cell phone numbers. He also wrote sexually explicit messages to the subject via &lt;a href="w%3AAOL%20Instant%20Messenger"&gt;AOL Instant Messenger&lt;/a&gt; and sent "her" explicit hardcore &lt;a href="w%3Apornography"&gt;pornographic&lt;/a&gt; videos.

&lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; unveiled today a new program called "&lt;a href="w%3ABoot%20Camp"&gt;Boot Camp&lt;/a&gt;" which will allow &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Macintosh"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt; users to switch between running &lt;a href="w%3AMac_OS_X"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; on start-up of their &lt;a href="w%3Ax86"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Macintosh"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt; computer. Shares of the company rose roughly 7% in response to the news.

After Apple switched to Intel processors, enthusiasts and hackers have been trying to install Windows XP on a Mac. Because Macs boot using a faster and more modern system that Windows does not support, booting Windows was a very complicated task. 

Mac enthusiasts reportedly achieved this task in mid-March when the website OnMac.net hosted a contest &lt;a href="http%3A//www.winxponmac.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The winning solution found involved a lengthy process that took both operating systems off and put them both back on. In addition, individual files had to be downloaded and installed, and there were no drivers for many things, most notably games. 

Apple fixed both of these problems, with all major drivers included, and the process reportedly now takes less then an hour as compared to 3-9 hours. 

The program is available for download, in beta form, from the Apple website. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It will be included in the newest Mac OS, called &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS%20X%20v10.5"&gt;Leopard&lt;/a&gt;, once that operating system is released.

<h1>Thaksin departure doesn't signal end to Thai political crisis</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Thaksin%20departure%20doesn%27t%20signal%20end%20to%20Thai%20political%20crisis&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Despite promising to step down before the new parliament convenes, caretaker &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; is still embroiled in controversy. Opposition parties have stated they will not run in the by-elections on April 23.

Democrat leader Jurin Laksanawisit was quoted in ThaiDay, an insert in the Thai edition of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Herald%20Tribune"&gt;International Herald Tribune&lt;/a&gt; as saying, "the three parties still do not trust him because he is still the caretaker Prime Minister and behind the person who will be the new prime minister."

Leading candidates for the PM's job are &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; (lit. ♡❤Thais love Thais♡❤) party Deputy PM, Somkid Jatusripitak, and Pokin Polakul, a former parliamentary speaker. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;Bangkok Post&lt;/a&gt;, Thaksin favours Pokin whilst others within the party favour Somkid. 

The key to the potential crisis is 38 seats in Democrat territory. These were among over 200 seats where the populist Thai Rak Thai party ran unopposed due to major opposition parties boycotting the election. These constituencies are special because the sole candidate in each of them failed to get the required 20% of eligble votes. By-elections will be held on April 23, but a repeat of the void election will leave the parliament short of the 400 constituency MPs and in a situation which is not anticipated in the Thai constitution.

The soon to be ex-PM has appointed Police General Chidchai Vanasatidya, the Justice Minister, to run the country and cabinet while he takes some time off. According to the Thai News Agency, the caretaker Prime Minister has begun packing to leave Government House.

Fighting on, Thaksin Shinawatra has instructed his lawyers to file yet another defamation suit against &lt;a href="w%3ASondhi%20Limthongkul"&gt;Sondhi Limthongkul&lt;/a&gt;, media firebrand and one of the leaders of the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD); Chatree Tharipassaro filed the suit at the Criminal Court on behalf of the caretaker PM, allegations contained within centre around remarks Sondhi made at various anti-Thaksin rallies.

<h1>Swan in Fife, Scotland dies with H5N1 bird flu virus infection</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Swan%20in%20Fife%2C%20Scotland%20dies%20with%20H5N1%20bird%20flu%20virus%20infection&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
It has been confirmed that tests done on a dead &lt;a href="w%3AMute%20Swan"&gt;Mute Swan&lt;/a&gt; found in the village of &lt;a href="w%3ACellardyke"&gt;Cellardyke&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFife"&gt;Fife&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; has tested positive for the deadly strain of &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; Bird Flu virus. The swan is believed to have been native to Scotland.

Two other swans found in Richmond Park in &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; are being tested for the H5N1 virus. They are among at least 14 other dead birds and 12 more swans found in Glasgow, that are being tested for the H5N1 virus.

This is the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s first confirmed case of the H5N1 virus and would make the U.K. the 14th country to report the virus.

"The risk to humans has not changed by the fact that we have found the virus in the U.K.. There is a better chance of a person winning the national lottery than catching bird flu in the U.K. today," said Doctor Jim Robertson from the National Institutes for Biological Standards and Control in a press conference.

"We also have to work on the assumption that there is some spread among wild birds. There is no doubt we are getting closer to the day when moving birds indoors will be necessary," said former President of the British Veterinary Association, Bob McCracken. "The situation is that the virus is there, and it will probably continue to circulate among the birds. It will spread through close contact, irrespective of species. There is one big question mark: Will the virus disappear from wild birds after a period of six months, or will it still be present after a period of six years?" added McCracken.

McCracken also said that the virus could turn up in more birds saying, "I would start from the assumption that a small pool of wild birds in the Fife area are infected and potentially passing it on to other birds" and that seagulls could pose a threat of passing on the virus because they have been known to peck at the bodies of other dead birds that were infected. "We have to assume that," he said.

In a statement by the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20for%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs"&gt;Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, released yesterday, the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Executive"&gt;Scottish Executive&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that a "highly pathogenic H5 avian flu" virus was found in a sample taken from the dead &lt;a href="w%3Aswan"&gt;swan&lt;/a&gt;.

The swan was discovered March 29, 2006 and has been confirmed as a domestic species and officials say that it may have caught the virus from another infected bird. Officials also report that the area where the swan has been found is being sealed off.

"In accordance with a recent EU decision the Scottish Executive is putting in place a protection zone of a minimum of three kilometres radius and a surveillance zone of 10 kilometers. Keepers of birds in the protection zone are being instructed to isolate their birds from wild birds, by taking them indoors where ever possible," said the Scottish Executive in a statement.

Samples from the swan were sent to the European Union Bird Flu Laboratory at &lt;a href="w%3AWeybridge"&gt;Weybridge&lt;/a&gt;.

"Bird keepers outside the protection zone should redouble their efforts to prepare for bringing their birds indoors if that becomes necessary. They must also review their biosecurity measures to ensure that all possible precautions have been taken," said Charles Milne, Chief Veterinary Officer for Scotland yesterday in the statement.

An exercise named 'Exercise Hawthorn' was to prepare people for a possible pandemic was taking place yesterday and was halted just after the discovery of the dead swan. Officials were in the second phase of the exercise. Taking part in the exercises were the Ministry of Defence, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Environment Agency and several other areas of the British government.

"I brought to an end the national avian influenza exercise to ensure that we can bring all our resources to bear on this situation. We are already in a high state of readiness and I have every confidence that officials north and south of the border will work together to manage this incident successfully," said the United Kingdom's Chief Veterinary Officer, Debby Reynolds.

However; today Reynolds stated "there is no reason for public health concern" and also stated that in order for Bird Flu to infect humans, it would require "extremely close contact with infected birds, particularly feces."

According to the World Health Organization H5N1 has killed 109 people worldwide since 2003.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Today, &lt;a href="w%3AGuinea"&gt;Guinean&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3ALansana%20Conte"&gt;Lansana Conte&lt;/a&gt; fired his prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3ACellou%20Dalein%20Diallo"&gt;Cellou Dalein Diallo&lt;/a&gt;, for "grave wrongdoing and serious misconduct." The two appeared to be in a power struggle as President Conte quickly reversed a shuffle planned by PM Diallo that would have replaced allies of President Conte with allies of PM Diallo. The shuffle was announced on a radio broadcast but was stopped short by Army members because Secretary-General of the Presidency, Fode Bangoura, had not been notified. Opposition groups called for a new government while President Conte was receiving medical treatment in Switzerland, but he returned immediately to reduce any concerns.

Local journalist Maseco Conde says he believes the army was acting under the orders of President Conte and not under its own initiative. He says in the current context of Guinea's politics, it would not be possible for anyone to take such an initiative without the consent of President Conte. But the journalist says even though Mr. Conte is still in control, this latest political fiasco shows he is losing his tight grip on power.

Amid an escalating rape and racial discrimination scandal involving members of the &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20University"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; Men's &lt;a href="w%3ALacrosse"&gt;Lacrosse&lt;/a&gt; team, Monday the university announced it has cancelled the rest of the team's season. Head coach Mike Pressler has also resigned after 16 seasons with the Blue Devils, winning last year's &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Coast%20Conference"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; championships, and leading his 2005 squad to the national title game.

Allegations of rape surfaced last week when an African-American exotic dancer came forward, saying she was forcefully engaged into sexual intercourse by a group of caucasian lacrosse players at a house party. The investigation is continuing, with investigators awaiting DNA test results from all 46 white athletes on the team of 47. 

No charges have been filed. However, a team member has been suspended from the University for an e-mail proposing a grisly entertainment in his dorm room. DNA samples have been taken from the 46 caucasian team members.

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Businesses that employ more than 10 people are required to provide health insurance for all staff or face fines of $295 per year per uninsured worker.
BULLET::::2. Individuals will be required to enroll in a health plan by July 1, 2007, or face tax penalties.
BULLET::::3. Health insurers will provide partially to fully subsidized coverage for low-income residents.

</ol>
At least one other state (&lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;) requires employers to provide employee health insurance, but no other state holds individuals accountable for coverage.

&lt;a href="w%3AMedha%20Patkar"&gt;Medha Patkar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANarmada%20Bachao%20Andolan"&gt;Narmada Bachao Andolan&lt;/a&gt; activist in the ninth day of a hunger strike protesting the &lt;a href="w%3ASardar%20Sarovar%20Project"&gt;Sardar Sarovar Project&lt;/a&gt;, is forcibly moved to hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; by police.

On the ninth day of the &lt;a href="w%3Ahunger%20strike"&gt;hunger strike&lt;/a&gt; she and two other activists had undertaken to protest the &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; government's decision to raise the height of the &lt;a href="w%3ASardar%20Sarovar%20Project"&gt;Sardar Sarovar dam&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href="w%3ANarmada"&gt;Narmada&lt;/a&gt; river and the lack of progress in rehabilitating people displaced by the dam project, Patkar was taken to the &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20India%20Institute%20of%20Medical%20Sciences"&gt;All India Institute of Medical Sciences&lt;/a&gt; where she was placed under intensive care. Doctors have said that she is conscious and her condition is stable. 

Police sources say that Patkar has not been arrested as of now, but an &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Information%20Report"&gt;First Information Report&lt;/a&gt; has been lodged against her for attempting to commit suicide. 

Activists of the Narmada Bachao Andolan tried to prevent the police from moving Patkar and some were arrested on rioting charges. 

<h2>Hunger strike</h2>
Patkar, Jamsinh Nargave and Bhagwatibai Patidar began an indefinite fast on March 29, refusing food and medical care. They called on the government to reverse its decision to raise the height of the dam under construction from 110m to 121m
and demanded proper rehabilitation for people displaced by the project. &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20India"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; rulings of Oct 2000 and March 2005 stated that further construction on the dam (above 110m) was illegal until temporarily and permanently affected families were rehabilitated as per the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal Award. 

Patkar said "If the construction work for increasing the height of the dam is started, over 35,000 people will lose their land by the month of June." and that "Yet, most of the villagers living along the Narmada river bank have not been provided alternative land holdings".

The Indian Water Resources Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASaifuddin%20Soz"&gt;Saifuddin Soz&lt;/a&gt; and other central ministers met the protestors and called on them to end the fast, promising suitable rehabilitation. 

"We urge Medha Patkar to break her fast. She is welcome to continue her protest and raise the issue with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, my ministry and the courts," said Soz.

On April 3rd, the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed to the hunger strikers to end their fast. Three union ministers are also planning to visit the dam site to personally supervise the rehabilitation work.

<h2>The Sardar Sarovar dam project</h2>
The Sardar Sarovar Project involves the construction of a series of large hydroelectric dams on the Narmada River in India. Although first conceived of in the 1940s by the country's first prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJawaharlal%20Nehru"&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru&lt;/a&gt;, the project began only after 1979. Officials say that the dam is essential for drought-prone areas in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh but the dam has been mired in controversy over its environmental impact, costs and benefits since the late 1980s.

Local protests have coalesced under the Narmada Bachao Andolan (Save Narmada Movement) led by Medha Patkar. The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; was a funder of the SSP, but withdrew after an independent review in 1990. Indian writer &lt;a href="w%3AArundhati%20Roy"&gt;Arundhati Roy&lt;/a&gt; has protested the Narmada Dam project.

&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Owomoyela"&gt;Patrick Owomoyela&lt;/a&gt;, a soccer player in the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; national team, has achieved a preliminary injunction against the far-right &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;NPD&lt;/a&gt; over a pamphlet of the party depicting Owomoyela.

On the cover of the pamphlet concerning the upcoming &lt;a href="w%3ASoccer%20World%20Cup%202006"&gt;Soccer World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in Germany, the NPD had shown the torso of a man wearing a jersey of the national soccer team with the number 25, which is the fixed number of Owomoeyela in the team. Below it were the words: "White. Not just the color of the jersey. For a real national team."

The court found that this portrayal "defames [Owomoyela] in an unbearable racist manner" and ordered that the NPD cease distributing the pamphlet under penalty of 250,000 €.

Owomoyela's lawyer and the &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20Football%20Association"&gt;German Football Association&lt;/a&gt; also intend to press criminal charges for defamation and hate speech against the party.

NPD spokesperson Klaus Beier said the reference to the word "white" was not related to skin color, but rather to a series of betting and corruption scandals in German soccer in recent months.

He also claimed that "neither the player nor his number were recognisable". However, although partially covered by the caption, the number 25 is &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de/files/images/npd-wmplaner.jpg"&gt;easily identifiable on the image&lt;/a&gt;.

According to papers filed in U.S. Federal Court by &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20J.%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick J. Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, &lt;a href="w%3AI.%20Lewis%20Libby"&gt;I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President Dick Cheney's former Chief of Staff, has told investigators that he was authorized by President Bush to divulge to reporters information from the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Intelligence%20Estimate"&gt;National Intelligence Estimate (NIE)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to develop nuclear weapons.

Libby's testimony to the federal grand jury included the statement that he had received "approval from the President through the Vice President" to release portions of the NIE. According to court documents, he also stated that this type of authorization was "unique in his recollection".

It was Libby's understanding that Bush's allowing the information to be released in effect declassified the information. Although legal experts disagree on this authority, Libby stated that it was a White House lawyer who so counseled him.

This information has come to light due to Fitzgerald's efforts to collect information regarding the "outing" of former &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; operative &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt;. Fitzgerald has broad authority to conduct investigations, as the &lt;a href="w%3Aspecial%20prosecutor"&gt;special prosecutor&lt;/a&gt; in the case. Although Libby's statements released yesterday may seem inflammatory, it is unknown what effect they will have on either Vice President Cheney or President Bush.

Speaking on the US House floor Thursday, Cynthia Mckinney stated, "There should not have been any physical contact in this incident." Her remarks were in relation to an incident last week where she struck a US Capitol police officer as he attempted to stop her from walking through a metal detector. During her speech she also stated that she would vote for a resolution supporting the efforts of the Capitol police.

Her speech comes on the same day when a Disctrict of Columbia grand jury began hearing testimony regarding the McKinney case. It is possible that McKinney may be charged in relation to the case, possibly as early as next week.

A ship sank off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ADjibouti"&gt;Djibouti&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about 1 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AUTC%252B3"&gt;Eastern African Time&lt;/a&gt; (1000 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), killing 109 people. At least 20 more are reported missing. Reports say that 36 people are currently receiving medical care, and seven are in serious condition.

The ship was bound for the religious festival of Djamaad, in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ATadjoura"&gt;Tadjoura&lt;/a&gt;. Built to hold roughly 80 people, it was reported to have been carrying at least 200 people as well as construction materials at the time it sank. Though the cause of the accident has yet to be determined, Ismael Tani, advisor to the Djiboutian President Umar Guelleh, said that the overload probably caused the disaster. Eyewitness Omar Souleiki, however, blamed it on a small wave. Search operations by the Djiboutian, French, and American naval vessels have been called off for the night.

<h2>Interview with Glen Stollery</h2>

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: When did you become interested in Scientology, and Tom Cruise?♡❤♡

</ul>
Cults have always interested me for years simply based on their mystery/ability to draw unwavering devotion to in some case absolutely ludicrous premises even from otherwise very intelligent people. As such for probably all of my adult life I've read books on persuasion, unconscious influence,

LGAT (large group awareness training) and for want of a better term "brain washing"; I've also always looked to improve myself in all areas I can so at the same time I would also read self improvement material. However, my interest in cults really peaked in 2003. I was a Tony Robbins advocate, and when attending an "unleash the power within" weekend live seminar I saw to my horror it had some striking makings of a &lt;a href="w%3ALarge-group%20awareness%20training"&gt;LGAT&lt;/a&gt;/"&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALandmark%20Forum"&gt;Landmark Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; /&lt;a href="w%3AErhard%20Seminars%20Training"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWerner%20Erhard"&gt;Werner Erhard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " type event, with &lt;a href="w%3ACult"&gt;cultish&lt;/a&gt; rituals such as 15-18 hour days with almost no breaks for food or even the bathroom, repetitive chanting, unconscious influence techniques, a charismatic leader, and strict guidelines that could even be seen as totalitarian.

From there I researched Robbins further, as well as other groups using similar practices such as Landmark Forum and Scientology, and although I do not believe Robbins is leading a destructive cult, I do believe he uses unconscious persuasion, building participants into a frenzy and subjecting them to intense peer pressure and group dynamics in an effort to sell additional products/services whilst they are in this heightened state. I read pro-Scientology material like Dianetics (as best as one can) and ♡❤Clear Body, Clear Mind♡❤, and all of the &lt;a href="w%3AOperating%20Thetan"&gt;church OT material&lt;/a&gt;, as well as many critic's books such as ♡❤L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman♡❤, ♡❤A Piece of Blue Sky♡❤, ♡❤Bare-Faced Messiah♡❤, and of course all the critical websites I could find to really see inside the cult without going ♡❤inside♡❤ the cult.

It was when Tom Cruise began his very vocal promotion of Scientology and more specifically his fierce opposition to psychiatric medication that I decided I would act and create the site. The thought of young impressionable fans following any of his advice and dropping their meds or joining the cult make me sick to the pit of my stomach, so my theory was I could poke some fun through parody whilst at the same time getting across a few serious home truths about Scientology.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: How did you create the website, and how do you pay for it?♡❤♡

</ul>
The website itself is very basic. There's no dynamic pages, shopping cart, or database to run so I simply quickly wrote up the &lt;a href="w%3AHTML"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; myself. As such the site cost nothing to build, though in October last year when Scientology's lawyers threatened me with the lawsuit and it was suddenly in every newspaper the site had just under 10 million hits in 3 weeks, and the gigabytes downloaded did cost me a bit. It was then I moved the videos to a third party provider and that's worked perfectly.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: Who all was involved in creating the website? Is everyone still involved?♡❤♡

</ul>
Just me! Though I received and still do receive a huge amount of support through xenu.net and alt.religion.scientology, as dozens of critics have been threatened just as I was.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: Why did you create the website? what is the goal and reason for it?♡❤♡

</ul>
The real tipping point for me was Tom Cruise's statements about psych meds. Scientology owns a front group specifically to oppose psych meds and psychiatrists called CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights), staunchly opposing ALL medication of that genre. Cruise's numerous statements that no one should be using any psychiatric medication was not only ignorant but darn right dangerous. Life threatening in fact. Cruise stated that the opposed Brooke Shield's use of medication for &lt;a href="w%3APost-partum_depression"&gt;post-partum depression&lt;/a&gt;, and that she was ignorant about the history of psychiatry - well he is most certainly ignorant of the circumstances of every medicated individual in the world, and as such his comments that people should get off the meds and take vitamins and exercise was absolutely outrageous.

I am not anti-Cruise... before he started this propaganda regime I would have proudly stated I was a Cruise fan! But c'mon let's be realistic here; no one can possibly argue that it isn't irresponsible for Tom Cruise to effectively tell every child and adult on prescribed medication for a "chemical imbalance" (a mental illness like depression, bi-polar, schizophrenia, &lt;a href="w%3AADHD_psychosis"&gt;ADD/ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) to suddenly stop their meds and start “exercising and taking vitamins.”

Think about how many people his statements could have (and from the over 1000 posts on my website ♡❤has had♡❤) on those who are unwell? It was irresponsible, ignorant, and dangerous; and if my site pokes a little fun at him for doing that and possibly makes those people think twice before following his advice, then I'm happy.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: Why create a website that portrays a man as insane and defames his character?♡❤♡

</ul>
If you take a close look at the site you'll see that I actually make little comment and let the videos speak for themselves. When people see Tom jumping on Oprah's couch declaring his undying love for a woman he just met, followed by his completely out of character argument with Matt Lauer about medication and Scientology (calling him glib, stating he was an expert in medicine as if he [had a] &lt;a href="w%3ADoctor_of_Philosophy"&gt;Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, and then repeating himself over and over again), followed by his appearance on "60 Minutes" where he threatens to walk out when, then lying to a reporter at a press conference about alien's having any involvement in the tenets of Scientology... well, they soon work it out themselves!

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: What is your opinion of Tom Cruise?♡❤♡

</ul>
I believe he's a reasonably smart guy who unfortunately has been, for want of a better term; "brain-washed" into believing the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard. I mean, he quotes him verbatim. All the "no such thing as a chemical imbalance" "psychiatry causing WWI and WWII" "&lt;a href="w%3AElectroconvulsive_therapy"&gt;electro-shocking&lt;/a&gt; children" "psychiatric industry producing a nation of drug addicts" - all comes from the writings of Scientology and the CCHR. And, of course he's entitled to his own opinion - he just shouldn't force it on everyone else and use his position as a household name more responsibly.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: On March 19 you claimed that your hosting provider removed videos from your website. What pressures have been put on your site and by whom?♡❤♡

</ul>
Well, "coincidentally" the ♡❤same day♡❤ Viacom pulled the South Park episode about Scientology off-air ♡❤♡reportedly♡❤♡ due to Cruise's pressure to drop all promotion of MI3 if they didn't the site hosting all my videos pulled them citing "removed at the request of the owner".

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: How do you know that Tom Cruise and/or Viacom were responsible for the removal of the videos?♡❤♡

</ul>
Just like Viacom was saying "It wasn't Tom that make us pull South Park Trapped in the Closet it was because of respect for Mr. Hayes" obviously the videos were NOT pulled at my request. I received no notice, warning, or communication of any kind (sort of rude after pulling many, many millions of new viewers to their site!) nor are they even replying to requests as to what happened.

They even pulled original work that was created for us exclusively and we were the only copyright holders of! On the same day Viacom announced they were pulling South Park? &lt;a href="w%3AOccam%27s%20Razor"&gt;Occam's Razor&lt;/a&gt; points directly at Cruise involvement here as well.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: Do you hold licenses for the videos being distributed on your website? If not, under what grounds are you distributing them?♡❤♡

</ul>
Definitely not all of them! Many of the videos were on YouTube (the hosting company) already, so I simply linked to those files. Others were linked to directly from the copyright holders (like MSNBC, Access Hollywood, 60 Minutes, CNN, etc.) so again we didn't actually infringe on the copyright, simply pointed our site at their file. Others were snippets of video that were held under "fair use" for commentary purposes.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: You claim in a media release that those who inquired with YouTube were told that the videos were removed at the request of their owner. Do you find it possible that the copyright holders could have asked for them to be removed?♡❤♡

</ul>
No, because as I mentioned ours were removed, and YouTube's policy is to remove the video and inform the user - not state that we requested their removal.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: You were sent a cease and desist order from the Scientologists, which you've chosen to dispute. Can you tell us the details about that order, like who sent that order? when was it sent? and what the primary order elements were?♡❤♡

</ul>
It was sent from the Church's and &lt;a href="w%3AReligious_Technology_Center"&gt;RTC&lt;/a&gt;'s (the company that actually owns all Scientology's trademarks) law firm "Moxon and Kobrin" and essentially said I must immediately cease and desist using the domain as it infringed on their trademark "Scientology" and was causing confusion as (they claim) my site was being mistaken for theirs, citing breach of the &lt;a href="w%3ALanham%20Act"&gt;Lanham Act&lt;/a&gt;. I was told to immediately transfer ownership to them or face a USD $100,000 lawsuit.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: Did you get legal counsel? if so, what was it?♡❤♡

</ul>
Yes. Originally I had a 'knee-jerk' reaction and told them "okay" and bought [the domain name] ♡❤passionofcruise.info♡❤. Then I met with a trademark lawyer and a commercial lawyer specializing in suits like this and found that their claims were without any merit whatsoever.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: You've decided to challenge the validity of the cease and desist. Have you heard further from the Scientologists or their lawyers?♡❤♡

</ul>
The local church called me for several weeks playing "good cop" - he never mentioned lawsuits or the like just kept wanting to meet with me to "chat about it" (I refused). But no, never heard from the law firm again.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Wikinews: Have you considered bringing legal action against the Scientologists for harassment or intimidation? Have you consulted legal counsel about doing so?♡❤♡

</ul>
No. I think they got their just desserts.

At least seventy civilians were killed, with many more injured in an apparent suicide attack at the popular Buratha mosque in northern &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; soon after the Friday prayers. Police have said that two of the bombers were dressed as women. The attack comes a day after the Iraqi interior ministry issued a warning about possible attacks on mosques.

The chief imam of Buratha mosque, Sheikh Jalaluddin al-Saghir, who is also a member of the Iraqi parliament, stated that Shias are being targeted "as part of this dirty sectarian war waged against them as the world watches silently."

Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr on the other hand asserts that recent bombings were in fact the work of the US-led coalition forces. Regarding Thursday's Najaf bombing, he was quoted as saying: "This is not the first time that the occupation forces and their death squads have resorted to killings".

Sadr further charged the occupying forces, and more specifically the United States, with "killing religious Shia clerics in order to start a sectarian strife".

U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad issued a statement, urging all parties to remain calm: "I urge all Iraqis to exercise restraint in the wake of this tragedy, to come together to fight terror, to continue to resist the provocation to sectarian violence and to pursue justice within the framework of Iraq's laws and constitution."

&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and Irish &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; (Prime Minister) &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; have unveiled their plan to restore a power-sharing executive government in &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; by a deadline of November 24.

The plan calls for the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt;'s members to be recalled on May 15 and given six weeks to form an executive. If no results comes within six weeks, then the members are to be given another 12 weeks to attempt to form an executive. After that, if no result is achieved by November 24, then the salaries of all members will be suspended, and the Irish government will be given greater influence in Northern Ireland.

The Assembly has been suspended since October 2002 following the allegation of the existence of a republican spy ring.

Blair and Ahern acknowledged the diffculty of implementation of the plan, which has been hampered by the murder this week of &lt;a href="w%3ADenis%20Donaldson"&gt;Denis Donaldson&lt;/a&gt;, a former British spy in Sinn Fein.

Blair said of the plan, "We have today set out a framework, beginning with the recall of the assembly on the 15th of May and running up to November of this year, for that ultimate decision to be made. At that point we close the chapter ... or we close the book." His verdict on the plan was, "If the parties really can't find a way forward, we have to call a halt and find a different way forward."

Ahern said, "It is time to talk and to agree. People are entitled to firm assurances that if there is deadlock that it will not be allowed to continue indefinitely." His verdict on the plan was, "I don't look at the end date of this. In fact, I look at this as a start of a process. I do not want on 24 November to be thinking about another plan."

&lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; said "The DUP will not be forced, rushed or bullied into accepting any level of IRA criminality. Currently there is no evidence that Sinn Fein/IRA will be any further advanced in giving up criminality in November." Paisley also denounced the involvement of the Irish government, saying, "This part of the UK is not really a part of the UK but is a part of the UK where a foreign government has more say over Northern Ireland than the people of Northern Ireland."

&lt;a href="Gerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt;, the President of &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt;, said that the statement contained "negatives and positives." "We welcome that the assembly has been brought together ... we have concerns about the timeframe, about other aspects of the statement, but we think that's a good forward step. We would like to think that unionism generally would see it as a positive opportunity. I appeal to Unionism to seize this opportunity. It is about a shared future for all the people on this island. It appears that they [the two governments] are saying to the DUP, 'If you don't come on board, we are going to go ahead without you.' "

The leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Ulster Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Reg%20Empey"&gt;Sir Reg Empey&lt;/a&gt;'s response was, "We urgently need to have an input into, and make changes to, direct rule decisions on education, water rates and the Review of Public Administration, to name but three. This is our job." Empey was also critical of the DUP's statement, saying, "We have been told by the Democratic Unionist Party that the Belfast agreement was binned, consigned to the dustbin of history. Looking and listening to today's press conference, it didn't look binned to me. It's actually back centre stage."

The &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party"&gt;SDLP&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Durkan"&gt;Mark Durkan&lt;/a&gt; said, "All we have today is an 11-paragraph announcement that tells us less rather than more. That's why the SDLP will need to see the legislation that follows it. It may be better — or indeed worse." He further added, "A shadow assembly was agreed between the DUP and Sinn Fein in 2004, in the so called comprehensive agreement. We are still living with the damage caused by that bad deal."

&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement saying, "Today is an opportunity for all in Northern Ireland to take control of their future and bring the political process to a successful completion this year." "We remain steadfast in our support of the peace process and the efforts of the British and Irish governments to achieve a lasting peace under the principles of the Good Friday Agreement."

The 38 game hitting streak of Jimmy Rollins has ended. The streak begain on August 23, 2005. After two games into the 2006 regular season, he went 0-4 in a 4-2 loss against St.Louis, promptly ending his pursuit of the impressive record 56 game feat accomplished by Joe Dimaggio in 1941. Another record that Rollins' was chasing has been largely overlooked. The National League hit streak record shared by Pete Rose(1978) and Willie Keeler(1897) was 44 games, just 6 more than Rollins' accomplished.

The streak was not without controversy. Many contested that the streak should not count due to the fact that it spanned two seasons. The major league marks for longest hitting streak in one season and longest hitting streak spanning two seasons are separate records. For example, Willie Keeler's hitting streak was accomplished in one season in 1897. He also had a hit in the last game in 1896, making his streak 45 over two seasons. Others believed that the streak was more difficult since Rollins had to wait six months before trying to start again. "I think it will be almost a little bit more special if he ends up going as far because of the layoff," Cardinals shortstop David Eckstein said before the streak ended.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; police have arrested and charged a man after an attack on the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney-Newcastle%20Freeway"&gt;Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (F3)&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;.

Police allege that on March 25, 2006 at around 11:20 p.m., a 22-year-old man was pulled over by three men posing as policemen on the F3 freeway on the New South Wales Central Coast. He was assaulted by one of the men and forced into the passenger seat of his car. During the seven-hour ordeal, he was raped and robbed. His bank card was taken and used to withdraw cash from his bank account. The man was found by a passing driver at Canton Beach, where the group left him after the attack.

On Thursday, a 28-year-old man handed himself in to police at &lt;a href="w%3AToukley%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Toukley&lt;/a&gt;. He was arrested and questioned by detectives before being charged with robbery in company, aggravated kidnapping, and driving whilst disqualified.

Police are still searching for the other two men involved in the attack.

The &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anon-profit%20organization"&gt;non-profit organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; filed a brief on Wednesday claiming that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAT%26amp%3BT"&gt;AT&amp;T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been illegally forwarding &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; traffic directly to the &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt;.

The EFF has asked that the forwarding be stopped immediately. According to EFF staff attorney Kevin Bankston, "The evidence that we are filing supports our claim that AT&amp;T is diverting Internet traffic into the hands of the NSA wholesale, in violation of federal wiretapping laws and the Fourth Amendment. More than just threatening individuals' privacy, AT&amp;T's apparent choice to give the government secret, direct access to millions of ordinary Americans' Internet communications is a threat to the Constitution itself. We are asking the Court to put a stop to it now."

The motion was filed under seal allowing only the judge and litigants to view the complaint. The procedure allows AT&amp;T five days to explain to the court their reasons for keeping the information from the public.

In the class action lawsuit, EFF is representing all AT&amp;T residential customers nationwide.

According to Police, a 22 year-old male provisional driver from Macquarie Fields in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney's&lt;/a&gt; West has been clocked doing 202 Kph (125 Mph) in a 110 Kph (68 Mph) speed zone.

The driver was detected by a highway patrol officer who was carrying out radar duties along the &lt;a href="w%3AHume%20Highway"&gt;Hume Highway&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AMittagong%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Mittagong&lt;/a&gt;, South of Sydney.

Police also discovered after stopping the man that his driver's licence had already been suspended. He was subsequently charged with driving whilst suspended and dangerous speeding.

A &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; man who fell into the sewage-contaminated Ala Wai Yacht Harbor died Thursday night of a massive bacterial infection that caused the loss of one of his legs, &lt;a href="w%3Aseptic%20shock"&gt;septic shock&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately organ failure.

Oliver Johnson, 34, a Honolulu mortgage broker, died between 9:15 and 9:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii-Aleutian_Standard_Time_Zone"&gt;HST&lt;/a&gt; Thursday (0715-0730 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; Friday) when his family removed him from life support. On Friday, March 31, Johnson had apparently fallen into the waters of the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor, located at the mouth of the Ala Wai Canal on the western side of Waikiki. 

At the time, the canal and surrounding beaches were &lt;a href="Sewage%20spill%20fouls%20Waikiki%20Beach"&gt;contaminated by over 48 million gallons of untreated sewage&lt;/a&gt;. The extent to which the sewage spill contributed to Johnson's symptoms remains unclear.

Johnson earlier reported that he had fallen accidentally into the harbor, then later indicated that he had been involved in a fight on board a boat and had been pushed or thrown into the harbor waters. A security guard at Johnson's apartment reported that he was bloodied and soaking wet, and that he stumbled into the lobby and collapsed. Paramedics took Johnson to Straub Hospital where he was treated and released.

Johnson reported steadily worsening leg pain that weekend and was admitted to Queen's Hospital on Sunday with breathing difficulties. Doctors that night amputated his left leg above the knee to try to halt the spread of the infection, and Johnson was placed in a medically induced coma. 

Initially suspecting that Johnson had contracted &lt;a href="w%3Astreptococcus"&gt;streptococcus&lt;/a&gt;-caused &lt;a href="w%3Anecrotizing%20fasciitis"&gt;necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, doctors later found that Johnson had contracted three different bacteria, two of which, &lt;a href="w%3Avibrio%20vulnificus"&gt;vibrio vulnificus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aaeromonas%20hydrophila"&gt;aeromonas hydrophila&lt;/a&gt;, have flesh-eating properties. Despite the amputation, Johnson's condition steadily worsened to the point where doctors said that his other leg and left arm would also have needed to be amputated to save his life.

An autopsy performed by the Honolulu medical examiner's office reported that Johnson had suffered from massive organ failure caused by septic shock. The medical examiner noted that Johnson had a vulnificus infection on his foot and suffered from chronic alcoholic liver disease which may have contributed to the infection's taking hold.

The Honolulu Police Department has opened a third-degree assault case; with Johnson's death, homicide detectives are also investigating. State health officials are also investigating Johnson's illness.

Johnson's family has retained an attorney to investigate the causes surrounding his illness and death. It is not clear yet whether any legal action will be taken.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGhana-India%20Kofi%20Annan%20Centre%20for%20Excellence%20in%20ICT"&gt;Ghana-India Kofi Annan Centre for Excellence in ICT&lt;/a&gt; introduced the &lt;a href="w%3ASemacode"&gt;Semacode&lt;/a&gt; technology and the &lt;a href="w%3ASemapedia"&gt;Semapedia&lt;/a&gt; application to a segment of the Ghanaian public in a presentation delivered by &lt;a href="w%3AGuido%20Sohne"&gt;Guido Sohne&lt;/a&gt;, Developer-In-Residence at the Centre and Chief Software Architect of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.corenett.com"&gt;CoreNett Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, a Ghanaian electronic transaction processing company.

Introduced for the first time in Africa, Semapedia is a way of associating Internet sites with physical barcodes that can be read by cameraphones, enabling one to look up information about physical objects quickly and easily.

<h2>The Semacode technology</h2>

The Semacode (a URL barcode), was conceived in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;), and includes portions (such as one of the very first versions) that were developed in &lt;a href="w%3AGhana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Africa"&gt;West Africa&lt;/a&gt;) by local software developers. &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Woodside"&gt;Simon Woodside&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the &lt;a href="http%3A//semacode.com"&gt;Semacode Corporation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http%3A//semacode.org"&gt;Semacode community site&lt;/a&gt; contacted Mr. Sohne for assistance in developing an early version of Semacode and Mr. Sohne in turn recommended &lt;a href="w%3AFrancois%20Bonin"&gt;Francois Bonin&lt;/a&gt;, another Developer-In-Residence at the Kofi Annan Centre for Excellence, to develop this software. Mr. Bonin successfully delivered on the project to develop an implementation of this technology, which later on has become increasingly widely adopted and known.

The significance of Semacode is that one can now link a real world, physical object to arbitrary data. Before there has been no link, except for things like ordinary barcodes such as those used in stores to label products, or on books to indicate publication details. Unlike Semacodes, traditional barcodes have limited storage for information, are fixed function and good for only one narrow application, and also require the use of special, custom hardware and software to read or access such barcodes.

With the Semacode approach, all it now takes is for an ordinary camera phone, equipped with a Semacode reader software package (available free of charge by pointing your mobile phone web browser to the &lt;a href="http%3A//semacode.org/ota"&gt;over the air distribution&lt;/a&gt;). There is no need to purchase any hardware or software to read these two dimensional barcodes.

Semacodes, by embedding a URL into a barcode, enable any portion of the Internet to be 'attached' to any object, and can replace barcodes by going further to give arbitrary information on the Internet, not just the simple product number.

After the successful development of the core of the Semacode encoding software (called the Semacode Tagger), Semacode went on to achieve user adoption, such as with the inception of the Semapedia, the Physical Wikipedia.

<h2>Semapedia, the physical Wikipedia</h2>

In the words of &lt;a href="w%3AStan%20Wiechers"&gt;Stan Wiechers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlexis%20Rondeau"&gt;Alexis Rondeau&lt;/a&gt; who are the founders of the Physical Wikipedia, "Semapedia is a non-profit project. The idea was to bring the amazing knowledge from the wikipedia to places in the ♡❤real♡❤ world where it matters. Being able to stand in front of a building and dive into its history right on the spot is something incredibly useful to anybody.

Doing that by just taking a picture with your mobile phone of a semacode is a very very simple interaction that is understandable to everybody. We have been explaining and showcasing to people with no technical background at all and they still immediately understand the use and value of our project.

Semapedia is a community project, everybody can go to our site and create semapedia tags via a simple text entry form right away, print them out and start hyperlinking ojects to the information he wants people to know."

<h2>Made in Ghana</h2>

Following his interest in the initial development of the Semacode encoder, Mr Sohne has continued with Semacode technology by developing free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License, to create Semacodes. The first version of his software was developed as &lt;a href="http%3A//sohne.net/semacoder/"&gt;an experiment to investigate the benefits of writing code&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3AApple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS%20X"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Sohne had at the time recently acquired an Apple PowerBook and used the Semacode as a goal to be achieved that would serve as a learning exercise for the newly acquired hardware. This software grew to include &lt;a href="http%3A//sohne.net/semafox/"&gt;a C to JavaScript port of the Semacode encoder&lt;/a&gt; to run within a web browser, so that it could be accessible on all platforms, and not just the Apple platform. 

Within computer software development, a port can be considered akin to a translation between two human languages. It retains the essence of its source, yet is somewhat different while performing the same function. With that transformative step, each Web browser is itself a full blown Semacode encoder, regardless of platform. And since each Semacode created by the software is in a hyperlink format, all the Semacodes created can be conveniently stored by web engines such as &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.

Powering this all, are deceptively simple Semacode symbols that are easy to create and quick to read, a testament to simple ideas brought to life by complex systems. Perhaps the real genius of the idea behind the Semacode, brainchild of Mr. Simon Woodside of Semacode Corporation, is that it is so simple that it works so well and so easily. It was not so simple before the breakthrough concept of the Semacode as a URL barcode that is accessible by a wide variety of 'off the shelf' camera phones!

<h2>Bringing Semapedia to Africa</h2>

Today, this introduction of the Semapedia and its associated technologies, at
the prestigious Ghana-India Kofi Annan Centre for Excellence, explained and
explored the possibilities that are opened by the use of Semacodes. The
audience received the talk very well and suggested several interesting ways of
locally applying Semacodes during an engaging discussion during question and
answer time.

The introduction of the Semapedia immediately preceded the launching of the
first African entry into the Semapedia which will take place immediately after
the talk, when several members of the audience used Semacodes to tag the
Ghana-India Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence with its corresponding entry into
the Wikipedia.

During the presentation Mr Sohne said that "The time has come for African
content to take its place in the global constellation. We need more African
content, and anybody can help add more content to the Wikipedia. So tag
something today. It's really easy to do and the software is free too!"

If it can be done in Ghana, then it can easily be done elsewhere in Africa and
even in Asia, Europe and North America too. It is rare to find African
created technology being used today in Western cyberspace so this event is
indeed a laudable step forward for African technology as well as an indication
of the benefits of collaborative development based on liberal software
licensing such as open source software that can arise from further North/South
private sector partnerships.

The ♡❤Loch Portrain♡❤ ferry, operated by Caledonian MacBrayne, will arrive at 10 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ABritish_Summer_Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; (0900 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) today at Leverburgh, in the Western Isles of Scotland, despite strong opposition from Presbyterian residents who regard it as a breaking of the &lt;a href="w%3ASabbath"&gt;Sabbath&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Harris West councillor Morag Monro, more than 700 people on both Harris and Lewis signed a petition opposing the Sunday service. The Western Isles Council is also opposed to the new service.

They are also considering legal action.

"At the moment we are investigating whether there is a legal option open to us to protect us from this imposition," she said.

"It is not just church people who are opposed, but also those who have come to appreciate a day of relaxation and a chance to be together with their families for one day."

It has been welcomed, however, by many people at the southern crossing at Uist.

Councillor Archie Campbell (of the North Uist/Berneray) will be expected on the vessel today, and is a campaigner for the "7 days per week" service.

There is little sign of opposition expected when the ferry completes its journey, as the campaigners will be in church as the vessel arrives.

Negotiations between the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Bank%20of%20India"&gt;State Bank of India&lt;/a&gt; and its employees over pension benefits have resulted in a settlement, ending a seven-day strike.

The bank, which is based in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; and majority-owned by the nation's central bank, is India's largest commercial bank, with over 9000 branch offices. 

The settlement calls for workers whose final monthly salary was up to 21,040 rupees (US$471) to receive half that amount as pension; workers with salaries larger than that would receive 40%. The bank's previous pension maximum was 4,250 rupees (US$95)

The bank's 200,000 employees will return to work Monday.

On March 23, 2006 the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; ceased publication of the M3 monetary aggregate, in line with an announcement it made in November, 2005. The M3 is a measure of &lt;a href="w%3Amoney%20supply"&gt;money supply&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, 

The M3 is most general of the many measures of ♡❤money supply♡❤, the quantity of money available within the economy for purchasing goods, services, and securities. The money supply is monitored and adjusted by a &lt;a href="w%3Acentral%20bank"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt;, to keep inflation in check, because money supply has to change in tune with real &lt;a href="w%3AGross_Domestic_Product"&gt;Gross Domestic Product (GDP)&lt;/a&gt; to prevent inflation (or deflation). 

In November last year, the US Federal Reserve announced that it would cease publishing M3 data, saying, "[the] M3 does not appear to convey any additional information about economic activity that is not already embodied in M2 and has not played a role in the monetary policy process for many years", adding that the costs of collecting the data required for the index outweighed its benefits.

Some commentators have questioned this decision and have speculated that this would allow the Federal reserve to covertly fund the US budget deficit and its negative balance of trade or hide the fall in international demand for the US dollar. In March, 2006, Rep. &lt;a href="w%3ARon_Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; introduced a bill (HR 4892) requiring the Federal Reserve to reverse its decision.

On 9 and 10 April 2006, &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt; voted to elect members of Parliament as well as the country's next Prime Minister. 

The election was fought mainly between coalitions: the centre-left &lt;a href="w%3AL%27Unione"&gt;L'Unione (The Union)&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt;, and the currently-ruling centre-right &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Freedoms"&gt;House of Freedoms&lt;/a&gt;, led by incumbent Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt;. Initial polls do not indicate a clear winner.

The main party in L'Unione is the &lt;a href="w%3AOlive%20Tree"&gt;Federation of the Olive Tree&lt;/a&gt;, and the House Of Freedoms' main party is Berlusconi's &lt;a href="w%3AForza%20Italia"&gt;Forza Italia&lt;/a&gt; party.

It is expected that no party will obtain an outright majority of seats. Polls closed on Monday at 3 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral_European_Summer_Time"&gt;CEST&lt;/a&gt; (1300 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;).

According to Italian law, the Prime Minister must have the support of both houses of Parliament: the Senate (the upper house) and the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house).
<h2>Exit Polls</h2>

First Exit Polls of Nexus published by major newspapers at 15:00 (local time) give the following partial results:

&lt;a href="w%3AL%27Unione"&gt;L'Unione (The Union)&lt;/a&gt; Chamber (of Deputies): 50% - 54%
&lt;a href="w%3AL%27Unione"&gt;L'Unione (The Union)&lt;/a&gt; Senate: 50% - 54%
&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Freedoms"&gt;House of Freedoms&lt;/a&gt; Chamber (of Deputies): 45% - 49%
&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Freedoms"&gt;House of Freedoms&lt;/a&gt; Senate: 45% - 49%

Later exit polls showed &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Freedoms"&gt;House of Freedoms&lt;/a&gt; in the lead in both houses.

These are based on mock voting booths outside 1,050 polling stations across the country that are expected to be representative samples, where people can anonymously indicate how they voted. The margin of error on Nexus's exit polls is 2 percentage points.

Rafael Garcia, the former director of the Information and Technology Department of Security Administrative Department (Spanish acronym DAS) , the Colombian intelligence agency, from prison stated that there was a plan to assassinate Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.

The information was revealed by Garcia in an interview with ♡❤Semana♡❤ magazine in which he accused former DAS Director, Jorge Noguera, of providing the paramilitary death squads with information and lists about union leaders, professors, and left-wing leaders who then after were found dead. He accused Noguera of working with paramilitary chief ♡❤Jorge 40♡❤ in a conspiracy to kill Chavez and other Venezuelan officials.

He denounces also that a system installed on a border post between the Colombian department of Guajira, and the Venezuelan State of Zulia for migration control was in reality an espionage system aimed at Venezuela.

Garcia said that Noguera had plotted a fraud to obtain 300,000 votes for the 2002 election campaign in favor of Alvaro Uribe.

According to ♡❤Cambio♡❤ and ♡❤Semana♡❤ magazines, Noguera was appointed consul in Milan after an scandal broke in which he was organizing a coup d’etat against Chavez in 2005.

The family of a &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; woman plans to file a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city after her six-year-old son's calls to emergency operators were allegedly dismissed as a prank. The family released the tapes of the emergency calls to the media on Friday.

Sherrill Turner, 46, died on February 20 of complications from an enlarged heart. Her son Robert made two calls to 911 to report the emergency.

"My mom is passed out," said Robert Turner when he called 911 the first time.

"Where's Mister Turner at?" asked the operator. Robert replied that his mother was unable to speak. 

"Okay, well, I'm going to send the police over to your house to find out what's going on," added the operator, before hanging up on the boy. However, the police never came, and an ambulance was never dispatched to the home.

The boy called 911 three hours later, and reports say the operator who answered the call may have been the same operator that answered the first call. The operator asked to speak to the mother before saying "before I send the police over there." Then she said to the boy, "You shouldn't be playing on the phone. Now put her on the phone before I send the police over there to knock on the door, and you're going to be in trouble."

"It was taking too long," said Robert. 

Delaina Patterson, the boy's older sister, who lives in &lt;a href="w%3ANovi%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Novi, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, said that after 9:00 p.m. help did come, but only the police and no EMS or medical personnel.

The operator, whose name has not been released, remains on the job pending an investigation by city officials.

Ontario Provincial Police raided a farmhouse on Sunday, continuing an investigation into what is called Ontario's "biggest massacre".

On Saturday, eight bodies were found in or around vehicles near the village of Shedden, approximately 30 kilometres from London, Ontario. Police would not identify the victims, but believed they knew each other and were from the Toronto area. They also refused to comment on any possible links between the deaths and organised crime.

Neighbours believed the house was owned by a former leader of a motorcycle gang. Police have closed off a 15 square kilometre area while they search for clues. They would not comment on the reason for the raid.

"Having information about a target's countermeasures does two things. It gives you an opportunity to choose a different weapon and to choose a different attack style... perhaps choosing to launch a salvo attack, or choose a missile that uses an active beam," said Daniel Goure of the Lexington Institute.

Air Force One is the primary form of transportation for the &lt;a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force"&gt;U.S. Air Force&lt;/a&gt; maintains two Boeing 747-200B series aircraft that are used only for the transportation of the President.

"It is not a good thing. We are concerned with how it got there and how we can get it out. This affects operational security," said director of public affairs for the Air Mobility Command's 89th Airlift Wing at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndrews%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Andrews Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Lt. Col. Bruce Alexander.

The document also is said to include detailed maps of the interior of the two planes, the locations of Secret Service agents and the location of the plane's medical center, detailing where the oxygen tanks are kept. This would assist snipers to target and detonate them.

As of Friday, the document was said to be still available online, however efforts to locate the page have so far been unsuccessful.

French President Jacques Chirac has announced that the new youth job law that has fueled protests for the past few weeks is to be replaced by other measures to attack unemployment amongst young adults.

Students and unions protested the new law, which would have given employers the freedom to fire youth workers under the age of 26 without reason during a two-year "trial period". The prospect had sparked somewhat violent protests across the country in the past two months.

Union leaders have given government officials until Easter to withdraw the existing law or face yet another general strike.

Following a phyrrhic victory by the &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party, &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; caretaker Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; resigned to try to defuse the country's political crisis. It remains unclear what the eventual outcome will be.

In 38 constituencies, Thai Rak Thai (lit. ♡❤Thais love Thais♡❤) stood unopposed and failed to garner support from the required 20% of eligible voters. Seven of those 38 may face the same ballot choice in the upcoming April 23 by-elections, according to the Thai-based English-language newspaper, the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;Bangkok Post&lt;/a&gt;. A repeat of the mass abstention that saw TRT resoundingly rejected in the south would leave the lower house of the parliament short of the required 500 seats and, according to the country's constitution, unable to convene and elect a prime minister. A reading of the constitution reveals that the only likely fallback position would involve intervention from the monarch.

Leaders of the PAD (People's Alliance for Democracy), who have spearheaded the campaign to bring down the Prime Minister, may face arrest, according to a report from the Thai News Agency. Protests organised by the PAD have been peaceful, and no specific charges that may be used against the organisation's leaders are given in the TNA report.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, the United States' space agency, has announced that its next mission to the &lt;a href="w%3Amoon"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; will not only orbit the Moon, but also send two craft crashing into its surface. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), whose main mission pertains to mapping the Moon, will send a spent fuel stage and an impactor probe towards a crater on the South Pole. The crater seems to be rich in &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrogen"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; and possibly ice. 

The mission is part of the run-up to trying to land astronauts back on the Moon, and perhaps keep them there for a longer period of time than the &lt;a href="w%3AApollo"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; missions did. Scott Horowitz, NASA's associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, had this to say: "What this mission buys is an early attempt to know what some of the resources we’re going to have ... we know for sure that for human exploration to succeed we’re going to have to essentially live off the land." 

Twice before, with the Pentagon's Clementine spacecraft and with the Lunar Prospector, scientists have seen hints of ice on the Moon's surface. It is NASA's hope that this mission may provide better answers to the question of water ice on the Moon. This would prove useful to the agency's goal of a four-astronaut mission to the Moon by 2020. 

<h3>The Probe</h3>

The name of the project is the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS for short. It will launch with the LRO in October 2008 and use its onboard cameras and spectrometers to watch the impact of its upper stage into the surface. The upper stage roughly resembles an SUV in mass - around 4,409 pounds.

The project manager, Daniel Andrews said: "We will create a substantial plume and excavate some sample material, some of which we think will be water ice." After the first crash, LCROSS will attempt to fly through the plume of debris, taking readings and sending them back to Earth. Once done, it will itself crash into a different region of the crater, allowing both the LRO and stations on Earth to observe the plume that it creates.

The Australian activist organisation &lt;a href="w%3AAID/WATCH"&gt;AID/WATCH&lt;/a&gt; staged a protest outside the &lt;a href="w%3ACole%20Inquiry"&gt;Cole Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. In a press release, Kate Wheen of AID/WATCH attacked the government over the scandal, claiming that foreign aid is being used to benefit businesses rather than those in need. "It’s scandalous that AWB was paying kickbacks to the Iraqi regime, but it is unethical, immoral and possibly illegal that our government can ruthlessly support Australian business whilst so many in Iraq remain in such great need," she said.

The Cole Inquiry, started in January this year, is tasked with investigating whether Australian companies paid bribes to Saddam Hussein during the UN Oil-for-food programme. The government has denied any wrongdoing. In a press conference on Monday, the Prime Minister defended his ministers. "I do not believe, on the information known to me that any of my Ministers have been guilty of dereliction of duty and I am very, very happy to provide the statement and, if asked, to appear."

The Australian Trade Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Vaile"&gt;Mark Vaile&lt;/a&gt;, and Foreign Affairs minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; appeared before the Inquiry this week. During questioning, both men rejected all suggestion that they made any mistakes or acted in any way innapropriately.

On Monday Mark Vaile repeatedly answered that he "couldn't recall" details of whether he was aware of the many warnings given to the government from various sources that dealings between the AWB, formerly the Australian Wheat Board, and the Iraq government were corrupt and supplied the pre-invasion Iraq government with up to 300 million dollars of funding.

Alexander Downer spent 3 hours before the commission on Tuesday and said that he could not specifically recall the details of any of the 21 cables containing warnings about the possibility of kickbacks being paid to the Iraqi government. He claimed that he did not have time to read all the material in his department and spent much of the year travelling. The Labor Party opposition has pointed to the fact that this testament seems to contradict statements previously made to parliament.

The commission also received a written statement from Howard, which will be assessed by the inquiry's lawyers to determine whether he should be called before the inquiry. Howard has said that he is prepared to appear before the commission, if required.

In a five-way tie for third place at four under par were &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Olaz%C3%A1bal"&gt;José María Olazábal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARetief%20Goosen"&gt;Retief Goosen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATiger%20Woods"&gt;Tiger Woods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChad%20Campbell"&gt;Chad Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Couples"&gt;Fred Couples&lt;/a&gt;. Rounding out the top ten were eighth place finishers &lt;a href="w%3AAngel%20Cabrera"&gt;Angel Cabrera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVijay%20Singh"&gt;Vijay Singh&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href="w%3AStewart%20Cink"&gt;Stewart Cink&lt;/a&gt; in tenth place.

Although Mickelson had to fire up during the last few holes to take the '04 Masters over &lt;a href="w%3AErnie%20Els"&gt;Ernie Els&lt;/a&gt;, nothing of that sort was required during Sunday's round. He parred the first six holes before making two straight birdies at 7 and 8, and then went on to make two more at 13 and 15 before finishing off with a bogey at 18. Last year, Mickelson put Tiger's jacket on for him. This year, Tiger helped Phil into the jacket. "I certainly enjoyed having the jacket put on me," Mickelson said. "I love the chance to compete against guys like Tiger, guys like Retief and Ernie and Vijay and Fred who are playing so well. It gives me an incredible feeling of accomplishment to be able to come out on top this week." After 42 straight misses at majors, Mickelson is now on track with one major per year for the past three years. 

Playing partner Fred Couples nearly got within one stroke of Mickelson but went on to miss the birdie putt and another par putt to sink out of contention. Putting was also Tiger Woods's major hindrance. He made three three-putts and had an overall total of 33 putts with a final round of 70. Afterwards, Woods remarked, "It was frustrating. I felt in control of my golf swing from tee to green. Once I got on the green, I was a spaz. I didn't have it all day - even this morning (in the third round) I didn't putt well." Clark capped off a great run and a final round 69 with a chip-in from the sand at 18 for a birdie. Clark moved to number 15 on the Official World Golf Rankings, Woods stayed at number 1, Couples moved to 21st, and Mickelson moved up to 2nd.

As &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20II"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; approaches her 80th birthday, on April 21, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuckingham%20Palace"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has released 80 little known facts about her.

Did you know that: The Queen owns all &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adolphin"&gt;dolphins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aporpoise"&gt;porpoises&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asturgeon"&gt;sturgeons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; waters. She has sat for 139 official portraits, opened 15 bridges in the UK, launched 23 ships, and speaks fluent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrench"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

The Queen sent a message of congratulations to Apollo 11 astronauts, for the first moon landing on July 21 1969, and it was put in a metal container and placed on the Moon's surface. 

Or that in 1976 at an Army base she sent her first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aemail"&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Or she has owned more than 30 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWelsh%20Corgi"&gt;corgis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , starting with Susan who was her 18th birthday present. And in 2002, at 76 years of age, that The Queen was the oldest monarch to celebrate a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20jubilee"&gt;Golden Jubilee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Italian opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the center-left coalition ♡❤L'Unione♡❤ (♡❤Lit.♡❤ "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Union%20%28political%20coalition%29"&gt;The Union&lt;/a&gt;"), was declared the victor today in parliamentary elections held Sunday and Monday, but Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; has yet to concede his office.

Official but not yet confirmed results indicate that ♡❤L'Unione♡❤ won control of the lower house or &lt;a href="w%3AChamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Italy"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; with 49.8% of the vote to 49.7% for Berlusconi's center-right Casa delle Libertà (♡❤Lit.♡❤ "The &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Freedoms"&gt;House of Freedoms&lt;/a&gt;") coalition. The winning party automatically receives a minimum of 55% of the seats in the lower house, giving Prodi at least 340 seats in the 630-seat Chamber.

Berlusconi, however, claims that his party would control the 315-seat &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; by one vote, resulting in a split parliament. The current results, however, show Prodi with a 158-156 lead in the Senate, giving him enough seats of support in both houses. Berlusconi's spokesman also indicated that his party has requested a recount.

Italian law requires that the prime minister receive the support of both houses of Parliament. Should the two houses be controlled by different coalitions, the stalemate would result in new elections. A caretaker government would rule in the meantime.

The Israeli cabinet today (Tuesday) declared Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; "permanently incapacitated," a declaration that officially ends his tenure as Prime Minister.

Acting Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;, whose centrist Kadima party won parliamentary elections in March, is currently in negotiations to form a coalition government.

Sharon has been in a coma since suffering a massive hemorrhagic stroke on January 4. Under Israeli law, Olmert can serve in the capacity of acting prime minister for only 100 days, until April 14, before a permanent replacement must be chosen. The official announcement was moved up to Tuesday because the Jewish holiday of Passover begins on Wednesday, April 12. Olmert is expected to be named as Sharon's permanent replacement.

Four men and a woman have been charged with first-degree murder in what the Ontario Provincial Police calls "internal cleansing" of a biker gang.

The eight victims found on Saturday in a farmer's field in Shedden, Ontario, as well as one of the suspects have been linked to a biker gang called the "Bandidos", Ontario Provincial Police confirmed on Monday afternoon. According to police, the victims were shot dead.

"The victims of this crime have been positively identified and are associated [with], or belong to, the Bandidos motorcycle gang," Det. Supt. Ross Bingley told a news conference in London, Ontario. 

"This is an isolated incident with ties to the Bandidos." 

"There's nothing to indicate that there's anything outside the Bandidos ...this is simply an internal cleansing," said Det. Insp. Don Bell.

Six people who were found dead are believed to be full members of the gang:
<ul>
BULLET::::- George Jesso of Etobicoke, Ontario.

BULLET::::- Luis Manny Raposo of Toronto, Ontario.
BULLET::::- Francesco Salerajno of Toronto, Ontario.

The other two victims were associated with the gang, according to police:

The five people charged are Kellestine of Dutton, Ontario, Eric Niessen of Monkton, Ontario, Kerry Morris, also of Monkton, Ontario, Frank Mather of Dutton, Ontario and Brett Gardiner of no fixed address.

<h1>Australia's deputy PM faces Iraqi kickback inquiry</h1>

Yesterday, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADeputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Deputy Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Vaile"&gt;Mark Vaile&lt;/a&gt;, appeared before the &lt;a href="w%3ACole%20Inquiry"&gt;Cole Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into kickbacks paid to &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; regime. It is the first time in over a decade that a senior government official has been called to give evidence before a royal commission in Australia.

The inquiry heard that Mr Vaile could not recall being told any specific details of the allegations made against the wheat exporter &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Wheat%20Board"&gt;AWB&lt;/a&gt; before 2003, and despite his department receiving information about the allegations, it came as no surprise that he was not informed as he held no responsibility for the UN Oil-for-Food program.

Mr Vaile has been Australia's trade minister since 2000 and the deputy prime minister since 2005.

Mr Vaile told the commission that despite the cables received by his department in 2000 alleging that the AWB agreed to pay a kickback to Hussein's regime in Iraq, inflating wheat prices and paying money into another non-Iraqi account, he does not recollect being told specific details of the allegations.

When asked by counsel assisting the commission John Agius about how such cables are dealt with, Mr Vaile told the commission that they are looked at by department officers who decide whether or not they need the minister's attention. Mr Vaile said that if a particular cable needed his attention it was generally put into a ministerial submission. He said that such submissions may require ministerial action, while others just contain information which he may need to make a note of. Once the submission has been read, the minister signs it and it goes into the system.

Mr Vaile told the commission that on occasion he receives information from cables via briefings from his advisors and departmental officers.

When questioned about a cable sent to the department of trade containing concerns raised by the UN about AWB's dealings in Iraq dated January 13, 2000, Mr Vaile said that he was briefed in a general sense on the issues raised. Despite the UN's concerns being stated in the cable, Mr Vaile said that he "can't recall being aware of the substance".

Mr Vaile said he was under the belief that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and Australia's UN mission were taking care of the UN's concerns. He said that he did not have responsibility over the issues being raised "That's my recollection, and my recollection is that there were concerns that had been raised about an AWB contract, and that DFAT and the Mission in New York were dealing with it, bearing in mind that I was not - I didn't have direct ministerial responsibility for either the UN Mission in New York or the Oil-for-Food Program" he said.

When asked if he would have expected to be briefed in detail on the issues in the cable, Mr Vaile said "Given the circumstances at the time, in terms of my direct ministerial responsibility and being new in the portfolio, probably not."

Mr Vaile told the inquiry that he was surprised that he had not been briefed about a cable dated March 11, 2000 from Austrade to the department of trade. The summary of the document said "It may be necessary to advise the minister of the situation."

The inquiry heard that in April, 2000 Mr Vaile was told by an advisor that the issue raised in January, 2000 had been resolved with the UN.

When questioned by Mr Agius about why he did not follow up on the allegations made against AWB in 2000, Mr Vaile said he was too snowed under with work. "My best recollections are that I was pretty well snowed under in taking on the responsibilities of a new portfolio and the breadth of issues, having come from a much narrower base in the previous portfolio, and I recall early in 2000 being very, very focused on what to do next in the WTO process after the Seattle ministerial failed in the December of 1999" he told the inquiry.

Mr Agius then questioned Mr Vaile about allegations made by US Wheat Associates in 2003 that AWB had been inflating wheat prices to Iraq. At the same time there were also allegations that money was being paid to Hussein's regime, that AWB was not being transparent in their dealings. At the time Mr Vaile defended AWB based upon information provided to him by his department. He claims that it was some time later that he learned the information he was given was provided to the department by AWB. Mr Vaile said that his department did not conduct an investigation into the allegations despite them being raised in 2000 and again in 2003 by separate parties.

Mr Vaile also admits that at the time, he dismissed the allegations made by US Wheat Associates as he believed that they were putting pressure on the US administration with regards to &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Organisation"&gt;WTO&lt;/a&gt; negotiations between Australia and the US.

Mr Vaile told the inquiry that the first ha became aware of possible corruption with connected with AWB was in April, 2004. The inquiry heard that Mr Vaile and Alexander Downer (Australia's foreign minister) had received a submission claiming that AWB had acted properly, but the company they paid to transport wheat in Iraq had been paying kickbacks to Hussein's regime. Mr Vaile said that at the time he saw no need to review procedures within his department for the distribution of information regarding AWB.

According to Mr Vaile, the only time the department of trade investigated its files to locate information it had received on AWB's dealings in Iraq was around March 2004 to assist the UN's inquiry into the Oil-for-Food programme.

Zach Scruggs, a lawyer for United States Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATrent%20Lott"&gt;Trent Lott&lt;/a&gt;, says that &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Farm%20Insurance"&gt;State Farm Insurance Company&lt;/a&gt; is destroying records related to claims for damage from Hurricane Katrina.

The records allegedly contain information saying that State Farm fraudulently denied insurance claims made by its policy holders, including Lott, that had homes there were damaged or destroyed when Hurricane Katrina came ashore on the Gulf Coast.

Scruggs said that Lott has "good faith belief" that many employees of the insurance company in &lt;a href="w%3ABiloxi%2C%20Mississippi"&gt;Biloxi, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; are destroying engineer's reports that were inconclusive as to whether or not water or wind was the main cause of damage to the buildings affected by the hurricane.

Lott is among thousands of home and/or business owners who had their property damaged or destroyed during the hurricane and had their claims denied because State Farm claimed that their policies don't cover damage caused by floods or water that was driven by the wind.

State Farm has not issued a statement on the matter so far.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rapper%20Proof%20%28D12%29%20shot%20and%20killed%20outside%20Detroit%20nightclub&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Rapper &lt;a href="w%3AProof%20%28rapper%29"&gt;Proof&lt;/a&gt;, born Deshaun Holton, was shot and killed on April 11, 2006, at approximately 4:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (0830 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) at the Triple C Club on 8 Mile Road in Detroit.

Proof was known for his work together with his good friend &lt;a href="w%3AEminem"&gt;Eminem&lt;/a&gt; and his group &lt;a href="w%3AD12"&gt;D12&lt;/a&gt;.

Another man was shot shortly afterward, and was taken to St. John Hospital.

On April 12, &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, Mario Etheridge, 28, of Detroit turned himself in to the police, having been named by several witnesses. Mario was allegedly a bouncer at the club. "Police said he is a cousin of Keith Bender Jr., the bouncer who was allegedly shot by Proof during the fight." The fight that started inside the club was reported to be over a pool game. The argument was taken outside where, "A shot was fired in the air, Proof allegedly pistol-whipped Bender, knocked him to the ground and then shot him. Etheridge then allegedly opened fire on the rapper, striking him four times in the head and chest. One week later, Keith Bender Jr. died of his injuries on April 18, 2006.

Official Police reports are yet to determine the series of events which left Proof and Keith Bender, 35, deceased. Bender died 8 days later on April 18, 2006. Following Proof's death, rapper &lt;a href="w%3ASnoop%20Dogg"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt; called on fellow musicians to unite, describing the incident as "a loss to the hip-hop community".

The tributes were led by fellow rapper &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Game"&gt;The Game&lt;/a&gt; who was first to comment on the tragedy. The Game remembers how he and Proof became 'real cool and real homies' and that 'Proof will always be remembered and I as well as the Black Wall Street family will keep his memory &amp; his family in our prayers 1'. The second to comment on Proof was long time friend Royce da 5'9" who was deeply saddened by the death of his good friend. Royce had been a friend of Proof for over 9 years and the two had recently reconciled. Royce echoed the music community, saying 'He is such loss for the hip hop community...I hope that he will be remembered for the talented artist and great person that he was, and not the tragedy that he fell victim to'. 

Eminem was the third to discuss Proof's death days after his passing, clearly affected by the tragedy. Eminem described Proof as "funny, smart and charming" and said that he would be sorely missed and described him as "the heart and ambassador of Detroit hip-hop". Eminem said that Proof was, and always will be, his best friend.

Tributes poured out of the UK with Vm2k6 leading the remembrance. Proof's demise which was mainly overlooked by the UK media was documented and reflected by VM2k6 in which he calls Proof 'fresh, talented and meaningful, a rarity in Hip Hop today'. He continues saying that Proof had 'the greatest ability to transfer his experiences and most of all feelings into words' and finished with the heartfelt line- 'I guess its only in Death you really begin to shine'. 

Several fan videos were released in tribute to Proof, including the hit "Good Die Young" music video which used D12's 2004 single, which is currently one of the highest discussed and viewed videos on YouTube.com. Many other "slide show" flicks were created, which are appearing all over the internet. The "Good Die Young" clip was produced by RYKE Video Productions.

Proof stated how he wanted to be remembered in an interview with Sohh.com shortly after his album release; 'I want people to say that I was a true artist', ' That I did it best and stayed true to Hip Hop roots' and 'I'd want people to understand I did it for the love not for the charts.'

&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; foreign affairs minister, told the &lt;a href="w%3ACole%20Inquiry"&gt;Cole Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that it was not his department's job to investigate claims that wheat exporter &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Wheat%20Board"&gt;AWB&lt;/a&gt; was paying kickbacks to &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; in the lead up to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Mr Downer, who entered the inquiry via a back entrance to avoid the crowd waiting outside told the inquiry numerous times that he did not read a series of diplomatic cables which raised concerns about AWB in Iraq. Mr Downer admitted that he did not have the time to read diplomatic cables and the only time he did so was when he is "stuck on a plane" and has nothing else to read.

The claims are in stark contrast to a statement made to parliament in February where Mr Downer said "Of course I would have read them".

When asked why the department of foreign affairs and trade did nothing about the allegations first received in 2000, he told the inquiry that his department couldn't investigate AWB and responsibility for the oil for food program laid with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;. " The department does not have the legal authority to go into AWB and access their files" he said.

"They (the UN) also had people on the ground in Iraq because insofar as there could be infringements of the sanctions regime, those infringements could take place within Iraq and Australia had no access to Iraq during that period." Mr Downer told the inquiry.

Mr Downer admitted that the department of foreign affairs and trade had dealt with each cable, despite he not reading them and that were satisfied with assurances from AWB that there was no substance to the allegations.

Mr Downer was also asked about an unassessed intelligence report, sent to the National Security Committee of cabinet which raised concerns about Alia, the Jordanian trucking company used by the AWB to transport wheat around Iraq. The document alleged that Alia may have been paying kickbacks to the Iraqi regime.

Mr Downer told the inquiry that the intelligence may not have been dealt with."There is so much intelligence. It's a very major challenge, to deal with intelligence" he said. 

When asked by Terry Forrest, counsel for AWB executives what the point of sending intelligence to his department when it was never read, Mr Downer conceded that it was "physically impossible" to read it all.

Mr Downer was also questioned about a cable delivered in June 2003 from US army captain Puckett which claimed that every contract under the UN's oil for food program contained a kickback. Mr Downer told the inquiry he didn't see the cable as being important because the information was provided by "a junior officer in the US army".

Mr Downer denied claims made by former AWB executive Andrew Lindberg that he had been told about the possibility that money may have been paid to Iraq by Alia. According to Mr Downer it is common practice in his department to have two advisors at such meetings, where one of them takes notes so there is a record of what is said. According to Mr Downer, no notes were taken during the meeting despite it being "the usual practice".

Mr Downer told the inquiry that he had no idea why notes weren't taken during the meeting, despite the meeting being quite important. He also told the inquiry that he couldn't recall if he noticed that nobody was taking notes as he would have been "focused a little more on the meeting than on somebody taking notes".

<h1>U.S. claims of Iraqi bioweapons labs contradicted in classified Pentagon report filed on 27 May 2003</h1>

In an article published on Wednesday by &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, reporter Joby Warrick alleged that the Bush administration and the CIA "possessed powerful evidence" that contradicted assertions made by President Bush one month after the Iraqi war began, where trailers found in Iraq were said to have been &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20weapons%20laboratory"&gt;mobile biological weapons labs&lt;/a&gt;.

On May 27, 2003, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; made public statements on these trailers by asserting that "We have found the weapons of mass destruction," which coincided with the CIA publishing a whitepaper that detailed how the trailers were allegedly used to produce biological weapons. 

Warrick's news report revealed that evidence exists to support that two days before the presidential statements were made and the CIA whitepaper was published, that a fact-finding group reached an opposite conclusion.

The group was comprised of U.S. and British civilian experts that investigated the labs and concluded unanimously that they had nothing to do with biological weapons production. They relayed their results back to Washington, where Warrick said in the front page ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ article that the newspaper interviewed six of the nine group members.

According to ♡❤The Washington Post♡❤, this preliminary report was followed up with a detailed 122 page final report three weeks later, titled "Final Technical Engineering Exploitation Report on Iraqi Suspected Biological Weapons-Associated Trailers." The report remains classified to this date.
&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported that an unnamed U.S. official confirmed the existence of the field report filed on May 27, 2003, and said that the field report had not been evaluated at the time of Bush's statement. "You don't change a report that has been coordinated in the (intelligence) community based on a field report," he reportedly said. The Bush administration continued to make claims about having found mobile biological weapons facilities throughout 2003. 

On June 8, 2003, an unnamed senior &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; official stood by the interpretation that the trailers were mobile bioweapons labs saying "It is what we think it is, to the best of our knowledge".

Then Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3AColin%20Powell"&gt;Colin Powell&lt;/a&gt; claimed in June 2003 that "confidence level is increasing" that the trailers were intended for biological weapons production. 

White House speaker &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; said on July 16, 2003, that "We've seen some of the evidence of his weapons of mass destruction program through two mobile biological weapon labs that have been discovered."

Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; claimed in September 2003 that the trailers were "mobile biological facilities". Then CIA director &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Tenet"&gt;George Tenet&lt;/a&gt; claimed in a speech on February 5, 2004, that the trailers "could be made to work" as biological weapons labs. 

The alleged existence of mobile biological weapons laboratories was one of the cornerstones in Colin Powell's presentation in front of the United Nations to make the case for war on February 5, 2003. Much of the information came from an Iraqi defector dubbed &lt;a href="w%3ACurveball%20%28informant%29"&gt;Curveball&lt;/a&gt; who was an asset of the German &lt;a href="w%3ABundesnachrichtendienst"&gt;BND&lt;/a&gt;. The credibility of this source was disputed by the BND.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Survey%20Group"&gt;Iraq Survey Group&lt;/a&gt; reported in September 2004 that the trailers were "impractical" for biological agent production and "almost certainly" designed and built for the generation of hydrogen. Asked about the prospects to turn the trailers into biological weapons labs, Rod Barton, a member of the Iraq Survey Group, said "It would be easier to start all over with just a bucket". 

The Washington Post cites unnamed sources among officials and members of the initial survey group as claiming that the original classified report from May 27, 2003 and the classified final report three weeks later came to the same conclusions as the unclassified findings of the Iraqi Survey Group. 

&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Ritter"&gt;Scott Ritter&lt;/a&gt;, a former United Nations weapons inspector, wrote September 8, 2003:
"However, it now is clear that these so- called labs were nothing more than hydrogen generation units based upon British technology acquired by Iraq in the 1980s, used to fill weather balloons in support of conventional artillery operations, and have absolutely no application for the production of biological agents."

In the April 12, 2006 press conference, Scott McClellan said "I will point out that the reporting I saw this morning was simply reckless and it was irresponsible. The lead in The Washington Post left the impression for the reader that the President was saying something he knew at the time not to be true. … The President's statements were based on the joint assessment of the CIA and DIA that was publicly released the day before [the President made his statements]." 

He did not answer repeated questions whether the President knew of the secret report at the time he was asserting that "we found biological laboratories" on May 29, 2005. When asked why the secret report was not made public earlier McClellan responded by saying that "it takes a substantial amount of time to coordinate and run through a declassification process".

Mr Howard said in a statement that he has been asked to appear at the inquiry. "The Cole Commission of Inquiry has requested that I appear at its hearings" he said.

Mr Howard expects that he will give evidence around 10 a.m. "The Inquiry has indicated that it would suit its convenience for me to do that at 10 a.m. tomorrow" said Mr Howard.

It will be the first time an Australian Prime Minister has appeared before an inquiry since &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Hawke"&gt;Bob Hawke&lt;/a&gt; faced the Hope Inquiry into Australia's intelligence services in 1983.

&lt;a href="w%3AGrover%20Norquist"&gt;Grover Norquist&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative activist, is working to trademark the term '&lt;a href="w%3AK%20Street%20Project"&gt;K Street Project&lt;/a&gt;'. Norquist feels that &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, along with Republican &lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Boehner"&gt;Jay Boehner&lt;/a&gt;, have hijacked the term and made it symbolize corruption and scandal, which he says is entirely unrelated to his project, a branch of &lt;a href="w%3AAmericans%20for%20Tax%20Reform"&gt;Americans for Tax Reform&lt;/a&gt;.

Norquist states that his project is just a job listing for lobbyists in Washington, as well as a list of political ties or campaign contributions that they may have. Originally founded in 1989, the goal of the K Street Project was to correct the imbalance that Norquist saw in lobbyist's political views in Washington.

Norquist later stated: “Some people say Kleenex when they mean tissue. We will jealously guard the real phrasing the way Kleenex and Coca-Cola do. We will sue anyone who says it wrong and make lots of money.”

A spokesperson for House Minority Leader &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; (D-CA) said, "Republicans can call it anything they want. It doesn’t change the fact that every single Republican is responsible for enabling and benefiting from a K Street Project that puts their cronies ahead of the American people."

With 186,000 cases of &lt;a href="w%3Achikungunya"&gt;Chikungunya&lt;/a&gt;, a viral fever, on the island of &lt;a href="w%3AR%C3%A9union"&gt;Réunion&lt;/a&gt;, nearly one quarter of the population of that French overseas département has officially been affected since Mar. 2005.

The epidemic has gotten markedly worse in the past few months, with the worst point being 45,000 new cases in the week from Jan. 30 to Feb. 5. The Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; has stated on Wednesday (Mar. 1) that "Nine out of ten patients were struck since the beginning of the year (...). No one could have anticipated the progression of it."

The virus is also present in the Indian Ocean in &lt;a href="w%3ASeychelles"&gt;Seychelles&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AMauritious"&gt;Mauritious&lt;/a&gt; and especially in &lt;a href="w%3AMayotte"&gt;Mayotte&lt;/a&gt;, where the line of 2000 cases would have been crossed, according to &lt;a href="w%3AXavier%20Bertrand"&gt;Xavier Bertrand&lt;/a&gt;, minister of French Health. That represents a doubling in 10 days.

According to Philippe Renault, medical epidemiologist of the CIRE (Regional Epidemiological Intervention Center of the Rhône-Alpes)&lt;a href="http%3A//rhone-alpes.sante.gouv.fr/sante/liecirei.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the propagation of the epidemic will show the first signs of stabilization, at a very high level. He urged against drawing hasty conclusions, however. "An infectious disease can reach a plateau, then start again. It is necessary to wait until the decrease is clear on all the indicators."

The threat, a written note, was found in a magazine on the plane. The UK's ♡❤Times Online♡❤ and ♡❤Reuters♡❤ are now reporting that the threat was a hoax.

"This obviously had the potential to be a major incident and one which was taken extremely seriously by the security forces and indeed the police. I am extremely glad it appears to have been nothing more than a hoax, but I am disappointed about the inconvenience passengers have suffered. I’m very glad that the response has been entirely appropriate and that at the end of the day no harm has been done," said MSP John Scott, whose Ayr constituency covers the airport.

♡❤Reuters♡❤ also reports that police have not found a bomb on the plane, though passengers were still being questioned.

The Ryanair jet liner, a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt;, was diverted, and escorted while landing by two Royal Air Force Tornados.

"At approximately 13.45 today a Tornado F3 from RAF Leuchars was diverted from a routine training flight in order to assist a Ryanair flight from Paris to Dublin. Two additional Tornados were also scrambled from RAF Coningsby. The plane has now safely landed at Prestwick Airport and the three jets have now landed back at base. The incident is now a matter for Strathclyde Police," said a spokesman for the UK Ministry of Defence.

"There is an ongoing incident at Glasgow Prestwick Airport. Police and emergency services are in attendance," said a spokesman for the airport.

"A note was passed to the cabin crew onboard claiming that there was a bomb. The captain immediately reported this to UK air traffic control and was instructed to divert to Glasgow Prestwick Airport. said a spokesman for Ryanair. 

The scare caused the airport to close for two hours, according to police; a security alert remains in place. 

All 172 passengers were evacuated from the plane. Authorities are still searching luggage and passengers, but there is no word on whether or not explosives have been found or if there have been any arrests. Three other flights were not allowed to leave the airport and four arriving flights were diverted to Stansted and &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh%2C%20Scotland"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; Airports in Scotland. Most of the passengers are reported to be in their twenties. Reports also note that at least 71 schoolchildren were on the plane.

They were "quite distressed," said Strathclyde Police Assistant Chief Constable John Neilson. "As soon as they landed they were fine. There’s appropriate support from the health services for them." He also said "people are still being interviewed" and that he thinks "we will know for sure what’s happened once everybody has been interviewed."

"All [passengers and crew] are safe and well and are being interviewed by Strathclyde Police," said a spokesman for the Strathclyde Police.

"All passengers together with Ryanair are co-operating fully with the police and local safety authorities. The aircraft will now be subject to a detailed search, following which we expect it will be cleared to travel onwards to Dublin. Ryanair apologises sincerely for any inconvenience caused to these passengers, however the safety of our passengers and aircraft will always be our number one priority," added the Ryanair spokesman.

A coroner's inquest hearing ruled on Monday, April 10, that Tom Hurndall, a 22 year old man from north &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, was intentionally killed by an &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; on soldier April 22, 2003. Mr. Hurndall died nine months later from the single gunshot wound to the head. 

On Thursday April 6, the same court decided that the award-winning cameraman James Miller, 34, was also intentionally shot in the neck by an Israeli sniper three weeks previous to the Hurndall shooting. Both men were shot within a mile of each other near Rafa in the Gaza strip.

The cases were presided over by Dr Andrew Reid, who said he would be writing to the UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith to see if there was any further legal action which could be taken in relation to the deaths of Tom Hurndall and James Miller. 

The five man, five woman jury at Saint Pancras Coroners Court in north London complained of a lack of cooperation by the Israeli authorities in their investigation of both cases. Saying in their verdict of the Hurndall case that "The jury would like to express its dismay with the lack of cooperation from the Israeli authorities", and, in the Miller verdict "It is a fact that from day one the Israeli authorities have not been forthcoming in the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr Miller's death.” The Israelis originally put out statements claiming that opposition forces shot both men and that Mr. Hurndall was wearing camouflage gear when he was shot. However images by a South African photographer showed him unconscious and bleeding heavily moments after being shot, he was dressed in casual clothes but wearing bright orange trousers and a vest top. 

Mr Hurndall, a &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20Metropolitan%20University"&gt;Manchester Metropolitan University&lt;/a&gt; journalism and photography student, who had entered Gaza from &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM). 
had described being "shot at, gassed and chased by soldiers" in the war-torn Gaza strip in the days preceding his fatal shooting. The inquest reveled that just before he was killed shots were fired from an IDF watchtower, causing Palestinians children to flee. One child froze and Mr Hurndall went to help but was shot in the head. Sergeant Taysir Hayb was convicted of manslaughter by an Israeli court and jailed for eight years for shooting him.

James Miller was killed on his last day of work on a HBO film titled "Death in Gaza" a documentary about the impact of violence upon children in the conflict zone which has gone on to win three Emmys and a Bafta. He was reportedly filming Palestinian children throwing stones at Israeli tanks in Rafah at the time. The shooting was described as "slow, deliberate, calculated and aimed". He was approaching soldiers from the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) while holding a white flag when he was shot by Lieutenant Hib al Haib of the Bedouin Desert Reconnaissance Unit.

British Legislator, Gerald Kaufman said Tuesday, sanctions must be imposed against Israel if it does not hand over officers and troops suspected of being responsible for the killing of the two British men.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Islamic%20web%20forum%20releases%20videotape%20of%20Ayman%20al-Zawahiri&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An Islamic militant web forum has released a videotape of &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;'s second in command, &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;, who reportedly released the tape to commemorate the battle of &lt;a href="w%3ATora%20Bora"&gt;Tora Bora&lt;/a&gt; in December 2001.

"The Islamic nation must support the heroic &lt;a href="w%3AMujahideen"&gt;mujahedeen&lt;/a&gt; [holy warriors] in Iraq, who are fighting on the very front line for the dignity of Islam. And to my brother mujahedeen in Iraq, I say, Stay firm. Stay together. Your enemy has begun to falter, so don't stop pursuing him until he flees defeated," said Zawahiri in the tape which was believed to have been made in November 2005.

"I warn all Muslims in Iraq: Anyone who impedes the jihad against the Crusader occupiers is a traitor to God and his prophet ... and a traitor to the rest of the Muslims," he added.

Zawahiri also accused United States President George W. Bush of being the "&lt;a href="w%3AJulius%20Caesar"&gt;Caesar&lt;/a&gt; of Washington."

"Bush, son of Bush, eliminating Israel is the duty of every believer. If we commit to peaceful action, they will demand we adhere to international laws and treaties that mean nothing to them. If we adhere to that, they will ask us to impose constraint on what they call terrorism and war on Israel. Then if we adhere to that, they will demand we recognize Israel and establish normal relations with it," Zawahiri continued.

Zawahiri also praised &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of an Iraqi militant group, calling him his "beloved brother" and says, "I have lived with him up close and have seen nothing but good from him."

Zawahiri has made at least three other tapes since November, all of which were broadcast by &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared in two tapes in January, and in one tape on March 4, 2006. The latest video was not released immediately after the date it was allegedly filmed, nor has Al-Jazeera yet broadcast the video by Zawahiri despite having broadcast his three previous tapes.

Al-Qaeda's leader, &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20Bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama Bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;, released an audio tape on January 19, 2006. Parts of that tape were aired on Al-Jazeera and it was the first time in over a year that Bin Laden had been heard.

&lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;'s King &lt;a href="w%3AGyanendra"&gt;Gyanendra&lt;/a&gt; deployed lethal force against protestors in Kathmandu on Thursday as a general strike and pro-democracy protest spread through Nepal threatening the future of the monarchy.

Government forces fired on protesters in the Kathmandu neighborhood of Kalanki, killing three people and injuring more than 100, according to officials at two city hospitals. Two of those killed appeared to have been shot in the head by live bullets.

Kathmandu was under a curfew from 2 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time on April 20. Non-governmental organizations such as the United Nations and the Red Cross were denied permission to move through the city during the curfew, and journalists were also denied curfew passes. The United Nations Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights called the move a "clear violation" of their agreement with the Nepali government.

The curfew was reportedly extended until 3 a.m. local time Friday. Protestors intend to continue protests on Friday.

Gyanendra assumed direct rule in February 2005, citing the failure of political parties to control a Maoist insurgency that has killed 13,000 people. He has pledged free elections by April 2007, but an alliance of political parties has demanded he relinquish power to an all-party government immediately.

The protests have touched all areas of Nepalese society. As an example, a peaceful protest meeting called by the &lt;a href="w%3ANepal%20Bar%20Association"&gt;Nepal Bar Association&lt;/a&gt; was fired upon by Nepalese police on April 13, 2006. About 1500 people took part in the protest which took place at Babarmahal in &lt;a href="w%3AKathmandu"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt;. 50 were reportedly injured in the firing. Nepal Bar Association President Shambu Thampa was one of the casualties. It is not clear at this time whether the police used rubber, or live bullets. After the protest, tear gas shells were used to disperse the crowd. The authorities reportedly detained 72 people.

Later that day, around 100 people were arrested at a rally in a stadium at Maitighar. Most of those detained were associated with the Association of International NGOs (AIN).

The &lt;a href="w%3AAyya%20Vaikunda%20Avatharam"&gt;Ayya Vaikunda Avatharam&lt;/a&gt; is a festival celebrated in a grand scale in the southern districts of &lt;a href="w%3ATamil%20Nadu"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;. People from almost all the districts of Tamil Nadu visit &lt;a href="w%3ASwamithoppe%20Pathi"&gt;Swamithoppe Pathi&lt;/a&gt;, the religious headquarters of &lt;a href="w%3AAyyavazhi"&gt;Ayyavazhi&lt;/a&gt;. And for the comfort of the devotees, for a long time the religious leader of Ayyavazhi &lt;a href="w%3ABala%20Prajapathi%20Adikalar"&gt;Bala Prajapathi Adikalar&lt;/a&gt; and some other &lt;a href="w%3AAyyavazhi%20Movements"&gt;Ayyavazhi Movements&lt;/a&gt; demanded from the government, a leave of absence for the districts of &lt;a href="w%3ATirunelveli"&gt;Tirunelveli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChennai"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMadurai"&gt;Madurai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThoothukudi"&gt;Thoothukudi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVirudunagar"&gt;Virudunagar&lt;/a&gt;. 

Taking into consideration, the government of Tamil Nadu have announced the day of Vaikunda Avatharam (March 4) as a holiday for the districts of Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi, the districts in which the Ayyavazhi followers was populated mostly, from this year. 

Still, they request for a leave for the districts for Chennai, Madurai and Virudunagar.

Nevaeh Gough is back with her family, and police in Toronto have cancelled the &lt;a href="w%3AAmber%20Alert"&gt;Amber Alert&lt;/a&gt; issued earlier today when she was driven away by her father, Daniel James David, after an alleged domestic altercation between the 10-month old's parents.

Police were called to a home on Warden Avenue at 1:35 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (1735 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) regarding a domestic dispute. Police allege Mr David arrived at a motel where the mother and child were staying and assaulted the infant's mother, then drove away with the child. When he returned to the hotel, they allege he forced the mother into the car and drove her to the home on Warden Avenue, from which he later fled.

Police issued the alert, along with descriptions of Mr David and his vehicle, and the warning that he may have a gun.

The alert was canceled off after approximately an hour when the baby's grandfather brought her to the police, about 7 p.m. local time.

Mr David was described as 5’10”, black, with black, short hair and brown eyes and has a cheek scar under his right eye. His vehicle is a silver, four-door, 2006 Mazda M6, with Ontario license plate AYFZ 177.

Anyone with information to his whereabouts is asked to contact police at 416-808-4300, or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-TIPS (8477), or online at www.222tips.com .

Initial tests done on a six-year-old dairy cow in &lt;a href="w%3AFraser%20Valley"&gt;Fraser Valley&lt;/a&gt;, a farming community near &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, are inconclusive for &lt;a href="w%3Abovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt;, or "mad cow disease," said Canada's &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20Inspection%20Agency"&gt;Food Inspection Agency&lt;/a&gt;.

Further tests are being conducted at Winnipeg's National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease and results are expected on Sunday. Officials also say the cow did not enter the human food chain.

"Canada has a suite of internationally recognized safeguards that work together to provide high levels of human and animal health protection," officials for the agency said in a statement.

If the results are positive, this will be Canada's fifth case of the disease since 2003.

<h1>Australian PM faces inquiry into Iraqi kickbacks</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20PM%20faces%20inquiry%20into%20Iraqi%20kickbacks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Unlike his foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; who gave evidence before the inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Howard entered through the front door where he gave a brief address. He told the press that his government is being open about the Iraqi kickback affair. " just want to make one point and that is that the appearance by me, earlier this week by the Foreign Minister and also by the Trade Minister, demonstrates absolutely how open and transparent and accountable the Government is being in relation to this matter" Mr Howard said to reporters.

Mr Howard was questioned by John Agius, counsel assisting the inquiry. Counsel for &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Wheat%20Board"&gt;AWB&lt;/a&gt;, the company at the centre of the scandal did not apply to cross-examine the prime minister.

Terrence Cole, the inquiry's commissioner received an application from Peter Geary and Micheal Long's counsel to cross-examine the prime minister but refused it on the grounds that the proposed line of questioning was similar to that of Mr Aguis' and that there was no evidence that Mr Howard had "ever met with Mr Geary or Mr Long".

Mr Agius questioned the prime minister about a series of diplomatic cables sent to his office, which raised concerns about AWB's contracts in Iraq.

Mr Howard told the inquiry that he doesn't recall reading or being briefed about any of the cables referred to by the inquiry. The inquiry also heard that prior to 2003 there was no system in place to identify which cables had been bought to the prime minister's attention.

In his statement to the inquiry, Mr Howard said that his office had not received four of the cables mentioned by the inquiry. Under questioning, Mr Howard confirmed this but conceded that it was likely that his staff had read the other 17.

When asked whether there were any guidelines which guided his advisors in deciding which cables should be bought to the prime minister's attention, Mr Howard replied "No, there weren't".

The inquiry heard that the only discussions about which cables which should be bought to Mr Howard's attention occurred when an advisor changed in very generic terms. Mr Howard told the inquiry that he would tell a new advisor "Well, you've got to exercise your own judgment, I can't possibly read everything, and clearly I want things brought to my attention which are, in your judgment, important and are relevant to issues in front of the government at the time".

Mr Howard admitted that the government had an interest in Iraq using the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; oil for food program for its own financial benefit, but said he did not expect cables dealing with alleged breach of UN sanctions to have been bought to his attention.

The questioning then turned to a statement Mr Howard made to the National Press Club on March 13, 2003, one week prior to the US-led Iraqi occupation. Speaking about &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; Mr Howard said "He has cruelly and cynically manipulated the United Nations oil-for-food programme. He's rorted it to buy weapons to support
his designs at the expense of the wellbeing of his people".

Mr Agius asked Mr Howard if his statement was based upon briefngs he had received. Mr Howard told the inquiry that the information was based upon "open source" intelligence stated at addresses by &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; foreign secretary &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; state department. Mr Howard said one of his advisors "checked with some cables to confirm that those cables supported the open-source claims and was satisfied that they did".

Mr Howard denied seeing the cables used by the advisor to support the claims, but believed he would have told her to be sure that everything they were saying can be supported by fact. Mr Howard told the inquiry that he never knew about cables which referred to Hussein rorting the UN Oil for Food program. Mr Howard admitted that at the time his "general knowledge" was that Hussein had breached UN sanctions and was rorting the Oil for Food program.

"My general knowledge at the time and belief was that the program had been rorted, and it was not seriously in dispute. Nobody was arguing it hadn't been rorted" Mr Howard said.

The prime minister was questioned about an unassessed intelligence report which mentioned a Jordanian trucking company known as "Alia" paying kickbacks to Hussein. In response to this Mr Howard told the inquiry that he could not recall the information being bought to his attention, which was not unusual.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Explosion%20rocks%20Jama%20Masjid%20in%20India&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Twin blasts have rocked the historic &lt;a href="w%3AJama%20Masjid%2C%20Delhi"&gt;Jama Masjid&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Delhi"&gt;Old Delhi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;), killing at least five people and injuring thirteen. The explosions were not strong enough to damage the 17 century mosque.

The first explosion occurred around 1730 hrs local time (&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Standard%20Time"&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt;) and the second at 1740 hrs. The explosives were reportedly carried in plastic bags. There were around 1000 people in the mosque at the time of blasts as the day happened to be &lt;a href="w%3AFriday"&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;, considered holy by the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslims"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; as well as because of the fact that it was the first Friday after &lt;a href="w%3AMilad%20un%20Nabi"&gt;Milad un Nabi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AProphet%20Muhammad"&gt;Prophet Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;'s birthday. The blasts took place just before the &lt;a href="w%3AAzaan"&gt;Azaan&lt;/a&gt;. Some sources claim that the mosque was almost empty with only 100-150 people in the premises when the blast took place. The first blast occurred near Gate No. 1, a place where people wash their hands before offering prayers.

The injured have been admitted to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital. Alert have been sounded in major mosques in India, especially in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. Fire trucks, ambulances and bomb disposal squads reached the site and have cordoned off the area for their operations. The nearby shops have been asked to suspend operations. The Delhi State Government has requested the people to maintain calm and announced an ex-gratia compensation of Rs. 50,000 for the seriously injured and Rs. 25,000 for those with minor injuries. It is being speculated that these blasts might be linked with coincidental six grenade attacks in &lt;a href="w%3ASrinagar"&gt;Srinagar&lt;/a&gt;, that took place the same day. As of 15 April, no terrorist group has claimed the responsibility of the blasts. The Delhi police have arrested four people and are questioning them for the blasts. However, the police have ruled out involvement of any major terrorist group because of the crude nature of explosives.

<h2>Type of explosive</h2>
It has been established that the explosives used in the blast were very crude in nature and consisted of &lt;a href="w%3APotassium%20chlorate"&gt;Potassium chlorate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASulphuric%20acid"&gt;Sulphuric acid&lt;/a&gt;. These two were separated by a rubber wall. When the acid corroded the rubber to make contact with the Potassuim chlorate on the other side, the explosion was triggered.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angels%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; reports that the transcript of the voice recorder on &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines%20Flight%2093"&gt;United Airlines Flight 93&lt;/a&gt; was read during the on-going trial of &lt;a href="w%3AZacarias%20Moussaoui"&gt;Zacarias Moussaoui&lt;/a&gt;, the self-proclaimed &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; member being charged with terrorism in connection with the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;.

The transcript is the first recording of the hijacked airplane's voice recorders to be released to the general public. In 2004, when the &lt;a href="w%3A9/11%20Commission%20Report"&gt;9/11 Commission Report&lt;/a&gt; was finished, some details of the recording were published, however the full transcript was not included in the publication.

The transcript, which has been viewed by the &lt;a href="w%3A9/11%20Commission%20Report"&gt;9/11 Commission Report&lt;/a&gt;, references to people trying to get in the cockpit at 9:58 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ANorth_American_Eastern_Standard_Time_Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;. The transcript at timestamp 09:58:57 records a voice in Arabic saying, "(They want to get in here. Hold, hold from the inside. Hold from the inside. Hold)." Minutes later, a voice in English is recorded, stating, "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die." 

The reading of the United Airlines Flight 93 voice recorder transcript during the on-going trial of Zacarias Moussaoui confirms what has already been stated in the findings of the 9/11 Commission — there is nothing to show any passenger ever got into cockpit or fought the terrorists before the plane crashed at 10:03 a.m. EST. 

The transcript does not record anyone saying, "&lt;a href="w%3ALet%27s%20roll"&gt;Let's roll&lt;/a&gt;" as stated in previous media reports, but has one person saying "roll it." The phrase "&lt;a href="w%3ALet%27s%20roll"&gt;Let's roll&lt;/a&gt;" has become a popular catchphrase, said to be stated by &lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20Beamer"&gt;Todd Beamer&lt;/a&gt;, in reference to the attempt of passengers of Flight 93 to stop the hijackers. President Bush used the phrase in his 2002 &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20the%20Union%20Address"&gt;State of the Union Address&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACOSMIC"&gt;COSMIC&lt;/a&gt; atmospheric research spacecraft launch is likely to be rescheduled to Saturday due to inclement weather.

&lt;a href="w%3ACOSMIC"&gt;COSMIC&lt;/a&gt; is currently scheduled to launch tonight between 5:10 and 8:20 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AUTC-7"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt; (Saturday 0010 to 0320 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; ). The Air Force launch weather team at &lt;a href="w%3AVandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Vandenberg Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; is predicting a 70% chance that weather conditions will prohibit the launch from happening tonight.

If tonight's launch is cancelled, it will be rescheduled for Saturday. Times for a rescheduled launch have not been announced.

The weather outlook for Saturday shows improved conditions with only a 10% chance of rain.

&lt;a href="w%3AMushin%20Musa%20Matwalli%20Atwah"&gt;Mohsin Musa Matawalli Atwah&lt;/a&gt;, 45, who is accused of being an &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; explosive expert, was killed in a missile attack on Wednesday night in &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, said Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Pakistan's information minister. At least eight other alleged terrorists, both foreign and of Pakistani descent, were also believed to have been killed in the strike. However, the body of Atwah has not yet been found and the identities of the others killed are not yet known. It is believed that at least two children were also killed.

"We can confirm the identities of the foreigners killed once we have carried out a thorough ground check," said Pakistani military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan.

Atwah, also known as Abdul Rahman Al-Muhajir, Muhammad K.A. and Abdel Rahman, is accused of being responsible for the bombings of the American embassies in &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; on August 7, 1998 which killed 20 Americans and at least 200 Africans. Atwah is on the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;'s list of most wanted terrorists with a bounty of five million dollars.

"His death has been confirmed. The confirmation is based upon multiple intelligence sources," said Ahmed.

"I confirm the death of this Egyptian terrorist," said an Egyptian minister.

Pakistani forces used missile fire and explosives launched from assault helicopters to kill the expert in the North Waziristan village of Naghar Kalai, which lies near the border of &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Atwah "had been living here for quite some time," said one security official.

However, it is believed that associates of the alleged terrorists killed removed the bodies and buried them in an unidentified location, but at least four tribesmen that were killed were buried in the town's cemetery.

So far, neither the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; nor U.S. officials in &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed the death of Atwah.

A six-year-old girl was killed after a &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Bear"&gt;black bear&lt;/a&gt; attacked her. Her mother and two-year-old brother, also attacked, were critically injured.

The nearly 400-pound bear attacked the family when they were staying at Chilwoee Campground located within the Cherokee National Forest in &lt;a href="w%3ATennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;. The family was visiting a nearby waterfall when they were attacked.

According to rescuers, the girl managed to escape from the bear, but was found only an hour later by a rescuer who fired shots that scared the bear away.

"Allegedly, after the rescue squad found the little girl, one of the squad members fired a shot from a small-caliber handgun. We don't know whether the bear was hit or not. There was no blood, but it chased off," said Dan Hicks, a spokesman for the states Wildlife Resources Agency.

The mother and the brother both remain in critical condition at a hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AChattanooga%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Chattanooga&lt;/a&gt;. The boy's skull was punctured by a bite to the head, before the bear attacked his mother. The mother was trying to scare the bear away with rocks and sticks before being attacked. According to doctors, she had several puncture wounds to her neck, but had too many other claw and teeth marks for them to count. Both are expected to recover.

Investigators have not yet been able to speak to the mother because of the severity of her injuries. 

"She may not remember the attack at all," said Hicks, who also said that it was only Tennessee's second documented attack involving a bear.

"There is a chance that the same bear would attack someone else, so I hope they do catch him," said Lynn Rogers of the North American Bear Center.

Officials have baited traps with honey buns and doughnuts to try and catch the bear.

Authorities have not yet released the names of the victims. The campground has been closed.

According to the online magazine &lt;a href="w%3ASalon"&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; let an "abusive and degrading" interrogation happen in 2002, citing an Army document obtained through a &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt; request as its source. The magazine quoted a December 2005 Army inspector general's report where officers told of Rumsfeld's direct contact with the overseeing general at the U.S. naval base at &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Cuba. 

According to the article, the victim, &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20al-Kahtani"&gt;Mohammed al-Kahtani&lt;/a&gt;, was made to stand naked in front of a female American interrogator and accused of being a homosexual, forced to wear women's underwear and to perform "dog tricks" on a leash and went though 18-20 hours of interrogation per day during 48 of 54 days. 

Salon reports that "on Dec. 2, 2002, Rumsfeld approved 16 harsher interrogation strategies for use against Kahtani, including the use of forced nudity, stress positions and the removal of religious items." According to the report, Rumsfeld revoked these harsher interrogation techniques in mid-January 2003 and they were not approved again.

Salon cites Army investigator Lt. Gen. Randall Schmidt's statement, which was made under oath, that he concluded that although Rumsfeld did not specifically order the interrogation methods used on Kahtani, the open-ended policies approved by Rumsfeld paired with lack of supervision of day-to-day interrogations permitted the abusive conduct to take place.

Pentagon spokesman Jeffery Gordon told &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; that "We've gone over this countless times and yet some still choose to print fiction versus facts," and added that "Twelve major reviews, to include one done by an independent panel, all confirm the
Department of Defense did not have a policy that encouraged or condoned abuse. To suggest otherwise is simply false."

Last week, &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt; released a program for their &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS"&gt;Mac OS&lt;/a&gt; operating system called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABoot%20Camp"&gt;Boot Camp&lt;/a&gt; Assistant♡❤, which will allow Macs to boot &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;. The software was released as a beta version for Apple computers powered on the &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; architecture, which is also used by Windows. ♡❤Assistant♡❤ works by creating a &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20disk%20partition"&gt;hard drive partition&lt;/a&gt; to contain the Windows operating system. Unlike the current method of reformatting, the software will arrange files so that the new partition will not erase existing files. After the partition is created, the user must load a Microsoft Windows install disc.

While Macs will support booting competitors' operating systems with ♡❤Boot Camp Assistant♡❤, Apple will not offer support for them. ♡❤Infinite Loop♡❤ reports that this has led to people accidentally permanently installing Windows on their computers. Another concerned party is Microsoft, who claims that their commitment to the Macintosh operating system "has not changed."

One group seen to benefit is gamers, who will no longer be left waiting for delayed releases of Macintosh versions of games. Peter Cohen of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMacworld"&gt;Macworld&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ notes that he has been able to play certain games with a moderate level of quality. However, he considers this to be a disadvantage for Mac developers, who are responsible for bringing software already available for Windows to the Macintosh operating system.

Police in &lt;a href="w%3AMilwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed that the bodies of two children recovered yesterday from a small pond in McGovern Park are indeed those of Purvis Parker, 11, and Quadrevion Henning, 12, who lived nearby. The two boys were reported missing nearly a month ago.

Police had shown photos of the two bodies to Parker's mother, Angela Virginia, who said she believed that the bodies were those of the two missing boys. Today's autopsy confirms their identities, and lists drowning as the cause of death. Police have said there is no evidence to suggest foul play. 

"Honestly I don't think there was any foul play. That makes it kind of nice for the family that they weren't held against their own will," said Dennis Frazier, Henning's uncle.

"It looks like it has been in the lagoon for quite some time," said Nan Hegerty, Chief of the Milwaukee Police, when the first body was found. According to Hegerty, two people walking in the park spotted the first body at around 7:23 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral_Daylight_Time"&gt;CDT&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. The second body was found at about 10 p.m. CDT by divers for the police department. Both boys were fully clothed when found. 

According to Hegerty, the pond where the bodies were found had been checked several times in the past.

"Apparently that body too had come up to the surface and was caught in a somewhat of a weedy, wooded area of the lagoon," added Hegerty.

Both boys had been missing since March 19, 2006.

<h2>Headlines</h2>

&lt;a href="Police%20confirm%20lagoon%20bodies%20are%20boys%20missing%20from%20Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Police confirm lagoon bodies are boys missing from Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;

Police in Milwaukee, Wisconsin have confirmed that the bodies of two children recovered yesterday from a small pond in the city's McGovern Park are indeed those of Purvis Parker, aged 11, and Quadrevion Henning, age 12, who lived nearby. The two boys were reported missing nearly a month ago.

Police had shown photos of the two bodies to Parker's mother, Angela Virginia, who said she believed that the bodies were those of the two missing boys. Today's autopsy confirms their identity, and lists drowning as the cause of death. Police have said there is no evidence to suggest foul play.

&lt;a href="U.S.%20claims%20of%20Iraqi%20bioweapons%20labs%20contradicted%20in%20classified%20Pentagon%20report%20filed%20on%2027%20May%202003"&gt;U.S. claims of Iraqi bioweapons labs contradicted in classified Pentagon report filed on 27 May 2003&lt;/a&gt;

In an article published on Wednesday by The Washington Post, reporter Joby Warrick alleged that the Bush administration and the CIA "possessed powerful evidence" that contradicted assertions made by President Bush one month after the Iraqi war began, where trailers found in Iraq were said to have been mobile biological weapons labs.

On May 27, 2003, two days before President Bush said "We have found the weapons of mass destruction" and the CIA published their whitepaper detailing how these trailers were allegedly used to produce biological weapons, a fact-finding group comprised of U.S. and British civilian experts that had investigated the labs concluded unanimously that these had nothing to do with biological weapons production and relayed their results back to Washington, according to the Washington Post. The paper said it interviewed six of the nine group members.

In Wednesday's press conference, White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan said "I will point out that the reporting I saw this morning was simply reckless and it was irresponsible. The lead in The Washington Post left the impression for the reader that the President was saying something he knew at the time not to be true. ... The President's statements were based on the joint assessment of the CIA and DIA that was publicly released the day before..."

Days after the &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian administration announced their first successful enrichment of uranium, President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; has made threatening comments against the &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i government at a conference to discuss &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;.

During the three day conference on Friday, Ahmadinejad is reported to have commented on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;Israel’s reported threat to the Middle East&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and suggested that the Israeli government was "heading toward annihilation," and that it will soon be liberated. 

Iran is known to be a supporter of Palestine, and has previously offered an unknown amount of money to the Palestinian Authority to make up for the loss of Western donations since Hamas won the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20legislative%20elections%20in%202006"&gt;Palestinian legislative elections in 2006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

More than 600 suspected cases of &lt;a href="w%3Amumps"&gt;mumps&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in &lt;a href="w%3AIowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; since December, well above the state average of five cases a year. State and federal officials are searching for the source of the outbreak.

Officials from the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; are contacting passengers of several commercial flights that may have carried individuals infected with the virus. Mumps can be transmitted by coughing, sneezing, and sharing cups or eating utensils.

Symptoms of the infection include headache, coughing, and most notably swelling of the glands at the base of the jaw. In some cases, mumps can lead to serious complications such as meningitis, sterility, and deafness. Most children in the United States are immunized against mumps.

Police in &lt;a href="w%3APurcell%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Purcell, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, about 40 miles (64 km) south of &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma%20City"&gt;Oklahoma City&lt;/a&gt;, on Friday discovered the mutilated body of a ten-year-old girl in the apartment of a man who lived in the same apartment complex.

The body of Jamie Rose Bolin was found in a storage bin in the bedroom closet of Kevin Underwood, 26, said Tim Kuykendall, district attorney for McClain County. Underwood has been arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder and is being held without bail. He has no criminal record or history of mental illness.

The girl was last seen on Wednesday near the Purcell public library, and her family reported her missing that night. Officials waited until Thursday night to issue an &lt;a href="w%3AAmber%20Alert"&gt;Amber Alert&lt;/a&gt; because no abduction was reported.

Underwood reportedly drew the suspicion of law enforcement at an information checkpoint set up at the apartment complex. Among the other items found in Underwood's apartment were a decorative dagger, a hacksaw, barbecue skewers, meat tenderizer, and a wooden cutting board, according to police.

Preliminary autopsy reports find that the girl died of asphyxiation and blunt force trauma to the head. Deep saw marks found on the body indicate that the suspect attempted to decapitate the girl, say authorities. As the body was found unclothed, police also suspect that Bolin was molested after she died.

"Regarding a potential motive, this appears to have been part of a plan to kidnap a person, rape them, torture them, kill them, cut off their head, drain the body of blood, rape the corpse, eat the corpse, then dispose of the organs and bones," Purcell police chief David Tompkins said.

According to Kuykendall, Underwood said he began fantasizing about eating someone a year ago. The prosecutor added that authorities believe "that while she was ultimately chosen to be the victim of this horrific crime, that other people had been targeted and considered," including a woman and a 5-year-old boy. He added that this was one of the most atrocious crimes he had seen as district attorney, and that he intends to seek the death penalty.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; cheerleaders have been told today to cover up their midriffs under calls by Gymnastics Australia, as they believe it encourages girls to be self-conscious.

Nerine Cooper, head of Gymnastics Australia, told the Sunday Telegraph, "We don't want girls to feel under pressure to lose weight because of uniforms." 

Lisa Ince, head of Sydney Professional Dancers, disagreed. "It's ridiculous really, if the thinking is that a midriff is offensive, then every dance school and athletics club would face the same restrictions," she said.

The ban will affect about 150 teams registered with Gymnastics Australia.

A finance spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; federal opposition has said that Australia could use its power as a large &lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt; exporter to discourage the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20proliferation"&gt;proliferation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20weapons"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Australia has the largest known reserves of uranium but is the world's third largest producer behind &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States"&gt;Commonwealth of Independent States&lt;/a&gt;.

Lindsay Tanner told Channel Ten that: "We could play a much stronger role as a uranium exporter as part of a relatively small number of major uranium exporters, in using that influence collectively for good on nuclear weapons proliferation".

Mr. Tanner said Australia could join forces with other major uranium exporters to discourage the spread of nuclear weapons. "We don't seek to collectively use our influence, along with the influence of other countries like Canada who are major uranium exporters, to try and restrict the proliferation of nuclear weapons," he said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; is said to be divided about its uranium mining policy. The debate within the party has come to the forefront following a decision earlier this month to export uranium to &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. At present, Labor opposes the opening of new uranium mines. The party's resource spokesperson, Martin Ferguson is calling for the policy to be thrown out.

Peter Garrett, another member of the ALP said last week he did not support any changes to the party's uranium mining policy but refused to rule out doing so in the future.

Mr. Tanner said that it is "perfectly reasonable" to reconsider the party's policy as "the world has changed". He said that the issue of nuclear proliferation should be at the centre of any change to the party's policy.

"So there's a number of things we could be doing, but we aren't doing yet, and I think (that) should be central to the debate about the future of Labor's policy and the future of Australia's approach" said Mr. Tanner.

Opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; has deferred discussion of the issue until next year's national conference.

British MPs on the Commons Environmental Audit Committee warn Britain could face widespread electrical blackouts if new generating capacity is not added soon.

Clean and renewable generating methods will be preferred in the Government's energy review, including a return to nuclear power generation. But the committee warned that no new nuclear power plants are expected to come online until at least 2017 with the proposed network not reaching full capacity until as late as 2030. Meanwhile nearly a quarter of Britain's current generating capacity is scheduled to go offline by 2016, creating a shortfall described by the committee as a "generation gap" which could not be bridged by nuclear energy.

"Very substantial investment in new generating capacity and energy efficiency will be required if the lights are to stay on," committee chairman Conservative MP &lt;a href="w%3ATim_Yeo"&gt;Tim Yeo&lt;/a&gt; said. The committee stated that an "extensive" building programme of new gas-fired power stations would be needed to meet the predicted shortfall.

The committee's statement drew some support from environmentalists as well as from some energy sector industries. &lt;a href="w%3AFriends_of_the_Earth"&gt;Friends of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; was cautiously cheered by the committee's commitment to energy efficiency, and support of reduced emissions. "...people understand renewables is the next big thing and we should get on with it," said Maf Smith, CEO of Scottish Renewables to &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.

Aruban police have made an arrest in relation to the &lt;a href="w%3ANatalee%20Holloway"&gt;Natalee Holloway&lt;/a&gt; case. 

Holloway, 18, was visiting the island from &lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; and has not been seen since May 30, 2005, with Joran van der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. All three boys were arrested as suspects in the disappearance in June 2005, but were released when a court ruled that there was not enough evidence to continue holding the boys.

A spokeswoman for the public prosecutor's office in Aruba, Mariaine Croes, said that authorities are not yet prepared to release details about the arrest, but did say that the suspect is 19 and that his initials are "G.V.C.". Names of suspects arrested in Aruba are not usually released to the media, so authorities use initials in place of a full name.

Family members and relatives of Natalee have posted a US$250,000 for information leading to an arrest in the case. A US$1 million dollar reward has also been posted for the safe return of Natalee.

An estimated 10,000 conscientious objectors chose to withhold some or all of their U.S. income taxes due Monday, April 17, in protest to the use of US military power in Iraq. Some plan to instead donate their required tax to charity.

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; does not distinguish tax resistors from any other person behind on their taxes, and will apply the same fines and interest used against the other Americans who do not pay their taxes on time. Legal action is possible for extreme cases, but more commonly the IRS uses wage or bank account garnishing.

The tax protestors are well aware of these risks, yet refuse to pay on principle. Jim Allen, who served in the Army for 20 years and now teaches at St. Louis University, acknowledges that he will likely end up paying more due to the fines than he is refusing to pay today. "I am not opposed to paying taxes, but I am when such a large percent is going to pay for war. Sooner or later, they're going to get their money, but until that happens, I'm going to continue protesting. This is too important not to." Allen and his wife withheld $1300 - or 42% of what the couple owes the IRS, estimating this to be the proportion of his taxes that would otherwise go to military spending.

Other protestors simply refuse to file at all. Becky Pierce of Boston fills out a 1040 to determine her tax, but then donates that amount to charity without filing. Pierce says she follows in the footsteps of American protesters like &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20David%20Thoreau"&gt;Henry David Thoreau&lt;/a&gt;, a protester of the Mexican-American War who went to jail rather than pay taxes. "You need to have control of your money," Pierce says. "I'm a self-employed carpenter. No one is reporting what I make. That's why I can go unnoticed."

On the occasion of the one year since the death of &lt;a href="w%3AIakovos%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20America"&gt;Archbishop Iakovos of America&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AAristotle%20University%20of%20Thessaloniki"&gt;Aristotle University of Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt; Church History Professor, &lt;a href="w%3AAthanasios%20Angelopoulos"&gt;Athanasios Angelopoulos&lt;/a&gt; along with his collaborator, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWestminster"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt; University politics graduate Nicolas Mottas, represented the program ♡❤♡Ecumenical Hellenism♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.gnl.gr/gnl_en/home_en.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the ♡❤♡Institute for National and Religious Studies of Thessalonika♡❤♡ at the first annual memorial service for the late Archbishop Iakovos which took place in Boston on April 9, 2006. 

The memorial service for Archbishop Iakovos - which was followed by a parade in Central Boston honoring the Greek Independence Day - were attended by five members of the Greek &lt;a href="w%3Aparliament"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;, the Consul General of Greece in Boston and hundreds of Greeks and Americans from &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. 
The memorial service, which was offered by His Eminence, the Metropolitan of Boston Methodios, was followed by a speech from Athanasios Angelopoulos dedicated to Archbishop Iakovos' memory. More specifically, Angelopoulos mentioned that "♡❤the late Archbishop was the proper and the only person who could inspire the presidents of the United States, so that this country co-celebrates along with the Greek-Americans every year, the spiritual goals of freedom and democracy, on the occasion of the historic event of the Greek revolution in 1821♡❤". Angelopoulos made also a reference to the late Metropolitan Silas of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, who died in 2000 and was a personal friend of Iakovos. Speeches were also offered by the Metropolitan of Boston as well as from &lt;a href="w%3AConsul%20General"&gt;Consul General&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;.

By the opportunity of the first annual memorial service of the former Greek Orthodox leader, professor Angelopoulos and Nicolas Mottas, met with the director of Archbishop Iakovos' archives and for years personal secretary of the Archbishop, Nikie Calles, at the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America&lt;a href="http%3A//www.goarch.org"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - as well as with Paulette Poulos, director of development of Leadership 100 and former secretary of Iakovos at the &lt;a href="w%3AOnassis"&gt;Onassis&lt;/a&gt; Cultural Centre - in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%2C%20NY"&gt;New York City, NY&lt;/a&gt;, regarding the inedited correspondence of the late Archbishop on human rights and national issues; an ambitious work, which is scheduled to be published in both Greek and English, within 2006.

Kevin Ray Underwood, the suspect in the &lt;a href="10-year-old%20Oklahoma%20girl%20found%20murdered"&gt;murder of 10-year-old Jamie Rose Bolin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3APurcell%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Purcell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly kept a weblog in which he joked about cannibalism, discussed the effects of not taking his prescribed medicine, and talked about "dangerously weird" fantasies.

Underwood was arrested Friday after investigators searched his apartment and found Jamie's body in a plastic bin in his bedroom closet. Also reportedly found in his apartment were barbecue skewers and meat tenderizer, which law enforcement officials believe he intended to use to eat the girl's flesh.

People who knew Underwood reported that he was a relatively unassuming man, seemingly trustworthy. His mother described him as "a wonderful boy" and said of Jamie, "I would like to be able to tell her family how sorry we are. I just feel so terrible."

In the profile of his blog, entitled "Strange Things are Afoot at the Circle K" (&lt;a href="http%3A//futureworldruler.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Underwood described himself as "Single, bored, and lonely, but other than that, pretty happy." Also on his profile page, he poses the question, "If you were a cannibal, what would you wear to dinner?" and answers, "The skin of last night's main course."

In an entry dated September 8, 2005, Underwood reportedly described 1998 as "the year that a large part of me died" and "the longest year of my life." He reported losing contact with most of his friends, making an online acquaintance only to lose her again, and suffering panic attacks from being around people at college. Two of his friends also were involved in a car accident, one fatally injured. 

He reported in that entry that in the last year he found himself becoming more and more detached from the world, never leaving his apartment except to go to work or his parents' apartment. In an entry dated September 24, 2004, he reported that his fantasies were "just getting weirder and weirder. Dangerously weird. If people knew the kinds of things I think about anymore, I'd probably be locked away. No probably about it, I know I would be."

In an entry dated February 4, 2006, he said that he had hardly left the apartment in almost two months, and that "a week or so ago, I spent my day off sitting here at the computer, barely moving from the chair, for 14 hours."

His last blog entry was dated Thursday, April 13, 2006, one day after authorities believe Underwood killed Jamie Bolin.

An article supporting written by appeared in the Washington Post Outlook section yesterday. Moore was a co-founder of who currently co-chairs an industry-funded initiative, the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, which supports increased use of nuclear energy. Moore and U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-Nebraska) spoke during the opening session of the 2005 American Nuclear Society's Winter meeting in November.

Moore says that his views have changed since founding Greenpeace, and he now believes that using nuclear energy can help counteract catastrophic climate change from burning fossil fuels. Says Moore, "The 600-plus plants emit nearly 2 billion tons of annually -- the equivalent of the exhaust from about 300 million automobiles." Moore also cites reports from the Clean Air Council that coal plants are responsible for 64 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 26 percent of nitrous oxides and 33 percent of mercury emissions. 

"Meanwhile, the 103 nuclear plants operating in the United States effectively avoid the release of 700 million tons of CO2 emissions annually," says Moore. "Nuclear energy is the only large-scale, cost-effective energy source that can reduce these emissions while continuing to satisfy a growing demand for power. And these days it can do so safely." Moore points out that the average cost of producing nuclear energy in the United States was less than two cents per kilowatt-hour, comparable with coal and hydroelectric. He predicts that advances in technology will bring the cost down further in the future.

According to Moore, British atmospheric scientist , father of the Gaia theory, also believes that nuclear energy is the only way to avoid catastrophic climate change. Concerns about past accidents in the nuclear industry were also mentioned, as he claims the &lt;a href="w%3AChernobyl%20nuclear%20disaster"&gt;Chernobyl nuclear disaster&lt;/a&gt; as example, calling it "an accident waiting to happen. This early model of Soviet reactor had no containment vessel, was an inherently bad design and its operators literally blew it up". He also recognized the difficulty of dealing with nuclear waste.

Moore was a founding member of Greenpeace in 1971 and was instrumental in its early campaigns, but left the organization in 1986. Greenpeace is known for its campaigns of nonviolent direct action against atmospheric and underground nuclear testing.

&lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Food%20Inspection%20Agency"&gt;Food Inspection Agency&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that a cow in British Columbia, Canada, tested positive for &lt;a href="w%3Abovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt;, or "mad cow disease". Officials announced on Friday that initial tests done on the purebred six-year-old dairy Holstein had come back inconclusive. The cow was found in &lt;a href="w%3AFraser%20Valley%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Fraser Valley&lt;/a&gt;, a farming community near &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;.

Officials also say that the beef supply is safe because none of the infected cows had made it to the human food chain. "This finding does not affect the safety of Canadian beef. Tissues in which BSE is known to concentrate in infected animals are removed from all cattle slaughtered in Canada for domestic and international human consumption. No part of this animal entered the human food or animal feed systems," said agency officials in a statement on Sunday.

"This animal, a six-year-old dairy cow, developed BSE after the implementation of Canada's feed ban. Investigators will pay particular attention to the feed to which the animal may have been exposed early in its life, when cattle are most susceptible to BSE. The CFIA is collecting records of feed purchased by and used on the animal's birth farm," the statement continued.

However, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; does not believe a ban on Canadian beef will come immediately. "Information gathered through this investigation will help us to determine what, if any, impact this should have on our beef and live cattle trade with Canada. Based on the information currently available, I do not anticipate a change in the status of our trade," said U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns.

This is Canada's fifth confirmed case of the disease since May 2003, and officials have tested more than 100,000 cows since the first case of the disease turned up in &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;. This is the second cow to test positive for the disease this year. 

At least 150 people worldwide have died from eating beef contaminated with the variant &lt;a href="w%3ACreutzfeldt-Jakob_Disease"&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&lt;/a&gt;, a nerve disease that is usually fatal. Most of the deaths occurred in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; police report that a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; suicide bomber has caused an explosion at a restaurant in central Tel Aviv. Eight people are reported dead and at least 40 injured in the blast.

Two of the victims died after they had arrived at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv. Of the wounded, six were seriously hurt, 12 sustained moderate wounds, while the rest were lightly injured. 

A suicide bomber targeted the same restaurant, “The Mayor’s Felafel,” on January 19. At least 20 were wounded in that attack. The restaurant was reportedly full of holiday travellers.

Palestinian group Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for the attack, as it has for six suicide bombings carried out since a cease-fire was declared in February 2005. Palestinian sources identified the bomber as Sami Salim Hamad, an Islamic Jihad activist from the village of Qabatiyah, on outskirts of the West Bank city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJenin"&gt;Jenin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abattle%20of%20Jenin%202002"&gt;Battle of Jenin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; occurred in 2002.

The suicide bombing was the first since Hamas took over the government of the Palestinian Authority less than three weeks ago. On Sunday, Islamic Jihad pledged to carry out more attacks.

The Bush administration has strongly criticized the attacks, calling it "a despicable act of terror for which there is no excuse or justification." Khaled Abu Helal, spokesman for the Hamas-led Interior Ministry, called the attack "a direct result of the policy of the occupation and the brutal aggression and siege committed against our people."

Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Gideon Meir said Israel held Hamas responsible for the attacks, accusing it of "giving support to all the other terrorist organizations."

The known deceased:
Piroska Boda (50): citizenship: Romanian, nationality: Hungarian, foreign worker in Natanja, spending Easter holidays in Tel Aviv
Rozália Besenyei (48): citizenship: Romanian, nationality: Hungarian
7 others are known to be of Israeli citizenship

A &lt;a href="w%3Arail"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt; accident occurred on Sunday night outside the town of Drama, northern &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, having as a result the death of four people and the injury of 22. The Intercity train, which was operating the route from &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AAlexandroupolis"&gt;Alexandroupolis&lt;/a&gt;, had 65 passengers onboard and according the Hellenic Railway Organisation(OSE) the accident occurred when a truck driver attempted to drive through a &lt;a href="w%3Agrade%20crossing"&gt;grade crossing&lt;/a&gt;. 

Forty people were transferred to the &lt;a href="w%3AHospital"&gt;Hospital&lt;/a&gt; of Drama and 22 remain hospitalised; two of them to be in critical condition. The driver of the truck, Yannis Papadopoulos, 40, a police trainee and a kindergarten teacher were killed, however the police have not released the names of the last two.

OSE expressed its sorrow for the deaths and the &lt;a href="w%3AMinister"&gt;Minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMacedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AThrace"&gt;Thrace&lt;/a&gt; visited the site of the accident and declared that the State acted immediately. However, this rail accident raises a question about the safety of the Hellenic Railways as well as the policies that the Greek Ministry of Transport should apply.

On Thursday, the Internet news publication &lt;a href="w%3ARaw%20Story"&gt;Raw Story&lt;/a&gt; corroborated claims that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; is involved in acts of violence committed in Iran. It claims that these are being carried out by retrained ex-members of the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Mujahedin%20of%20Iran"&gt;People's Mujahedin of Iran&lt;/a&gt; (MEK) rather than by traditional US soldiers.

A previous claim was made by former United Nations weapons inspector &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Ritter"&gt;Scott Ritter&lt;/a&gt; in June 2005 that United States security forces have been sending members of the MEK into &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian territory. Ritter claimed that the CIA had used the MEK "to carry out remote bombings in Iran of the sort that the Bush administration condemns on a daily basis inside Iraq".

Early this month, &lt;a href="w%3ASeymour%20Hersh"&gt;Seymour Hersh&lt;/a&gt; made a similar statement in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20Yorker"&gt;New Yorker Magazine&lt;/a&gt; about the entry of US troops themselves into Iranian territory, but without supporting the claim that they carried out acts of violence. Hersh claimed that US combat troops are "now operating in Iran" and that according to a "government consultant with close ties to civilians in the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;nowiki&gt;[combat troop]&lt;/nowiki&gt; units were also working with &lt;a href="w%3AEthnic%20minorities%20in%20Iran"&gt;minority groups in Iran&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href="w%3AAzerbaijani%20people"&gt;Azeris&lt;/a&gt;, in the north, the &lt;a href="w%3ABaloch"&gt;Baluchis&lt;/a&gt;, in the southeast, and the &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20Kurdistan"&gt;Kurds&lt;/a&gt;, in the northeast &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt;." According to Hersh, the government consultant also said that the US troops "are studying the terrain, and giving away walking-around money to ethnic tribes, and recruiting scouts from local tribes and shepherds."

In Thursday's report, Raw Story supported the previous claims about the US committing acts of violence in Iran, with the difference that it claimed that the acts are being carried out by &lt;a href="w%3Aproxy%20war"&gt;proxy&lt;/a&gt; retrained ex-MEK members rather than by traditional US soldiers, and that the incursions have been occurring for about a year.
Raw Story cited an unnamed &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; source "close to" the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; who stated that former MEK members have been used as a &lt;a href="w%3Aproxy%20war"&gt;proxy&lt;/a&gt; by the US for "roughly a year" inside of Iranian territory. An intelligence source quoted by Raw Story said that the former MEK members were made to "swear an oath to Democracy and resign from the MEK" before being incorporated into US military units and retrained for their operations in Iran. The MEK is an Iranian opposition group listed by the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department%20list%20of%20Foreign%20Terrorist%20Organizations"&gt;Foreign Terrorist Organization&lt;/a&gt; but describes itself as "secular" and "patriotic, Muslim and democratic".

Raw Story cited the UN official saying that "We are already at war". Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Sam Gardiner made similar remarks on CNN on Friday saying "I would say -- and this may shock some -- I think the decision has been made and military operations are under way."

Raw Story said that the MEK has been used in the Iranian provinces of &lt;a href="w%3ASistan%20and%20Baluchistan%20Province"&gt;Baluchistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEthnic%20politics%20of%20Khuzestan"&gt;Khuzestan&lt;/a&gt; and quoted a senior British intelligence official saying that British intelligence believes that the MEK is responsible for the violent attacks in the southern Iran, and that people from a "US Special mission unit" are present on Iranian territory, but was unsure as to the links between US military and the MEK.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Council%20of%20Resistance%20of%20Iran"&gt;National Council of Resistance of Iran&lt;/a&gt;, which is alleged by the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; to be "an integral part of the MEK", Professor Raymond Tanter of Georgetown University and a former White House aide argued on Al-Jazeera television that the only way to confront Iran's threats is to support the MEK and its removal from the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department%20list%20of%20Foreign%20Terrorist%20Organizations"&gt;U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations&lt;/a&gt; and from its classification as a terrorist organization by the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20the%20European%20Union"&gt;Council of the European Union&lt;/a&gt;.

Raw Story reports that the office of the Undersecretary of Defense Intelligence did not return calls for comment.

In the run up to the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;'s May local elections, attention has again been drawn to the &lt;a href="British%20National%20Party"&gt;British National Party&lt;/a&gt; (BNP). Party spokesman and councillor candidate for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFulham%20Broadway"&gt;Fulham Broadway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; area of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Steven Tyler stated "Now we are a party with sensible policies which have made us much more electable than in the past,"

The BNP local election manifesto of April 14 outlined the party's commitment to environmental and tax reforms, with a focus on a zero-tolerance campaign against anti-social behaviour and the removal of what the BNP sees as preferential treatment of asylum seekers. 

The party has said it will field a total of 365 candidates for local authority seats in the May 4 elections. Currently the BNP has 15 councillors across &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and stated at its campaign launch that it intends to add "another 15 or 20" seats.

Research undertaken on behalf of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Rowntree%20Charitable%20Trust"&gt;The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has indicated that up to 25% of people have said that "they might" vote for the BNP. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUK%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;MPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from mainstream parties have admitted that they need to face the challenge presented by the BNP in the May 4 election.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; members have suggested that disillusionment with the government is to blame for the current findings of the report. 

Former Conservative leader &lt;a href="Iain%20Duncan%20Smith"&gt;Iain Duncan Smith&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; radio 4's ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToday%20%28BBC%20Radio%204%29"&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ program that the BNPs message was gaining headway in disadvantaged areas and identified that “What we have picked up in these very difficult communities is the collapse in the quality of life for so many people". Duncan Smith went on to say, "The whole sense of the quality of life in these communities has become a rich feeding ground for people who want to stigmatise others as being the cause of this." 

"If voters are unhappy with conventional parties, one of the key reasons is because successive Tory and Labour governments have failed to provide enough affordable housing where families wish to live," commented Liberal Democrat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Hughes"&gt;Simon Hughes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He added that voters should not be taken in by the “simplistic promises” of the BNP.

Seven weeks after citizens of the &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Nations%2040%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Six Nations of the Grand River&lt;/a&gt; reserve repossessed land near &lt;a href="w%3ACaledonia%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Caledonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, on February 28, the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;Ontario Provincial Police&lt;/a&gt;, who have authority from a court to arrest the protesters for contempt of court, have yet to act.

On April 11, more than 50 police cruisers, two paddy wagons, and several vans gathered outside an abandoned school on Unity Road in Caledonia. However, reports from last night are that visible police presence is minimal, with just a few police cruisers parked down the road from the protest site.

Before the site was blocked, Henco Industries had begun construction on 10 luxury homes out of a total of 71 scheduled to be built as part of the $6 million Douglas Creek Estates subdivision.

The tract of land under dispute was registered as a land claim by the Six Nations Band Council in 1987 but its status has yet to be settled. The land originally made up part of a large land grant given in 1784 to the Six Nations for services rendered during the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Revolutionary%20War"&gt;American War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. The government and the developer claim that the Six Nations surrendered title in 1841, but the Band disputes this.

The protesters are demanding a nation-to-nation dialogue with the Canadian government and continue to call for a peaceful resolution. Some protesters, however, have stated that if the OPP forcefully try to remove them, they will defend their land with force.

"If they break the peace, we'll do what we have to do," said protester Dick Hill. "Things are very tense. We are trying to defend our lands, which were taken from us. Every time we try to stand up for who we are and what we are, they come and drag us away."

An injunction was issued to the development company a month ago that allowed for the protesters to be removed. Police have not enforced the injunction. 

However, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20James%20Ramsay"&gt;David Ramsay&lt;/a&gt;, Ontario's Aboriginal Affairs Minister, said that the province was going to have a meeting with both protesters and developers in an attempt to address their concerns.

"This is a very serious situation. I have to be very hopeful that we're going to see a peaceful end to this situation. We think we can resolve this by negotiating, and by talking so that's what we're doing," added Ramsay.

In &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland's&lt;/a&gt; Harbour, a suitcase containing a dead body has been found. Police, first suspecting a possible kidnap and ransom plot, have now arrested two male students from China. They have not been accused of any crime, but they are in custody and "are helping police", as Detective Inspector Bernie Hollewand told IOL reporters.

Specialists say the body had been dead for about 24 hours by the time it was found and had multiple injuries. Forensic police believe that the murder took place in an inner-city Auckland hotel.

Last Thursday, a mental patient at Rotorua Hospital's psychiatric ward in New Zealand was assaulted. Today, she was named as Moria Albert, 51, from Rotorua. After the attack, she was taken to the intensive care unit and placed on life support, but died that afternoon.

The attacker, Nigel Mountford of Rotorua, was charged with murder and appeared in court on Friday. He entered no plea, and a psychological assessment is pending.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; is currently drafting a bill known as the Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Efficiency Act of 2006 that would revise and update the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATelecommunications%20Act%20of%201996"&gt;1996 Telecommunications Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Currently phone and cable lobbyists who own the broadband networks, such as those from AT&amp;T and BellSouth, are calling on the federal government to permit them to operate Internet and other digital communications services as private networks. The bill as it now stands states that certain classes of Internet providers "may not unreasonably" impair, interfere, restrict or limit applications or services, such as Web sites or voice-over-IP phone connections. 

Consumer advocates such as Common Cause and some large Internet companies such as Google and Yahoo are concerned that this change will result in a loss of what is being called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anetwork%20neutrality"&gt;network neutrality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and are demanding specific language in the bill to address it. Three weeks ago, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Subcommittee on Telecommunications rejected an amendment to the bill that would have strengthened provisions for network neutrality. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 28 to 8.

Network neutrality is a principle of computer networking that describes networks designed so that no communication, application, or service is either given preferential treatment or restricted. 

Advocates of network neutrality fear that allowing broadband networks to operate unregulated could lead to preferential treatment toward certain companies at the expense of others. Phone companies who oppose network neutrality legislation contend that some mechanism needs to be in place in order to pay for expansion of the public Internet. 

Edward Whitacre, AT&amp;T's chief executive officer, had made remarks on the issue that consumer groups found inflammatory. In remarks made on November 7, 2005, presumably referring to Internet sites using their network connections, he called for "some mechanism for these people who use these pipes to pay for the portion they're using. Why should they be allowed to use my pipes?" 

Whitacre has since reversed his public statements, saying on March 21, 2006, "Any provider that blocks access to content is inviting customers to find another provider. And that's just bad business."

Federal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin believes that the FCC already has the authority to enforce network neutrality provisions, citing a North Carolina case in which the FCC acted against Madison River Communications for blocking Vonage VoIP phone service.

Representative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Upton"&gt;Fred Upton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , chairman of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Energy%20and%20Commerce"&gt;Telecommunications and the Internet Subcommittee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , describes the bill as a way to "ignite the marketplace &amp;mdash; unleashing great advances in technology and delivering to consumers a variety of new services at a lower cost that were once never even imagined. Every consumer in the nation with a telephone, television and access to the Internet will be better for it &amp;mdash; the wave of the future is now." 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Copps"&gt;Michael Copps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a FCC Commissioner, said recently, "This Internet may not be the one we know in the future there are threats to it out there... Entrenched interests are already jockeying to constrain the openness that has been the Internet's defining hallmark." 

A recent poll done by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Federation%20of%20America"&gt;The Consumer Federation of America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (See source 5) shows that the Internet has taken on an important role in the daily life of Americans. With two-thirds reporting it is important for personal communications and researching products, over half said it is important for getting news and, about 40 percent cited online banking, e-commerce, and retrieving government information as significant ways in which they used the internet. They expressed a great deal of concern about discriminatory practices of communications network operators.

The revision of the 1996 Telecommunications Act was proposed by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Joe Barton, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIllinois"&gt;Ill.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in late March and went on to the full committee on April 5.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; Police Commissioner H. McCarthy Gipson, Sister Karen Klimczak, 62, a Catholic nun who went missing on Friday, has been found dead in a shallow grave. Her body was found inside a shed in the backyard of an abandoned house just five miles from her home. Police believe that she was either suffocated or strangled and her body did not show any immediate signs of a gunshot wound or a stab wound. They are waiting awaiting the results of an autopsy.

"We've lost a tireless champion of the people," Buffalo Mayor, Byron W. Brown said on Monday.

Klimczak founded and lived in the Bissonette House in 1989, a halfway house for ex-convicts who are considered to be non-violent. It was named after Rev. A Joseph Bissonette, a priest that was killed in the house in 1987 by an ex-convict that was residing there.

"It is a tremendous tragedy that this repeats itself 19 years later," added Brown.

Craig Lynch, 37, an ex-convict who has been living in the house since April 5, according to Gipson, was arrested and confessed to the murder while also admitting to being on drugs at the time. According to Gipson, however, Lynch said the murder was "an accident." Lynch was paroled in January from Wyoming Correctional Facility after time served from a conviction related to auto theft.

Police say he was attempting to steal Klimczak's cellular phone from her room when she returned home on Friday. Detective Sgt. James P. Lonergan, the lead investigator on this case, says Lynch then attacked Klimczak from behind when she got to the door and then proceeded to dispose of the body.

"He initially hid the body behind a house on George Street and he covered it with some debris. He [then] went to a shed behind a vacant house and dug a shallow grave, then he brought the body there and put it in the grave," said Lonergan.

The phone, along with some of the victims clothing and various personal belongings, were found in two different trash cans near her home.

Lynch is expected to be charged with larceny and second-degree murder.

A report published by &lt;a href="Greenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; questions an estimate made by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IAEA) that 4000 deaths have resulted from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChernobyl%20accident"&gt;Chernobyl nuclear accident&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Greenpeace claims that this estimate is 'a gross simplification of the breadth of human suffering' and that over the last 15 years, 60,000 have died in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; because of the accident, and estimates that the total death toll for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABelarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could be another 140,000.

The figure of 4,000 deaths given by the IAEA report referred to cancer fatalities within a group of 600,000 people, comprising of those who were sent in to clean up after the accident and those relocated after the accident. The Greenpeace report calls this figure 'misleading', saying that the report 'hid the true scale of human impact of Chernobyl'.

Ivan Blokov of Greenpeace said "it is appalling that the IAEA is whitewashing the impacts of the most serious nuclear accident in human history".

The IAEA have not yet responded to the report. 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spokesman Gregory Hartl stated that "The Greenpeace report is looking at all of &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, whereas our report looks at only the most affected areas of the three most affected countries." Furthermore, "The WHO felt it had recourse to the best national and international scientific evidence and studies when it came up with its estimates of [up to] 9,000 excess deaths for the most affected areas. We feel they're very sound."

The report has been released at a time when the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; government is considering whether new nuclear power stations should be built in the country.

The sentencing hearing is scheduled for August 4.

Current governor &lt;a href="w%3ARod%20Blagojevich"&gt;Rod Blagojevich&lt;/a&gt; has replaced Ryan, a &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;, who served as the 39th governor of the state of Illinois from 1999 to 2003. He is best known for his state-wide moratorium on executions in 2000.

The samples will be sent abroad to the 
&lt;a href="w%3AWorld_Health_Organization_%2528WHO%2529"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; for further testing. Most of the infected poultry has already been disposed of. H5N1, which has spread throughout Europe, northern Africa (including neighboring Egypt), central Asia, and the Middle East, has already killed about 100 people. There is no word yet on the man's identity or condition.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, president of the &lt;a href="United%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; was awarded the first place ♡❤♡♡❤Jefferson Muzzle♡❤♡♡❤, anti-free speech award for 2006, by the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression. The &lt;a href="w%3ANSA"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; warrantless wiretapping that was authorized by a secret executive order by him was cited as the primary reason for this distinction. 

According to their website: ♡❤"...the Jefferson Muzzles are awarded as a means to draw national attention to abridgments of free speech and press and, at the same time, foster an appreciation for those tenets of the First Amendment."♡❤

The commonly accepted legal use of electric surveillance of U.S. citizens is when the government gets a warrant from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Foreign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Court"&gt;United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court&lt;/a&gt;. The court was established by the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1978. However, the Bush Administration maintains that they are allowed to conduct warrantless eavesdropping under the &lt;a href="w%3AAuthorization%20for%20Use%20of%20Military%20Force%20of%202001"&gt;Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001&lt;/a&gt;. 

♡❤"Our position is that the authorization to use force, which was passed by the Congress in the days following September 11th, constitutes that other authorization, that other statute by Congress, to engage in this kind of signals intelligence,"♡❤ Attorney General &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt; said on December 19, 2005.

Two men charged after the body of a Chinese student was stuffed into a suitcase and thrown into Auckland's harbour on Good Friday would deny their guilt, a court was told today.

One of them appeared in Auckland District Court today to be confronted with the charge of kidnapping a 19-year-old English language student, ransom and murder. The other accused appeared on a charge of hiding evidence for the murder. They have been granted name suppression until their next appearance in court. 

According to lawyers, pleas of not guilty would be entered.

Customers of Vodafone 3G in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; are now able to watch live video news bulletins on their mobiles. This service, offered in corporation with the Prime channel, part of the Sky News network, replaces a service just offering news clips. 

To access the live bulletin, a 3G handset is required and the phone needs to be in a 3G coverage area. At 5:30PM the Sky News streamed channel will automatically broadcast Prime's 'First at 5.30' show until 6PM. To watch the 'live!' mobile tv channels, customers must either pay a flat fee of $2.99 a week for unlimited access, or pay 99 cents for a one-off session lasting fifteen minutes.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; governments plan to send reinforcements to the &lt;a href="w%3ASolomon%20Islands"&gt;Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt; following a written request for help from the Solomon Islands' government.

Violence began yesterday in &lt;a href="w%3AHoniara"&gt;Honiara&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the Solomon Islands, when protestors took to the streets opposing the election by parliament of &lt;a href="w%3ASnyder%20Rini"&gt;Snyder Rini&lt;/a&gt; as the new Prime Minister. The streets of the capital witnessed arson and widespread looting.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;Australian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said "We have a long term commitment to the security of the Solomon Islands and we are absolutely determined that the Solomon Islands will be a stable democratic country and that can only happen if we go the distance."

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;New Zealand Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; said the “situation in Honiara continues to be a cause for concern…Police are still attempting to regain full control and it is clear that the Solomon Islands government needs assistance from its neighbours to restore law and order."

A contingent of 110 Australian soldiers and 80 &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20federal%20police"&gt;Australian federal police&lt;/a&gt; officers left for the islands today. Thirty &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; and twenty five &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Army"&gt;New Zealand Army&lt;/a&gt; personnel will leave on a &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force"&gt;Royal New Zealand Air Force&lt;/a&gt; plane on Thursday morning. 

They will provide extra support to the &lt;a href="w%3ARAMSI"&gt;RAMSI&lt;/a&gt; security force currently based there. The current violence is the worst the capital has seen since Australia, New Zealand and other Pacific governments intervened in 2003 to end years of civil unrest.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Galloway"&gt;George Galloway&lt;/a&gt;, an MP in the British Parliament for Bethnal Green and Bow, has won a court battle allowing him to publish photos of the infamous News of the World "fake sheikh", undercover reporter &lt;a href="w%3AMazher%20Mahmood"&gt;Mazher Mahmood&lt;/a&gt; famed for setting up high-profile figures. George Galloway had a meeting with the reporter after being approached via a contact. Over dinner at the Dorchester hotel, Mazher is said by George Galloway to have asked leading questions over political party funding and to have solicited anti-semitic remarks. George Galloway became ever more suspicious, especially after seeing that the reporter's driver had a 'mouthful of gold teeth', as described in journalist Andrew Marr's book.

After threatening to release a photograph of the reporter, who has in the past tried hard to keep his identity secret, the News of the World sought an injunction against publication, claiming that they feared for his safety, and lost.

In a post on the ♡❤Guardian♡❤ newspaper's ♡❤Comment is Free♡❤ weblog, George Galloway said that Mazher "has crossed the cusp of reputable journalism into seeking to procure criminal acts".

<h1>India sends special envoy to Nepal</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; has decided to send Karan Singh as the Prime Minister's special Envoy to &lt;a href="w%3ANepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;. Singh is scheduled to hold talks with &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Gyanendra"&gt;King Gyanendra&lt;/a&gt; as well as the leaders of the Nepalese pro-democracy movement, in an effort to end the deepening political crisis in that country. 

Nepal has witnessed growing protests against King Gyanendra's decision last year to dismiss the government and assume direct rule. Since then, a seven-party opposition alliance has led nationwide protest demanding that the King immediately hand over power to an all-party government, dismissing King Gyanendra's offer to hold election by April 2007. 

The King is also directing a difficult campaign against a Maoist guerilla movement in the countryside. 

Singh is a senior diplomat and is also related to King Gyanendra by marriage. India's foreign secretary Shyam Saran is also scheduled to accompany the special envoy. India has long expressed concern over the situation in Nepal, calling for a return to representative government. 

Speaking to a television news channel, Singh said "It is not our intention to interfere in the internal affairs of another country but the last thing that we would want is for Nepal to dissolve into chaos because India's vital security interests are involved. Our human interests are involved. There's an open border between Nepal and India and our commitment to parliamentary democracy is there."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Oil%20prices%20surge%20over%20%2475%20a%20barrel%20to%20a%20record%20high&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APetroleum"&gt;Crude oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; prices surged to a new record of over $75.00 a barrel on Tuesday closing at a price of $75.17. In Europe, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20crude"&gt;Brent crude oil&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; rose to $74.59. In less than a month, prices have risen $10, back to the record highs set after &lt;a href="Hurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; caused refineries to shut down in August 2005. Prices are also 42% higher than a year ago.

Political instability in oil-producing countries is seen as a major cause of this rise. The standoff over &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's nuclear program has led to strong words being exchanged and a possibility of sanctions being imposed on Iran, the world's fourth largest producer of oil. Violence in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; earlier this year has led to a drop the country's production by almost a quarter. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil exporter and is also a major supplier of gasoline-rich crude oil to the United States, where demand is set to increase as the "driving season" begins next month. 

Edmund Daukoru, the president of &lt;a href="OPEC"&gt;OPEC&lt;/a&gt; and Nigerian oil minister said on Tuesday, "The current shoot up we are experiencing is as a result of the Iran problems and it's not helped by the flare up between Israel and the Palestinians. But mainly it's the threatening statements being made against Iran as a result of its nuclear program."

<h1>Four Korean women accuse JMS leader Jeong Myeong-seok of rape</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Four%20Korean%20women%20accuse%20JMS%20leader%20Jeong%20Myeong-seok%20of%20rape&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Four South Korean women have accused &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJung%20Myung%20Seok"&gt;Jeong Myeong-seok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hangul: 정명석, Hanja: 鄭明析), the leader of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anew%20religious"&gt;new religious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; organization JMS, of rape.

The four women were crying and wearing hats, sunglasses and mouth masks to cover their faces. Gim Du-hyeong (金度珩), the former leader of EXODUS, accompanied them on the press conference held in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeoul"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

EXODUS is a South Korean non-governmental organization against JMS, formed by former members of JMS. EXODUS had been tracing Jeong Myeong-seok in many nations for many years.

Gim Du-hyeong stated that Jeong Myeong-seok was an instructor for the International Sung-gong Association under &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnification%20Church"&gt;Unification Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to other sources, in March 1980, Jeong left the Unification Church and established ♡❤Ae-Chun Church♡❤. Later, the name changed and the organization reached the world. ♡❤Jesus Morning Star ♡❤(JMS), ♡❤International Christian Association♡❤ (ICA), and ♡❤Global Association Of Culture and Peace♡❤ (GACP), are all closely related organizations.

The organization operates worldwide, primarily on university campuses. There are 240 branches of the church in Korea alone, and there are organizations in almost all universities.

Gim said the major branch of these colorable religious organizations, ♡❤Jesus Morning Star♡❤ (JMS), was named after the acronym of Jeong's romanized name, "JMS". Gim also said Jeong established and exploited the evil dogma of "salvation through intercourse" to rape countless women from Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Malaysia.

Jeong Myeong-seok was born in Wolmyeong-dong in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Chungcheong"&gt;South Chungcheong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Gim said that Wolmyeong-dong was later claimed a sacred place by JMS. And before Jeong fled Korea, he had been living lavishly and promiscuous here.

In September 2001 Jeong Myeong-seok was charged with sexual assault by the Korean government and left the country. In November, the Taiwane version of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANext%20Magazine"&gt;Next Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; covered the story of "Korean cult leader raped over hundred Taiwanese female college students". Members of Exodus soon came to Taiwan and held a press conference with an involved woman in local &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Yuan"&gt;Legislative Yuan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .
Gim said, under heavy critics of Taiwan media, Jeong fled to Hong Kong, and still kept raping Korean women who came to visit him. He was arrested by local Immigration Department in 2003 July, but escaped to Mainland China on his 100,000 USD bail. Jeong was still wanted by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInterpol"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Gim said, since then Jeong have been staying in one of four lavish villas in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnshan"&gt;Anshan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiaoning"&gt;Liaoning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; province.

Gim said, on April 2 He had a group sex with more than 50 women from Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and China. Jang and Gim, two of these women, fell for the invitation of a Taekwondo performance, and were also raped and injured badly in crotch.

The two women escaped on April 4 and tried to take plane back to Korea. Jeong's gang attempted to kidnap them, but they were saved by Chinese police, and returned Korea for treatment on 7.

Then, four other presenters cried out and accused Jeong had sexually violated them in Hong Kong, Malaysia and mainland China. They demand media's effort to prompt international community to bring Jeong to justice.

White House Press Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; announced his resignation on Wednesday, and advisor &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt; has given up his policy-making duties, continuing a series of personnel changes in the administration of U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

"I have given it my all sir and I have given you my all sir, and I will continue to do so as we transition to a new press secretary," said McClellan, who has served as press secretary since July 2003. He is expected to remain on the job until his replacement is named. Among people under consideration to replace McClellan include Fox News anchor Tony Snow, former Treasury spokesman Rob Nichols, and former Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke.

Rove, who was instrumental in managing Bush's two presidential campaigns, will serve as a deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to President Bush, focusing on long term strategic planning, according to CNN, which quoted a senior White House official. Joel Kaplan, the acting deputy budget director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been named to succeed Rove. 

McClellan's departure comes shortly after the resignation of longtime Chief of Staff &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Card"&gt;Andrew Card&lt;/a&gt; and the appointment of &lt;a href="w%3AJosh%20Bolten"&gt;Josh Bolten&lt;/a&gt;, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, as Card's replacement. More personnel changes are expected in the next few weeks.

Bush announced Tuesday that trade representative &lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Portman"&gt;Rob Portman&lt;/a&gt; will assume Bolten's former position as head of the OMB.

Meanwhile, Chancellor &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, widely considered to be the next Labour leader, has been discussing green issues and policies ahead of his trip to the US, where he will deliver speeches at the UN, G7 and IMF. The Liberal Democrat party, who have the longest track record of supporting green policies, haven't been quite as active, with leader &lt;a href="w%3AMenzies%20Campbell"&gt;Ming Campbell&lt;/a&gt; criticised for being slow to give up his 'gas-guzzling' car.

The political wrangling between Labour and the Tories intensified after Labour produced a party political broadcast, shown on tv, which portrayed David Cameron as a chameleon, changing his colours to appeal to his audience but remaining blue underneath. Margaret Beckett MP, Labour's Environment Secretary, accused Cameron of a 'flip-flop', criticising him for voting against the Cleaner Neighbourhoods and Environment Act. The Liberal Democrats suggested that Cameron is merely 'posturing' and said the government has done nothing on issues like aviation emissions.

The Green Party, which has no MPs but has MEPs and London Assembly members, said that Cameron "gave tokenism a bad name" and was fooling no-one. Green Party speaker Keith Taylor attacked Cameron's record on actual green policies, contrasting his rhetoric of the environment being a "top priority" with his support for airport expansion and road-building.

Cameron has also hinted that he is unsure about the idea of building new nuclear power stations, which the Tories have long supported. Blair still claiming not to have decided on the issue either, the political debate on this issue is yet to get really started.

Just before 5 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_Daylight_Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (0900 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) on Thursday, &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;Ontario Provincial Police&lt;/a&gt; officers armed with guns, tasers, tear gas, and pepper spray stormed the area that dozens of &lt;a href="w%3AIroquois"&gt;Six Nations&lt;/a&gt; protesters have &lt;a href="Still_no_action_in_standoff_in_Ontario_town"&gt;occupied for the past 52 days&lt;/a&gt;.

"People were pepper sprayed...another man was shot in the back with a Taser and we were told more police officers would be coming back," said protester Hazel Hill.

"The police just completely swarmed the territory," said protester Mike Desroches, adding that the officers entered with guns drawn. No shots were fired.

"They swarmed every which way, I couldn't even hazard a guess how many cops," said another man, Clyde Powless. The protesters have been unarmed since the beginning of the occupation, although a police statement said some officers needed medical attention for injuries sustained "while confronted by the protesters with […] axes, crowbars, rocks and a various assortment of make-shift batons".

OPP Deputy Commissioner Maurice Pilon confirmed that 16 people were arrested before protesters called in reinforcements that caused police to retreat. A spokeswoman for the protesters, Janie Jamieson, made it clear that the confrontation was not over. "We're prepared ... for however long it takes," she said.

Protesters started a huge tire fire to block the road in an attempt to prevent a further incursion by the police. A dump truck was also stopped astride the road and roadblocks set up to prevent the passage of traffic.

Protesters expect more natives to support them in the near future.

A man and a woman were lynched and burned to death by a furious &lt;a href="w%3AGuatemalan"&gt;Guatemalan&lt;/a&gt; mob who attacked them. Around 800 people snatched the couple from a jail in a village, 25 miles southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AGuatemala%20City"&gt;Guatemala City&lt;/a&gt;, where they were being held for attempting to kidnap a 7-year-old boy. 

A police spokeman said, "The people […] took them out of the jail, beat them until they were unconscious, and then burned them with gasoline before anyone could intervene". 

In the past, many crimes have been committed in Guatemala by mobs and local criminals. In &lt;a href="w%3A2000"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; tourist and a Guatemalan bus driver were killed after being attacked by a mob who thought they were there to kidnap children. Lynch mobs have killed about 360 people in the impoverished and crime-ridden Guatemala since 1996, when it emerged from a 36-year civil war that killed about 200,000 people, mostly &lt;a href="w%3AMayan"&gt;Mayan&lt;/a&gt; peasants.

&lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Rep.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Dennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt; (D-OH) claimed in a letter to President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; on April 18, 2006 that the US seems to be supporting both the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParty%20for%20a%20Free%20Life%20in%20Kurdistan"&gt;Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (PEJAK), an armed group associated with the &lt;a href="Kurdistan%20Workers%20Party"&gt;Kurdistan Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; (PKK) and based in Iraq, and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Mujahedin%20of%20Iran%23Alleged%20MEK%20Activity%20In%20Iran"&gt;People's Mujahedin of Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MEK) in insurgent activity in Iran during 2005 and in particular in killing twenty four Iranian soldiers in March 2006.

Both the PKK and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Mujahedin%20of%20Iran"&gt;MEK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are listed by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20State%20Department"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and by the &lt;a href="Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union"&gt;Council of the European Union&lt;/a&gt; as terrorist organizations. The &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; alleges that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Council%20of%20Resistance%20of%20Iran"&gt;National Council of Resistance of Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is "an integral part of the MEK", i.e. essentially the same organisation as the MEK, while the NCRI itself claims that the MEK is just one of five components of the NCRI.

Kucinich compared the alleged US support for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainsurgency"&gt;insurgents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against the government of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; with Bush's previous criticisms against insurgent groups, writing to Bush, "U.S. support for insurgent activity in Iran is not tolerable. You have claimed numerous times that the object of the so-called '&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terrorism"&gt;War on Terror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' is to target lawless insurgent groups."

Kucinich asked Bush to report to Congress both on US military operations in Iranian territory and on US use of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aproxy%20war"&gt;proxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; organisations in military actions against the Iranian government, stating, "Previously I asked you to immediately report to Congress on the extent of U.S. military operations currently in Iran. Now, in light of the evidence described above, I urge you to report to Congress on U.S. support for military operations in Iran by anti-Iranian insurgent groups."

Bush's response is not yet known.

<h1>Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II turns 80</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Her%20Majesty%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II%20turns%2080&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today marks the 80th birthday of &lt;a href="w%3AHer%20Majesty%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II"&gt;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;, whose reign has lasted over 54 years.

Her Majesty became the first female to become the sovereign since &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Victoria"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, who died in 1901 after a 64-year reign.

She was crowned on June 2, 1953, in &lt;a href="w%3AWestminster%20Abbey"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first coronation that was televised live. She is Queen of sixteen independent nations known as the &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Realms"&gt;Commonwealth Realms&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

One of the most peculiar incidents of her reign was when &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Fagan"&gt;Michael Fagan&lt;/a&gt; broke into &lt;a href="w%3ABuckingham%20Palace"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt; and entered the Queen's bedchamber in the early hours of July 9, 1982.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMonarchist%20League%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Monarchist League of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, said in a press release: “there is scarcely a single public figure who can compare with The Queen. She is universally admired and respected for her professionalism, dignity and example.”

Despite her age, royal watchers say Her Majesty will never abdicate. If Her Majesty is reigning on September 9, 2015, she will become the longest reigning monarch in British history.

Cries of “God save the Queen!” have been said across the &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20of%20Nations"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; today.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, an earthquake struck at 23:25:05 UTC April 20 (local time 12:25:05 April 21) on the &lt;a href="w%3AKamchatka"&gt;Kamchatka&lt;/a&gt; peninsula in &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3Ahypocenter"&gt;hypocenter&lt;/a&gt; of the quake was located at 61.092° N 167.100° E at a depth of 43&amp;nbsp;km. According to the Japanese Meteorological Agency and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, there was no danger of a &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;.

According to wire reports, damage has been reported in several villages in Russia. The Associated Press reports via local reports that public facilities in the village of Telichiki near the seashore have been damaged and that transmission of electrical power has been affected. CNN reports that the population of the village is 2,000.

In an address to the nation, the king of Nepal, Gyanendra said that he was turning the nation pro-democratic.

"We are committed to multi-party democracy and a constitutional monarchy. Executive power of the kingdom of Nepal, which was in our safekeeping, shall from this day be returned to the people. We hope peace and order is restored to the country by protecting multi-party democracy. We ask the seven-party alliance to recommend the name for the post of prime minister at the earliest," said the king in his address to the nation today.

Girija Prasad Koirala, the former Prime Minister of Nepal and leader of the opposition alliance said he will meet and discuss the announcement made by the king, before responding.

Earlier, United States Ambassador James Moriarty, had said that "his [the king's] time is running out" and that "ultimately the king will have to leave if he doesn't compromise. And by 'ultimately' I mean sooner rather than later."

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

President &lt;a href="w%3AOlusegun%20Obasanjo"&gt;Olusegun Obasanjo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; announced that Nigeria will complete repayment of all debt owed to the &lt;a href="w%3AParis%20Club"&gt;Paris Club&lt;/a&gt; of creditors by Friday. The Director General of the Debt Management Office (DMO), Mansur Muhtar confirmed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would transfer $4.5 billion to the recipient countries on Friday.

The Paris Club is an informal group of creditor governments from major industrialized countries. Under the terms of an agreement signed last year, Nigeria will pay $12.4 billion in exchange for a 
debt cancellation of an estimated $18 billion, representing about 60% of the $30 billion Nigeria owed the Paris Club creditors. The agreement is the biggest debt relief deal for an African nation. 

Nigeria, Africa's largest producer of oil, has used "windfall" earnings from the prevailing high oil prices in making these payments. 

The Paris Club agreement was negotiated in October 2005, with the Nigerian delegation headed by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the minister of finance. The deal is part of the free-market reforms pursued by President Obasanjo. 

The announcement comes in the wake of the endorsement of the reform programme by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which marks the last step for the debt relief deal to be completed. Nigeria is the first country to qualify for the IMF's Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which provides assessment and endorsement of a country's economic policy by the IMF, for those countries that do not require fund assistance. 

Speaking before the commencement of the Federal Executive Council meeting at the Council Chambers, State House, President Obasanjo said, "By Friday, April 21, we would have cleared ourselves of all debts owed to Paris Club." He also added, "Considering the outstanding debts to the London Club and those owed internally, we are not out of the woods yet."

This week, the &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Broadcasting%20Service"&gt;Public Broadcasting Service&lt;/a&gt; aired a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANOVA_%2528TV_series%2529"&gt;NOVA&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ program titled “Dimming the Earth”, which presented research by leading scientists on the complex systems of our global climate and human activity's effect on it. One of the largest interactions (or "inputs") humans have with the atmosphere is the ever-increasing use of &lt;a href="w%3AFossil_fuel"&gt;fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;. Consumption has risen 2% per year for this decade.

Fossil fuels burnt in factories and automobiles send their waste into our atmosphere in two forms. The first is &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon_dioxide"&gt;CO&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse_gas"&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt;, which have received substantial attention in the last few years because of the way they trap heat in the atmosphere. The second is the tiny particles of sulfur dioxide, soot and ash, which scientists call &lt;a href="w%3AParticulate"&gt;aerosols&lt;/a&gt; (basically smog). Research into understanding the negative health effects of air pollution has resulted in the development of &lt;a href="w%3Acatalytic%20converter"&gt;catalytic converter&lt;/a&gt;s for cars as well as devices to remove particulate solids from industrial waste before it reaches the air. 

More recently, atmospheric scientists have come upon the phenomenon of the reduction of direct sunlight reaching Earth's surface&amp;mdash; observing a nearly a 5% decline between 1960 and 1990, with evidence of a recovery since then. This has been dubbed the "&lt;a href="w%3AGlobal_dimming"&gt;global dimming&lt;/a&gt;" effect, and is probably due to the way these aerosols act upon clouds. It is important to realise that this does ♡❤♡not♡❤♡ represent a net loss of this much sunshine to the climate system - if so, large temperature declines would have been observed. Instead, the sunshine is absorbed elsewhere in the system, with a much smaller net loss.
&lt;a href="w%3ACloud"&gt;Clouds&lt;/a&gt; form when moisture gathers around airborne particles, such as pollen or dust. Clouds formed by the aerosol particles emitted by fossil fuel consumption are made of many more tiny droplets than "natural" clouds. These smog-created clouds have two notable effects: they shield sunlight from reaching Earth's surface and, due to water's reflective nature, the millions of tiny droplets suspended in them reflect light back into space, allowing even less light to reach Earth.

Many scientists now believe that global dimming caused by these pollutants has mitigated the temperature rises brought about by &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal_warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;. Over the last thirty years, Earth's temperature has increased by about 0.5 oC.

In the absence of global dimming, however, the Earth might be 0.3 oC warmer than it currently is, suggesting that a "tug-of-war" exists between greenhouse gases and particulates released by burning fossil fuels. Efforts to mitigate the human health dangers of smog have allowed more heat into our atmosphere and brought about a sharper increase in global warming.

Dr. James E. Hansen, professor at Columbia University and the head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies &lt;a href="http%3A//www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, believes that if we continue on our current pattern, this warming could be as much as five degrees in the next thirty years and ten to fourteen degrees over the course of the century. Such a temperature rise would devastate life on Earth, likely bringing on a cascade of self-reinforcing warming effects. Earth's forests drying and burning, a steady thawing of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreenland"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APolar_ice_cap"&gt;arctic ice sheets&lt;/a&gt;, and, most dangerous of all, a release of the &lt;a href="w%3AMethane_clathrate"&gt;methane hydrates&lt;/a&gt; that are now frozen at the bottom of the oceans, could remake the planet into something inhospitable to human life. Dr. Hansen warns that, according to his research, man has just 10 years to reduce greenhouse gases before global warming and other responses to human activity by Earth's climate reach a "tipping point", becoming unstoppable.

A &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabian&lt;/a&gt; man named Abu Marwan al-Suri, 38, suspected of being a senior &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; "bag man", was killed in a shootout on Thursday, according to the Pakistan army spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan. It is believed he has been killed at a checkpoint in Khar, a town in the tribal district of &lt;a href="w%3ABajaur"&gt;Bajaur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, when he opened fire on security officials from inside a car. According to Sultan, al-Suri opened fire when asked to stop his car. Al-Suri wounded two people and killed one Pakistani security official.

"His death is quite a significant blow to al-Qaeda," said officials. 

Al-Suri is believed to be one of several senior al-Qaeda officials targeted in a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; lead airstrike in January in the Damadola village of Bajaur, Pakistan against &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;, which killed at least 18 civilians and several militants. Zawahiri was not killed in the strike. Suri was also believed to be giving money to the families of Iraqi militant leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as well as other militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Al-Suri is also believed to have been a close associate of Zawahiri.

"He was giving them money every three months," said officials.

Pakistani officials say they have his body and that it will be examined to determine its true identity at a hospital in the city of &lt;a href="w%3APeshawar"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt;.

Officials also say a notebook with instructions in Arabic on making bombs and explosive devices was found with al-Suri. The notebook also contained diagrams and drawings of circuits.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWang%20Wenyi"&gt;Wang Wenyi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was seen on television heckling &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; President &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; during his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; appearance this week, was formally charged in a United States federal court for the misdemeanor of willfully intimidating, coercing, threatening, and harassing a foreign official. 

According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Secret%20Service"&gt;Secret Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Wang Wenyi gained press credentials for working with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFalun%20Gong"&gt;Falun Gong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -run newspaper ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Epoch%20Times"&gt;The Epoch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. She then stood on a camera stand and shouted in Chinese: "Stop oppressing the Falun Gong," as well as "Your time is running out," and "Anything you have done will come back to you in this lifetime." She also shouted in English, "President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , stop him from persecuting the Falun Gong." The Falun Gong is a religious group who is currently being persecuted in China for unconventional beliefs.

Wang Wenyi was then "escorted" by the Secret Service away from the South Lawn where the appearance was taking place. Over 35 supporters attended Wang's arraignment on Friday. If she is convicted, she could receive up to six months in jail and a &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;5,000 fine.

This is the 47-year-old Wenyi's second incident in five years involving protest of a Chinese leader. July 2001, she confronted then-President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJiang%20Zemin"&gt;Jiang Zemin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during a tour of Malta. According to Wang, she introduced herself to Jiang and then urged him "to stop the killing of Falun Gong practitioners in China." Security officials dragged her away, but Jiang called her back and spoke to her in Chinese saying that the "Falun Gong practitioners were killing themselves."

Wenyi's court-appointed lawyer, David Bos, challenged the criminal charge on the basis of &lt;a href="free%20speech"&gt;free-speech&lt;/a&gt;.

"It's making the First Amendment rights of all Americans just evaporate," he said, while he said Wang's remarks were "relatively innocuous."

The first amendment to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20constitution"&gt;U.S. constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; states; "♡❤Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech♡❤ ... (or the freedom)♡❤ to petition the Government for a redress of grievances♡❤." 

Hu is in the U.S. for a weeklong conference with President Bush.

&lt;a href="w%3APramod%20Mahajan"&gt;Pramod Mahajan&lt;/a&gt;, the general secretary of &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s main opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3ABharatiya%20Janata%20Party"&gt;Bharatiya Janata Party&lt;/a&gt;, was shot in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. The attack occurred at Mahajan's residence at around 6:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Standard%20Time"&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt; (0100 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). 

There are few details available at this time, however sources say Mahajan was shot three times at close range by his brother Praveen Mahajan, allegedly over a property dispute. Praveen later surrendered at the Worli Police Station. His lawyer Nandkumar Rajukar claimed that he was depressed and suffering from some mental trauma. 

Pramod Mahajan was rushed to the nearby Hinduja Hospital, where he is currently being operated upon for a serious injury to his liver. A senior surgeon at the hospital stated that Mr. Mahajan was still in critical condition and that the next 72 hours would be "crucial". Three bullets are still lodged in his body and doctors are finding it difficult to extract them. There is talk of using the help of doctors from the armed forces, who have better experience in treating bullet injuries. Mr. Mahajan's liver was severely injured in the incident, leading to massive blood loss. Doctors say that he is currently on a ventilator and that the bullets cannot be removed for fear of causing even more bleeding.

Praveen Mahajan has been booked under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code that deals with attempt to murder. He underwent a psychological examination, which indicated that he was mentally stable.

Senior politicians from across India are arriving in Mumbai to offer their support to the popular leader. The Prime Minister of India &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt;, speaker of the Indian &lt;a href="w%3ALok%20Sabha"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt; Somnath Chatterjee and the President of India &lt;a href="w%3AA%20P%20J%20Abdul%20Kalam"&gt;A P J Abdul Kalam&lt;/a&gt; have expressed shock over the attack.

A senior &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n air force commander has claimed that new, upgraded bomber aircraft were unchallenged by US air defense systems when they penetrated a radar zone near the Canadian coast in US territory during an April training exercise, reports the Russian news agency &lt;a href="w%3ARIA%20Novosti"&gt;RIA Novosti&lt;/a&gt;. 

Commander of Russia's long-range strategic bombers, Lieutenant General Igor Khvorov said that the bombers successfully carried out four mock Tu-95MS cruise missile launches, 200 mock bombings, and 53 mock sorties during the exercise. The RIA Novosti reported that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; is currently investigating how the Tu-160's escaped detection. 

Lieutenant General Igor Khvorov said, "They were unable to detect the planes either with radars or visually."
Khvorov denies any link of the tests to the current US-Iranian tension, saying, "Of course, our exercises did not have anything to do with the situation in Iran, but their organization indirectly echoed in that region."

The Tupolev Tu-160 is a strategic bomber introduced in 1987. It resembles the North American &lt;a href="w%3AB-1B%20Lancer"&gt;B-1B Lancer&lt;/a&gt;, but is larger and faster, being powered by four NK-32 afterburning turbofans, the largest in any combat aircraft. It is not considered to be a stealth aircraft due to its exposed engine inlets and broad wing gloves.

According to Khvorov over the course of this year, two additional Tu-160s will be commissioned for the long-range strategic bomber fleet with the numerous upgrades, including the ability to launch cruise missiles, aviation bombs, and satellite communication.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

In the first meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i parliament since general elections were held four months ago, &lt;a href="w%3AJawad%20al-Maliki"&gt;Jawad al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Al%27Dawa%20Party"&gt;Islamic Al'Dawa Party&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Shiite-led &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Iraqi%20Alliance"&gt;United Iraqi Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, has been named prime minister-designate of Iraq by President &lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt;. He will replace interim Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20al-Jaafari"&gt;Ibrahim al-Jaafari&lt;/a&gt;, whose candidacy for the permanent position led to an impasse in negotiations to form a national unity government.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AAdnan%20Pachachi"&gt;Adnan Pachachi&lt;/a&gt;, acting parliament speaker, al-Maliki has one month to present his list of cabinet minister to Parliament for approval. Should al-Maliki's Cabinet fail to win support, someone else will be asked to form a government.

Also elected during the initial meeting was &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; politician Mahmoud al-Mashhadani as the speaker of the Council of Representatives. Khalid al-Attiya, a &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt;, and Aref Tayfour, a &lt;a href="w%3AKurd"&gt;Kurd&lt;/a&gt; will serve as deputies. Talabani was also re-elected as Iraqi president during the meeting.

Al-Maliki called on the formation of a national unity government "to eradicate injustice that the Iraqis have suffered." "We will work as one family to lead the political process, not based on our differences, sects or parties," al-Maliki said.

Reaction has been mostly positive so far. Sunni leader Tariq al-Hashimi of the Iraqi Islamic Party pledged to work with al-Maliki, and to "work together in order to form a unity government." 

Kurdish leaders have not commented thus far, but independent Kurdish politician Mahmoud Othman was said to have welcomed al-Maliki's nomination. U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza_Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; also welcomed al-Maliki's nomination as an "important milestone" for the Iraqis.

Sunnis, Kurds, and secularists have opposed al-Jaafari's renomination, citing weak leadership and sectarian strife.

Thailand's three southernmost provinces have been the centre of an insurgent campaign that has left over 1000 dead in the last two years. The predominantly &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; region overwhelmingly rejected the &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party candidates who stood unopposed in the April 2 general election forcing by-elections in an effort to fill the country's lower house of parliament before it is due to reconvene on May 2. Rules laid out in the country's constitution require that any candidate standing unopposed must receive votes from 20% of the eligible electorate to be elected. With the major opposition parties continuing their election boycott, these is some doubt if the full compliment of 500 MPs will be elected by the May 2 deadline.

According to the Thai News Agency, there are by-elections in 40 constituencies spread over 17 provinces, despite voting being compulsory, turnout is expected to be low as this is the third set of elections since the start of the month.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Nagin%2C%20Landrieu%20advance%20to%20runoff%20in%20New%20Orleans%20mayoral%20election&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Nagin"&gt;Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt; and Louisiana Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3AMitch%20Landrieu"&gt;Mitch Landrieu&lt;/a&gt; will most likely face each other in a May 20 runoff election for mayor of New Orleans.

With all 442 precincts reporting from elections on Saturday, Nagin has reportedly received 41,489 votes (38%), leading all candidates but falling short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff. Landrieu received 31,499 votes (29%); &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Forman"&gt;Ron Forman&lt;/a&gt;, 18,734 votes (17%). All three are Democrats.

Nagin, 49, was first elected in 2002 on a platform of fighting government corruption, but he has since become better known for leading the recovery effort in New Orleans after &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, he has come under criticism for certain remarks, such as asserting that New Orleans would remain a "chocolate city" with an African-American majority.

Nagin said that he was "humbled by the support from this community," and called on New Orleanians to "bring this city together ... it's time for black and white, Hispanic and Asian, everybody to come together for one New Orleans. It's time for us to stop the bickering."

Landrieu, 45, brother of U.S. Senator &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Landrieu"&gt;Mary Landrieu&lt;/a&gt; (D-LA) and son of former New Orleans mayor Moon Landrieu, said, "Tonight, we take the second step on this journey back home, and I ask all New Orleanians to join with me in this march as we proclaim to America that New Orleans will be rebuilt."

Forman pledged to "work day and night with either Mitch or Ray to rebuild this city."

A special challenge in this election was bringing together New Orleans residents displaced by the catastrophic flooding in the aftermath of Katrina. It is estimated that nearly six out of every ten residents still registered to vote in New Orleans live outside the city. 

Polling was held at 76 polling stations (compared with 262 four years ago) and ten satellite stations were opened throughout the state for absentee voting. Civil rights groups challenged the plan, and instead advocated for polling stations to be setup in Houston and Atlanta where many displaced residents now live. State officials and federal courts rejected the plan, citing legal questions.

Major distributors of the operating system &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; have agreed on a new standard that includes common elements for desktop software, in a move to make Linux a more effective competitor to Microsoft Windows.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Standards%20Group"&gt;Free Standards Group&lt;/a&gt; (FSG) will unveil the &lt;a href="w%3ALinux%20Standard%20Base"&gt;Linux Standard Base&lt;/a&gt; (LSB) 3.1 on Tuesday at the Desktop Linux Summit in San Diego. The first distribution to include LSB 3.1 support, Xandros, is expected to be released on May 1, followed shortly by versions by Red Hat, Novell, and others. The status of Ubuntu's upcoming version is still unclear &lt;a href="http%3A//www.linux-watch.com/news/NS8432548714.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The standards aim to resolve difficulties that programmers face in developing software for Linux. Because Linux, developed by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds, defines the kernel or core of the operating system, there is a wide variety of graphical interfaces for it and differing software libraries. LSB 3.1 standardizes core pieces of Linux to make development easier.

"One of the big things that's difficult is consistency, and that's Windows' biggest strength," Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Free Standards Group, told the Associated Press. "If you buy a Windows program, you know it will run on a Windows computer, and Linux needs to work the same way. [...] If you really want to become a broadly adopted and used technology, you have to have that degree of standardization," he said.

"Schumi" won the pole position at the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;San Marino Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;. The pole position was the 66th for Schumacher. &lt;a href="w%3AAyrton%20Senna"&gt;Ayrton Senna&lt;/a&gt; held the previous record. Senna won his F1-career 65 pole positions between years 1984-1994. Schumacher has been racing in the F1-series since 1991. Senna won 40% of his pole attempts (161 races) compared to Schumacher's 28% (235 races so far). This new pole record reawakened the affection for Senna who died in 1994 on the fifth lap at the same race, the San Marino Grand Prix, a race won by Schumacher who was also champion the same year.

&lt;a href="w%3AAljazeera"&gt;Aljazeera&lt;/a&gt; has aired a new audiotape it says contains the voice of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda's&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;. The tape is 11 minutes and 26 seconds long, believed to have been made after March 14, 2006.

According to Aljazeera, in the tape, Bin Laden talks about the "situation in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;" and says that the isolation of the Hamas-led Palestine is a "war by crusaders and Zionists against Islam."

"I say that this war is the joint responsibility of the people and the governments. While the war continues, the people renew their allegiance to their rulers and politicians and continue to send their sons to our countries to fight us. The war goes on and the people are renewing their allegiance to its rulers and masters. They send their sons to armies to fight us and they continue their financial and moral support while our countries are burned and our houses are bombed and our people are killed," said bin Laden.

"The blockade which the West is imposing on the government of Hamas proves that there is a Zionist crusaders war on Islam. I have sworn to only live free. Even if I find bitter the taste of death, I don't want to die humiliated or deceived. The war is a responsibility shared between the people and the governments. They do not want a truce unless it is from our side only. They insist on continuing their crusader campaign against our nation and to loot our wealth," he added.

Bin Laden also talked about Sudan saying, "I call on mujahedeen and their supporters, especially in Sudan and the Arab peninsula, to prepare for long war again the crusader plunderers in Western Sudan. Our goal is not defending the Khartoum government but to defend Islam, its land and its people. The politicians of the West do not want dialogue except for the sake of dialogue to drag us on, for them to gain more time. They want an armistice that is observed only by us."

The United States has since said that they believe the tape is authentic.

"We just heard from the intelligence community that they believe it's authentic," said &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt;, spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;.

"We are continuing to take the fight to the enemy abroad and making it difficult for them to plan and plot against Americans. The al Qaeda leadership is on the run and under a lot of pressure. We continue to take all terrorist threats seriously and that is why we are acting on all fronts doing everything within our power to prevail in the war on terrorism," added McClellan.

Aljazeera last aired an audiotape in January by bin Laden, where he promised new terrorist attacks in the U.S. but also offered the U.S. a "long-term truce."

The government of &lt;a href="w%3APeru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; declared a state of emergency in the vicinity of the &lt;a href="w%3AUbinas"&gt;Ubinas&lt;/a&gt; volcano on Saturday as it began to spew out ash and smoke over a 6km area, indicating a possible eruption in the near future. The civil defense institute has recommended the total evacuation of the 3,500 residents of the district of Ubinas.

The Peruvian military has been ordered to aid in the evacuation of civilians from the area. Aid shipments of tents, water and powdered milk are being sent to the affected area.

Those who decided to evacuate were brought to the town of Querapi by bus. Others who reside near the volcano chose to stay behind to protect their livestock and belongings. 

No human deaths have been reported so far, but llamas and alpacas have died after eating grass contaminated by volcanic pollutants. People have reported eye and breathing problems following exposure to the acid-laden ash and smoke. 

The 18700-ft. high Ubinas is Peru's most active volcano, with 23 eruptions recorded since 1550. The current activity follows a 40-year dormant period. Scientists at the Institute of Geophysics have warned that a dome of incandescent lava appears to be building up in the volcanic crater.

<h1>By-elections fail to provide way out of Thai political crisis</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=By-elections%20fail%20to%20provide%20way%20out%20of%20Thai%20political%20crisis&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

With the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;Bangkok Post&lt;/a&gt; reporting indications that 14 unopposed candidates failed to meet the requirement of receiving votes from 20% of eligible citizens, &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; Constitutional court may be asked to consider breaching the constitution and convening the new parliamentary session without &lt;a href="w%3Aquorum"&gt;quorum&lt;/a&gt;.

The April 2 general election saw caretaker Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra's&lt;/a&gt; populist &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; (lit: ♡❤Thais love Thais♡❤, or ♡❤Thai Unity♡❤) party win the controversial election, but a significant boycott and use of the abstention option on ballot forms forced Thaksin to announce he will not assume the post of PM in the parliament's next session. The three main opposition parties had refused to participate in the snap election leading to a significant number of constituencies where TRT stood unopposed. Over 40 candidates failed to meet the 20%-of-eligible-voters requirement forcing yesterday's by-elections.

Thailand's snap election was the PM's response to ongoing demonstrations and accusations of malfeasance, particularly in relation to his family's sale of their interest in &lt;a href="w%3AShin%20Corporation"&gt;Shin Corp&lt;/a&gt;, a major Thai company, to &lt;a href="w%3ATemasek%20Holdings"&gt;Temasek Holdings&lt;/a&gt; which is described by Wikipedia as "the investment arm of the &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; government." The mass rallies that ensued, organised by the self-styled People's Alliance for Democracy, and the mainstream opposition boycott damaged the PM's attempt to use an election to renew his mandate.

&lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Mswati%20III"&gt;King Mswati III&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href="w%3ASwaziland"&gt;Swaziland&lt;/a&gt; has said that political parties are no longer banned under the country's new constitution that came into force in February. 

King Mswati III is the absolute monarch of Swaziland, a small landlocked country in southern Africa. Mswati’s father, King Sobhuza II, banned political parties in 1973. A new constitution was brought into effect by royal decree in February by King Mswati, which proclaimed the right to freedom of association and freedom of speech but did not explicitly lift the ban on political parties. 

In an interview with the news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP), King Mswati said, "The old constitution had actually written that we banned political parties but these days when you read our new constitution, our new constitution allows the freedom of rights." He added, "There is nothing which says we ban parties."

This week marks the 20th year of Mswati's ascention to the throne. He has been criticised for his lavish lifestyle, while ruling over a country struggling with unemployment, poverty and the world's highest HIV infection rates. A pro-democracy movement has been active in the country since its independence from British colonial rule. In the last few months, there have also been firebombings of government offices and official residences, and members of a banned pro-democracy group, the People's United Democratic Movement have been arrested on treason charges. 

In the AFP interview, the King also spoke against using violence to bring about change in the country, and said that "doors are wide open" to those who wanted to convey a message. He also expressed hope of international assistance in overcoming the challenges facing the country.

At the start of the tournament, 19-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Nadal"&gt;Rafael Nadal&lt;/a&gt; of Spain was seeded as the second favourite to take the &lt;a href="w%3AMonte%20Carlo%20Masters"&gt;Monte Carlo Masters&lt;/a&gt; clay court title, ranked only behind the current world number one, 25-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Federer"&gt;Roger Federer&lt;/a&gt; of Switzerland. 
The finals match-up in question, the first where the number 1 and 2 seeds faced each other since 1985, was won in four sets; 6-2, 6-7, 6-3, 7-6, ending in just eleven minutes short of four hours.

As the lengthy matchtime suggests, the action on the court was a see-saw battle with both players looking as though they would go on to win at different points of the match. At times, it was difficult to see who was the more experienced. Nadal, the more successful of the two on a clay tennis surface, played to Roger Federer's weakness. Roger Federer didn't give up without a fight, but his best, which is capable of beating ♡❤anybody♡❤ on his day, seemed to remain in the locker room as Roger Federer's aggression came a rare second to Nadal's accurate baseline style.

Nadal wins the Monte Carlo Masters for a second consecutive time. Nadal can celebrate his unexpected but much welcomed victory in Monaco, if only for a little while ahead of the next tournament in the clay court series.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20India"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; has said that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAligarh%20Muslim%20University"&gt;Aligarh Muslim University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (AMU) will remain a minority institution and that its character will not change, but refused to stay, till the pendency of the matter, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAllahabad"&gt;Allahabad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; High Court’s verdict striking down the 50% quota for students belonging to the minority community. Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AK.%20G.%20Balakrishnan"&gt;K. G. Balakrishnan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; headed the bench. The next hearing will be on May 10, 2006.

The court referred the matter to the chief justice for allocating it to a larger bench. The Aligarh Muslim University hailed the SC's interim order on the institution's minority character as a "major victory" and said the issue of granting 50% reservation to Muslims would be held in abeyance till a final verdict. 

Earlier this month, AMU had moved the Supreme Court challenging the Allahabad High Court's verdict, which had put down the minority status of the institution. The appeal to Supreme Court challenging the High Court verdict that AMU was not a minority institution entitled to protection under Article 30 (1) of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20India"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The Allahabad High Court on January 5 had struck down the provision of the Aligarh Muslim University Amendment Act, 1981, by which the status of a minority institution was accorded to AMU. It had also quashed the 50 per cent quotas for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; students. By doing so, it had upheld its last year's judgement, terming as unconstitutional the minority status of the university and 50 per cent reservation for the Muslim students . The division bench referred to the SC judgement in the Ajeez Basha case of 1968, which had already taken the view that AMU was not a minority institution and any enactment of a law by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20India"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could not overrule the judgement.

<h1>112 year old joke fools political activists and the Associated Press</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=112%20year%20old%20joke%20fools%20political%20activists%20and%20the%20Associated%20Press&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Friday April 21, 2006 Associated Press released a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.startribune.com/587/story/385482.html"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; which has been reprinted in many newspapers throughout the United States. The article prints as factual several false and historically inaccurate assertions by Reverend Patterson, a Native Hawaiian sovereignty activist, who seems to have taken a 112 year old joke seriously. 

The direct falsehood reported as fact by Associated Press (not merely attributed to Reverend Patterson), and which Reverend Patterson uses as a basis for his April 30, 2006 "national day of prayer for Hawaiian natives", is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;♡❤♡"...it was Cleveland as president who set aside April 30, 1894 as a day of prayer and repentance over the U.S. role in the Hawaiian monarchy's overthrow."♡❤♡&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fake proclamation attributed to President Grover Cleveland, was allegedly printed in the New York Sun February 26, 1894, and has been reported as real on several Hawaiian sovereignty websites; cited as real by Rev. Kaleo Patterson; and now reported as real by Associated Press in many newspapers.

The misunderstanding regarding this joke proclamation started with Helena G. Allen, in her book "The Betrayal of Liliuokalani", pp. 314-315, which provided the text of that proclamation. She did so in the context of discussing the constitution of the Republic of Hawai`i, despite the fact that the date on the proclamation was 4 months before a constitution was produced for the Republic of Hawaii. She wrote:

Helena Allen cited its publication in the New York Sun, February 26, 1894. Allen does not say who arranged for the newspaper publication of this joke proclamation. She strongly implies it was Cleveland who actually authored the proclamation to show contempt for the revolutionary Hawai`i government headed by President Sanford B. Dole. 

But that interpretation is doubtful for a number of reasons. As a joke, it hardly seems very funny for Cleveland to be calling an officer of the government of the United States (John Stevens) "the devil." The description of the Provisional Government as a "miserable herd of missionaries" also doesn't come across as very humorous, since this was a government with which he had continuing diplomatic relations. The whole tone and tenor of the proclamation make President Cleveland seem emotional, irrational, insulting and arrogant.

A more likely interpretation is that the joke was at the expense of President Cleveland -- his political opponents were poking fun at the zealousness of Grover Cleveland's continuing support for a deposed queen regarded by many as corrupt. The U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs published the Morgan Report the same day the joke proclamation was allegedly printed in the New York Sun. Washington politicians (including President Cleveland) had seen the Morgan Report beforehand, and knew the date it would be published. They knew the report would clear the U.S. of any wrongdoing in the overthrow of the monarchy, and support the legitimacy of the revolutionary Dole government. They knew the Morgan Report would severely criticize the royalist regime, and repudiate the Blount Report that Cleveland had orchestrated for the purpose of justifying his attempt to destabilize the Provisional Government and restore his friend Liliuokalani to the throne. Cleveland's enemies may have published the joke proclamation to poke fun at him.

Regardless whether the joke proclamation was Cleveland's own expression of contempt for the Dole regime, or whether it was Cleveland's opponents' expression of contempt for the Cleveland regime -- either way, we know for sure that it was only a joke. The proclamation was never issued in any official way. It is not included in Cleveland's &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gutenberg.org/etext/14137"&gt;presidential messages and papers&lt;/a&gt;. The fake proclamation was apparently published in only one newspaper. 

President Grover Cleveland was a friend of Liliuokalani and was very aggressive in blocking annexation. During his first week in office he withdrew from the Senate a treaty of annexation proposed by the Hawai`i Provisional Government that had been approved by U.S. President Harrison; and he sent James Blount to Hawai`i. Blount went to Hawai`i, without Senate confirmation or even notification, as paramount minister plenipotentiary under secret orders. His actions while there seemed to imply a mission to destabilize the revolutionary government and to produce a report that would derail efforts in Congress to accept Hawai`i's offer of annexation. Blount took actions, which seemed to encourage a royalist counterrevolution, and wrote a report portraying the
overthrow of the monarchy as planned and supported by the U.S. rather than by local revolutionaries. Blount intervened to sabotage negotiations whereby Liliuokalani offered Dole that she would give up all claims to land and political power in return for a lifetime annuity. After the submission of Blount's report, Minister Willis, Cleveland's representative to Hawai`i, ordered President Dole to step down and to put Liliuokalani back on the throne. 

But despite all these things, after the U.S. Senate published the Morgan Report containing lengthy sworn testimony which repudiated the Blount Report, Cleveland changed his mind, gave formal diplomatic recognition to the Republic as the legitimate government of Hawai`i, and engaged in normal diplomatic negotiations with the Dole government on matters such as further implementation of treaties.

As much as political activists may want to believe Cleveland declared April 30, 1894 as a day of mourning for their cause, the reality is that Cleveland made no such statement, and in fact treated the Republic of Hawaii with dignity and respect after his initial impressions regarding the Hawaiian Revolution were shown to be in error.

<h2>Afterword</h2>
Further research into the citation of Helena G. Allen referring to the New York Sun, February 26, 1894, has yielded no such article as she mentions. It is possible her citation was incorrect on the date, so further research into the February 25th, 1894 and February 27, 1894 editions will be conducted. Unfortunately, Helena G. Allen died in 2003, so she is not available to answer questions about her citation.

Investors are rushing to fund new ventures in renewable energy as Americans continue to see rising gasoline prices at the pump. The price for crude oil continues to rise to new record highs ($75 per barrel of crude oil on NYMEX as of Friday's close). According to the results of a survey reported by the San Francisco Gate, in the 1st Quarter of 2006 investments in the clean technology sector has increased by 13% to $3.36 Billion in the US. In addition to attracting venture capital, clean technology companies are receiving a buzz from high profile investors.

&lt;a href="Bill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, Founder of Microsoft, announced last week that his venture group (Cascade Investments) initiated the purchase of 25.5% ownership in Pacific Ethanol Inc. Pacific Ethanol is an ethanol production company that plans to expand operations by opening a new facility in California. Gates is not alone in high profile investments into the clean energy market, Bob Metcalfe (Founder of 3COM and Inventor of Ethernet), who acts as the managing partner of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.polarisventures.com"&gt;Polaris Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, announced the VC's first investment into the energy market. Polaris, which manages over $3 Billion in funds, invested $6.8 million into &lt;a href="http%3A//www.greenfuelonline.com"&gt;GreenFuel Technologies Corporation&lt;/a&gt; of Cambridge, MA. GreenFuel Technologies is an emissions to biofuels company, that utilizes natural algae in their patented bioreactors to turn greenhouse gas emissions from power plants into rich bio fuel. Polaris's investment into GreenFuel was part of the company's $18 Million Series B financing round that also included a high profile venture capital investor: Draper Fisher Jurvetson. When asked about the new industry venture, Bob Metcalfe said, "Energy has got to be one of the top five problems the world faces, and it's been frustrating to watch activists and politicians fail to solve the problem...Now it's time for the entrepreneurs and scientists to give it a try." 

According to the International Energy Association, demand for renewable energy fuels will more than quadruple in the next decade. The current jump in oil prices is fueling investment into this relatively new market as investors view clean technology as an emerging opportunity rather than a public relations campaign. As gasoline prices continue to rise, alternative fuels become respectively cheaper and more attractive. In his latest State of the Union Address, President Bush outlined a plan to direct new investment into ethanol production and other clean technologies. According to a poll conducted by CBS News, Americans now see gas prices as one of their top three main concerns. With pressure coming from constituents, politicians are beginning to exert pressure on new spending on renewable technology to promote energy independence. Yet another front in this debate is that of environmental concern. With global warming on the rise, and many European governments eagerly searching for a Carbon Dioxide solution, the promise of reducing these emissions by 46% (as claimed by GreenFuel's bio reactor system) begins to resonate as a promising environmental and business opportunity.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Explosions%20rock%20Egyptian%20resort%20town%20of%20Dahab&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Three explosions rocked the Egyptian resort city of &lt;a href="w%3ADahab"&gt;Dahab&lt;/a&gt; and killed at least 24 people. Between 60 and 150 people were injured in the attack.

The blasts came at the height of the tourist season, officials said. The three time bombs exploded in a busy restaurant and in a market area in the Red Sea resort city within a span of five minutes.

Dahab is located on the &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20of%20Aqaba"&gt;Gulf of Aqaba&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern side of the &lt;a href="w%3ASinai%20Peninsula"&gt;Sinai Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Statement on casualties</h2>
An early written statement, attributed to the Egyptian Interior Ministry, gave the death toll as 23 people: 20 Egyptians, a German child, and two victims of unknown nationality.

The statement also listed the 20 foreigners who were wounded as three &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Danes&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Britain"&gt;Britons&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; and one each from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKorea"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The nationalities of the other victims were not specified.

Today, court proceedings in the European Union's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg began as &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft Corporation&lt;/a&gt; filed an appeal against the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union Commission&lt;/a&gt;'s decision in an anti-trust case, commenting that the Commission made several mistakes in its decision to fine Microsoft 497 million euros, or approximately 613 million dollars concerning several allegations that Microsoft used its majority share in desktop software to also take over the video and media player business. The Commission also forced Microsoft to produce a version of &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP"&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; that did not include &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Media%20Player"&gt;Windows Media Player&lt;/a&gt;. Only 1,787 copies were ordered through March 31st. Microsoft has also alleged that the proposed punishment of 2 million euros per day is too severe. The EU has also proposed that Microsoft's upcoming operating system, &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Vista"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt; will also exclude rivals through bundling programs. Although a decision is not expected for at least several months, analysts have predicted that a verdict in favor of Microsoft would destroy the EU Commission's prestige as well as any case against Microsoft.

<h2>U.S. president</h2>
President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; condemned the deadly explosions in the &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian resort city of Dahab Monday and pledged to bring terrorists to justice. He commented at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino where he was speaking to raise money for Republican &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Rep.&lt;/a&gt; Jon Porter. "I strongly condemn the killings that took place, the innocent life lost in Egypt," Bush said. "This is a heinous act against innocent civilians."

"The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; sends our condolences to the families of those who were killed," Bush said. "We keep those were injured in our thoughts and prayers and I assure the enemy this — we will stay on the offense, we will not waver, we will not tire, we will bring you to justice for the sake of peace and humanity."

<h2>Egyptian president</h2>
President &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Hosni Mubarak&lt;/a&gt;, whose economy is heavily dependent on tourism, called the blasts a "a wicked terrorist attack."

The Egyptian government has said the militants who carried out the bombings were locals without international connections, but other security agencies have said they suspect &lt;a href="al-Qaida"&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Lawsuit%20sends%20Buffalo%2C%20N.Y.%20hotel%20proposal%20to%20New%20York%20Supreme%20Court&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Attorney Arthur J. Giacalone has filed a lawsuit in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;New York Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; against the city of &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;'s Common Council and Planning board, alleging that the proposed Elmwood Village Hotel was approved "without giving meaningful consideration to either the impact on the adjoining residential neighborhood, or the unique character of this section of Elmwood Avenue." Giacalone is representing Nancy Pollina and Patricia Morris, who operate the Don Apparel (a vintage clothing and collectibles shop at 1119 Elmwood Avenue), Angeline Genovese and Evelyn Bencinich, owners of residences on Granger Place which abut the rear of the proposed site, Nina Freudenheim, a resident of nearby Penhurst Park, and Sandra Girage, the owner of a two-family residence on Forest Avenue less than a hundred feet from the proposed hotel's sole entrance and exit driveway.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a 72-room, seven-million-dollar hotel proposed by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. Its construction would require the demolition of at least five buildings, currently at 1109-1121 Elmwood, which house several shops and residents. Although the properties are "under contract," it is still not known whether Savarino Construction actually owns the buildings. It is believed that Hans Mobius, a resident of &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Clarence, New York&lt;/a&gt; and former Buffalo mayoral candidate, is still the owner. The hotel is expected to be a franchise of the Wyndham Hotels group.

The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court, is seeking annulment of the City of Buffalo's rezoning and site plan approvals for the hotel. 

"Had the Common Council members complied with State law and waited to receive comments from the County's planning agency, they would have been obliged to address the County's concerns regarding the replacement of former residential buildings with 'a much larger commercial structure', the health effects of placing a 55-vehicle parking area next to existing homes, and the absence of a traffic study to assess the likelihood that the project would add 'considerable congestion' to the Elmwood/Forest intersection," said Giacalone.

"The four-story hotel will overshadow the neighboring homes and backyards, impacting quality of life and property values. Equally as important, the project will displace a unique and diverse group of businesses that have served nearby college students and Buffalo's arts and theater community for many years, and replace them with upscale retail establishments that will cater, not to local residents, but to affluent tourists and business travelers," added Giacalone.

On March 22, 2006 the city's Common Council approved the rezoning for the proposed hotel and on March 28, the Planning board approved the design and site plan of the hotel.

The lawsuit, entitled Pollina et al. v. Common Council of the City of Buffalo et al., [Index No. I-2006-3885], has been assigned to the Honorable Rose H. Sconiers, and is scheduled for oral argument at 9:30 A.M. on Thursday June 8, 2006.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Cyclone%20Monica"&gt;Tropical Cyclone Monica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has missed Darwin, dissipating into a category one cyclone at 1030 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (0030 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). The cyclone was originally expected to hit &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaffir-Simpson%20scale"&gt;category five&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but lost power as it traveled across the &lt;a href="Northern%20Territory%2C%20Australia"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt;, moving further south than anticipated. While this may bring relief to many residents fearing a return of the infamous &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACyclone%20Tracy"&gt;Cyclone Tracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , authorities have warned that Monica still packs a punch and will bring 90 kph winds to the region. Northern Territory police commander, Bert Hofer, has advised residents to "stay where they are," for the time being. Australian airline &lt;a href="Qantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt; is resuming its flights to Darwin as of 1945 AEST today. All ANZAC Day dawn services were cancelled in the Northern Territory's capital.

&lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aleftist"&gt;leftist&lt;/a&gt; groups of masked youth demonstrators clashed with Greek &lt;a href="w%3Apolice"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; and riot squads in Stadiou &lt;a href="w%3AAvenue"&gt;Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, during American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's meetings with Greek officials. &lt;a href="w%3AAnarchist"&gt;Anarchist&lt;/a&gt; mobs hurled Molotov cocktail bombs and the police-riot squads fired tear gas. According to police information, the youths smashed some 20 store fronts and set six vehicles alight.
Police had thrown a cordon around central road arteries of the city since Tuesday morning, while two street protests - organized by the &lt;a href="w%3AKKE"&gt;KKE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASynaspismos"&gt;Synaspismos&lt;/a&gt; leftist parties - were staged at Propylea on Panepistemiou Street as well as on Klafthmonos Square. Moreover, yesterday, a team of about 15 members of the Greek &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; party, climbed on the top of Athens' Concert Hall, just meters away from the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Embassy, in order to hang a huge banner with the message "Condoleezza Rice go Home". 

In her short stay in &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, America's chief diplomat met with the Greek Premier &lt;a href="w%3ACostas%20Karamanlis"&gt;Costas Karamanlis&lt;/a&gt; in Maximus Palace as well as with her counterpart, the Greek Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADora%20Bakoyiannis"&gt;Dora Bakoyiannis&lt;/a&gt;. The agenda of their discussions included &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s nuclear program, the Greek-Turkish relations, the &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMacedonian"&gt;Macedonian&lt;/a&gt; issues as well as the co-operation between the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and Greece.

Six workers in the post office in &lt;a href="w%3AHueytown%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Hueytown, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; developed breathing problems and 23 were sent to the hospital after a chemical used in the manufacture of fishing lures leaked from a package. 

The post office, located five miles west of downtown &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, was evacuated, and Hueytown firefighters in hazardous materials attire inspected the chemical. The chemical was found to have leaked from an inadequately designed package, evaporated quickly leaving a garlicky scent, and discolored the flooring tile in the post office. Workers complained of symptoms ranging from breathing difficulties to vomiting to burning in the throat.

The chemical was later identified as "J.J.'s Magic," a yellow dye for soft plastic fishing lures which contains garlic oil as a fish attractant. The manufacturer confirmed that a two-ounce bottle of the product was sent to a customer in suburban Birmingham and speculated that the container may have cracked in transit.

A new study published in the May 2006 issue of the Journal of &lt;a href="w%3APsychopharmacology"&gt;Psychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt; and conducted at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Louisiana%20at%20Lafayette"&gt;University of Louisiana at Lafayette&lt;/a&gt; finds no significant link between &lt;a href="w%3AEcstasy"&gt;Ecstasy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AMDMA"&gt;MDMA&lt;/a&gt;) use and depression. 
A common street drug, Ecstasy is found mostly in tablet form, and often taken in a nightclub setting. Its psychological effects include making users affectionate, giving them the impression of heightened senses in response to music, and overall euphoria. Physically the drug acts as a stimulant, a mild diuretic and causes hyperthermia, which is why, in combination with physical exertion leading to perspiration, users often drink large amounts of water to prevent dehydration.

&lt;a href="w%3ASerotonin"&gt;Serotonin&lt;/a&gt; is an important neurotransmitter, also known as 5-HT or 5-hydroxytryptamine, implicated in controlling mood. In fact, most well known anti-depressants, such as &lt;a href="w%3APaxil"&gt;Paxil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AProzac"&gt;Prozac&lt;/a&gt;, are believed to work by stabilizing the level of serotonin in the brain (&lt;a href="w%3ASSRI"&gt;SSRI&lt;/a&gt;s).
Ecstasy is believed to increase the levels of serotonin because of its effects on mood. Research in lab animals has provided evidence that it causes long-term post-use serotonin depletion. A common hypothesis among many researchers is that drop in serotonin levels below normal could be recognized by a corresponding decline in mood.

Sixty-four participants took part in the study. One half of the participants between the age of 18 to 45 were obtained by word of mouth or over the Internet. The other half consisted of controls that had no experience taking ecstasy, recruited from introductory psychology classes at the university. 

According to the study, participants filled out a questionnaire about their personal and drug use history. The personal history questionnaire queried the gender, age, psychiatric background, and current anti-depressant drug usage. Alternately, the drug history questionnaire explored the lifetime usage and usage habits of a wide variety of substances, including specific questions about abstinence from ecstasy and the most ecstasy taken by the participant in 12 hours.

Two tests were performed to assess psychiatric function: the &lt;a href="w%3ABeck_Depression_Inventory"&gt;Beck Depression Inventory-II(BDI-II)&lt;/a&gt; and the Shipley Institute of Living Scale(SILS) &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usq.edu.au/users/senior/69301/Shipley.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The BDI-II is a 21-question self-assessment that according to many sources is empirically valid for highlighting the presence and severity of depressive symptoms, and meets the requirements of the &lt;a href="w%3ADSM-IV"&gt;DSM-IV&lt;/a&gt;, which is the standard reference that mental health professionals use to diagnose psychological disorders.

The SILS is administered to assess cognitive abilities. It was developed in 1940 as a measure of general intellectual functioning, and is still administered in its original form.

According to the study there was no significant difference in the BDI-II scores between the control and experimental groups. Furthermore, no significant correlation was found between any of the conditions of ecstasy use.

This study seems to go against the consensus that &lt;a href="w%3AMDMA"&gt;MDMA&lt;/a&gt; reduces &lt;a href="w%3Aserotonin"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; levels and causes some measurable damage. However, there are other studies in the same journal that go into more detail about individual usage habits and harm reduction strategies that need to be considered alongside the data presented with this study. The study claims that when experimental groups are gathered via the Internet, they could be biased (more available information, taking less) and adopt different &lt;a href="http%3A//jop.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/20/3/437.pdf"&gt;harm reduction strategies than average users&lt;/a&gt;. 

However, according to Professor David Nutt at University of Bristol, one could conclude &lt;a href="http%3A//jop.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/20/3/315.pdf"&gt;Ecstasy causes less harm, and has less societal costs than&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aethanol"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;.

Cyclone Monica was expected to hit Darwin as a category five storm, with winds of up to 350 km/h (220 mph). But the national weather bureau downgraded it to category two on the morning of April 25, 2006, when it lost power after making landfall. Monica was a category five cyclone when it touched down in the remote Aboriginal community of Maningrida, in the Northern Territory, late on 24th night.
A spokeswoman for the Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services said some parts of the area had been damaged by the storm. Maningrida "certainly suffered extensive damage to some buildings and structures," she told the Sydney Morning Herald, although no serious injuries have been reported

&lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Cyclone"&gt;Tropical Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; Monica now poses no risk to the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Territory"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt; of Australia. Monica was downgraded to a tropical low, but the cyclone has the potential regroup over the warm seas north of Australia. Monica could intensify back into a category two or even three cyclone before striking the north coast of Western Australia at the NT/WA border.

Cyclone Monica hit Australia just a month after category five Cyclone Larry tore through the community of Innisfail, about 100 km (60 miles) south of Cairns. Thousands of homes were destroyed by Cyclone Larry, with a damage bill expected to top A$1bn ($707m, £405m). 

"A cyclone watch is current between the Daly Mouth River right through to the Kimberley" says Ms Jenny Farlow, an NT forecaster.

Meanwhile the cyclone has hampered government efforts to crack down on illegal fishing in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Rough seas combined with busy officers have grounded the effort to a halt, and three Indonesian fishing boats in Australian waters are reported to have gone unchecked.

Giacalone has filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court against the city of Buffalo's Common Council and Planning board, alleging that the proposed Elmwood Village Hotel was approved "without giving meaningful consideration to either the impact on the adjoining residential neighborhood, or the unique character of this section of Elmwood Avenue."♡❤

&lt;a href="ANZAC%20Day%20marked%20throughout%20NZ%2C%20AU"&gt;ANZAC Day marked throughout NZ and AU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
♡❤Australians and New Zealanders throughout the world stood still and turned out in huge numbers for their national war memorial days in remembrance of the failed Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) — attack on Gallipoli, Turkey that began on 25 April 1915. The fateful attack was designed to end the First World War quicker by creating a supply line to Russia. A hundred thousand died in the battle, remembered every year as ANZAC Day by both nations.♡❤

♡❤A senior Russian air force commander has claimed that new, upgraded Tu-160 bomber aircraft were unchallenged by US air defense systems when they penetrated a radar zone near the Canadian coast in US territory during an April training exercise, reports the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. Lieutenant General Igor Khvorov , Commander of Russia's long-range strategic bombers, said that the bombers successfully carried out four mock Tu-95MS cruise missile launches, 200 mock bombings, and 53 mock sorties during the exercise. The RIA Novosti reported that the US Air Force is currently investigating how the Tu-160's escaped detection.♡❤

♡❤The government of Peru declared a state of emergency in the vicinity of the Ubinas volcano on Saturday as it began to spew out ash and smoke over a 6km area, indicating a possible eruption in the near future. The civil defense institute has recommended the total evacuation of the 3,500 residents of the district of Ubinas. The Peruvian military has been ordered to aid in the evacuation of civilians from the area. Aid shipments of tents, water and powdered milk are being sent to the affected area♡❤

♡❤Tropical Cyclone Monica has missed Darwin, the territorial capital of Australia’s Northern Territory, dissipating into a category one cyclone at 1030 AEST (0030 UTC). The cyclone was originally expected to hit Darwin as a category five, but lost power as it traveled across the Northern Territory, moving further south than anticipated. While this may bring relief to many residents fearing a return of the infamous Cyclone Tracy, authorities have warned that Monica still packs a punch and will bring 90 kph winds to the region♡❤

<h1>In depth: Buffalo, N.Y. hotel proposal controversy</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=In%20depth%3A%20Buffalo%2C%20N.Y.%20hotel%20proposal%20controversy&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
In February of 2006, the Savarino Services Construction Corp. proposed the construction of a seven million &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20dollar"&gt;dollar&lt;/a&gt; hotel on Elmwood and Forest Avenues in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. In order for the hotel to be built, at least five properties containing businesses and residents would have to be destroyed. It was not certain whether the properties were owned by Savarino or by the landlord Hans Mobius. The hotel was designed by Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group, and is planned to be a franchise of the Wyndham Hotels group.

Elmwood Avenue is known by the community as a popular shopping center, and Nancy Pollina of Don Apparel (who is "utterly against" the construction) claims it's the only reason why students from &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20State%20College"&gt;Buffalo State College&lt;/a&gt; leave campus. Additionally, Michael Faust of Mondo Video said he did not want to "get kicked out of here [his video store property]."

In 1995, a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWalgreens"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was proposed to be built on the same land, but Walgreens later withdrew its request for a variance because of pressure from the community. More recently, Pano Georgiadis tried to get the rights to demolish the Atwater House next to his restaurant on Elmwood Avenue, but was denied a permit due to the property's historical value. He has since been an opponent to the hotel construction.

In the process of debating the hotel, it was thought that a hotel had previously existed on the proposed site, however; research done at the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society had shown that no hotel had previously existed on the site.

<h2>In depth</h2>
<h3>The initial meeting</h3>

On February 21, 2006, 140 people attended a meeting that was held at the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20State%20College"&gt;Buffalo State College&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the hotel proposal. Citizens were opposed to the hotel development, including Mark Freeland, who claimed that the hotel will effectively prevent nearby Granger Street from getting any sunlight, and would make the households on that street "on permanent reality TV." Nancy Pollina claimed that the proposal was being rushed. Alternatives were suggested, including a plan to commercially revitalize the street without the construction of a hotel. Rocco Termini, the developer who proposed the plan, claimed that small stores would "preserve the streetscape" of Elmwood Avenue.

<h3>Hotel redesign</h3>
One of the main objections at the meeting was the design of the building: a large box-shaped building that dwarfs the small shops on that street. In an interview with Eva Hassett of Savarino Construction Services Corp., she told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that the hotel would be a story shorter and have 10% less rooms. In addition, the aesthetics of the building were to be changed, different building materials were to be used, and the smaller building would allow for more parking. When asked if Savarino agreed to Termini's proposal, they asserted that the hotel would be a great asset for Buffalo. Hassett agreed to another large meeting that was held in late February.

<h3>The second meeting and the planning board's decision</h3>

A more low-profile meeting was held on February 27, 2006 to disucss the redesign. One of the attendees was Joseph Golombek, who had only heard of the hotel proposal a few days earlier. He claimed that he was asked to approve the hotel the next day, to which he had responded that he would not accept or reject until the community has had more time to look at it. In addition, Golombeck claimed that two of the properties, 605 Forest and 607 Forest, would need to be re-&lt;a href="w%3Azoning"&gt;zoned&lt;/a&gt; in order for the hotel development to go through. At a meeting of the City Planning Board, they unanimously agreed to postpone voting on the hotel plans for thirty days due to a lack of meetings. 

Termini, who appeared at the first meeting, still claimed that the hotel is bad. He proposed another idea, again without a hotel. Susan Curran Hoyt claimed the hotel is still too large, and asked if the hotel size could be further reduced. Evelyn Bencinich complained that her property value will be deprecated as a result of the hotel, and that the construction process of the hotel could result in serious consequences.

On March 10, 2006, it was reported that the planning board further delayed voting on the hotel.

<h3>Threats of lawsuit</h3>

At a meeting on &lt;a href="w%3AMarch%2013"&gt;March 13&lt;/a&gt;, 2006, Savarino confirmed that they are seeking a &lt;a href="w%3Avariance"&gt;variance&lt;/a&gt; on 605 Forest in Buffalo. Originally, both 605 and 607 Forest were requested for a variance. 605 Forest is the property of Pano Georgiadis, a local restaurant owner, who has threatened to sue if they had requested the variance. A petition has been drawn to prevent the construction, which had been signed by Georgiadis. However, signs of support have been found, including a citizen claiming that the hotel will raise property values. ♡❤The Buffalo News♡❤ claimed that at least six of the Common Council members have approved the hotel construction.

On March 18, 2006, citizens protested on Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo against the construction of the hotel. At least forty people arrived to picket for two hours. One complaint within the crowd was that the hotel would destroy businesses that had been around for years.

<h3>Approval by the Common Council and Planning Board</h3>
On March 22, the Common Council unanimously approved the construction of the Elmwood Village Hotel in less than two minutes. The approval also allowed for the rezoning of all five properties to allow for hotel development. While 605 and 607 Forest Avenue are not needed for the hotel, Savarino still needs the rights to 605 Forest Avenue to fulfill certain requirements. Six days later, another protest occurred. Several individuals met with a lawyer to see if any legal action could be taken. While it has been claimed that there is a case, the legal fees would be too expensive. A legal fund has been looked into.

On March 28, the Planning Board, who has the final say, approved the hotel construction. This has aroused plenty of controversy for the plan, with one man saying, "Thanks for destroying Buffalo." Georgiadis, the owner of an affected property, has confirmed that he is "definitely suing." 

<h3>Lawsuit filed</h3>

Attorney Arthur J. Giacalone has filed a lawsuit in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20State%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;New York State Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; against Buffalo's Planning Board and Common Council on April 21. The lawsuit claims that the plans were approved without giving consideration to the effects on the community. Giacolone is representing several people, including Nancy Pollina, one of the business owners affected by the plans. The lawsuit, titled ♡❤Pollina et al. v. Common Council of the City of Buffalo et al.♡❤, has been assigned to Rose H. Sconiers.

On April 26, more people have been named in the lawsuit, including the Mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown, Savarino Construction Services Corporation, Hans J. Mobius and his son Hans S. Mobius, who are owners of the properties at stake, Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, and Cendant Corporation, the parent company of Wyndham Hotels. In addition, Savarino is prohibited from doing any construction and Mobius is prohibited from preventing the lawsuit.

In an e-mail interview with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, councilmember Joseph Golombek stated that the city is fighting the lawsuit, claiming that they "believe that [they] did everything fairly and properly (as well as legally)."

As of June 2, 2006, the preliminary hearing for the lawsuit was postponed to June 22, and was subsequently postponed indefinitely.

<h3>Proposal withdrawn</h3>
As of July 13, 2006, according to Savarino Construction Services Corporation, the plans for the hotel will be withdrawn and will undergo a "do-over". By the end of next week, the new proposal will be submitted.

"We're lovers, not fighters. Our energies should be spent on developing a really wonderful project, not wasted in court. We'll start over with a clean slate and take as much time as necessary to hear people out and end up with a very positive project for the neighborhood," said President of Savarino Construction, Sam Savarino.

Savarino asserts that the problem was not with the design or the location, but with the rushed process involved with the proposal.

Since then, the preliminary hearing for the lawsuit has been rescheduled for August 10, 2006, and as of August 14, 2006, has been postponed indefinitely pending Savarino's next action.

<h3>Properties for sale</h3>
 Hans Mobius has decided to place a for sale sign in front of the properties at 1109-1121 Elmwood.

Savarino now states that "legal complexities now exist" as a result of the sign being put up.

<h3>Documents threaten hotel proposal, businesses on site</h3>
Documents that lead back to nearly 1815 have turned up. According to the documents, "no business of anykind whatsoever" can be placed on the site of the proposed hotel. This discovery may cause the closure of any and all businesses on the site and may even prevent a hotel from ever being built.

Savarino is claiming that a judge will look at the documents to determine if the rules, which are stated on the original deeds of the properties, if a hotel can be placed there.

The original owner, Erastus Granger sold the land, which was known as the Granger estates to different people to build upon, but had restrictions which include no businesses or bars/saloons. For the time they were written, the documents also state that no barn, farm or stable can be built on the properties.

A female suicide bomber from the militant separatist group &lt;a href="w%3ALTTE"&gt;LTTE&lt;/a&gt; disguised herself as a pregnant woman and detonated a bomb inside the &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lankan&lt;/a&gt; Army HQ in Colombo yesterday evening. Eight soldiers were killed in the attack and Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka was severely wounded. 

The Sri Lanka Air Force launched retaliatory strikes against rebel positions this morning at 00:30 GMT. This attack threatens to put an end to the uneasy ceasefire between the Tamil rebels and the Sri Lankan government that has been in place since 2002.

Several suspect packages were found in the Shepherds Bush area of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20London"&gt;West London&lt;/a&gt; this morning, which led to many roads in the area being closed, along with the ♡❤Hammersmith and City♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;tube&lt;/a&gt; line.

The area re-opened shortly afterwards, after Bomb Squad experts determined the packages were safe, and a woman walked into Hammersmith Police Station and admitted placing the packages as "works of art".

Police are still advising motorists to avoid the area, due to heavy traffic.

The number of casualties is not known at this time with the spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AMultinational%20Force%20and%20Observers"&gt;Multinational Force and Observers (MFO)&lt;/a&gt; and Egyptian security forces giving conflicting reports. According to Major Nathan Bond, an MFO spokesman, no peacekeepers were injured in the attack. However, Egyptian security personnel maintain that one Norwegian, one New Zealander and four Egyptians were killed in the bombing.

U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday named Tony Snow, a former news anchor and talk show host for the Fox News network, as his new press secretary.

Bush said in a press conference, "I'm confident Tony Snow will make an outstanding addition to this White House staff. I am confident he will help you do your job. My job is to make decisions, and his job is to help explain those decisions to the press corps and the American people."

Snow said in response, "These are times that are going to be very challenging. We've got a lot of big issues ahead, and we've got a lot of important things that all of us are going to be covering together, and I'm very excited and I can't wait."

Snow, 50, replaces Scott McClellan, who submitted his resignation last week.

Before joining Fox News in 1996, Snow was a speechwriter for Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush. At Fox News, Snow was a weekend news anchor and host of "The Tony Snow Show" on Fox News Radio. He was also a nationally syndicated columnist for the ♡❤Detroit News♡❤ from 1993 to 2001.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
A copy has been obtained of the lawsuit filed against the City of &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly fast-tracking a seven million dollar hotel proposal.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a 72-room, seven-million-dollar hotel proposed by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. Its construction would require the demolition of at least five buildings, currently at 1109-1121 Elmwood, which house several shops and residents. Although the properties are "under contract," it is still not known whether Savarino Construction actually owns the buildings. It is believed that Hans Mobius, a resident of Clarence, New York and former Buffalo mayoral candidate, is still the owner. The hotel is expected to be a franchise of the Wyndham Hotels group.

According to official court documents, there are more defendants than previously thought. Documents state that not only Buffalo's Common Council and Planning Board are named in the lawsuit, but also the Mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown, Savarino Construction Services Corporation, Hans J. Mobius and his son Hans S. Mobius owners of the properties at stake, Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, and Cendant Corporation, the parent company of Wyndham Hotels are also named in the suit.

According to the lawsuit, during the length of the trial, Savarino Construction along with their employees, Hans Mobius and his son are not allowed to make any alterations or "engage in the physical alteration" of any of the said properties, 1109-1121 Elmwood and 9999 Forest. The suit also states that the owner of 605 Forest, Pano Georgiadis is also to follow the same rule.

The suit also states that Hans Mobius, his son and employees or "agents" are not allowed to "take any step, lawful or otherwise, to terminate [the] petitioners, Nancy Pollina and Patricia Morris," owners of Don Apparel at 1119 Elmwood "tenancies." Although the business is owned by Pollina and Morris, they are without a lease.

Within the suit it states that the rezoning of the properties 1119-1121 Elmwood and 605 Forest, by the Common Council, from a 'R3' Dwelling District to a C2 commercial zone "constitutes as impermissible 'spot-zoning'" and is "not in accord with a well-considered plan for the development of the community and is null and void." According to the suit the courts of New York have defined spot-zoning as "the process of singling out a small parcel of land for a use classification totally different from that of the surrounding area, for the benefit of the owner of such properties and to the detriment of other owners." The suit also states that the proposed site for the hotel is different from the surrounding properties because none of the zoning classifications, 'EB' [Elmwood Avenue Business District], 'R3' [Dwelling District], 'R1' [One Family District] and 'R2' [Dwelling District], permit the construction and operation of a hotel.

It is alleged that Savarino Construction "failed to utilize forms obtainable from the city clerks office, failed to include an accurate map or survey showing the location of all buildings and structures and failed to include the names and addresses of each of the owners of the properties to be rezoned."

It is also believed that recommendation in regards to [hotel] compatibility, different land uses, traffic studies, community character, population density, relations between other residents and business owners, public convenience, governmental efficiency, and achieving and maintaining a satisfied community, were to be sent to Erie County's Planning agency and was to refer Savarino's rezoning application and site plan to the agency, however; the lawsuit alleges that although a referral was given to Savarino, it "does not appear that the 'full statement of such proposed action' was forwarded to the County [Agency]." 

The suit also alleges that the Common Council "failed to wait the 'statutorily-mandated' 30-days after the County's Planning Agency's receipt" of recommendations from the Council. The County's Planning Agency replied to the recommendations, however; the Agency replied on March 27, 2006, just six days after the Council made its recommendations, falling well short of the "statutorily-mandated" thirty days. The Agency's reply however, did not support or oppose the recommendations or hotel proposal.

Public hearings are required to be registered by the City clerk to the City Planning Board, and according to the suit, "no record" of the Public hearing on March 7, presenting the initial proposal to the public, was made within the City's Clerk office or Planning Board.

The suit also alleges that the Common council and Planning Board also violated the State's Environmental Quality Review Act or SEQRA and the City's Environmental Review Ordinance by allowing the Planning Board to be the "lead agency" instead of the Common Council. A lead agency is an involved agency principally responsible for undertaking or approving an action and therefore responsible for determining whether an Environmental Impact Statement or EIS is needed, according to the SEQRA regulations. The suit also states that the hotel proposal "constitutes an action under the SEQRA" because the project could "affect the environment by changing the use, appearance or condition of any natural resource or structure that requires one or more approvals from an agency or agencies" and that the Common Council and Planning Board are "obliged to comply with both the letter [recommendations] and spirit of the SEQRA review process" which include identifying the areas of environmental concerns and taking a "hard look" at them. The suit also claims that the Common Council has the "sole authority to grant Savarino Construction's rezoning request" and "to approve the special development plan," but it also claims that the Planning Board is "an involved agency" but that it is "clearly subordinate to that of the Common Council" therefore the decision made by both the Council and Planning Board to allow the Planning Board to be the 'lead agency,' is in "violation" of the State's SEQRA and "renders all determinations" made by the Planning Board and Common Council on March 14, 21, and 28, 2006, "void and unauthorized." It goes on to say that the Council "proceeded without or in excess of their jurisdiction, and/or made a determination in violation of lawful procedure, affected by an error of law, and/or in an arbitrary and capricious manner." It also states that unless the requirements of the SEQRA are met, then the petitioners have the right to "seek a temporary restraining order" from the Court if circumstances require it.

The suit also states that a failure to grant a preliminary injunction, through the courts, will result in "irreparable injury" to the petitioners and that the Council and Planing Board have failed to comply with the requirements of the SEQRA and have violated several other state laws and city codes.

So far, Savarino Construction has not responded to any calls or e-mails. District councilman Joseph Golombek also has not responded. Georgiadias was unavailable for comment.

A preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place at 9:30 a.m. on June 8, 2006 in the Supreme Court building at 50 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo, on the 8th floor, part 31.

35,000 chickens at Witford Lodge Farm at &lt;a href="Norfolk"&gt;Norfolk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; are to be culled after some chickens found dead tested positive for bird flu. Further tests are being carried out to establish which strain of the virus it was, but preliminary results suggest it is not the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain, but is instead the &lt;a href="w%3AH7N7"&gt;H7N7&lt;/a&gt; strain. The birds are being culled as a precautionary measure.

The H7N7 strain can be transmitted to humans, but not as easily or as lethally as the H5N1 strain. Previous outbreaks of the H7N7 strain include one from 2003 in the Netherlands, which infected more than 80 people and led to the death of one vet.

So far the only positive test for H5N1 in the UK has been a dead swan found in &lt;a href="w%3AFife"&gt;Fife&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤In other news... A new study published in the May 2006 issue of the Journal of Psychopharmacology and conducted at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette finds no significant link between the use of Ecstasy and depression. Ecstasy is believed to increase the levels of serotonin, because of its effects on mood. Research in lab animals has provided evidence that it causes long-term post use serotonin depletion. A common hypothesis among many researchers is that the reduction in serotonin levels below normal could be detected by a corresponding decline in mood. This study seems to go against the consensus that Ecstacy reduces serotonin levels.♡❤

♡❤Six workers in the post office in Hueytown, Alabama developed breathing problems and 23 were sent to the hospital after a chemical used in the manufacture of fishing lures leaked from a package. The post office was evacuated, and Hueytown firefighters in hazardous materials attire inspected the chemical. The chemical was found to have leaked from an inadequately designed package, evaporated quickly leaving a garlicky scent, and discolored the flooring tile. Workers complained of symptoms ranging from breathing difficulties to vomiting to burning in the throat.♡❤

Maoist rebels in &lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; announced a three-month ceasefire from Thursday onward saying that this move reflected their support for the formation of a new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANepalese%20Constituent%20Assembly"&gt;Constituent Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Maoist leader Prachanda said in a statement that the People's Liberation Army would not carry out any offensive military action during the tenure of the ceasefire. Maoist rebels have been fighting to overthrow the monarchy in the Himalayan nation since 1996 and over 13000 people have been killed in the insurgency. The Maoists' announcement has been welcomed by India, which has indicated that it will likely resume sending financial and military aid to Nepal.

A human rights project, The Detainee Abuse and Accountability Project (DAA), released a report in Washington saying that allegations of detainee abuse, torture and killings have now implicated at least 600 U.S. military and civilian personnel deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the prison for terrorist suspects in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The project is a cooperation between New York University's Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, Human Rights Watch and Human Rights First.

The human rights groups say they analyzed thousands of pages of government documents and conducted interviews with witnesses and prisoners who say they were abused by U.S. troops.

"Over 95 percent of those implicated were military personnel," said Hina Shamsi, a senior counsel for the group Human Rights First. "The remainder were from the CIA or other intelligence agencies or were civilian contractors working either for the military or the CIA The cases involve over 1,000 acts of abuse, including homicide, assault, cruelty, maltreatment, maiming and sexual abuse."

"We found that abuses were pervasive, extending far beyond Abu Ghraib and that investigations have been incomplete and delayed, which has left a general failure of accountability," she said.

In the two years since the Abu Ghraib scandal surfaced, the human rights groups say 40 people have been sentenced to serve time in prison. Of those, 10 have been sentenced to a year or more in detention.

Lieutenant Commander Jeffrey Gordon, a press officer at the Department of Defense, told VOA the allegations outlined by the human rights groups "are false."

Commander Gordon says the military has conducted more than 600 criminal investigations resulting in charges against 251 soldiers who faced courts-martial, the military's equivalent of criminal trials, or administrative punishment.

Commander Gordon says all allegations of abuse are taken seriously, people were held accountable, and the military's system of justice does work.

The information from the human rights groups comes at same time as the news that a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel is expected to be charged in connection with the abuse of detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. 

"Two years ago, U.S. officials said the abuses at Abu Ghraib were aberrations and that people who abused detainees would be brought to justice," said the faculty director of the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at NYU Law School, Professor Meg Satterthwaite. "Yet our research shows that detainee abuses were widespread, and few people have truly been brought to justice."

Two years after the Abu Ghraib scandal caused a worldwide uproar, reports say Lieutenant Colonel Steven Jordan will become the highest-ranking officer to be charged in the case.

Colonel Jordan's attorney says he expects his client will be charged within the next few days on several counts, including dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming an officer and lying to investigators.

The colonel led the Joint Interrogation and Debriefing Center at Abu Ghraib between September and December 2003.

Military investigations determined that Colonel Jordan, who was trained as a civil affairs officer, had no experience with interrogating prisoners and failed to properly supervise soldiers under his command.

<h1>Australia to introduce universal health and welfare smartcard</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; federal cabinet has approved plans for a universal &lt;a href="w%3ASmartcard"&gt;smartcard&lt;/a&gt;, which would be required to access health and welfare services from 2010. The card will be introduced from 2008.

The face of the card will contain its owner's name, a photograph, a number and the cardholder's signature. The card will also have a chip that will store a second photograph, address, date of birth, and details of children. Cardholders will be able to optionally include details of their next of kin, medical information and organ-donor status.

Australian &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; says the card will replace 17 cards and vouchers used throughout Australia's health and welfare system. The card will be used to access unemployment benefits, pensions, healthcare rebates, childcare subsidies, veteran's entitlements and family tax benefits.

Mr Howard denied that the card was intended to be a stepping stone for a national identity card. He said that the card would not be compulsory and no person would be required to carry the card at all times.

Australians have never been keen on the idea of a national identity card. The idea for a national identity card first appeared in 1985 with a proposal for the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20Card"&gt;Australia Card&lt;/a&gt; but was eventually given up upon, since then the idea has resurfaced on numerous occasions, most recently in 2002 after the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; bombings. Mr Howard said his government had looked into a national identity card but the disadvantages outweighed the advantages.

The government hopes that the card will crack down on welfare fraud. The government estimates that it will cost $1 billion to implement the card and claims the card will save $3 billion over 10 years.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, has cautiously welcomed the card, claiming to support it "in principle". The party's public accountability spokesman, Kelvin Thomson said that Labor will question if the card will be used to track people for national security purposes.

"Will this card be used for national security purposes and, if so, how?" Mr Thomson said. 

Peter Hendy, chief of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (a body representing businesses in Australia said that the card would be intrusive and increase operating costs for businesses.

The Australian Council for Civil Liberties has also expressed concerns. ACCL president Terry O'Gorman said he is concerned that the card will infringe the right to privacy.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s intelligence chief Major General Amos Yadlin was quoted by the Haaretz newspaper as saying that BM-25 missiles from &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; had arrived in &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier, a German diplomat confirmed that his country's intelligence sources had recovered information about such an Iran-North Korea missile deal. The BM-25s (which were originally manufactured in the USSR as SSN6s) are capable of delivering nuclear payloads. These weapons have a range of around 2500 kilometres,which brings Europe within striking distance. Teheran already possesses Shihab-4 class missiles which are capable of hitting Israel.

The Conservative government of &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; announced on Monday, April 24 that it will no longer lower the flag on top of the &lt;a href="w%3APeace%20Tower"&gt;Peace Tower&lt;/a&gt; at Parliament Hill whenever a Canadian soldier has been killed in action, reversing a practice set down by the previous government in 2002. Instead, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Harper said that all casualties of war would be honored equally on Remembrance Day. This announcement came after the news of four Canadian soldiers killed by an improvised roadside bomb in Afghanistan. 

The government has said that in the event of a Canadian soldier death, flags would fly at half-mast at the soldier's operational base, at their home base, and at the Defence Headquarters in Ottawa. The flag at Peace Tower will only be lowered to half-mast outside of the Remembrance Day in the case of the death of a former governor general, senator, prime minister, or an important public figure.

The mainstream media have mostly published articles which show the decision in a negative light. The Canadian newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AHalifax%20Chronicle-Herald"&gt;The Chronicle-Herald&lt;/a&gt; carried a front page editorial on April 27 titled "Lower flag as sign of respect" which argued that the flag should be lowered "out of respect for those killed in action". The newspaper pledged to fly their own flag at half-mast whenever a Canadian soldier died in combat, and urged readers to do the same. Readers were also urged to write members of parliament to protest the government's decision. In the Opinions page the next day, The Chronicle-Herald published two editorials from readers who criticised the front page editorial, while dedicating the rest of the page to letters that spoke in favour of the newspaper's campaign.

&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; high school students’ consumption of &lt;a href="w%3Aalcohol"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Atobacco"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aillegal%20drugs"&gt;illegal drugs&lt;/a&gt; is headed up, according to a nationwide study of teen substance abuse released in April. 

Nationwide, the rate of underaged drinking remained basically unchanged, but in California, it rose from 15.28 percent of California children between 12 and 17-years-old who said they had consumed alcohol in the previous month in 2002, to 16.81 percent who said they had in 2004.

Binge drinking, defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least one day in the past 30 days, was reported by 10.27 percent of kids in 2004, up from the 9.16 percent who said they binged in 2002.

The report found that, in 2004, 10.9 percent of the nation’s kids from the ages of 12 to 17 had used an illegal drug in the past month, down from 11.4 percent in 2002.

In California, the number of kids who said they had used an illicit drug in the past month rose, from 11.44 percent in 2002 to 12.05 percent in 2004.

Among California’s 12- to 17-year-olds, those who said they had used &lt;a href="w%3ACannabis"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; in the previous month rose from 7.66 percent in 2002 to 8.52 percent in 2004. Those who had used marijuana in the past year rose from 14.11 percent to 14.6 percent over the period.

Only &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; use was down among the age group, from 1.7 percent who said they had used it in the past year to 1.61 percent.

The use of any illicit drug, other than marijuana, in the month preceding the interviews of the 12- to 17-year-olds rose from 5.79 percent to 5.97 percent, according to the report. Nearly 8 percent of the age group in California had used pain relievers for “non-medical” purposes, such as getting high, the survey reported, a topic not explored in the previous survey.

More than 9 percent of California kids from 12-17 said they were abusers of or dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs in the 2004 survey, up from just over 8 percent in 2002.

Tobacco use, including chewing tobacco, increased in the age group from 9.22 percent to 10.88 percent. Cigarette smoking rose from 7.48 percent to 8.69 percent. Fewer smokers, however, reported being at great risk of smoking a pack or more a day.

The report, State Estimates of Substance Use from the 2003-2004 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, issued April 6, estimates state rates of use of illegal drugs, binge and underage drinking, serious mental illness and tobacco use. SAMHSA combined two years of data from the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health to enhance the precision of estimates for the less populous states.

The report shows that California increased from 24.7 percent of 12 to 20 year olds using alcohol in the past month to 26.3 percent, while Wisconsin increased from 34.7 percent to 38.3 percent. Michigan and South Carolina, however, showed decreases in underage drinking from 31.8 percent to 30.2 percent for Michigan and from 27.3 percent to 24.1 percent for South Carolina.

For illegal drug use, six states registered decreases in current use among youth ages 12-17, Illinois, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont and Virginia. There were no statistically significant increases in current drug use among youth in any state, and there were no increases in either the 18-to-25 year old age group or the 26- and -older age group.

“While we are making progress on drug and tobacco use among youth, underage drinking continues as a stubbornly persistent problem,” SAMHSA Administrator Charles Curie said. “It’s time to change attitudes toward teen drinking from acceptance to abstinence. It begins by recognizing the importance of parents talking to their children early and often about alcohol, especially before they’ve started drinking.”

The estimates show that past month use of any illicit drug in 2003-2004 ranged from a low of 5.8 percent in Mississippi to a high of 11.8 percent in Alaska for all persons aged 12 and older. Four jurisdictions showed decreases from 2002-2003 in current use of any illicit drug: the District of Columbia, Florida, Nevada and Washington.

“State-by-state data is a powerful tool for policymakers at the federal, state and local levels to identify needs and target prevention and treatment resources. It is clear from the findings that illicit drug, alcohol and tobacco use varies substantially among states and regions. That is why we continue to work though innovative programs like Access to Recovery to increase the flexibility of federal funding available to states and communities,” Curie said.

Mississippi and Utah had the lowest rate of past month marijuana use (4.2 percent) in 2003-2004 for population ages 12 and older, while Alaska had the highest rate (9.9 percent). Eight states were ranked in the top fifth nationally for past month marijuana use in all three age groups, 12 to 17, 18 to 25 and 26 and older. These states are Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont.

Seven jurisdictions had decreases in past month use of marijuana between 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 for those ages 12 and older: Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington.

Rhode Island had the highest percentage of persons aged 12 or older using cocaine in the past year, 3.5 percent. Ohio was the only state to show a decline in the use of cocaine in the past year, from 2.5 percent to 2.1 percent of persons aged 12 and older.

In the District of Columbia and Hawaii, approximately 3.1 percent of those 12 or older used narcotic pain relievers nonmedically, while 6.3 percent of those in Kentucky did. Washington and Kentucky were in the highest fifth for use of prescription pain relievers nonmedically in all three age groups. Arkansas and Maine had increases in the 12-17 age group, while California, Montana and New York had increases in nonmedical use of prescription pain medications among those ages 18 to 25. A decrease in nonmedical use of pain relievers was seen among those ages 12 and older in Hawaii (from 3.9 to 3.1 percent).

Eight states were in the top fifth for both underage use of alcohol and underage binge use of alcohol: Iowa, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

Tobacco use in the past month by youth increased in California, but overall in California, tobacco use by those 12 and older fell from 22.5 percent to 20.7 percent due to a decrease among persons aged 26 and older. In Kansas, the percentage of persons aged 18-25 using tobacco in the past month increased from 45.7 percent to 49.9 percent.

The data show that West Virginia had the highest rate of serious psychological distress among persons aged 18 and older in the past year (12.7 percent) while Hawaii had the lowest rate (7.1 percent). Increases in serious psychological distress appeared in 10 states, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming, generally the result of increases among persons aged 26 and older.

18 members of the Granny Peace Brigade (an anti-war activist group) were acquitted on charges of disorderly conduct during a protest outside a Times Square military recruiting center in New York City last fall. 

The defendants in the case - some were in their 80s and 90s - were charged with two counts of disorderly conduct during their October 17, 2005 protest of the Iraq war.

The Judge Neil Ross says that his verdict is not a critique of any particular police agency but that evidence showed there was no blockage of pedestrian traffic and anyone who wanted to enter the recruiting center could do so. The Manhattan courtroom erupted into applause after Judge Ross said that the prosecution ♡❤"failed to prove each defendant guilty of each charge."♡❤

The defense lawyer Norman Siegel said that the women were pleased by the verdict and was quoted saying that, ♡❤"They are great Americans, and they walk the shoes of great Americans who have made America the place that it is,"♡❤

If any of the defendants were convicted, they each could have faced up to 15 days in prison.

The &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; supreme leader, &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;, warned the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; against any attack on his country saying "The Americans should know that if they launch an assault against Islamic Iran, their interests in every possible part of the world will be harmed." Earlier this week Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Iran was ready to begin offering nuclear technology to developing countries.

Speaking at a rally in North-West Iran this Thursday, &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; was quoted as saying "Those who want to prevent Iranians from obtaining their right, should know that we do not give a damn about such resolutions."

Iran says that its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20program%20of%20Iran"&gt;nuclear program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is meant for producing energy and that it has a right under of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NPT) to enrich fuel for that purpose. The President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated,"[Iran] won't back down one iota". The US has called on Iran to stop its enrichment work and accuses Iran of trying to build a nuclear bomb. The US "is leaving all options on the table" not excluding military strikes with nuclear weapons or with conventional weapons in the eventuality of sanctions being ineffective. Iranian leaders have made strong statements against possible sanctions or military action against their country. The Ayatollah Khamenei said, "The Iranian nation will give a double response to any strike." Tehran has vowed to respond against US targets worldwide in the case of a US led attack against Iran. 

According to some claims, the US has already started attacking Iran. On April 18, Congressman &lt;a href="Dennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt; (D-OH) wrote a letter to &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; requesting information about claims that the US has already sent US covert operatives and/or retrained ex-members of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Mujahedin%20of%20Iran"&gt;MEK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParty%20for%20a%20Free%20Life%20in%20Kurdistan"&gt;Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (PEJAK, associated with the &lt;a href="Kurdistan%20Workers%20Party"&gt;PKK&lt;/a&gt;) into Iranian territory in order to provoke existing ethnic tensions by incidents of violence. MEK and PKK are classified by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and by the &lt;a href="Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union"&gt;Council of the European Union&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department%20list%20of%20Foreign%20Terrorist%20Organizations"&gt;terrorist organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; has called on Iran to suspend its enrichment work by Friday and permit additional inspections of its nuclear programme. Iran has rejected the demands. The &lt;a href="IAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to report on Iran's compliance of the Security Council resolution on Friday.

A 90 minute meeting between Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, the president of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtomic%20Energy%20Organization%20of%20Iran"&gt;Atomic Energy Organization of Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the IAEA provided no breakthrough and no new proposals were made, although Aghazadeh's deputy Mohammed Saidi said the talks were "encouraging." 

Speaking Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; spoke in Vienna at a meeting of &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; foreign ministers over Iran's nuclear program. "The United States believes ... that in order to be credible the Security Council of course has to act," to reporters. Condoleezza Rice also said that it was "highly unlikely" Tehran would comply with the US's demands and that the UN "cannot have its word and its will simply ignored by a member state." Further, Rice stated that "I look forward to discussing this with my colleagues and to I and others making that case, and I would certainly hope the Security Council is prepared to take some action."

The German Foreign Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrank-Walter%20Steinmeier"&gt;Frank-Walter Steinmeier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said, "We expect [Iran] to meet international standards and ... to allay world suspicions that its civil nuclear operations are being used to develop a possible weapons program."

Russia and China have called for negotiations to resolve the issue with President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; saying that the IAEA must retain the lead in the process. 

Widespread resentment of western influence on past Iranian internal affairs, such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Ajax"&gt;Operation Ajax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which removed the democratically elected prime minister of Iran in 1953, has called some experts to bring into question the possibility of a coalition of NATO or U.S. led forces against Iran. The likelihood of any &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apreventive%20strike"&gt;preventive strike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against Iran is uncertain, apart from the claims that US troops and or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aproxy%20troops"&gt;proxy troops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have already started small scale attacks. With a large young population increasingly pro-western, there are fears that any strike against Iran could damage any democratic movement as the population as a whole resents pro-Western influence in its internal affairs. 

Iran has nearly four times the land area of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Iran's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Iran"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20countries%20by%20number%20of%20active%20troops"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to 768,000/350,000 active/reserve military troops and the paramilitary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Revolutionary%20Guards%20Corps"&gt;Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; include 11,000,000 troops.

The &lt;a href="w%3AQingzang%20Railway"&gt;Qingzang Railway&lt;/a&gt; is a project by the Chinese Government to build a unique railway linking &lt;a href="w%3ATibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; with Mainland &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. The railway will include sections at high altitude, crossing 5000 metre high mountains, long tunnels and lots of track laid on &lt;a href="w%3Apermafrost"&gt;permafrost&lt;/a&gt;. The railway is being hailed in China as "an engineering miracle", but has attracted criticism from across the world over fears that the railway, the first to link it to outside the region, will increase Chinese control over the Tibetan autonomous region and will erode Tibetan culture and traditions.

Currently, Tibet can only be reached by air and by road. Departing from lower-altitude airports to fly into Tibet carries the risk of experiencing high altitude sickness, and the landing at &lt;a href="w%3ALhasa"&gt;Lhasa&lt;/a&gt; can be 'hair-raising'. Travelling by road means several days on a bus or hitchhiking on trucks over windy mountain roads. When the Quingzang Railway opens, it is expected that direct trains will run from &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; and other cities.

China has long received criticism over its treatment of Tibet. The &lt;a href="w%3ATibet%20Autonomous%20Region"&gt;Tibet Autonomous Region&lt;/a&gt; excludes many areas claimed to be part of 'historic Tibet', and the former government of Tibet, headed by the &lt;a href="w%3ADalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;, now live in exile in India. China claims that the railway will bring greater freedoms and economic opportunities to the people of Tibet. For an area that has long been in relative isolation though, the railway is bound to have a profound effect. Locals may worry about what would happen to their trade if they were suddenly forced to compete with businesses from Mainland China. Much of Tibet is also ancient, with old buildings and traditional practices, which may be under threat from the new physical link with China.

There are also concerns from environmentalists. The passage between Tibet and China contains some unique flora and endangered animal species, such as Tibetan antelope, which may be threatened by the railroad. Construction of the railway will generate 7,000 tons of rubbish from 20,000 builders. Some of this rubbish will have been buried on the spot whilst some forms of non-degradable rubbish which may pollute water is said to have been transported to Golmud or Lhasa for treatment. A bridge is also said to have been built at Wudaoliang Basin to enable animals to cross. Once open the railway will generate more waste, and whilst the carriages are said to be enclosed, preventing passengers from throwing out rubbish, it remains to be seen what additional impact the running of the railway will create.
As well as passengers, the railway will also have a strong use in transporting freight, currently carried on trucks. This will mean that more coal and petroleum-based products will be brought into Tibet. Whilst China claims that this will enable Tibetans to stop logging pine trees for fuel, aiding the local ecology, the railway will accelerate Tibet's use of climate-damaging fossil fuels.

Some Canadian student groups had called for a boycott of the group, who has a contract with China to provide some of the carriages.

Most of the line is now complete, ahead of schedule. Signaling equipment is currently being installed, with trials said to begin in July. The railway is scheduled to open fully in 2007. Luxury carriages will carry tourists, with sleeping compartments and oxygen tanks to enable breathing within the high-altitude areas.

<h2>Headlines</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Criticism%20over%20Qingzang%20Railway%20as%20opening%20nears"&gt;Criticism over Qingzang Railway as opening nears&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
China

The Qingzang Railway is a project by the Chinese Government to build a unique railway linking Tibet with mainland China. The railway will include sections at high altitude, crossing 5000 metre high mountains, long tunnels and lots of track laid on permafrost. The railway is being hailed in China as "an engineering miracle", but has attracted criticism from across the world over fears that the railway will increase Chinese control over the Tibetian autonomous region and will erode Tibetian culture and traditions.

<h3>&lt;a href="Iran%20nuclear%20impasse%20continues"&gt;Iran nuclear impasse continues&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Iran

The Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt; warned the United States against any attack on his country saying "The Americans should know that if they launch an assault against Islamic Iran, their interests in every possible part of the world will be harmed". Earlier this week Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Iran was ready to begin offering nuclear technology to developing countries.

<h3>&lt;a href="Pakistani%20militants%20behead%20suspected%20US%20informant"&gt;Pakistani militants behead suspected US informant&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Pakistan

Pro-Taliban militants in Pakistan's troubled Waziristan province decapitated a cab driver on suspicions that he was an American informant. This is the fourth such killing in the region this month.
The deceased was found on Tuesday in a town 25 kilometres south of Wana in an area where US forces are hunting Al-Qaeda militants. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Canadian%20government%20in%20row%20over%20flag%20lowering"&gt;Canadian government in row over flag lowering&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Canada

The Conservative government of Canada announced on Monday, April 24 that it will no longer lower the flag on top of the Peace Tower at Parliament Hill whenever a Canadian soldier has been killed in action, reversing a practice set down by the previous government in 2002. Instead, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Harper said that all casualties of war will be honored equally on Remembrance Day.

The leader of the main opposition party, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlaksandar%20Milinkievi%C4%8D"&gt;Alaksandar Milinkievič&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has been jailed for 15 days in &lt;a href="Belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; for taking part in an 'unsanctioned rally'. The march, held in the centre of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinsk"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , marked the 20th anniversary of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChernobyl%20nuclear%20disaster"&gt;Chernobyl nuclear disaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Held every year, it is a traditional forum for expressing political opposition. At least 6,000 protesters took part, accompanied by riot police.

Demonstraters are said to have asked permission for the rally and to have received authorisation for having the protest on some sites. Protestors say that their protest was on the authorised sites and was not unlawful.

Conflicts between the opposition party and the government, led by &lt;a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko"&gt;Alexander Lukashenko&lt;/a&gt;, have been numerous since Lukashenko was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABelarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202006"&gt;re-elected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as President on March 19, 2006. The opposition party has organised numerous demonstrations and rallies, and over 1,000 of their members being arrested.

Milinkievič has said that he has received "a political sentence". Other opposition leaders &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Bukhvostov"&gt;Alexander Bukhvostov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Kalyakin"&gt;Sergei Kalyakin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were also jailed on the same day.

US secretary of state &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; has said the US "condemns this act" and called upon Belarus to act within accepted international principles on the treatment of political opposition. &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; chief &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJaap%20de%20Hoop%20Scheffer"&gt;Jaap de Hoop Scheffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has also condemned the action.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=City%20of%20Buffalo%2C%20N.Y.%20fighting%20lawsuit%20against%20hotel%20proposal&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Councilmember Joesph Golombek has responded to the lawsuit filed against the city of &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly 'fast-tracking' a hotel that will be built on the corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo. The lawsuit, filed by Attorney Arthur J. Giacalone, was filed in New York State Supreme Court on April 21, 2006.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a 72-room, seven-million-dollar hotel proposed by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. Its construction would require the demolition of at least five buildings, currently at 1109-1121 Elmwood, which house several shops and residents. Although the properties are "under contract," it is still not known whether Savarino Construction actually owns the buildings. It is believed that Hans Mobius, a resident of Clarence, New York and former Buffalo mayoral candidate, is still the owner. The hotel is expected to be a franchise of the Wyndham Hotels group. Buffalo's Common Council, Planning Board, Mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown, Savarino Construction Services Corporation, Hans J. Mobius and his son Hans S. Mobius owners of the properties at stake, Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, and Cendant Corporation, the parent company of Wyndham Hotels are among those named in the suit.

Councilmember Joesph Golombek said that the Law Department is "fighting the lawsuit because they believe that we did everything fairly and properly (as well as legally)."

Golombek also stated that the lawsuit "could delay the start of the project" and that if he were "Mr. Savarino I would counter sue for any damages a postponement could bring."

"Except for the lawsuit the city is finished with the project. In my opinion I believe those opposed to the project are simply use to the city procrastinating on projects. This one was passed quickly by comparison. Thus part of their frustration." said Golombek.

"I understand the frustration of some of the people opposed to the project. But, in order for Elmwood to grow and thrive it will need to change. This change is a positive for that community," he added.

Golombek also said that he is looking into "helping the displaced businesses."

At least five businesses, Six Nations Gift Shop, Don Apparel, H.O.D. Tattoo, Skunk Tail Glass Company, and Mondo Video, will be forced to close their doors or relocate. Many of the buildings are also home to residents who will also have to move.

"I have personally contacted adjacent and nearby business associations and property owners to ask about the possibility of helping the displaced businesses. Hopefully the project will go through in a timely fashion and the displaced businesses will be able to relocate," said Golombek.

A preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place at 9:30 a.m. on June 8, 2006 in the Supreme Court building at 50 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo, on the 8th floor, part 31.

The mother of Australian soldier, Private Jake Kovco, has spoken of her anger at being told it was not her son's body in the casket delivered to Melbourne Airport. She says all hell broke loose when the Defence Minister &lt;a href="Brendan%20Nelson"&gt;Brendan Nelson&lt;/a&gt; told Private Kovco's wife and family that there had been a mix-up. "They've told us at some stage somebody was told it was a Bosnian in that coffin," she told &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Age"&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt;.

Prime Minister John Howard, speaking on Southern Cross Radio, says the family has every right to be upset. "I just want to say again how incredibly sorry I am for what has happened," he said.

Mr Howard received an angry phone call from Private Kovco's widow Shelley last night and told Southern Cross Radio he completely understands Mrs Kovco's reaction.

Judy Kovco says she is still seeking a full explanation from the Army about her son's death, she insists he did not shoot himself.
Dr Nelson has told Macquarie radio that reports Private Kovco accidentally shot himself while cleaning his gun are incorrect, "It was near him in his vicinity and he made some kind of movement which suggests that it discharged," he said.

Veteran anti-nuclear activist and journalist &lt;a href="w%3APraful%20Bidwai"&gt;Praful Bidwai&lt;/a&gt; claims that while &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; authorities "will not sacrifice &lt;nowiki&gt;[Iran's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; rights under the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)&lt;/a&gt; to engage in peaceful activities, including uranium enrichment for power generation", they are also "keen to reach a deal or compromise on the nuclear issue" and "are also working diplomatic channels to let it be known that Tehran wants talks which will lead to a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue." 

The alternative news website &lt;a href="w%3ARaw%20Story"&gt;Raw Story&lt;/a&gt; published a story on April 20 that alleged &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; vice-president &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; and Secretary of Defense &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; have obstructed the progress of diplomatic discussions which could help solve the conflict between the United States and Iran. The conflict involves the alleged &lt;a href="w%3A2005-2006%20US-Israeli%20threats%20to%20attack%20Iran"&gt;plan of attack on Iran&lt;/a&gt; led by the United States, and Iran's alleged &lt;a href="w%3AIran%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction%23Nuclear_weapons"&gt;intention to develop nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran have remained suspended since 1980, following the Iranian hostage crisis.

The website alleges that information from several different unnamed sources claim that expatriate arms dealer &lt;a href="w%3AManucher%20Ghorbanifar"&gt;Manucher Ghorbanifar&lt;/a&gt;, a key figure in the &lt;a href="w%3AIran-Contra%20Affair"&gt;Iran-Contra Affair&lt;/a&gt;, has been ordered by US authorities to monitor and report on "any interaction and attempts at negotiations between Iranian officials and US ambassador to Iraq, &lt;a href="w%3AZalmay%20Khalilzad"&gt;Zalmay Khalilzad&lt;/a&gt;." Raw Story also claims that sources "close to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;", a "high ranking intelligence official" and another "intelligence source" attributed the failure of the recent attempts at direct contacts between Khalilzad and Iranian officials as "part of an ongoing attempt by Cheney and Rumsfeld to squash diplomatic activities". The claims of the Internet publication's allegations have not yet been independently verified.

In addition, the Raw Story also claims that &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;US House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; Intelligence Committee Chairman &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hoekstra"&gt;Peter Hoekstra&lt;/a&gt; (R-MI) "approved using Ghorbanifar as an intermediary" and "attended at least one meeting in Paris with &lt;a href="w%3ACurt%20Weldon"&gt;Curt Weldon&lt;/a&gt; (R-PA) and &lt;a href="w%3AHarold%20Rhode"&gt;Harold Rhode&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Ghorbanifar."

Bidwai states that Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AHasan%20Rowhani"&gt;Hasan Rowhani&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20National%20Security%20Council"&gt;Supreme National Security Council&lt;/a&gt; chosen by Iranian head of state &lt;a href="w%3AAyatollah%20Khamenei"&gt;Ayatollah Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;, as saying that Iran is prepared to suspend its uranium enrichment for a short time.

On April 18, when asked whether US action against Iran could include a strike using &lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; answered "All options are on the table. We want to solve this issue diplomatically and we're working hard to do so."

Hosting Matters, a Web host located in Jacksonville, Florida, experienced an abnormal surge in Internet traffic at approximately 10:00 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Daylight%20time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (1400 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). Upstream providers confirmed shortly afterward that one of their servers was the target of a massive denial-of-service attack. 

System administrators took steps to isolate the target server from the network. Partial recovery was achieved and minor disruptions were reported after 12 noon EDT. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hmstatus.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The host suffered another attack around 8:30 p.m. EDT, which was resolved shortly before 9:30 p.m. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hmdnsgroup.net/forums/showthread.php%3Ft%3D11115"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Glenn Reynolds, whose popular &lt;a href="http%3A//www.instapundit.com"&gt;Instapundit&lt;/a&gt; blog was one of the sites affected, reports that the attack appears to have originated from computers in Saudi Arabia, though it is not clear whether the perpetrators were also located there. &lt;a href="http%3A//instabackup.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On its emergency operation forum, Hosting Matters would not elaborate as to the target or likely source of the attack, except that it appears to have come from outside U.S. borders. One of their administrators, known only as "Stacy," said, "I sincerely doubt that country's leadership has the least bit of concern for extraditing over something like this." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hmdnsgroup.net/forums/showthread.php%3Ft%3D11099"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

It is believed, but not confirmed, that the target of the attack was &lt;a href="http%3A//www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dcache%3ASnuQSP8lnXgJ%3Aaarons.cc/%2Baaron%27s%2Bcc%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Blr%3D%26amp%3Bstrip%3D1"&gt;aarons.cc&lt;/a&gt;, a weblog that had apparently been hacked in the past. At the time of this writing, the site is still down. Hosting Matters has stated that the target site would not be brought back online in order to avoid further problems. 

Hosting Matters hosts several high-traffic blogs, many of which, like Instapundit and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.powerlineblog.com"&gt;Power Line&lt;/a&gt;, are generally supportive of the policies of President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. 

Syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin commented on her weblog, "We are all affected by cyberterrorist tactics, wherever they may originate." &lt;a href="http%3A//michellemalkin.com/archives/005092.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

David Allyn of ♡❤Grouchy's Liberaltopia,♡❤ one of the few blogs critical of Bush hosted on Hosting Matters and found via Technorati, commented, "Hopefully, they have isolated the fucknozzles that have been attacking the servers. I can only hope that whoever is doing this DoS attack dies a horrible death that is dragged out for hours." &lt;a href="http%3A//liberaltopia.org/%3Fp%3D625"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Eleven protesters, including five members of &lt;a href="US%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;, were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly. Protesting the ongoing atrocities in the &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; region, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Rep.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Tom Lantos, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;Calif.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; survivor and the founder of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, said from the steps of the Sudanese embassy, "The slaughter of the people of &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; must end."

"The Sudanese government has shown total disregard for the wishes of the global, civilized community. I have no optimism as to the actions of the Sudanese government," Lantos said.

Democratic House members James McGovern and John Olver of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Sheila Jackson Lee of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and Jim Moran of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were among the others arrested and released after paying $50 fines after being arrested in front of the Sudanese embassy.

Olver said, "We must hold the Sudanese government accountable for the attacks they have supported on their own citizens in Darfur."

Meanwhile, President Bush met with Darfur advocates this Friday in support of rallies all over the US this weekend against the ongoing genocide in western Sudan.

"The genocide in Sudan is unacceptable... There will be rallies across our country to send a message to the Sudanese government that the genocide must stop. ... I want the Sudanese government to understand the United States of America is serious about solving this problem," Bush said.

Veteran anti-nuclear activist and journalist Praful Bidwai claims that while Iranian authorities "will not sacrifice [Iran's] rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to engage in peaceful activities, including uranium enrichment for power generation", they are also "keen to reach a deal or compromise on the nuclear issue" and "are also working diplomatic channels to let it be known that Tehran wants talks which will lead to a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue." So far, according to claims by Raw Story, United States vice-president Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense w:Donald Rumsfeld, have obstructed the progress of diplomatic discussions which could help solve the conflict between the United States and Iran. The conflict involves alleged threats by the United States to attack Iran and Iran's alleged intention to develop nuclear weapons.

<h1>IAEA Iran report leaked</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=IAEA%20Iran%20report%20leaked&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Director-General of the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, has issued a new report titled "Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the &lt;a href="Islamic%20Republic%20of%20Iran"&gt;Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/a&gt;" and distributed it to members of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; and the Agency's member states, but notes that the report is to remain secret, stating that "unless the IAEA Board of Governors and Security Council decide otherwise, the Agency cannot authorise its release to the public."

Iran is presently neither a member of the UN Security Council nor of the IAEA Board of Governors. 

As of 20:52, 29 April 2006 (UTC) or earlier, the report was &lt;a href="http%3A//www.payvand.com/news/06/apr/1242.html"&gt;made available on the Internet&lt;/a&gt; on the website ♡❤payvand.com♡❤, dated April 28, 2006. It is unknown whether or not the release was authorised by the United Nations Security Council or the IAEA.

The report's concluding paragraphs summarise the IAEA's findings: "33. All the nuclear material declared by Iran to the Agency is accounted for. Apart from the small quantities previously reported to the Board, the Agency has found no other undeclared nuclear material in Iran. However, gaps remain in the Agency's knowledge with respect to the scope and content of Iran's centrifuge programme. Because of this, and other gaps in the Agency's knowledge, including the role of the military in Iran's nuclear programme, the Agency is unable to make progress in its efforts to provide assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. ... 37. The Agency will pursue its investigation of all remaining outstanding issues relevant to Iran's nuclear activities, and the Director General will continue to report as appropriate."

&lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;'s second in command &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt; has released a new videotape onto the internet.

On the tape, Zawahiri said that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; forces "have achieved nothing but loss, disaster and misfortune."

"Al-Qaeda in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; alone has carried out 800 martyrdom operations in three years, besides the victories of the other mujahidin. And this is what has broken the back of America in Iraq," said Zawahiri.

Zawahiri also stated that the President of &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, needed to be overthrown.

"The West which claims to support democracy ... is encouraging Musharraf to stay in power by any means after he demonstrated his aptitude at killing Muslims. I call on the Pakistani people to stand with Islam against the Zionist-Crusader assault ... and topple this bribe-taking treacherous criminal," said Zawahiri.

"Musharraf is fanning the flames of civil war in Pakistan on behalf of America in &lt;a href="w%3AWaziristan"&gt;Waziristan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABaluchistan"&gt;Baluchistan&lt;/a&gt;. He is inviting the Pakistani army to fight its own people and brothers and turn a blind eye to the Indian threat," added Zawahiri.

The tape is 16 minutes long. On April 23, the leader of al-Qaeda, &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; released an audiotape onto the Internet. Leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt;, released a tape just two days after bin Laden's.

British &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Clarke"&gt;Charles Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, is facing increasing pressure to resign from office over a scandal involving the release of foreign prisoners without subsequent &lt;a href="w%3Adeportation"&gt;deportation&lt;/a&gt; hearings.

It was recently revealed that, since 1999, 1,023 prisoners were released after serving their sentences, but were not subjected to deportation hearings to determine whether they should be allowed to stay in the United Kingdom. Five of the criminals have subsequently &lt;a href="w%3Arecidivism"&gt;re-offended&lt;/a&gt;, with crimes involving drugs and violence. "It's clear that the increasing numbers of cases being referred for consideration led to the process falling down," said Clarke, "I do apologise. I have apologised, I continue to do so." 
Despite the admission of error on behalf of his department, the Home Secretary faces the very real threat of further crimes committed by the released offenders and still more pressure to resign. An intense effort is under way by the &lt;a href="w%3APolicing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; and immigration services to track down 63 of the higher-risk released offenders, and more arrests are expected today.

A Spanish-language version of the U.S. national anthem "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Star-Spangled%20Banner"&gt;The Star-Spangled Banner&lt;/a&gt;" has sparked controversy amid a developing debate over the status of illegal immigrants.

Produced by British record producer Adam Kidron and due to be released Friday, the recording "Nuestro Himno" (Our Anthem) features recording artists &lt;a href="w%3AWyclef%20Jean"&gt;Wyclef Jean&lt;/a&gt;, hip-hop star Armando "Pitbull" Perez, and Puerto Rican singers Carlos Ponce and Olga Tanon.

The song uses Spanish lyrics based closely on the English original, says Kidron. However, a remix planned for release in June will include lines critical of U.S. immigration policy.

President George W. Bush declared Friday that the anthem should be sung in English and not Spanish. "I think the national anthem ought to be sung in English, and I think people who want to be a citizen of this country ought to learn English and they ought to learn to sing the national anthem in English," said Bush.

In response, Kidron said, "The intention of recording 'Nuestro Himno' (Our Anthem) has never been to discourage immigrants from learning English and embracing American culture. We instead view 'Nuestro Himno' as a song that affords those immigrants that have not yet learned the English language the opportunity to fully understand the character of the Star-Spangled Banner, the American flag and the ideals of freedom that they represent."

News of the release of "Nuestro Himno" sparked surprise and outrage on Internet blogs. Columnist Michelle Malkin called the Spanish-language version an attempt to "pander to ethnic grievance-mongers who don't respect American laws or traditions." &lt;a href="http%3A//michellemalkin.com/archives/005098.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The political website ♡❤The American Street♡❤ points out that the U.S. Bureau of Education commissioned a Spanish-language translation of the anthem in 1919, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.reachm.com/amstreet/archives/2006/04/29/la-bandera-de-las-estrellas/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is displayed on the Library of Congress' website. &lt;a href="http%3A//lcweb2.loc.gov/cocoon/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.100000007/default.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The melody to "The Star-Spangled Banner" itself was borrowed from English drinking song "&lt;a href="w%3ATo%20Anacreon%20in%20Heaven"&gt;To Anacreon in Heaven&lt;/a&gt;." Kidron, in noting this, says, "There's no attempt to usurp anything. The intent is to communicate."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Shuttle%20will%20launch%20in%20July%3A%20NASA&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; says that the Space Shuttle Discovery will launch in July as planned and that no more safety changes will take place until after July's launch.

Tests that NASA performed on the shuttle have found that there is no way to stop the "ice frost ramps" that fall off the shuttles when they launch.

"The decision was to fly these ice frost ramps as is, knowing that we can expect to have some small foam loss that could pose a risk," said the shuttle's project director, Wayne Hale in a press conference.

"There was a strong concern from several folks that we should wait until we have a good design on those pieces of foam and then change them as well before we go fly. We considered that very strongly. However, at the end of the day, we came back to the fact that it is more appropriate to make one change at a time to take care of the biggest problem and then work toward the next situation we would like to improve." added Hale.

In February 2003, &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia"&gt;shuttle Columbia&lt;/a&gt; broke up during its return to Earth because 2 foam pieces that fell off the shuttle's fuel tank hit the wing of the shuttle. NASA grounded the fleet until modifications were made to its fuel tank.

In 2005, another piece of foam was seen falling off Discovery, and the fleet was grounded again and the fuel tank had to be redesigned. The redesign removed two pieces of foam from cables that were insulated from wind when the shuttle was taking off.

Hale called the changes the "largest aerodynamic change that we have made since the shuttle first flew."

"We're in a flight test program. When you make a major change, you should fly that major change and if you have to make additional changes then you make them after the flight," said Hale.

NASA is expected to completely retire the shuttles by 2010, but plans at least 16 more flights to complete the International Space Station.

The first “visual issue” of the Emir of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was issued April 25, 2006, by the Mujahideen Shura Council. A thirty-four minute video containing an approximately twenty minute oration by Zarqawi, footage of him leading mujahideen in training on the battlefield and in a war room, and seated amongst local leaders of al-Anbar province. His speech touches upon a variety of topics, including the purportedly victorious and successful state of the mujahideen in Iraq, waging jihad in Iraq while steadying eyes on Jerusalem, and Usama bin Laden’s proposed truce with the West. In fact, the video proper opens with an excerpt of a speech by bin Laden urging Muslim youth to jihad. On the refusal of the proposal, he warns U.S. President George W. Bush, his allies of the “Crusaders, Shi’ites and the converters” that they will never enjoy life as long as blood courses through the veins of the mujahideen.

Zarqawi also speaks of the alleged lies of the administration and the true state of the American soldier in Iraq. He states: “Why don't you tell about the reality of your soldiers and their failure to fight...why don't you tell your people about the soldiers who commit suicide, why don't you tell your people that your soldiers can not have any sleep without taking drugs which makes them like animals… and they are driven by your generals, who are like the Crusaders and evangelists, to the slaughterhouse.” He also condemns the Iraqi political process, and those who speak falsely of being one of the mujahideen, trying to convince Muslims that the government is an attempt to apply Shari’a law.

Concerning the Mujahideen Shura Council, which appeared on the Iraqi land following the seeming disappearance of Zarqawi, he admits to “being one of them” and continues to hold title as the Emir of al-Qaeda in Iraq, part of the umbrella for the mujahideen in that state. “They all stretch their hands and stand on the same line,” Zarqawi argues. Other portions of the video show Zarqawi inspecting local areas, using a rocket with a range of 50 kilometers, and a final image of him firing an automatic weapon, and stating: “American will go out of Iraq, humiliated, defeated.”

In the name of Allah the most Gracious the most Merciful
Mujahedeen Shura Council of Iraq
Then fight in Allah's cause thou are held responsible only for thyself and rouse the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the disbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment (Alnisa’a:84)
O’ Banner’s holders stand,
Where are the lions of Anbar?
Where are the lions of Salah Aldeen?
Where are Baghdad’s men?
Where are the knights of Ninawah and the champions of Dyalah?
Where are the courageous of Kurdustan?
Where are you the lions of Monotheism?

Be fully aware of the apostate media sources.
I swear by Allah, that they have nothing with us except the sharp swords, and between them and us will only be the frightened nights.

I swear by Allah that America will be defeated in Iraq.

(Field commander is talking):

As for the developing and manufacturing, the brothers, by the grace of Allah have developed and improved two missiles in Alanbar province in particular.

(When missile was fired):
Against the make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, of Allah and your enemies, and others besides, whom ye may not know, but whom Allah doth know. (Alanfal:60)

A message for Mankind

I focus this call to the young men of Islam; gather together in fighting the crusades and the Jews, and remember Allah at all times repeatedly, by Allah, it’s either victory or martyrdom. No one will surpass his fate, and he who ever turns out to be a martyr, his sole will freely be flying around the paradise as it wishes, close to the throne of Allah; what a great difference between being near his family and/or near his lord.
O’ young men of Islam every where, especially those near the battles, where the obligation is further; O’ young men in Aljazeera, Egypt, and Sham; O’ siblings of Salah Aldeen, O’ knights of Mohammad Alfateh, continue your support to your brothers in Iraq, whereby the gravest of the wars is continues, and its fire is on the rise, the crusades have invaded them, killed thousands of them, and abducted thousands, whishing to eliminate them. And they are instead, by the grace of Allah, fighting the crusades patiently, giving up all they’ve got for the sake of Allah and in order to defend themselves. May Allah be with them and those who support them.

All praise be to Allah granting might to his religion with his victory, lowering the infidels with his supremacy. Sorting circumstances by his order; Plotting for the disbelievers with his arrangement; He who alternated the days with his divine justice.
And peace be upon who Allah raised the minaret of Islam with his sword.

My treasured nation,
I am conversing to you not with falsehoods, hoping to find with you open ears and prudent hearts, for the honest man does not deceive his family.

The crusade enemy, when invaded Iraq, meant to control this nation and reinforce the Zionist state, from the Nile to the Euphrates. However, Allah granted your sons the Mujahedeen by standing firm before the strongest crusaders attack to the Islamic land.
They stood strong against this attack for over three years, disbursing their soles and their wealth. They stood against this massive military, media, and economical attack not for anything except to defend you, your religion, your sons, and your honor.
Allah dispersed the enemies’ gathering and their defeat became clearer to who ever has eyesight and prudent heart.
Here are your sons, by the grace of Allah, indulging into one battle after another, and attack after attack; they by the will of Allah hold the upper hand in the battle field now.

If it wasn’t for the continuous and ongoing media muting, you would’ve seen the astonishing. By Allah it’s the championships and the victories coming to us, and you my nation should thank Allah for this great bounty, that Allah prepared a group of your sons the Mujahedeen defending you and protecting your honor, otherwise the Sunnah in Iraq would’ve been in between a revulsion crusade and a betraying Shiite. And the women of the Sunnah would’ve been on the laps of the revulsion crusades and the betraying Shiites; Abu Ghraib and the interior ministry jails remain memorable.

My treasured nation,
We are in Iraq a stone throw from the Masjed Alaqsa, we fight in Iraq and our eyes are on Alqsa which will never be freed except with a guiding Quraan and a prevailing sword; “but enough is thy Lord to guide and to help” (Alforqan:31)

The history and experience had showed that you have no one after Allah except your Mujahedeen sons; they are your protection, your strong shield, and your beating heart. They become happy to your happiness and sad to your sadness; they stay up all night for your protection and have jealousy for you. Their hearts burst in sorrow for your state, and their tongues never stop chanting: O’ Allah elevate the state of humiliation and defeat away from my nation, O’ Allah bring back victory to my nation.

As for the American administration, and to its chairman the cross banner’s holder Bush, we say to him and to whoever is swimming in his space from the Jews and the crusades and form the Shiites and others, we say that you will never be safe in the Islamic land, and by Allah you will never feel secured so long we still have a beating nerve and a moving eyelash.
Previously, our leader Osama Bin Laden may Allah protect him, had offered you a long truce. It could’ve been better for you and those who are with you if you’d have accepted, but your arrogance pushed you to refuse. Here you are today, running from east to west trying to find solutions “will not stand except as stands one whom the evil one by his touch hath driven to madness” (Albaqarah:275). You turned to be a grave liar, betraying your own people that everything is under control, and then soon everyone finds out about your lies and so on. You became like the one who’s treating himself from alcohol by alcohol. You were never at any time truthful with yourself or your people, although it’s found some truth in your great grandparents you are fully detached from.
Why don’t you show the truth about your soldiers and their inferior state of struggle?
Why don’t you tell your people about the continuous suicides amongst your soldiers?
Why don’t you tell your people that your soldiers can never go to sleep unless they take the hallucinating and drugging pills? So they become like cattle driven by your war generals, the Neozionists, to the killing fate.
Why don’t you tell your people about the congregational escape and the defiance among your troops?

Listen you grave liar and insolent one; your dreams will never come true, our blood and bodies are between you and your imaginings. And what is coming your way is much greater than what passed by the will of Allah.

The game of rotten democracy that you brought to Iraq, after you gave hope to people about freedom, happiness, and the economical/personal security; all of these lies went with the winds and will never come back by the will of Allah.

There we see you today, trying with all what you got to bring together the clusters, the parties, the partners from your tails to bring about a handicapped government that it might pull you out from your crucial pitfall.

We believe that any government you place in Iraq, whether be it from the betrayal Shiites or Zionist Kurds, or your tails from the Sunnah; it will only be an apostate government that will aid the crusades, and it came only to be a poisoned dagger stabbed in the heart of the Islamic Nation.

America learned today that its planes, tanks, momentous troops, and its tails from the Shiites army will never be able to finalize the battle with Mujahedeen. Therefore, it’s trying to surround the Jehad by pushing its tails from those who are counted to Sunnah, those who accepted to play the role and be a rope that tightens around the Sunnah’s necks and pull the Americans from their defeat. They used those who use the Islamic slogans as a mask to spread their masters’ propaganda on the importance of organizing the military and the police, and confuse the Muslims with their mixed messages injecting poison in honey, forgetting intentionally or not that every occupier throughout history used a cover up face from the occupied to use them in order to establish a solid base and embezzle the wealth of the country and its people.
Allah has said: “And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them” (5:51)
That is by constituting for this life and the hereafter.
And Allah has said: “for Pharaoh and Haman and (all) their hosts were Men of sin” (28:8)

Therefore, we repeat our warning to whoever is trying to reorganize and spread the military and the police forces, which was established only to be a tool for the occupier in their bigger plan, and to implement laws other than the law of Allah.
Be extremely aware, those who join these apostate forces have nothing with us except the sharp swords, and between them and us will be nothing except grave days and nights.
Allah has said;” Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who reject faith fight in the cause of evil: so fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan” (4:76)

Having said the previous, and having mentioned the defeat of the enemy and his paraphernalia. The enemy is trying today to seduce two kinds of people to the alleged parliamentary game to harvest the fruits of the Mujahedeen whom only trying to make the word of Allah prevails.
The first kind of which is the one trying to attach oneself with the Mujahedeen, although they never lived the Mujahedeen life nor they ever supported them at the occupation time. The second of which is those who had at the beginning the honor of fighting the crusades, however what counts is the end; their efforts won’t be accepted by the law of Islam unless they strive with action to make the word of Allah prevails, using what Allah lawfully guided us with, the clean means, not by using evil parliaments striving to have the word of Allah mixed with other man made constitutions and laws. The aim does not justify the means here.
Although these two kinds, and whoever follows their footsteps, allege that they are trying with these parliaments to implement the law of Allah. However, the actions and the historical experiences oppose their myth. Anyone that is following the political map in Iraq knows that the majority of the parliaments’ members are from the Shiites and the atheists of Kurds and Sunnah, not to mention those of the mixed motion believes. Therefore, the heavy side in the balance of the parliaments will always be in the hand of evil.
Allah has said: “beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee” (5:49)

And Allah has said: “Fast thou not turned thy vision to those who declare that they believe in the revelations that have come to thee and to those before thee? their (real) wish is to resort together for judgment (in their disputes) to the evil one, though they were ordered to reject him but Satan's wish is to lead them astray far away (from the right” (4:60)
As for you patient truthful Mujahedeen, may Allah accept from you and us the best of deeds, and may Allah bless your Jehad. You were able by the will of Allah and his support to stop this crusades’ attack and you’ve bounded him with injuries. Thus, continue your Jehad and operations, and elevate your hits, it’s only the sign of victory and it’s the last breath of the cross worshipers in the land of two rivers. The low fighting self-esteem of the crusades’ soldiers is an only obvious sign in Iraq. Therefore, renew your intentions, and correct yourselves, and carry on together against your enemy. Your enemy is uncovered, by the will of Allah, weakened, unprotected, and broken in pieces. Do not give him a chance to take its breath, continue your stabbings one after the other, O’ Banner’s holders stand,

Where’s are the lions of Anbar?
Where are the lions of Salah Aldeen?
Where are Baghdad’s men?
Where are the knights of Ninawah and the champions of Dyalah?
Where are the courageous of Kurdustan?
Where are you the lions of Monotheism?
O’ siblings of Khaled and Muthananh, Saad and Meqdad and Salah Aldeen.
Where are the immigrants? Where are the supporters?
Where are the people of Surat Altawbah and Alanfal?
Where are the people of Alfath and Alqital?

O’ leaders of this nation; who is for the crying women, who is for the jailed dignified women, who is for the purified women in the jails of the Shiites.
O’ Allah, there is no life except the life of the hereafter, O’ Allah grant victory to immigrants and their supporters.

Be very aware from the embezzlers, with their masters the crusades, trying to surround you. Be aware and extremely aware from putting down your weapons, and then you will harvest nothing but the defeat, beat and crush in this life and the hereafter.
You were always supplicating to Allah day and night to ease the way for you to join the Jehad in Afghanistan and Chechnya or other places. After that, Allah chose you for the trade of Jehad at your own land, and opened for you the doors of paradise. Be extremely aware of closing these blessed doors, be aware “And be not like a woman who breaks into untwisted strands the yarn which she has spun, after it has become strong”(16:92)

Do not let the trade of Jehad depart your land; otherwise you will be disgraced and you’ll be only ruled by the scum; “they set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons and let your women folk live” (2:49)

“If ye turn back (from the Path), He will substitute in your stead another people; then they would not be like you” (47:38)

Finally, I glad tied the nation by establishing the Mujahedeen Shura Council of Iraq, which will be by the grace and will of Allah as the kernel for the establishment of an Islamic State, in which, the word of Allah prevails. All praise be to Allah, the efforts are being joined, and the hands are being extended and shaken for the obedience of Allah and his messenger and the Jehad in the cause of Allah. And this Council will be, by the will of Allah, an umbrella for every truthful Mujahed. I am honored to be one member of this blessed Council under its blessed leadership. At the same time remaining the Ameer (leader) of the Alqaeda Organization in the land of two rivers (Iraq).

The servant of Jehad and Mujahedeen, glorifying Allah, your brother Abu Musaab Alzarqawi.
Friday, 23 Rabii Awal 1427,
April 21, 2006.

All praise be to Allah.

In the name of Allah the most gracious the most merciful, and peace be upon our prophet Muhammad his family and companions.

I welcome our beloved sheikh in the land of Anbar, the land of Jehad. And we ask Allah to keep it a thorn in the eyes of the disbelievers.

I would like to inform about the great victory in the battles of Ramadi, killing many of the disbelievers and taking over the center and headquarter of the infidels.
Taking over the city for several days, preventing the crusades from even coming near it.
And this operation was a clear message against the visit by the infidels’ ambassadors ( Rice and Straw).
In general, the self esteem of the Mujahedeen is high, in opposite to the infidels whom are always in continuous deterioration.

As for the developing and manufacturing, the brothers, by the grace of Allah have developed and improved two missiles in Alanbar province in particular, that will be used soon, one has the ability to travel 40km with a 50kg warhead, here’s a picture of it…

Then fight in Allah's cause thou are held responsible only for thyself and rouse the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the disbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment (Alnisa’a:84)

And the other is anti armored vehicles, is carried on the shoulder and has been internally modified to penetrate armored vehicles, and here’s a picture of it.

“It is part of the mercy of Allah that dost deal gently with them. Wert thou severe or harsh hearted, they would have broken away from about thee: so pass over (their faults), and ask for (Allah\'s) forgiveness them in affairs (of moment). Then when thou hast taken a decision, put thy trust in Allah. For Allah loves those who put their trust (in him” (3:159)

If Allah helps you, non can overcome you: if he forsakes you, who is there, after that, that can help you? in God, then, let believers put their trust (3:160)

Sheikh Ayman Alzahahre’s voice:
O’ Islamic Nation, the turf of Iraq now is the most dangerous field of Jehad in this century. Therefore, the nation must support the courageous Mujahedeen that are fighting in the very forefront defending the honor of Islam and its dignity.

Sheikh Abu Musaab: by Allah, American will be defeated in Iraq, by the will of Allah, and it’ll leave Iraq humiliated, crushed, and defeated by the will of Allah.

A video released by the Mujahideen Shura Council operating in Iraq shows an attack on an American sniper town in the city of Ramadi.

At the beginning of the clip it says this is revenge on the sniper who killed a young girl and her mother. Apparently the sniper also killed a local civilian on Monday.

The official press release by the group is translated, quoted below, and sourced. 
In the name of Allah the most Gracious the most Merciful

O’ Allah, straighten up our aim and make us stand firm

All Praise and thanks are Allah’s, the Lord of all that exists. And peace be upon our prophet Muhammad, his family and companions in entirety.

<h1>Mexico on the verge of decriminalizing possession of small amounts of drugs</h1>

The &lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Congress of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; has passed a bill that will &lt;a href="w%3Adecriminalize"&gt;decriminalize&lt;/a&gt; the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use. The passage of the bill has drawn criticism from &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;
Under the law possession of up to five grams of &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;, half a gram of &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; (or about 4 lines) or 25 milligrams of &lt;a href="w%3Aheroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; would no longer be a crime in Mexico. In addition, possession of small amounts of &lt;a href="w%3ALSD"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMDA"&gt;MDA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aecstasy"&gt;ecstasy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Amethamphetamine"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; would also be legalized, officials said.

Current Mexican drug possession law allows charges to be dropped against defendants if they can prove that they are addicts and if the amount is the quantity necessary for personal use. The new law reportedly removes the "addict" requirement and sets specific legal quantities

President Vicente Fox is expected to sign the bill. According to President Fox's spokesman, Ruben Aguilar, "This law gives police and prosecutors better legal tools to combat drug crimes that do so much damage to our youth and children."

San Diego Mayor and former police chief Jerry Sanders seems to disagree, calling the legislation "appallingly stupid, reckless and incredibly dangerous." 

"If enacted, even the most reasonable person will have room to question Mexico's commitment to the war on drugs," he said. "I think many, including myself, will view this as a hostile action by a longtime ally to the United States."

'&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sultan%27s%20Elephant"&gt;The Sultan's Elephant&lt;/a&gt;', an enormous theatrical spectacle, has arrived in London on the start of its four day show. The elephant, a huge moving stage measuring forty feet high and weighing 42 tonnes, is the creation of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20de%20Luxe"&gt;Royal de Luxe&lt;/a&gt; theatre company. The elephant will move through London, accompanied by a troop of puppeteers and circus acts, telling the story of the Sultan who set off to find the little girl from his dreams with a time-travelling elephant.

The story began on Wednesday, when a 'crashed spaceship' landed in London, smashing up the pavement around it. The elephant first made an appearance on the Thursday.

The Mujahideen Shura Council, in seven communiqués issued amongst nearly two dozen between today, April 28, 2006 and yesterday, claims responsibility for a suicide bombing in al-Basra targeting British forces, several bombings and sniper attacks targeting American and Iraqi forces, and the attempted murder of the Iraqi Minister of Interior.

3. An improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated on the motorcade of the Iraqi Minister of Interior in an attempted assassination in Baghdad. In this third message, the group states: “We ask Allah to help us to get his head the next time”.

4. On Wednesday, April 26 an IED was detonated on a “Crusader” armored vehicle in al-Mosul, destroying it and killing its occupants.

5. The fifth communiqué indicates that a rocket was fired at an American Humvee in al-Ameriya on April 24.

Conference committee negotiators in the Hawaii state legislature have reached agreement on a bill that will suspend Hawaii's controversial &lt;a href="w%3Agasoline"&gt;gasoline&lt;/a&gt; price control law, commonly known as the "gas cap."

Under the proposed bill created by the conference committee, the current gas cap law would be immediately suspended for an indefinite period. The cap price would continue to be calculated, but the governor would have sole discretion to reinstate the price cap. The bill would also call for increased reporting of profits by oil companies.

The bill draft still needs majority approval by both houses (which appears likely), and signature by Governor Linda Lingle.

The current law uses wholesale gasoline prices from three Mainland markets to set the maximum price that oil companies can charge for gasoline. Retailers are free to charge whatever they wish. 

The law was proposed by the Democratic-controlled legislature during a time when oil company profits in Hawaii compared with the Mainland came under intense scrutiny. Republicans, including Lingle, opposed the bill.

Since the law went into effect in September 2005, price fluctuations due to the disruption of gasoline supply in the wake of Hurrican Katrina have resulted in gas prices of more than $3.00 a gallon in Honolulu, with significantly higher prices on the Neighbor Islands. Currently prices of unleaded gasoline in Honolulu range from $3.00 to $3.42 per gallon, the highest in the nation. 

During the current legislative session which expires Thursday, the House of Representatives (the lower house) passed a version calling for outright repeal of the law, while the Senate (the upper house) called for modification of the formula used to calculate the cap.

However, in recent weeks, the main proponent of the gasoline price cap law, Senator Ron Menor (D-Mililani), softened his position, allowing for an indefinite suspension of the gas cap. Negotiations between the House and Senate had reached an impasse over the calculation of the cap level. Senate negotiators pushed for a formula that would have set cap levels about 15 to 20 cents lower than the current formula. The leadership of the legislature intervened as the deadline for conference committee reports loomed.

Hawaii is the only state in the United States to institute price controls on gasoline in recent years.

Indian embassy officials in Afghanistan confirmed today that the body of the abducted &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; engineer K. Suryanarayana had been found in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; abducted Suryanarayana at gunpoint on Friday. 

His abductors had stated that if all Indian citizens in Afghanistan did not leave that country by 7 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Standard%20Time"&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt; (1330 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) today, Suryanarayana, who they claimed was an "American spy", would be killed. Suryanarayana was apparently killed while he was trying to escape a few hours ago. The Indian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADr.%20Manmohan%20Singh"&gt;Dr. Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; has condemned the beheading, calling it an "inhuman act". Indian security forces are enroute to Afghanistan to investigate the matter and the Indian Foreign Secretary Mr. Shyam Saran has said that India will do whatever it takes to bring the perpetrators of this brutal murder to justice. Suryanarayana leaves behind his wife and three children.

The protestors bussed and drove 56km from &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; out to the Barwon maximum security prison to voice their disapproval of the treatment of the 13 men accused of terror offences who are currently being held in the Acacia Unit of the prison. Some of the accused have been held in solitary confinement for 6 months up to and during their trial.

The group Civil Rights Defence organised the event with family members of the accused and news reporters as a peaceful protest. A small group of about 15 police officers awaited the arrival of the group. The police said that their main concern was the health and safety of everyone as the protest was being held next to a busy road. Officers only approached when the &lt;a href="w%3ACountry%20Fire%20Authority"&gt;Country Fire Authority&lt;/a&gt; was summoned by a passerby to put out an open camp fire, as there was fire restriction in effect in the area. The fire fighters were met with laughter and sarcastic applause. Enclosed fires and barbeques were considered acceptable.
The men being held are Nacer Benbirka, Shane Gregory Kent, Aiman Joud, Fadl Sayadi, Hany Taha, Amer Haddara Izzydeen Atik, Abdullah Meri, Shoue Hammoud, Bassem Raad, Ezzit Raad, Ahmed Raad and Majed Raad. 

In a statement read at the protest, one of the accused and his wife (Eman Abdou and Shane Kent) said they were upset at the Australian media for participating in lying to the Australian public and the government for the way they have treated the accused. 

"I believe the conditions out at the Barwon Prison Acacua Unit are oppressive and inhumane. Furthermore I am upset at the Australian media for participating in lying to the Australian public. These men have a right to a fair trial, and everyone is innocent until proven guilty," the statement read.
The statement also went on say that the limited legal visits were often shortened and that the best treated accused are in solitary confinement for 18 hours a day while some are in solitary confinement consistently. Omar Mehri, the brother of one of the accused spoke at the day's event and talked about verbal harassment and hate mail he and his family have received. He also talked of his brother being amazed to see grass after 5 months.

Speakers at the event said the current laws used to prosecute murderers and other criminals should be used to prosecute terrorist suspects and had the same sentiments as Eman Abdou and Shane Kent. They said the laws were unjust and the treatment of the accused was cruel and unusual, constituting torture under the terms of the UN charter. 

Omar Merhi, brother of one of the detained said in a statement "My brother and the other arrested men are confused and want to know why they are in Australia's highest security unit for simply practising their religion."

Two miners trapped since Tuesday in the &lt;a href="w%3ABeaconsfield%2C%20Tasmania"&gt;Beaconsfield&lt;/a&gt; Mine in &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, have reportedly been found alive by rescuers. Todd Russell and Brandt Webb were trapped by a rockfall caused by a minor earthquake on Tuesday night. Hopes for their survival had faded after the body of a fellow trapped miner, Larry Knight, was discovered on Thursday.

According to the mine's owners, the men are located in the mine where they were last seen, over 900m below the surface. Rescuers are communicating with, but still unable to free, the trapped men, and will be supplying them with food and water. It could be up to 48 hours before the men are extracted from the mine.

Ten people have been injured at the Royal &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt; Show after they were allegedly hit by a vehicle driven by a 82-year-old woman. The Bathurst Show is the largest agricultural show in regional &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

According to police, the incident happened at 5:10 p.m. Saturday (0710 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) when a Mazda sedan driven by an 82 year-old woman reversed into a large crowd which had been standing about the showground ring. Saturday is typically the busiest day of the show, with many events taking place in the ring.

Police and St. John Ambulance personnel who were already present at the show arrived almost immediately and began providing assistance. After assessing the incident, additional police, rescue, ambulance and fire personnel were deployed.

Those injured range in age from five to 71 years. The most severe of the injuries were sustained by a 71 year-old man who suffered head injuries and a five year old boy from a neighbouring city who suffered both head and severe leg injuries. Both have been airlifted to Westmead Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and are described as being in a critical condition.

Other injured people were taken to both Bathurst and &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt; Base Hospitals.

The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital suffering from shock.

Police are investigating the incident, have seized the involved car, and questioned witnesses.

Saturday saw London's Trafalgar Square play host to a '&lt;a href="w%3ALove%20Music%20Hate%20Racism"&gt;Love Music Hate Racism&lt;/a&gt;' anti-racism concert, ahead of the local elections taking place this week. The event aimed to celebrate multi-racial society and to send out a message telling people to use their vote to stop the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20National%20Party"&gt;British National Party&lt;/a&gt; gaining council seats in the election.

The lineup of bands at the event included &lt;a href="w%3ABelle%20%26amp%3B%20Sebastian"&gt;Belle &amp; Sebastian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Paddingtons"&gt;The Paddingtons&lt;/a&gt;, with speakers including &lt;a href="w%3AGurinder%20Chadha"&gt;Gurinder Chadha&lt;/a&gt; (director of &lt;a href="w%3ABend%20it%20like%20Beckham"&gt;Bend it like Beckham&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3AKat%20Fletcher"&gt;Kat Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANUS"&gt;NUS&lt;/a&gt; President).

Love Music Hate Racism was set up in 2002 in response to rising levels of racism and electoral successes for the British National Party, whose policies are often considered fascist and designed to provoke racism. The organisation has arranged over 200 events across the UK. The organisation is inspired by &lt;a href="w%3ARock%20Against%20Racism"&gt;Rock Against Racism&lt;/a&gt;, a similar group set up in the 1970s to challenge the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Front"&gt;National Front&lt;/a&gt;, famed for gigs featuring &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Clash"&gt;The Clash&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Robinson%20Band"&gt;Tom Robinson Band&lt;/a&gt;.

Fears that the BNP may do well in the elections this week have grown since &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret_Hodge"&gt;Employment Minister Margaret Hodge&lt;/a&gt; warned MPs that the BNP might make gains. Since her announcement, the number of voters considering voting for the BNP has been shown to grow in some polls, prompting some to criticise her announcement as being potentially counter-productive.

Police estimate that 3,000 people attended the event on Saturday.

On Saturday, April, 29, 2006, US President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; appeared alongside impersonator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bridges"&gt;Steve Bridges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to deliver a self-lampooning comedy act at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Correspondents%27%20Association"&gt;White House Correspondents' Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dinner. The annual event is well known for its evening lineup of fun-filled theatrics, attended by politicians and people from the media and entertainment industries. In his double-act with Bridges, Bush sent up his reputation for delivering nonsense lines and making verbal gaffes (for which the word '&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABushism"&gt;Bushism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' has been coined).

Bush talked about spreading his agenda "globally and around the world, as well as internationally", whilst Bridges, who delivered many of the more cutting lines, said, "How come I can't have dinner with the 36 percent of the people who like me?" The President's pronunciation of the word "nuclear" and Dick Cheney's hunting accident were also mocked.

The primary source for edgy political humor that Saturday night, however, occurred when rising star of ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Colbert%20Report"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Colbert"&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , assumed the helm as critic. With the President sitting visibly within several feet, Colbert warmed up the act by sarcastically admiring the president for thinking "with his gut, and not the head". 

Colbert's character, which shares his name, is a based on right-wing news channel personalities. "Fox News gives you both sides of the story — the president's side and the vice president's side," he said. Colbert's jabs at the president and his administration, usually made from the &lt;a href="Comedy%20Central"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/a&gt; studio in Manhattan, garnered nervous laughter from the &lt;a href="Washington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; audience. Although visibly red-faced, Bush sat quietly as Colbert continued to dig deeper into what bloggers and pundits are now considering to be the unfriendliest presidential roast in WHCA history.

Colbert didn't spare the White House correspondents, either:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; But, listen, let's review the rules. Here's how it works: the president makes decisions. He's the decider. The press secretary announces those decisions, and you people of the press type those decisions down. Make, announce, type. Just put 'em through a spell check and go home. Get to know your family again. Make love to your wife. Write that novel you got kicking around in your head. You know, the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration. You know - fiction!

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – Stephen Colbert, &lt;i&gt;White House Correspondents' Association Dinner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Since the event, which was held at the Washington Hilton on Saturday night, the full 25 minute &lt;a href="http%3A//blogs.citypages.com/ctg/2006/04/the_truthiness.asp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/4/30/1441/59811"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; have been circulating extensively via the Internet.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Planetarium"&gt;London Planetarium&lt;/a&gt;, famous for its distinctive green dome and for being next to &lt;a href="w%3AMadame%20Tussauds"&gt;Madame Tussauds&lt;/a&gt;, will close this week to make way for a new celebrity-themed show opening in July. The Planetarium used to be an attraction in its own right, but in recent years has become simply a feature tacked onto the end of the waxworks tour, the original 45 minute show cut down to just over 10 minutes. The planetarium will be renamed 'The Auditorium' and will feature a show that "gets to the heart of celebrity", being produced in collaboration with animation house &lt;a href="w%3AAardman%20Productions"&gt;Aardman Productions&lt;/a&gt;.

Famous astronomer &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Patrick%20Moore"&gt;Sir Patrick Moore&lt;/a&gt; has called the decision "most regrettable", and many have commented that the change from space to celebrity is an unfortunate sign of our times.

To say 'farewell' to the planetarium, Tussauds have allowed free entry in its penultimate week, from 24th - 30th April. Visitors could enter through the group admissions entrance to see the show, running every twenty minutes. Unlike the queues for Madame Tussauds, which typically run right up the street, few people waited to see the planetarium show, even on the Saturday. The show, titled ♡❤Journey to Infinity♡❤, was projected onto the inside of the dome using Digistar 3 digital projectors. It told the story of space, starting from Earth and zooming out to reveal the other planets in the Solar System, the Milky Way, the other galaxies and the rest of the universe. It ended with an optimistic message suggesting that humans would continue to explore space, going further than ever before.

The London Planetarium opened in 1958 on the site of an old cinema that was destroyed in the second world war. Evening laser performances called 'Laserium' were held between 1977 and 1990. A £4.5 million redevelopment saw it relaunch in 1995 with a new '&lt;a href="w%3ADigistar%20II"&gt;Digistar II&lt;/a&gt;' monochromatic 3D projection system. This was upgraded to the full-colour '&lt;a href="w%3ADigistar%203"&gt;Digistar 3&lt;/a&gt;' system in 2004 which is currently in use.

The planetarium at the also famous &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Observatory%2C%20Greenwich"&gt;Royal Observatory in Greenwich&lt;/a&gt; has also been closed since September 2004, however this is due to re-open in 2007 having received a £15 million redevelopment programme. It will be three times the size of the old planetarium, and has received backing from Astronomer Royal &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Rees%2C%20Baron%20Rees%20of%20Ludlow"&gt;Sir Martin Rees&lt;/a&gt;, and the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Brown%20%28professor%29"&gt;Professor John Brown&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ALegislator"&gt;Legislators&lt;/a&gt; in three states have introduced resolutions calling for the &lt;a href="w%3AImpeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;impeachment&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;. 
US state legislators Karen Yarbrough of Illinois, &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Koretz"&gt;Paul Koretz&lt;/a&gt; of California, and &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Zuckerman"&gt;David Zuckerman&lt;/a&gt; of Vermont have each introduced resolutions to begin impeachment proceedings. Yarbrough and Koretz are Democrats, and Zuckerman is a member of the Vermont Progressive Party.

Yarbrough's resolution charges Bush with directing the &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; to perform &lt;a href="w%3ANSA%20warrantless%20surveillance%20controversy"&gt;surveillance without a warrant&lt;/a&gt; in violation of the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt;; violating the torture conventions of the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Convention"&gt;Geneva Convention&lt;/a&gt;, and "leaking classified national secrets to further an agenda." Koretz' similar resolution also calls for Cheney to be impeached.

Zuckerman introduced a resolution last Tuesday in the &lt;a href="w%3AVermont%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Vermont House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; that asks Congress to "initiate impeachment proceedings against President George W. Bush." The resolution says "George W. Bush has committed high crimes and misdemeanors as he has repeatedly and intentionally violated the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;United States Constitution&lt;/a&gt; and other laws of the United States." Twelve Vermont state representatives (Democrats, Progressives, 1 Independent) have endorsed the resolution.

The Illinois resolution invokes Section 603 of &lt;a href="w%3AJefferson%27s%20Manual"&gt;Jefferson's Rules&lt;/a&gt; for the national House and Senate, which allows for the introduction of impeachment charges "by charges transmitted from 
the legislature of a State or territory." Section 604 also states that an impeachment charge brought by any means would be a privileged motion, superseding most other business in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

As of April 30, the Illinois resolution has been referred to the Rules Committee and has been sponsored by 17 representatives including Yarbrough.

In response to the Vermont resolution, the state's Republican Party Chairman James Barnett said, "If this is the best they can do at this late hour of the legislative session, then it's time to close down shop and go home for the summer so they can explain to their constituents that they didn't reform health care because they were too busy trying to impeach the president."

According to a CBS poll, the &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20perception%20and%20assessments%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President's public approval rating&lt;/a&gt; has steadily declined, and is so far at an all time low of 33%.

Suspected Muslim militants shot dead over 20 villagers in the &lt;a href="w%3ADoda"&gt;Doda&lt;/a&gt; district of the &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n state of &lt;a href="w%3AJammu%20%26amp%3B%20Kashmir"&gt;Jammu &amp; Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; early on Monday morning.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but police suspect that the &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3ALashkar-e-Toiba"&gt;Lashkar-e-Toiba&lt;/a&gt; is involved and have called the attack "pre-planned."

Eyewitnesses say armed men in military fatigues raided the village, made the residents line up and then opened fire on them injuring 9 villagers and killing the rest. 

The attack comes just after by-elections in the state and just before Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt;'s meeting with militant leaders. The Union Home Ministry has convened an emergency meeting in New Delhi. Officers from the Intelligence Bureau are also likely to be present.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; federal minister for families, Mal Brough, has told a function in the &lt;a href="w%3AHunter%20Valley%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Hunter Valley&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales'&lt;/a&gt; central east that he plans to introduce a system forcing parents, who receive welfare payments and who also are identified as neglecting their children, to pay their bills.

Under the proposal, parents who are identified will be required to attend an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ACentrelink"&gt;Centrelink&lt;/a&gt; (the agency responsible for welfare payments) to arrange for up to 30 percent of their benefits be automatically deducted to pay their bills and buy food.

Mr Brough says that there are a small percentage of parents who neglect their children, by spending their welfare payments on alcohol, drugs or gambling. The families minister says these parents neglect their children by failing to provide their children with food and clothing.

During his speech, Mr Brough said that many had expressed concerns about the government being able to identify those "abusing" the system but said that school principals, welfare workers, police and courts would be able to identify children in such situations.

Mr Brough said that similar voluntary programs operating in &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20York"&gt;Cape York&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; had operated successfully and that similar programs should be bought in nation-wide. He said that not every family suffering from these problems would voluntarily take up the scheme and that the government would need to make it compulsory for some families.

Australian welfare organisations have criticized the plan claiming it is impractical.

Lin Hatfield Dodds from the Australian Council of Social Service said that the government needed to do more to assist families in crisis, but the problems raised by the government were "human problems and not financial problems".

&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Nationals&lt;/a&gt; senator, Barnaby Joyce who holds the balance of power in the Australian senate said he would not support the proposal if it was rushed into parliament as part of this years budget, expected to be handed down next week. "I don't think anything you do in a rush works out terribly well," said Mr Joyce.

Kim Beazley, leader of the Australian opposition said that the government would not be able to organise such a system, saying that they were unable to organise "a kick in a street fight".

ImageSat International, the &lt;a href="w%3AIsreal"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; company that operates the recently launched photo/&lt;a href="w%3Aspy%20satellite"&gt;spy satellite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEROS%20%28satellite%29"&gt;Eros B&lt;/a&gt;, published its first photographs of potential targets in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;. Analysts say the timing of this announcement shows that Israel intends to carefully monitor &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20program%20of%20Iran"&gt;Iran's nuclear facilities&lt;/a&gt; to assess the threat for Israeli security. The dual-use satellite, second in the EROS series, can observe small details on the ground at very high resolution. 

Israelis commemorate today those who have fallen in military service and in terror attacks since the UN resolution on the establishment of the state in November 29, 1947. Israeli Chief of Staff, Major General Dan Halutz, said that the threat from Iran shows that Israel must be strong to defend its people.

&lt;a href="w%3ABolivia"&gt;Bolivian&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt; has ordered that all foreign-owned natural gas fields be turned over to the national government of Bolivia. 

President Morales signed a decree that orders troops to seize the fields "immediately" to ensure gas production. The decree also says that companies have 180 days to sign over their fields or leave the country.

The fields are owned by such companies as the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' Exxon-Mobil Corporation, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;'s Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Spanish-Argentine Repsol YPF SA, and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;'s BG Group PLC and BP PLC. 

"The looting by the foreign companies has ended. We are not a government of mere promises, we follow through on what we propose and what the people demand. We want to ask (the Armed Forces) that starting now, they occupy all the energy fields in Bolivia along with battalions of engineers," said Mr Morales after signing the decree.

"The time has come, the awaited day, a historic day in which Bolivia retakes absolute control of our natural resources," added President Morales.

One of Morales' vows in his presidential campaign was to "recover" the country's natural resources by renationalizing them. President Morales explained, on a visit to Brazil in January, that renationalising the industry would not mean expelling foreign companies or expropriating foreign property. "Foreign companies have every right to recover investments and make profits, but profits should be balanced".

Bolivia has the second largest supply of natural gas in South America after &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;.

Workers and trade union members have taken part in the traditional May Day march in London, ending in a rally at Trafalger Square. TUC leader &lt;a href="w%3ABrendan%20Barber"&gt;Brendan Barber&lt;/a&gt; addressed the crowd, praising the labour movement and expressing solidarity with the workers of the Peugeot manufacturing plant in Coventry, who face redundancy.

An estimated 40,000 people took part.

<h1>Blue Security anti-spam community target of large-scale spam attack</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Blue%20Security%20anti-spam%20community%20target%20of%20large-scale%20spam%20attack&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Beginning Monday morning, many BlueFrog and Blue Security users began receiving an email warning them that if they did not remove their email addresses from the Blue Security registry, they would begin to receive huge amounts of unsolicited email. As quickly as four hours after the initial warning message, some users began to receive an unprecedented amount of spam. Most of the messages were simply useless text. Users reported that Blue Security's website was unavailable or extremely slow in responding.

Blue Security is an online community dedicated to fighting spam. As they became more popular, their member list increased substantially. The members' email address is encrypted and added to a list of e-mail addresses that wish to stop receiving spam. Blue Security maintains the encrypted list, which uses an &lt;a href="w%3ACryptographic_hash_function"&gt;encrypted hash function&lt;/a&gt;. Spammers are encouraged to remove all addressed from their email list that are also in Blue Security's Do Not Intrude Registry by using free compliance tools available at Blue Security's web site.

According to &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bluesecurity.com/2006/05/the_blue_indepe.html"&gt;Blue Security's web site&lt;/a&gt;, "A major spammer had started spamming our members with discouraging messages in an attempt to demoralize our community. This spammer is using mailing lists he already owns that may contain addresses of some community members." Reportedly, Blue Security has received complaints from users about spam allegedly sent from Blue Security promoting their anti-spam solution and web site. 

Blue Security states they are "an anti-spam company determined to fight spam and as such never has and never will send unsolicited email." There are also reports of non-users of BlueSecurity/BlueFrog receiving the warning emails, which now seems is also being sent to email addresses of people who have never added their email address to Blue Security's Do Not Intrude Registry.

<h2>Warning messages in spam emails</h2>
There are several versions of the warning messages, two are copied below:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; You are being emailed because you are a user of BlueSecurity's well-known software BlueFrog. (http://www.bluesecurity.com/)

&lt;p&gt;Today, the BlueSecurity database became known to the worst spammers worldwide. Within 48 hours, the database will be published on the Internet, and your email address will be open to them all. After this, you will see the spam sent to your mailbox increase 10 - 20 fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlueSecurity was illegally attacking email marketers, and doing so with your help. Many websites have been targeted and hit, including non-spam sites. BlueSecurity's software has been fully analyzed, and contains an abundance of malicious code. This includes: ability to send mass mail to users; the ability to attack websites with Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS); the ability to open hidden doors on any machine on which it is running; and a hidden auto-update code function, which can install anything on your computer and open it up to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlueSecurity lists a USA address as their place of business, whereas their main office is in Tel Aviv. BlueSecurity is run by a few Russian-born Jews, who have previously been spamming themselves. When all is said and done, they will be able to run, hide and change their identities, leaving you to take the fall. YOU CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES and expect to get away with it. This email ensures that you are well aware of the situation. Soon, you will be found guilty of computer crimes such as DDOS attacking of websites, conspiracy, and sending mass unsolicited bulk email messages for everything from viagra to porn, as long as you continue to run BlueFrog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do not take money for downloading their software, they do not take money for removing emails from their lists, and they have no visible revenue stream. What they DO have is 500,000 computers sitting there awaiting their next command. What are they doing now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1. Using your computer to send spam ?
2. Using your computer to attack competitor websites?
3. Phishing through your files for your identity and banking information?&lt;/p&gt;

If you think you can merely change your email address and be safe while still running BlueFrog, you are in for a big surprise. This is just the beginning...

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – email to Bluefrog users&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; Hey,
&lt;p&gt;
You are recieving this email because you are a member of BlueSecurity (http://www.bluesecurity.com).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You signed up because you were expecting to recieve a lesser amount of spam, unfortunately, due to the tactics used by BlueSecurity, you will end up recieving this message, or other nonsensical spams 20-40 times more than you would normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How do you make it stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Simple, in 48 hours, and every 48 hours thereafter, we will run our current list of BlueSecurity subscribers through BlueSecurity's database, if you arent there.. you wont get this again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have devised a method to retrieve your address from their database, so by signing up and remaining a BlueSecurity user not only are you opening yourself up for this, you are also potentially verifying your email address through them to even more spammers, and will end up getting up even more spam as an end-result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By signing up for bluesecurity, you are doing the exact opposite of what you want, so delete your account, and you will stop recieving this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why are we doing this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Its simple, we dont want to, but BlueSecurity is forcing us. We would much rather not waste our resources and send you these useless mails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Its simple, we dont want to, but BlueSecurity is forcing us. We would much rather not waste our resources and send you these useless mails, but do not believe for one second that we will stop this tirade of emails if you choose to stay with BlueSecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
Just remember one thing when you read this, we didnt do this to you, BlueSecurity did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If BlueSecurity decides to play fair, we will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

Just remove yourself from BlueSecurity, and make it easier on you.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – email to BlueFrog Users&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, nearly sixty percent of the federal government's workforce will be eligible for retirement over the next ten years; with ninety percent of senior executive service officials expected to do so. Besides depleting Social Security funds, baby boomers will once again leave a big impression on the American workforce and economy. Calling it a "federal retirement tsunami," the United States Office of Personnel Management (the bureau responsible for government human resources) is preparing for this event in a few manners. In a news release today by the bureau, Director Linda Springer announced that the office would be releasing a major media campaign in efforts to recruit future employees.

With only twenty four percent of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; citizens with a bachelor degree or higher, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it's no wonder it has been difficult to attract qualified or interested employees for federal government positions; particularly young people. "We've been hearing for so long about how incompetent and shady the government is, but a lot don't understand the benefits," said Howard University sophomore Victoria Hooks. 

"The challenge is clear, and we are hard at work... with a 21st Century approach to the workplace, the federal government will ride the retirement wave and set the standard for a modern workplace... It will be a modern workplace, one that requires innovative training and encourage more flexibility by managers. The federal workforce will be one that the American people can count on," said Springer in support of the initiatives for recruitment. Other efforts for recruitment will also include additional employment benefits such as special salaries and relocation bonuses, especially for women.

The recruitment advertisements will reveal themselves in a series of four commercials around the country beginning in mid May 2006.

Today, &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the real name for the console previously known by the codename "Revolution", is Wii. The name was revealed in a message posted on Nintendo of America's &lt;a href="http%3A//revolution.nintendo.com"&gt;official site&lt;/a&gt;, which is shown below.

In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, the name received much criticism for sounding too much like "wee", an English slang word meaning urine. The name also sounds similar to "yes" in French and "good" in Japanese.

As of 6th May, 2006, the Pakistani government has once again put a ban on Blogspot. This has been confirmed by numerous bloggers across Pakistan.

The banned blogs can now be accessed through an alternative sites such as &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pkblogs.com"&gt;PKBlogs.com - Blogspot Proxy&lt;/a&gt; and other proxy servers.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Blogspot%20ban%20lifted%20in%20Pakistan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Since the morning of May 2, 2006, the blanket ban on the &lt;a href="w%3Ablogspot.com"&gt;blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt; blogs has been lifted. This has been confirmed by various people on the 'Action Group Against Blogspot Ban In &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;' mailing list. The six baloch and plenty of Indian sites are still blocked.

The website was originally blocked because some of the blogs it hosted, reportedly contained ♡❤"sacrilegious" content♡❤, mostly in the form of &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;cartoons&lt;/a&gt; that were earlier published by Jyllands-Posten, and republished in some . The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;Supreme Court of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; directed the government of &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; to block all websites that contained such content on March 1, 2006.

A warehouse fire on Brooklyn's waterfront has become a nine alarm blaze. The complex of seven old warehouses has been virtually destroyed and authorities are currently investigating it as arson.

Some 400 firefighters have working to extinguish the fire which started a little after 5:30 in the morning. A technique referred to as "surround and drown" has been employed in which fire trucks have flanked the complex on three sides while boats pump water from the adjacent river onto the blaze.

According to the New York Fire Department, some six million gallons of water have been pumped onto the site and the ninth alarm, which was posted around noon, makes it the second biggest fire in the city's history.

By noon, many of the buildings had been almost entirely destroyed. Area residents say that the complex was due to be demolished anyway to make a new park.

An &lt;a href="w%3AArmavia"&gt;Armavia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus_A320"&gt;Airbus 320&lt;/a&gt; passenger plane flying from &lt;a href="w%3AArmenia"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;'s capital, &lt;a href="w%3AYerevan"&gt;Yerevan&lt;/a&gt;, to the city of &lt;a href="w%3ASochi"&gt;Sochi&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; has crashed into the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The jet was found 6 km from the coast and carried a total of 113 people. Among the passengers were 8 crew and 6 children. Controllers lost contact with the plane at 0215 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC%252B4"&gt;local time&lt;/a&gt; (Tuesday 2215 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;).

Rescuers have found the corpses of a woman and a girl and another 12 body parts at the site of Wednesday's crash of Armenia's Airbus A-320 plane off Russia's Black Sea coast, a spokesman for the Russian Prosecutor General's Office told Interfax. Other reports say that at least 25 bodies have been found.

There were 77 Armenian citizens, 26 Russian citizens, 1 Ukrainian and 1 Georgian citizen on board of the Armenian air liner, Armenian Civil Aviation Department head Artyom Movsisian told on a news conference.

"Most of the Russian citizens are of Armenian origin," Movsisian said. 

"Rescue efforts are being hampered by deteriorating weather conditions, heavy rain and rough seas," a spokesman for the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said. 

"The fragments were found six km (3.7 miles) from the shore near the airport of Adler. The search operation continues," said Beltsov. The location of the crash site has been ascertained by a numerous fragments and life vests, and a large oil slick.

"The only thing [we] know is that when the crew asked for permission to land, the air controller in Sochi responded that bad weather meant this was not yet possible," Gayane Davtyan, head of Armenia's civilian aviation authority said. "Contact with the crew was lost at 600 meters, when the plane went to circle for a second time."

The cause of the tragedy remains unclear, but the investigators are pursuing two main versions: bad weather conditions and poor maintenance.

The Russian Prosecutor General's Office believes terrorism can be ruled out as a factor in the A-320 plane crash near the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Wednesday morning.

"We don't have any information that could indicate a possible terrorist attack on board the plane," Russian Deputy Prosecutor General Nikolai Shepel told Interfax on Wednesday. 

An official from the regional department of the Emergency Situations Ministry in southern Russia said "apparently there were malfunctions on board, as the pilots were making another attempt to land at the Adler airport."

"The plane was in an ideal technical condition, the crew was well qualified," said the airline's deputy commercial director, Andrei Aghajanov. The cause of the crash is under investigation.

In the area where the plane crashed, more rain is expected in the next hours and the water temperature is currently between 8 to 10 degrees celsius.

The Russian and Armenian presidents have announced on Wednesday that Friday, May 5th, would be a day of mourning in remembrance of the 113 people that died in the crash. 

The worst crash involving an two-engine A-320, which was first built in 1984 and remains the most popular Airbus on the market, occurred in August 2000, when a Gulf Air plane crashed off Bahrain on a flight from Cairo, killing all 143 people on board. The Airbus A320 is a short-to-medium range commercial passenger aircraft and a total of 328 people have been killed in earlier A320 accidents.

About 20 boats and a Be-200 amphibious aircraft are involved in the recovery operation, emergency services said, adding that two more Be-200s would fly to the scene if necessary. A group of rescuers from the Russian emergency ministry is expected to fly to the crash site in the next few hours.

As managers of local transit companies tend to boycott developments of transit rules in &lt;a href="w%3ABogot%C3%A1"&gt;Bogotá,&lt;/a&gt; the whole transportation system was a complete chaos on Tuesday (2).

The local Administration intends to develop the year 2000-stablished ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATransmilenio"&gt;Transmilenio&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ system, and to accomplish that, old buses must be removed from main routes and from active service. The protest included a complete halt of public service, and people recurred to private cars, trucks, and cabs for transportation. Bogotá has in place an already strange rule to stop the movement of cars around the city depending on the day of week and the last number of the license plate. Such a rule was cancelled for the time the protest continues, and other measures were announced by the Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ALuis%20Eduardo%20Garz%C3%B3n"&gt;Luis Eduardo Garzón&lt;/a&gt;. Garzón hinted several penalties will be applied to those who omit showing to the streets to give service, going from a buch of hundreds of dollars, to the total cancellation of transit licenses for Bus companies (Already in the past those measures were announced with no real effect and no real sanctions).

The protest was also infiltrated by people who damaged more than 70 machines of the Transmilenio system, Public schools called the day off and there will be no classes on Wednesday (3). Most public and private corporations and business, sent people home by 14:00 local time (19:00 UTC), to help avoid security problems.

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡What insipred you to get behind Geekcorps, and has there been a big Geekcorps mission, yet? ♡❤♡
</ul>
I got interested in Geekcorps because I'd lived in Ghana as a student in 1993 and 1994
While over there, I was amazed at just how little internet connectivity was available
I did a bit of volunteer work helping wire an environmental organization, but basically the only people who had regular net access were US embassy employees.
So I was fascinated to learn that my friends in Ghana were getting online in the late 1990s, and I wondered whether anyone would start building net-based businesses, as people were doing in the US
My wife and I went back to Ghana to visit friends and found that there was a huge deal of enthusiasm about the web and the potential it represented, but almost no expertise
people were really desperate to learn, but very few people were able to teach at the same time, I was ready to step down from Tripod, and I knew a lot of burned out geeks
I started wondering whether some of my friends would be interested in sharing their skills in the developing world and whether that would be a useful thing to do
lots of international development folks seemed to think it was a good cause, so I started working on it fulltime.
We ended up sending about 100 people overseas over the four years I was involved with the project
we usually sent about 6-8 to a country at a time, working with a variety of businesses, NGOs and government agencies biggest projects were in Ghana, Mali, Mongolia, Senegal.

But from an American perspective, that's outsourcing, the bane of US workers. How do you justify working towards a goal that might cost Americans their jobs? ♡❤♡
</ul>
Basically, I'm concerned about the ability of people all over the world to make a good living, send their children to school, build nice houses, have enough food and clean water, etc there's clearly something of a tradeoff offered by all sorts of globalization - as millions of Chinese are lifted out of rural povery, industrial manufacturing jobs in the US disappear but the US has a pretty good history of innovating and creating new jobs in fields that require a lot of intellectual endeavor the US continues to found interesting software companies, pioneer new net services and generally do a lot of the interesting development on the cutting edge of tech I think a lot of routine coding jobs are up for outsourcing, but I don't think that people who design software - or who manage the outsourcing and software development process - are going away any time soon it's very hard to outsource creative activities - it's somewhat easier to outsource repetitive processes.
I think we need to worry less about individual job loss and more about the ability to continue creating new projects. at the same time, I'm very excited to see companies in the developing world moving up the value chain as well, starting to innovate and create new projects as well...

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡ Lately you've been involved with projects including Global Voices and Worldchanging. Where and how do the two dovetail, and where and how do they differ? What are the strengths of each?♡❤♡
</ul>
They're very different projects and communities, WC is a magazine -it's a chance for a small group of smart people to write original content on green issues it's a lot less global than GV - perhaps overly focused on the US and Europe - and has a tight subject focus GV is an edited aggregator People are not so much writing original, opinionated content on GV as they are linking to other content indeed, we ask people to try very hard not to be especially opinionated on GV. Not NPOV, but a similar perspective - you point, you don't advocate
&lt;ethanz&gt; also GVO is huge - 10 regional editors, about 60 regular contributors, a network of about a thousand blogs we regularly link to the community has a very different feeling - much more international, more 24/7. both are fascinating projects, successes in their own ways, but quite different on the tech issues, a little - in both cases, we're taking very simple weblog tools and asking them to support very large communities. And a little bit on the issue of how they interface with mainstream media in both cases, we're interested in amplifying memes and getting them picked up by popular press as well as on the web.
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Isn't that a contradiction? you're asking people to be "less" opinionated, but not asking them to be unopinionated?♡❤♡
</ul>
Blogs are essentially about opinion, asking for NPOV in the blog space misses the point - we want to know what opinions people in Syria have but we want our middle east editor to try to fairly represent the different opinions taking place in that space that said, he's got an opinion as well so asking for NPOV isn't the right thing to do - asking him to point to a diversity of opinions is, in our case

The New Zealand Government has announced that it would require &lt;a href="w%3ATelecom%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Telecom&lt;/a&gt; to unbundled the local loop to provide "faster and better broadband Internet services." New Zealand used to be the only country in the OECD to have investigated unbundling the local loop and then rejected it. This means now that any &lt;a href="w%3AInternet_service_provider"&gt;Internet service provider&lt;/a&gt; in New Zealand can create their own plans / speeds for New Zealanders. The shock announcement, due to a leak of the plan to Telecom, saw the stock lose over &lt;a href="w%3ANZD"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;2 billion over the &lt;a href="w%3ANZX"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AASX"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANYSE"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; listings.

Armenia's president Robert Kocharyan expressed his condolences Wednesday morning to friends and families who lost their loved ones in the air crash over the Black Sea.

Early Wednesday morning, an Armenian Airbus A-320 flying from the capital of Armenia, Yerevan, to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi crashed with the loss of all 113 passengers and crew.

"I was deeply grieved to learn about the air crash," President Kocharyan said. "I offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the passengers and the crew. I assure that the families of those who died will receive the necessary assistance, and the authorities will make every effort to discover the causes of the accident."

The Russian and Armenian presidents have also announced on Wednesday that Friday, May 5th, would be a day of mourning in remembrance of the 113 people that died in the air crash.

Russian emergency services said the airliner had crashed at about six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the coast while approaching land in stormy weather.

Senior politician and general-secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party, &lt;a href="w%3APramod%20Mahajan"&gt;Pramod Mahajan&lt;/a&gt;, passed away in Hinduja Hospital, &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; at 16:10 &lt;a href="w%3AIndian_Standard_Time"&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt; (10:40 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) today. He was 56 . His younger brother Pravin had shot him three times from point blank range on April 22, 2006. He was given 25 bottles of blood to compensate for the extensive bleeding he suffered. His pancreas and small intestine were also damaged. Over the past 12 days his condition had remained critical yet stable. He was on a respirator, and ionotropes had to be administered to him to keep his blood pressure up. The seriousness of the condition made it unsafe for doctors to operate on him and remove the bullets lodged in his body. 

Events took a turn for the worse when he developed &lt;a href="w%3AAcute%20respiratory%20distress%20syndrome"&gt;acute respiratory distress syndrome&lt;/a&gt; 36 hours ago. This prompted physicians to further increase the level of respiratory support provided to him. This afternoon doctors reported that he was suffering from multiple organ failure - the first indication that his life was in grave danger. His family members and well-wishers were allowed to see him around 14:30 IST today. The attending physicians from Hinduja Hospital made an official statement of his death at 16:50 IST. Pramodji's family made the decision to cease giving him artificial ventilitaion after doctors made it clear to them that chances of Mr. Mahajan's recovery were very bleak. He will be given a state funeral tomorrow in Mumbai at 12:00 IST (6:30 UTC).
