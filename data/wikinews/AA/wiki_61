A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck eastern &lt;a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; at 9:15 AM local time on Sunday morning (23:15 Saturday UTC). The epicentre was 30 kilometers east of &lt;a href="w%3ALae%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea"&gt;Lae&lt;/a&gt;, and 300 kilometers north of &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Moresby"&gt;Port Moresby&lt;/a&gt; the capital of Papua New Guinea. The quake had a depth of 66.2 kilometers (41.1 miles).

The &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; in Hawaii has not issued any alerts related to the quake, and so far no injuries have been reported. Papua New Guinea National Disaster Centre officials in &lt;a href="w%3ALae"&gt;Lae&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; that while they were unaware of any buildings collapsing, the people of Lae did feel the quake.

Papua New Guinea is commonly hit by volcanic activity, earthquakes and tidal waves. Almost 3 years ago to this date, an &lt;a href="Strong%206.3%20magnitude%20earthquake%20reported%20in%20Papua%20New%20Guinea"&gt;earthquake with the same magnitude&lt;/a&gt; hit the area. On that occurrence no casualties were reported either.

The son of &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; Senate President &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Cullerton"&gt;John Cullerton&lt;/a&gt; allegedly drove under the influence (DUI) early Sunday morning while using a state-funded vehicle. Local police report that 26-year-old Garritt M. Cullerton was pulled over in downtown &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; shortly after midnight and registered a blood alcohol level of .188, more than twice the legal limit of .08. 

Chicago police spokeswoman Antoinette Ursitti told the local press that Cullerton has been charged with "DUI, negligent driving and improper lane usage." He is to appear in court on May 26. Senator Cullerton's office confirmed that his son was driving a 2009 Ford Escape registered to the state Senate, and added that "the Senate President is disappointed that this incident occurred and takes this matter very seriously. He will work to ensure that this does not occur in the future."

John Cullerton in 2008 sponsored legislation that requires DUI offenders to prove that they are sober by blowing into an electronic device every time they want to start the car. One of the strictest in the country, this law primarily targets first-time offenders.

<h1>News briefs:April 19, 2010</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Monday, April 19th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Fourteen%20dead%20in%20two%20attacks%20in%20Somalia"&gt;Fourteen dead in two attacks in Somalia&lt;/a&gt; (0:19)</h3>

A land mine blast in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, has killed eight people, and mortars launched by rebels at the city airport killed six others, according to witnesses and doctors. The al-Shabaab group was said to be responsible for both the attacks although they did not claim responsibility for them.

Ali Muse, a coordinator of ambulance services, told the Reuters news agency that while the mortar rounds missed the airport, they instead landed in the Bakara market where 5 of the 6 people killed in that attack had been at the time.

The land mine blast occurred near a police station in southern Mogadishu and several government soldiers died in that attack. Ali Gab, a local police official, said five police officials died in that attack. Fadum Hassan, a nurse at a hospital where the injured were being treated, said twenty critically injured people had been admitted to the hospital.

<h3>&lt;a href="Suicide%20car%20bomber%20kills%20seven%20in%20Kohat%2C%20Pakistan"&gt;Suicide car bomber kills seven in Kohat, Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; (1:16)</h3>

Seven people were killed and 26 injured in the city of Kohat in northwestern Pakistan on Sunday after a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb near a police station. Abdullah Jan, a high ranking police official told reporters that 7 people were killed and 21 injured in the attack. 

The station was badly affected by the attack, and three rooms of a government-run primary school were destroyed. Seven local shops were also severely damaged by the blast. Officials estimate that approximately 200 kilograms of explosives were used. 

This attack occurred a day after an earlier suicide bombing killed over 40 people near the same city, and two days after an attack in southern Pakistan killed which upwards of ten people.

<h3>&lt;a href="European%20airlines%20question%20flight%20bans"&gt;European airlines question flight bans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Half%20of%20Europe%27s%20flights%20could%20take%20off%20Monday%20says%20EU"&gt;Half of Europe's flights could take off Monday says EU&lt;/a&gt; (2:06)</h3>

Some of Europe's airlines and airports have called into question whether the mass restrictions imposed on the continent's airspace, due to volcanic ash in the area, are necessary.

Three large airlines — KLM, Air France, and Lufthansa made test flights yesterday to see if there were any immediate effects on jets after flying through the ash. Authorities have feared that the ash could cause vital aircraft parts, such as the engines, to fail in-flight.

KLM said that it will allow three freight planes to make flights to Asia, and that they had transferred seven passenger planes from Duesseldorf, Germany to Amsterdam, without any travelers. Chief executive Peter Hartman of KLM said of the tests that they observed no irregularities and that they hope to resume operations as soon as possible.

Airport closures and cancellations are estimated to be costing airlines about US$200 million daily according to the International Air Transport Association.

However, late Monday, good news from the European Union presidency says that air traffic over Europe could return to about 50 percent of its normal level today, if weather forecasts confirm that skies over the continent are clearing of volcanic ash.

European transportation ministers from countries affected by the ash met today by video conference in an effort to reopen closed airspace. European Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas says the meeting will try to find a technological solution to the flight disruption, but he stressed that safety considerations will come first.

Spanish Secretary of State for E.U. Affairs Diego López Garrido says the ash cloud over Europe is moving to the northeast, which could clear half of the air space over the continent. Air travel in Southern Europe - including Spain, southern Italy, Greece and Turkey - remains open, but the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands say their airspace will remain closed for much of Monday.

The last major disruption to European aviation followed the September 11 attacks on the United States almost a decade ago. U.S. airspace was closed for three days and European airlines canceled all trans-Atlantic flights.

<h3>&lt;a href="Son%20of%20Illinois%20Senate%20President%20charged%20with%20driving%20under%20the%20influence"&gt;Son of Illinois Senate President charged with driving under the influence&lt;/a&gt; (4:26)</h3>

The son of Illinois Senate President John Cullerton has been charged with allegedly driving under the influence early Sunday morning while using a state-funded vehicle. Local police report that 26-year-old Garritt M. Cullerton was pulled over in downtown Chicago shortly after midnight and registered a blood alcohol level of .188, more than twice the legal limit of .08. Senator Cullerton's office confirmed that his son was driving a 2009 Ford Escape registered to the state Senate. Garritt is to appear in court on May 26.

In 2008, State Senator John Cullerton sponsored legislation that requires DUI offenders to prove that they are sober by blowing into an electronic device every time they want to start the car. This is one of the strictest laws of it types in the country which primarily targets first-time offenders.

<h2>On this day in history (5:28)</h2>
In 1995, The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is bombed, killing 168.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3A2010%20Kalgoorlie-Boulder%20earthquake"&gt;A magnitude 5.2 earthquake&lt;/a&gt; has hit the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australian&lt;/a&gt; mining town of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKalgoorlie%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Kalgoorlie-Boulder&lt;/a&gt;.

The earthquake, which struck at 08:17 am AWST (00:17 UTC), is the strongest to hit the region of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGoldfields-Esperance"&gt;Goldfields-Esperance&lt;/a&gt; in 50 years. Goldfields is considered one of the more geologically stable regions of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, in comparison to the of the state, which is an active zone at the edge of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AYilgarn%20Craton"&gt;Yilgarn block&lt;/a&gt;.

Kalgoorlie is located 600 kilometres (370 miles) east of the Western Australian capital &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; and is historically the largest gold producing centre of its type in Australia. Kalgoorlie is also the largest urban centre in Goldfields, and has the largest number of buildings that would be vulnerable to such an earthquake.

Minor casualties and building damage have been reported, and miners and schoolchildren have been evacuated.

The court's 8-1 ruling overturns a law enacted in 1999 that banned the trade of "depictions of animal cruelty," including "conduct in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded or killed." The case was prompted by the prosecution of Robert J. Stevens, who had filmed and sold videos of dogfights, and subsequently was sentenced in 2005 to 37 months in prison, although he has yet to begin his sentence; his case has remained on appeal.

According to Chief Justice &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Roberts"&gt;John Roberts Jr&lt;/a&gt;, the law overturned by the court had been "a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth." The law had been defended by the US government, which had argued that videos of cruelty to animals had no value, and should therefore receive no protection by the First Amendment. Roberts argued the point in his written statement on the ruling, saying that "The First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter or its content." According to Roberts, the law had been too broad, and the court was therefore unwilling to place it outside the protection of the First Amendment.

Reactions to the ruling were mixed. A group called the Media Coalition supported the ruling, saying that "If the court were to rewrite the First Amendment every time an unpopular or distasteful subject was at issue, we wouldn't have any free speech left." The &lt;a href="w%3AHumane%20Society%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US Humane Society&lt;/a&gt; called for a new law to be written by Congress, this one more narrow in scope. The society's president, Wayne Pacelle, said that "Congress should act swiftly to make sure the First Amendment is not used as a shield for those committing barbaric acts of cruelty, and then peddling their videos on the Internet."

<h2>Intro</h2>

From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Tuesday, April 20th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:
<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>&lt;a href="Senior%20al-Qaeda%20leaders%20in%20Iraq%20killed"&gt;Senior al-Qaeda leaders in Iraq killed&lt;/a&gt; (0:18)</h3>

A joint military operation by Iraqi and American forces has killed two senior al-Qaeda leaders in Iraq, according to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Malaki and US officials.

The leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Ayyub al-Masri, and the leader of an affiliate group, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, were killed by Iraqi military forces with assistance from US troops in a night-time attack on a safe house in Thar-Thar, in the province of Salaheddin, 50 miles west of Iraq's capital, Baghdad.

Al-Masri, along with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in 2006, formed the first al-Qaeda cell in Baghdad, which have been responsible for many attacks since the US invasion of the country in 2003. Al-Baghdadi was the leader of an umbrella group, the Islamic State of Iraq, a group that is partly composed of radical Sunni militant groups.

The American commander of military forces in Iraq, General Raymond Odierno, said in a statement that "the death of these terrorists is potentially the most significant blow to al-Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency."

<h3>&lt;a href="Suicide%20bomber%20kills%2024%20in%20Peshawar%2C%20Pakistan"&gt;Suicide bomber kills 24 in Peshawar, Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; (1:32)</h3>

At least 24 people were killed in two separate suicide bombing attacks in Peshawar, the capital of the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. In the more damaging of the two blasts, a suicide bomber attacked police officials who were guarding a protest rally against the frequent power cuts in the city. A schoolboy was the victim of the earlier and less damaging attack, which injured ten. These attacks take the death toll in the North-West Frontier Province to 73 in three days, after two blasts in the city of Kohat killed 49 people during the weekend.

<h3>&lt;a href="Magnitude%205.2%20earthquake%20hits%20Kalgoorlie%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Magnitude 5.2 earthquake hits Kalgoorlie, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; (2:09)</h3>

A magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit the Western Australian mining town of Kalgoorlie-Boulder this morning.

It is the strongest earthquake in 50 years to hit the area. The Goldfields region of Western Australia is considered one of the more geologically stable regions of Australia, in comparison to the southwest corner of the state, which lies in a more geologically active zone.

Kalgoorlie is located 600 kilometres (370 miles) east of the capital — Perth — and is historically the largest gold producing centre of its type in Australia. Kalgoorlie is also the largest urban centre in the goldfields region, and has the largest number of buildings that would be vulnerable to such an earthquake.

Minor casualties and building damages have been reported, and the local miners and schoolchildren have been evacuated.

<h3>&lt;a href="Long%20Island%20teen%20found%20guilty%20of%20hate%20crime"&gt;Long Island teen found guilty of hate crime&lt;/a&gt; (3:02)</h3>

A Long Island, New York teen has been found guilty of murdering Ecuadorian immigrant Marcelo Lucero. The teen, 19-year-old Jeffrey Conroy, faces eight to 25 years in prison. The case exposed racial tensions in Long Island and received national media attention.

Lucero was attacked on the night of November 8, 2008 when he was approached by a group of people, beaten, then stabbed by Conroy.

Conroy was not convicted with murder, but rather manslaughter as a hate crime, however, he was also convicted of three other counts of gang assault for other racially charged beatings on Long Island.

<h3>&lt;a href="Toyota%20to%20pay%20US%20government%20%2416.4%20million%20over%20recalls"&gt;Toyota to pay US government $16.4 million over recalls&lt;/a&gt; (3:44)</h3>

Toyota has agreed to pay a record $16.4 million fine to the US government over allegations that the automaker concealed defects in its vehicles.

US Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood made the announcement Monday, saying in an e-mailed statement that "Toyota has accepted responsibility for violating its legal obligations to report any defects promptly." Toyota has still not admitted any wrongdoing, and said that it disagreed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which levied the fine against Toyota.

Toyota is still at risk of lawsuits from those affected by cars that crashed due to a safety defect in the accelerator pedal. Numerous such lawsuits have been filed, and analysts said that the total cost of the lawsuits could be upwards of two billion dollars in 2010, and possibly as much as ten billion in total. While the government fine is largely symbolic, as the amount was limited by US law, it could provide support for lawyers who are filing legal charges against Toyota.

<h3>&lt;a href="Roadside%20bomb%20kills%20NATO%20soldier%20in%20Afghanistan"&gt;Roadside bomb kills NATO soldier in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; (4:50)</h3>

According to NATO, one of its service members has died from a bomb attack at an army base in southern Afghanistan. In addition, an Afghan soldier reportedly died and the blast left three others injured.

The International Security Assistance Force released a statement yesterday, saying that "[the soldier] died today following an explosion at an Afghan National Army facility in Kabul." An anonymous official said that the blast occurred when a mortar fuse exploded while a training exercise was underway. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the incident, saying that an infiltrator had caused the explosion.

This latest death brings the total death toll of foreign soldiers in 2010 to 166 in Afghanistan.

<h3>(5:40)</h3>

McLaren driver Jenson Button won the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday and took a ten point lead in the driver's championship in the 2010 Formula One. Teammate Lewis Hamilton finished second in the race, followed by Nico Rosberg for Mercedes.

Ferrari's Fernando Alonso initially took a lead in his Ferrari, but was later penalized for beginning before the race commenced. Rosberg's teammate, Michael Schumacher finished tenth in the race.

Admitting that his performance was disappointing, Schumacher said that the race was one of the "frustrating" ones.

Felipe Massa of Ferrari slipped to sixth from the top position in the driver's championship after a ninth-placed finish. Renault's Robert Kubica was fifth while his teammate Vitaly Petrov finished seventh.

After four races this season, Button is at the top of the driver's championship with 60 points, followed by Rosberg who has 50 points. Hamilton and Alonso are third with 49 points each.

McLaren now leads constructors' standings, with 109 points. They are followed by Ferrari with 90, Mercedes with 78, and Red Bull with 73.

<h2>On this day in history (6:51)</h2>

In 1653 Oliver Cromwell dissolved the Rump Parliament of the Commonwealth of England by force, eventually replacing it with the Barebone's Parliament.

<h3>(0:19)</h3>

A public memorial for the victims of the plane crash that occurred last Saturday where the Polish president, Lech Kaczynski along with several key members of the Polish government died, was attended by 100,000 citizens in Pilsudski Square of Warsaw. The accident was caused when their plane went down in heavy fog after hitting the tops of trees on approach to Smolensk, Russia while en route to attend a memorial for thousands of Polish army officers who were killed in 1940 by the Soviet Union.

A gigantic white platform having a giant cross across the centre was constructed in the area which had photos of the victims, including Maria Kaczynski, the first lady of Poland and many high ranking Polish officials. The names of the deceased were read, beginning with the president and his wife, as their only daughter Marta and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the twin brother of Lech Kaczynski and former prime minister of the country, looked on. 

Former President Lech Walesa, Prime Minister Donald Tusk and interim president Bronislaw Komorowski were also present. The audience held Polish flags held together with black ribbons and observed a two minute silence before emergency sirens and church bells rang out.

A state funeral for the first couple is slated to be held on Sunday; however, some world leaders canceled their plans to attend. The principal cause for this was that several European airports remained closed, owing to volcanic ash that hovered in different parts of the continent. American President Barack Obama, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were still expected to arrive. Czech President Vaclav Klaus had stated that he would come to Krakow via train while the presidents of Slovakia and Slovenia said they would arrive by car.

<h3>&lt;a href="6.3%20magnitude%20quake%20strikes%20Papua%20New%20Guinea"&gt;6.3 magnitude quake strikes Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; (2:15)</h3>

A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Papua New Guinea at 9:15 AM local time on Sunday morning (23:15 Saturday UTC). The epicentre was 30 kilometers east of Lae, and 300 kilometers north of Port Moresby the capital of Papua New Guinea. The quake had a depth of 66.2 kilometers (41.1 miles).

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii has not issued any alerts related to the quake, and so far no injuries have been reported. Papua New Guinea National Disaster Centre officials in Lae told the Reuters news agency that while they were unaware of any buildings collapsing, the people of Lae did feel the quake.

Papua New Guinea is commonly hit by volcanic activity, earthquakes and tidal waves. Almost 3 years ago to this date, an earthquake with the same magnitude hit the area, however, no casualties were reported then either.

<h3>&lt;a href="North%20Korea%20denies%20involvement%20in%20sinking%20of%20South%20Korean%20warship"&gt;North Korea denies involvement in sinking of South Korean warship&lt;/a&gt; (3:11)</h3>

North Korea today denied any involvement in the sinking of a South Korean naval ship on March 26. In its first official statement on the disaster, in which 38 people were killed, North Korea denied any involvement in the incident.

North Korea's statement comes a day after South Korea blamed the sinking of the ship on an external explosion, which has served to increase speculation that North Korea was responsible for the incident. Although South Korean officials have not said specifically that North Korea is to blame, saying only that the possibility of North Korean involvement is being investigated, analysts and the media in South Korea have been speculating on a possible retaliation from South Korea, although a military response is not expected.

Earlier this week, the stern section of the ship was recovered from the site of the sinking, and investigators from several countries are examining the wreckage in an effort to determine the cause. Yesterday, a lead investigator said that "It was highly likely that it was an external, rather than internal, explosion" that caused the ship to sink.

<h3>&lt;a href="Man%20shot%20after%20attempting%20to%20drive%20through%20US-Mexico%20border"&gt;Man shot after attempting to drive through US-Mexico border&lt;/a&gt; (4:21)</h3>

At 8:50 AM local time (15:50 UTC) a man attempting to enter the United States at the Tijuana – San Diego section of the US – Mexican border, tried to escape U.S. customs officers, after he could not provide official documentation. According to Lieutenant Kevin Rooney of the San Diego police department, "the agent referred the driver to a secondary inspection and he [the driver] quickly accelerated away."

The acceleration caused him to crash into a pickup truck. It is thought he was trying to force the other vehicle out of the way. When customs officers surrounded the vehicle, the driver went into reverse, which led to two officers opening fire on the vehicle. The man was shot only once and the wound was not life threatening.

Police officials believe the driver tried to flee because the vehicle was reported to have been stolen from Colorado.

<h2>On this day in history (5:12)</h2>
In 1942 during World War II, sixteen B-25 Mitchell bombers from the aircraft carrier USS Hornet carried out the famous Doolittle Raid, the first Allied attack on the Japanese home islands.

<h3>&lt;a href="30%20people%20die%20in%20bombing%20in%20northwestern%20Pakistan"&gt;30 people die in bombing in northwestern Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; (0:19)</h3>

In Pakistan today, three separate regions experienced violence.

Two successive suicide bombings killed 30 people in a camp providing aid to displaced people in northwestern Pakistan. The two explosions hit the Kacha Pukha camp located near the city of Kohat. Nearly 50 people there were wounded.

Al Jazeera's Kamal Hyder said from Islamabad that the bomber hit the camp when a food distribution programme was underway.

In southwest Pakistan a suicide bomber attacked an emergency room of a hospital in Quetta, killing eight people, including three policemen. Approximately 35 people were wounded in the attack. The explosion occurred in the Civil Hospital of the city.

The hospital was full of journalists who were reporting about the shooting of a bank manager belonging to the Shiite community. Police official Mohammad Sabir, claimed the room was full of the manager's friends and family when the suicide bomber attacked.

Finally, in the Orakzai region of the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan, seventeen insurgents were killed in clashes with security troops. Several rebels were injured in the attack according to officials and security personnel alleged that they had arrested a senior Taliban leader in the attack. None of the soldiers were injured during the fighting.

Meanwhile, elders of various tribes demanded the government to bar security forces from carring out operations affecting the people of the area. They said that the government should have allowed the people some time to shift from the area before launching these attacks, claiming the air strikes in the region also killed some civilians.

<h3>(2:01)</h3>

In Europe today, aviation experts are warning that air traffic across western Europe may continue to be affected by an Icelandic volcano which has been billowing clouds of ash and spreading it throughout the region.

Already, thousands of passengers have been left stranded around the world, unable to travel to and from various points in Europe. The continent's air-traffic control center predicted 17,000 flights to have been canceled on Friday alone, and indicated there would be further disruption today. According to the International Air Transport Association, the cancellations are costing airlines about US$200 million daily.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20bank%20Goldman%20Sachs%20accused%20of%20fraud"&gt;US bank Goldman Sachs accused of fraud&lt;/a&gt; (2:41)</h3>

In financial news, US bank Goldman Sachs has been accused of fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission; an American financial regulator.

According to the SEC, Goldman Sachs failed to inform investors of a conflict of interest in the banks' marketing of sub-prime mortgage investments, which were being sold at a time of uncertainty in the US housing market. The SEC says that a Goldman subsidiary, Paulson &amp; Co, had been involved in the selection of securities included in the mortgage investments. It had not been disclosed to investors that Paulson had bet that the value of the investments would fall, benefiting Paulson but not those who bought the investments.

The securities, which were combined into a package called Abacus that was sold to investors, lost over $1 billion during the collapse of the US housing industry. According to the SEC, Goldman, Paulson, and the creator of Abacus, a vice-president of Goldman Sachs named Fabrice Tourre, all knew that the housing market was going to collapse, but continued to sell Abacus despite the risks.

<h3>&lt;a href="UN%20report%20says%20death%20of%20Benazir%20Bhutto%20preventable%3B%20fault%20of%20government"&gt;UN report says death of Benazir Bhutto preventable; fault of government&lt;/a&gt; (3:52)</h3>

A United Nations report released Thursday says that the death of Benazir Bhutto after a suicide bomber attacked her motorcade in 2007 was preventable and was caused by the failure of the government to live up to its obligations to protect her.

The report, released by a three-person UN commission, accused the Pakistani government of failing to take "the necessary measures to respond to the extraordinary, fresh and urgent security risks that they knew she faced." Additionally, Pakistani investigators were said to have deliberately avoided solving the case, as they were afraid that the evidence would indict the government.

According to the commission, "irreparable damage to the investigation" was caused by the actions taken directly after the assassination, including cleaning the area in which Bhutto was killed and failing to collect evidence pertaining to the crime. In an area that should have yielded thousands of pieces of evidence, UN investigators recovered only 23.

The report was unexpectedly harsh, and provided damning accounts of specific security failures around the assassination. It said that "The commission believes that the failure of the police to investigate effectively Ms Bhutto's assassination was deliberate."

<h3>&lt;a href="Toyota%20to%20recall%20Sienna%20minivan%20in%20North%20America"&gt;Toyota to recall Sienna minivan in North America&lt;/a&gt; (5:14)</h3>

Embattled Japanese automaker Toyota, has issued a voluntary recall of 870,000 of its Sienna minivans in North America.

The models affected are the first and second generation vehicles, which were manufactured between 1998 and 2010. It has been discovered that salt, used to grit roads and melt snow in northern US states and Canada, could potentially cause corrosion in the spare tire carrier cable. In a worse case scenario, this corrosion could lead to the wheel becoming detached and becoming a hazard for following vehicles. The new 2011 version of the Sienna is not affected, nor are all wheel drive versions of the vehicle.

This is the latest blow to Toyota's reputation for safety and quality and the recall comes just days after the company announced the suspension of sales of the Lexus GX 460 SUV over fears that it was susceptible to rollovers.

<h3>&lt;a href="Tobacco%20manufacturers%20and%20retailers%20fined%20over%20UK%20price%20fixing"&gt;Tobacco manufacturers and retailers fined over UK price fixing&lt;/a&gt; (6:16)</h3>

Finally, several tobacco manufacturers and retailers in the United Kingdom have been fined a total of £225 million for price fixing. The fines were imposed by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) following an investigation lasting seven years. It is the largest penalty ever issued by the OFT for breaches of the 1998 Competition Act, with the case involving two major tobacco makers and numerous British supermarkets.

Together the manufacturers involved, Imperial Tobacco (whose brands include Golden Virginia and Lambert &amp; Butler) and Gallaher Group (who owns Silk Cut and Benson &amp; Hedges among others) make almost 90% of all cigarettes and roll-ups sold in the UK. They were fined £112 million and £50 million respectively.

The supermarkets facing the largest penalties were Asda and The Co-operative Group, at £14 million each. Other stores fined were First Quench, Morrisons, Safeway, Shell garages, Somerfield, T&amp;S Stores (now One Stop) and TM Retail. Also taking part in the price fixing were Sainsbury's, though they received immunity from being fined after alerting the OFT and co-operating with the investigation. Some of the other companies also earned reductions in their fines through co-operation with the OFT.

Similar allegations against Tesco were not pursued due to a lack of evidence.

Imperial Tobacco denied the charges, claiming in a statement that its dealings with the retailers were simply legitimate "promotional arrangements". They have said they are considering an appeal against the decision.

<h1>News briefs:April 16, 2010</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Friday, April 16th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>&lt;a href="European%20airspace%20closed%20by%20volcanic%20ash"&gt;European airspace closed by volcanic ash&lt;/a&gt; (0:20)</h3>

Tens of thousands of air travelers were stranded when all flights into and out of the United Kingdom were grounded due to the eruption of an Icelandic volcano located in the south of that nation. Eurocontrol released a statement saying that "...most air traffic in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden is suspended."

The grounding is due to the fact that the volcanic ash drawn into the jet stream is of a particle size which allows it to remain aloft in the atmosphere. Ingestion of this foreign matter, because of its distribution, would lead to flame outs in all aircraft engines. The composition of the ash also means that it would first melt into glass if it were to enter the engine of an aircraft before solidifying again as it cooled. This could lead to damage to the compressors and fan blades, which would make it impossible to restart the engines, even if the aircraft was to exit the cloud.

The current contingency is informed by the experience of British Airways Flight 9 which on June 24, 1982 suffered just such complete engine flame outs when it flew through the plume of an eruption in Indonesia. In that case the flight crew, after many efforts, were able to restart the engines and though one failed shortly there after the aircraft landed without casualties.

In addition to the thousands of stranded travelers are a selection of British musicians booked to play at this weekend's Coachella Festival in California. Amongst those stranded are Frightened Rabbit, Gary Numan, The Cribs and Bad Lieutenant.

<h3>&lt;a href="Rescue%20efforts%20underway%20after%20China%20earthquake"&gt;Rescue efforts underway after China earthquake&lt;/a&gt; (2:02)</h3>

Humanitarian aid groups and Chinese military forces are beginning rescue operations in western China after a heavy 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the region on Wednesday, and reportedly killed over 600 people and injured almost ten thousand.

The quake, which was centered around the remote town of Yushu, was largely destroyed by the heavy temblor, which occurred early in the morning as residents were waking up. The official death toll stands at 617, while 9,980 more were injured and an additional 313 reported as missing. The Chinese ministry of civil affairs reports that 15,000 houses had collapsed and 100,000 people - almost the entire population in the area - remain without homes.

Rescue efforts are underway, but impeded due to the area's remoteness and landslides, which have blocked many roads in the area. Also a factor is the high altitude at which the area is located - about 4,000 metres above sea level (13,000 feet) - which could adversely affect rescue crews not used to being in such thin air. Sniffer dogs, for instance, who aren't accustomed to working at high sea levels, could have a harder time detecting living people buried beneath rubble.

Using shovels and their bare hands, residents and troops garrisoned in the Yushu county have managed to pull out more than 1,000 people alive, according to Chinese state media.

Further exacerbating the situation is the weather: temperatures are freezing, and meteorologists predict sleet and wind to come within the next few days. Many people were forced to sleep outdoors, protecting themselves from the cold in blankets, or spending the night in their vehicles.

Chinese president Hu Jintao, meanwhile, said that he would be dispatching over 5,000 rescuers and soldiers to the scene of the disaster. The government has also pledged over $29 million worth of aid. Hu described the quake as being a "huge calamity" and he is also shortening his visit to a summit in Brazil to return to his country. Premier Wen Jiabao has visited Yushu to oversee relief work and decided to delay a visit to southeastern Asia due to the disaster. 

Meanwhile, some foreign countries have offered financial help; among them is Japan, which has pledged over one million dollars to disaster victims. The United States also said it is "ready to assist" if China requests international aid.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20unveils%20revived%20space%20exploration%20program"&gt;US unveils revived space exploration program&lt;/a&gt; (4:45)</h3>

US President Barack Obama unveiled on Thursday plans for the future of American space exploration, committing to sending American astronauts to Mars by the mid-2030s.

The president was speaking at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a speech to lay out his plans for the future of the American space agency NASA. His comments included assurances that America was not abandoning space exploration, contrary to claims he was doing so after he announced the US's budget for 2011, which would have ended most of NASA's current projects, including the development of new heavy-launch rockets called the Constellation Program.

Under Obama's latest program, NASA would receive US $6 billion as supplementary funding over the next five years to develop new projects, which Obama emphasized, saying NASA was in the unusual position of having an expanded budget while other government agencies must comply to financial restrictions or cuts in efforts to reduce the US public debt. With the additional funding, NASA would extend the life of the International Space Station (ISS) by four years further, to at least 2020, develop a new series of heavy-lift rockets by 2015, and continue development of the Orion crew capsule, a major part of the Constellation program.

The centerpiece of the plan would be manned missions to the moon and beyond, beginning with missions to asteroids around 2025, with missions to Mars following within a decade.

Obama said that under his new plan, NASA would be able to achieve more in a shorter amount of time than it would have under the Constellation Program. He also said that, contrary to fears that changes in NASA would result in job losses in the state of Florida, where most space missions are launched from, under his new plan, a total of 2,500 jobs would be created in the area.

<h3>&lt;a href="Deposed%20Kyrgyz%20President%20flees%20to%20Kazakhstan"&gt;Deposed Kyrgyz President flees to Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; (6:47)</h3>

Kurmanbek Bakiyev left Kyrgyzstan Thursday for Kazakhstan after a large scale protest in the country forced him to flee from the Kyrgyz capital to his home village of Teyit. Kazhakstan's secretary of state and Foreign Minister called this "an important step" to stabilize Kyrgyzstan, thereby preventing conflicts in the country.

Bakiyev fled from the capital on April 7 after a violent riot broke out and citizens attacked government building. At least 83 people died in this violence in the Kyrgyz capital. While there is no arrest warrant against Bakiyev, his brother Zhanybek has one against him, however, the Interfax news agency of Russia mentioned witnesses claimed the deposed president had boarded a plane without his brother.

Earlier on Thursday, gunshots were heard in southern Kyrgyzstan during a political rally held by the deposed Kyrgyz President. This attack caused no injuries, but Bakiyev took a car to leave the rally after the shots were heard.

Bakiyev has been holding political meetings in towns near Teyit. Thursday's rally was in Osh, the largest city in the south of Kyrgyzstan, where the former was addressing a crowd of 5,000 people. Bakiyev arrived in a convoy consisting of minivans at Osh, where another rally supporting the country's interim government was being held.

Bakiyev has claimed he would resign his post if the interim government assured security to him and his family members. The latter have agreed to make such security guarantees to Bakiyev, but have refused it for him family members. They also said Bakiyev would either have to leave the country or be prosecuted, blaming him for corruption and the violences which occurred earlier this month. On Wednesday, Roza Otunbayeva, interim President of the country, said she would consider a direct discussion with Bakiyev but refused to discuss what would happen to his relatives.

<h3>(8:45)</h3>

According to a United Nations survey, more people in India, the second most populous country in the world, have access to mobile phones than to a proper toilet. Over half a billion cell phones are active in India, but only 366 million people there have access to a toilet.

India's 545 million cell phones serve about 45 per cent of the population of more than one billion. Only 31 per cent (366 million) have access to modern hygienic amenities as of 2008. The United Nations University (UNU) recommends achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) which aims to cut in half the number of people lacking safe water and proper sanitary arrangements. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), there would be a deficit of one billion people from that target aimed for 2015.

Recommendations made by the UNU include changing the MDG target from 50 per cent by 2015 to 100 per cent coverage by 2025. Another suggested reform was to assign 0.002 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to improving sanitation. Approximately 358 billion dollars would be required to achieve that MDG target, considering that a toilet costs 300 dollars.

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Thursday, April 15th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:
<h3>&lt;a href="Cyclone%20in%20eastern%20India%20kills%2031"&gt;Cyclone in eastern India kills 31&lt;/a&gt; (0:18)</h3>

At least 31 people were killed by a cyclone in the North Dinajpur district of West Bengal, India late Tuesday. The storm uprooted trees and destroyed several huts in the North Dinajpur district of the state. The storm snapped telephone and electric wires and 50,000 mud huts were destroyed by the storm. 

Civil defense Minister Srikumar Mukherjee reported that hundreds of people suffered injuries in the district, which is nearly 315 miles northeast of Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal. P.K. Dutta, the additional district magistrate, commented that he expected the death toll to rise as information from all affected areas was not yet immediately available.

<h3>&lt;a href="Volcanic%20eruption%20starts%20on%20top%20of%20Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull%2C%20Iceland"&gt;Volcanic eruption starts on top of Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland&lt;/a&gt; (1:02)</h3>

People in the area of the Eyjafjallajökull (Aevaloik) glacier in Iceland have been evacuated due to concerns of flooding from meltwater after a volcanic eruption created a large hole in the glacier, as well as a 2 kilometer (1 mi) long fissure that is forming under the glacier. Plumes of steam up to 5,000 feet in altitude could be seen rising over the glacier. The first evacuations began at about 02.00 local time (03.00 UTC) today because earthquakes in the area had pointed to an imminent eruption. Air traffic is prohibited in a large area around the eruption zone.

This is the second such event this year. On March 21th, a volcanic eruption occurred between two nearby glaciers, however, the current eruption appears to be much more powerful.

Over the past 1,100 years, Eyjafjallajökull has erupted three times: in 920, 1612, and between 1821–1823. Each of these incidents directly preceded a major eruption in the nearby subglacial volcano, Katla.

<h3>&lt;a href="Burial%20site%20for%20Polish%20president%20Lech%20Kaczynski%20draws%20objections"&gt;Burial site for Polish president Lech Kaczynski draws objections&lt;/a&gt; (2:07)</h3>

Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Krakow objecting to plans to bury the Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, at Wawel Castle this Sunday. Burial spaces at Wawel castle are normally reserved for Polish kings and heroes.

Groups of protesters arrived in front of the Archbishop’s of Krakow’s house on Tuesday evening, many holding banners with slogans such as “Are you sure he is equal of the Kings?” and “Not Krakow, Not Wawel”. A further 26,000 people joined a Facebook group titled “No to the Kaczynski’s being buried in Wawel”.

Polish film director Andrzej Wajda voiced his opinion on the plans of the late president’s burial site, saying that "Lech Kaczynski was an ordinary and good man, but there is no reason for him to lie in the Wawel among the kings of Poland and Marshal Jozef Pilsudski [the founder of modern-day Poland]." He continued to comment, saying that the decision had been “misplaced”.

Officials commented on the criticism, saying that the plans were made by both church leaders and the Kaczynski family. The current plans have Kaczynski’s burial place close to Marshal Pilsudski’s crypt.

Several of the world’s leaders and dignitaries are to attend the president's funeral, including US president Barack Obama and Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev.

<h3>&lt;a href="Somali%20radio%20stations%20stopped%20from%20playing%20music%20by%20Islamist%20militants"&gt;Somali radio stations stopped from playing music by Islamist militants&lt;/a&gt; (3:31)</h3>

Somali Islamic militants issued an order 10 days ago to all of that nations radio stations to stop playing music because the programming is seen as un-Islamic. The only stations not in compliance with the ban are a government controlled station and a UN-funded station based in Kenya. Stations that have reported that they complied with the ban did so over fears for their lives.

Since 1991, Somalia has had no functioning government, with militants controlling large parts of the country. The government, which is backed by UN funds and troops from the African Union, only control a small part of the capital city, Mogadishu.

Pop music is popular in Somalia and the ban has been met with heavy criticism but this new ban adds to the militants orders in certain parts of the country banning the watching of films and football.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20Library%20of%20Congress%20plans%20archive%20of%20Twitter"&gt;US Library of Congress plans archive of Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (4:28)</h3>

The United States Library of Congress plans to create an archive of every "tweet," or post made on Twitter. It announced the move today via Twitter.

Twitter's general counsel Alex MacGillivray told the BBC that he thinks it shows tweets are an interesting part of the historical record citing US President Barack Obama tweeting his election victory in 2008. 

The library plans to highlight such historically significant tweets and although the library plans a Twitter archive, it does not indicate a change of the Library of Congress' focus. The library reportedly has 160 terabytes of data already taken from other Internet sources.

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Wednesday, April 21st, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="US%20Supreme%20Court%20overturns%20ban%20on%20videos%20depicting%20animal%20cruelty"&gt;US Supreme Court overturns ban on videos depicting animal cruelty&lt;/a&gt; (0:19)</h3>

Yesterday, the US Supreme Court overturned an eleven-year-old law banning videos that depicted animal cruelty, ruling that such a law violated free speech rights under the First Amendment to the US Constitution.

The court's 8-1 ruling overturns a law enacted in 1999 that banned the trade of "depictions of animal cruelty," including "conduct in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded or killed." The case was prompted by the prosecution of Robert J. Stevens, who had filmed and sold videos of dogfights, and subsequently was sentenced in 2005 to 37 months in prison, although he has yet to begin his sentence and his case is currently on appeal.

According to Chief Justice John Roberts Jr, the law overturned by the court had been "a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth." The law had been defended by the US government, which had argued that videos of cruelty to animals had no value, and should therefore receive no protection by the First Amendment. Roberts argued the point in his written statement on the ruling, saying that "The First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter or its content." According to Roberts, the law had been too broad, and the court was therefore unwilling to place it outside the protection of the First Amendment.

The US Humane Society has called for a new law to be written by Congress, this one more narrow in scope.

<h3>&lt;a href="Death%20toll%20from%20Chinese%20earthquake%20passes%202%2C000"&gt;Death toll from Chinese earthquake passes 2,000&lt;/a&gt; (1:58)</h3>

The death toll from a 6.9 magnitude earthquake on April 14th in the Qinghai province in western China now stands at 2,039, with another 195 missing. 12,135 people were injured by the temblor and over 1,400 are said to still be in serious condition. 

On Tuesday, rescuers were still searching for survivors buried beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings in and around the town of Jiegu, one of the hardest hit areas.

Officials have increased their relief efforts, bringing food, blankets, tents, and other assistance to the area.

Yesterday, an official remembrance day for those killed was held; public entertainment was limited and national Chinese flags flew at half-mast.

<h3>&lt;a href="Former%20IOC%20President%20Samaranch%20dies%20at%2089"&gt;Former IOC President Samaranch dies at 89&lt;/a&gt; (2:45)</h3>

Juan Antonio Samaranch, former head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) died today in Barcelona at the age of 89. 

Samaranch was admitted to the hospital on Sunday with heart trouble marking one of a number of occasions he has fallen ill. He passed away at approximately 11:25 local time. Even in retirement, with advancing age and medical issues, Samaranch continued to travel and be active in Olympic circles, working to try and secure both the 2012 Olympics and 2016 Olympics for Madrid as well as attending various sport conferences.

A former diplomat and Spanish ambassador in Moscow, he was elected to the IOC in 1980 and is largely credited with the renewal of the Olympic movement over two decades marked by boycotts, bribery and drug scandals. While appearing to be small in stature and uncomfortable speaking in public, he was viewed as an often ruthless operator who could forge consensus within an often fractious Olympic movement and bring IOC members to deliver what he wanted.

During his time in office, Samaranch worked to help increase the number of participating countries at the Olympics, oversaw the creation of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the creation of the IOC Athletes Commission.

Prior to his election to the role of IOC president, he had a long background in sports, having held roles with the Spanish Skating Federation, Spanish National Olympic Committee and as Chef de Mission at the games in Rome and Tokyo.

<h3>&lt;a href="Ash-triggered%20flight%20diversions%20cost%20airlines%20%241.7%20billion"&gt;Ash-triggered flight diversions cost airlines $1.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; (4:23)</h3>

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said today that the flight disruptions triggered by the recent eruption of a volcano in Iceland cost the global airline industry a total of $1.7 billion dollars.

According to the IATA, airlines lost a total of $400 million daily for the first three days of the week that European airspace was closed. The closures also impacted an estimated 1.2 million passengers around the world each day, until airspace around Europe began reopening last night.

The crisis compounds the financial troubles of an already troubled airline industry in Europe which, according to the IATA's chief executive officer, lost $9.4bn in 2009 and is forecasted to lose $2.8bn in 2010. 

The IATA also criticized the response of European governments to the ash threat, saying that they had over-reacted and the shutdown of all airspace was excessive. However, Eamonn Brennan, CEO of the Irish Aviation Authority said in defense of Eurocontrol, who had ordered the 4 day long shut down of airspace, that the closure was necessary to carry tests and gather data to determine how much ash the engines of an airliner could withstand yet still operate safely.

Restrictions over air travel in Europe have been lifted in many parts of the continent today; three-quarters of the scheduled flights were operating, and most of the European airspace has been opened. Only parts of British, French and Irish airspace remain closed.

<h2>On this day in history (6:04)</h2>
In 1918, the German fighter pilot known as "The Red Baron", the most successful flying ace of World War I with 80 confirmed air combat victories, was shot down and killed.

The Fair Map Amendment, a citizen-led initiative in &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; to reform the state constitution's procedures on legislative redistricting, may not gather enough signatures to be presented before voters during the next election. As of last Friday, organizers have collected only 120,000 of the 279,000 votes needed to bypass the state legislature and have the issue decided on solely by the voters in the November 2 election. 

The current process of redistricting, or redrawing district lines every ten years following the nationwide census, is in the hands of the state legislature, or the &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. The maps are often drawn by party leaders, allowing incumbent legislators to minimize and discourage opposition in their districts and perpetuate the leading party's dominance statewide. 

Election statistics indicate that incumbents are successful in their reelection 98 percent of the time, and that &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; have dominated legislative elections since they were able to draw the redistricting map in 2001. The Democratic Party has successfully reinforced their dominance through "spoking", which involves extending districts in &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; — a Democratic stronghold — out into the more &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;-leaning suburbs. In addition to allowing more Chicago residents to become legislators, this method severely weakens the strong Republican presence in the suburbs. Republicans, if given the chance to draw the maps, could overturn this trend by keeping key Republican-leaning suburban and downstate communities intact within their districts. 

The Fair Map Amendment, supported by Republicans and good-government groups such as the League of Women Voters of Illinois, would take the redistricting process out of legislators' hands and instead give that task to an independent, nine-member commission. The amendment would apply to the redistricting of only state legislative districts, not US congressional districts.  The General Assembly would still have to approve the commission's suggested map, however. 

Proponents initially aimed to collect the required signatures by April 1, but their inability to do so forced them to push their deadline to last Friday. Even then, organizers were still unable to meet their goal, and they now have until May 3 to send the necessary paperwork to the Illinois Secretary of State's office. "We're not having so much trouble; it's two weeks before we have to file," says Jan Czarnik, a member of the League of Women Voters. 

Czarnik suggests that the petition low number of signatures is due in part to not having "enough people circulating petitions in such a short amount of time." As Kent Redfield of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois–Springfield commented, "If you've got basically volunteers circulating petitions rather than, say, political parties, people that are normally used to doing this, you're going to have to have a larger margin of error." Another possible setback is that public opinion may not carry as much fervor as for other previously proposed amendments. 

Republicans, who hold the minority in the legislature, have proposed the amendment through more conventional means — via the General Assembly — but have been unsuccessful. Legislators also have considered other ways to reform the redistricting process. A few Republican party leaders' campaign funds have donated cash to the group organizing the petition, and House Minority Leader Tom Cross has asked the governor to call a special session on legislative redistricting. Some Democrats support the amendment, including Sheila Simon, her party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor. 

Other Democrats, however, strongly oppose the proposal. Senator Martin Sandoval from Chicago warns that "Hispanics will not see a proportionate and fair increase in Hispanic-majority districts," and the Mexican American Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund wants assurances that minority rights will not be curtailed.

<h1>News briefs:April 22, 2010</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Thursday, April 22nd, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Three%20dead%2C%20over%2070%20injured%20in%20Bangkok%20blasts"&gt;Three dead, over 70 injured in Bangkok blasts&lt;/a&gt; (0:17)</h3>

A series of explosions occurred in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, today, in which at least three people died and 70 were wounded. The explosions, caused by five M-79 grenades, occurred in the business district of the city. Three of the explosions were in the Saladaeng Skytrain station, one at a hotel and another was near a bank. 

The Thai government said the attacks had been from anti-government protestors named the Red Shirts who have been demanding new elections and the resignation of the Prime Minister for the past five weeks. On April 11, 21 people died in clashes between the Red shirts and government forces. The military has recommended using tear gas, rubber bullets and other ammunition to prevent the protesters from causing disruption, if necessary. However, the Army has been reluctant to use such ammunition, being unwilling to renew the violence.

<h3>&lt;a href="Train%20derails%20in%20South%20Africa%3B%20at%20least%20two%20dead"&gt;Train derails in South Africa; at least two dead&lt;/a&gt; (1:12)</h3>

A luxury train traveling in South Africa just outside the capitol of Pretoria yesterday, derailed killing at least two people and leaving 25 injured. 

Although the exact cause is yet to be determined, it appears that when the train was entering the station in Pretoria, seventeen of the cars derailed during a switch between steam and electric locomotives. An emergency worker at the scene said that the derailment had produced "absolute carnage." and that rescue workers had to use hydraulic equipment to cut some of the people free.

Nationalities of the deceased were not released, however, a spokesperson for the operator of the train said that most passengers were from the US or Europe.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20Treasury%20unveils%20new%20%24100%20note"&gt;US Treasury unveils new $100 note&lt;/a&gt; (1:57)</h3>

For the first time since 1996, the United States Department of the Treasury has issued a redesign the $100 bill. 

This new design brings the note in line with the updated scheme of the 5, 10, 20, and 50 dollar notes which were introduced in 2006. 

The note bears a new stylized portrait of Benjamin Franklin and new security and design features such as a more secure watermark and a new feature called 'motion' which uses 650,000 micro lenses to create a moving image. On the reverse it has a new, larger '100' printed in gold lettering. 

The note was originally slated for release in 2008 although budget constraints pushed the release date back. The note will go into general circulation by early 2011.

<h2>On this day in history (2:49)</h2>
In 1969 British yachtsman Sir Robin Knox-Johnston completes the first solo non-stop circumnavigation of the world.

<h1>News briefs:April 23, 2010</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Friday, April 23nd, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>&lt;a href="Bombings%20in%20Iraq%20kill%20dozens"&gt;Bombings in Iraq kill dozens&lt;/a&gt; (0:16)</h3>

In breaking news, multiple car bombs in Iraq's capital of Baghdad have killed at least 58 and wounded a further hundred. Some media reports put the death toll as high as 69.

Most of the explosions took place near Shia mosques during prayers; the deadliest attacks, meanwhile, were in Sadr City. There were at least six total bombings, although some reports put the figure as high as thirteen.

Baghdad security spokesman Qassim Moussawi told the Reuters news agency the bombings targeted "prayers in areas with a certain majority", referring to Iraq's Shia population. He added that the blasts were "revenge for the losses suffered by al-Qaeda", and that he believes "such terrorist acts" will continue. 

A top Iraqi official has accused al-Qaeda as being responsible for the attacks.

<h3>&lt;a href="Oil%20rig%20in%20Gulf%20of%20Mexico%20sinks%20after%20explosion%3B%20eleven%20missing"&gt;Oil rig in Gulf of Mexico sinks after explosion; eleven missing&lt;/a&gt; (1:13)</h3>

The oil rig "Deepwater Horizon" which is located roughly 50 miles southeast off the coast of Louisiana, sank yesterday after an explosion of unknown origins occurred Tuesday night. 115 of the 126 workers on board the time of the explosion have been rescued, however, 11 still remain missing although Coast Guard officials have expressed optimism that they are still alive.

The environmental impact of the accident is unclear. So far the effects have been considered minimal as the oil, up to 13,000 gallons of crude per hour, has been burned off, however, according to David Rainey, vice president of the lessor of the rig, British Petroleum, this could change. 

The rig, which was built in 2001 by Hyundai Heavy Industries and owned and operated by Transocean, was completing the construction of a new oil well, and was constructing a layer of cement in the well to reinforce it. This is considered dangerous, as it has the potential to produce an uncontrolled release of fluid, known as a blowout. While the cause of the explosion has yet to be determined, a blowout is considered a possibility.

<h3>&lt;a href="6.2%20magnitude%20aftershock%20provokes%20panic%20in%20southern%20Chile"&gt;6.2 magnitude aftershock provokes panic in southern Chile&lt;/a&gt; (2:30)</h3>

A 6.2-magnitude aftershock struck a large part of central and southern Chile Friday morning, but it caused no casualties or major damage, according to Chile's National Office of Emergency of the Interior Ministry (ONEMI).

The aftershock took place at 06:03 local time (10:03 UTC), and according to the University of Chile Geological Survey, the epicentre was located 65 kilometers to the south of Concepción which is roughly 580 kilometers from Chile's capital, Santiago. The Chilean Army's Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service has also ruled out the possibility of a tsunami in the affected area.

<h3>&lt;a href="Brazil%27s%20Minas%20state%20stops%20sales%20of%20Toyota%20Corolla"&gt;Brazil's Minas state stops sales of Toyota Corolla&lt;/a&gt; (3:13)</h3>

In Minas, Brazil, one of that nations largest states, the regional government has stopped the sale of the Toyota Corolla over safety concerns.

The move was made after nine Corolla customers reported that their cars automatically accelerated. The state public prosecutor's office said in an online statement on Tuesday that the problem is blamed on accelerator pedals sticking underneath floor mats. 

According to the prosecutor's office, sales of Corollas may resume when Toyota alters the floormats in its current models. Toyota has already recalled over eight million vehicles worldwide due to acceleration problems.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20vice%20president%20Biden%20says%20Iran%20sanctions%20likely%20by%20early%20May"&gt;US vice president Biden says Iran sanctions likely by early May&lt;/a&gt; (3:55)</h3>

Vice president of the United States, Joe Biden, said yesterday that he expects the United Nations to implement new sanctions against Iran beginning early next month. According to Biden, the latest sanctions would mark the first time the world was unified in its opposition to Iran's nuclear program. He added that China, which had previously been opposed to sanctions against Iran, would take part in these latest actions despite being a close trading partner with Iran.

Biden continued to add that Israel has pledged not to take military action against Iran in the near future, and would instead wait to see what effect sanctions have on Iran. Iran and Israel have long been at odds, and Israel has not ruled out launching a preemptive strike against Iran before it develops nuclear weapons. Numerous Western countries have claimed that developing nuclear weapons is the ultimate goal of Iran's nuclear program, although Tehran claims that the program is for civilian purposes only.

<h3>&lt;a href="Greece%20formally%20asks%20for%20EU-IMF%20loans"&gt;Greece formally asks for EU-IMF loans&lt;/a&gt; (4:57)</h3>

Greece has formally asked for rescue loans by the European Union and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be activated, aimed at helping the country recover from an economic crisis.

Under the plan, countries in the Eurozone will provide up to 30 billion euros in loans in the first year, while the IMF will contribute ten billion euros.

The bailout will cover Greece's borrowing needs for the immediate future so that it can avoid default. The request still needs to be approved by all fifteen countries using the euro, and will be reviewed by the European Central Bank.

<h3>&lt;a href="Chilean%20actor%20Oscar%20Garc%C3%A9s%20accused%20of%20sexual%20abuse"&gt;Chilean actor Oscar Garcés accused of sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt; (5:33)</h3>

Chilean actor Oscar Garcés was arrested last Saturday morning in Calama, Chile after a 25-year-old woman accused him of sexual abuse. 

Prosecutor Pablo Medina reports that Garcés went to the Sonesta Hotel at 5:00 AM local time, and called the reception desk to request room service. Soon after, he was involved in a fight with a female hotel worker. The victim accused Garcés of forcibly attempting to kiss her and groping her with the intent of abusing her.

After the incident the woman called the Carabineros, which is the uniformed Chilean national police force, and later verified her lesions at the Carlos Cisternas Hospital. Prosecutor Medina reported the investigation will take about 80 days and that Garcés is currently free with some restrictions. If convicted, Garcés could be imprisoned from three to seven years.

<h3>&lt;a href="Ben%20Shephard%20announces%20departure%20from%20GMTV"&gt;Ben Shephard announces departure from GMTV&lt;/a&gt; (6:30)</h3>

Ben Shephard, television personality on the UK morning program "Good Morning Television" has announced his departure from the show after 10 years. He is the third presenter to leave GMTV within the last year, after the departures of Fiona Phillips and Penny Smith.

Initially, Shephard only presented an entertainment section of the television programme before being given a promotion to the sofa in 2005. His current contract ends this month, but he is expected to stay on until the end of this summer after which he will then focus on a number of new projects with ITV and other channels.

<h3>&lt;a href="British%20poet%20Peter%20Porter%20dies%20at%20age%2081"&gt;British poet Peter Porter dies at age 81&lt;/a&gt; (7:10)</h3>

Australian-born British poet Peter Porter has died at the age of 81 after suffering from liver cancer. The poet was born in Brisbane, Australia in 1929 and moved to London, England in 1951. His first collection of works, entitled "Once Bitten, Twice Bitten", was first published in 1961 and he went on to become a broadcaster, reviewer, journalist and a full-time poet by the year 1968.

Porter won the Forward prize for his work titled "Max is Missing" and was shorlisted for a T.S. Eliot Prize for Poetry for the work "Afterburner". He is most well known for his collection of poems titled "The Cost of Seriousness" which he wrote after his first wife committed suicide in 1974. 

Anthony Thwaite, another English poet, and friend and colleauge to Peter Porter, said that he would describe Porter as "one of the finest poets of our time".

Trusteer, a web security company, reports that a trojan horse virus called &lt;a href="w%3AZeus%20%28trojan%20horse%29"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; can steal online banking details from infected computers. The virus has infected one out of every 3,000 computers of the 5,500,000 million which the company monitors in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

The trojan can infect users of &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Internet%20Explorer"&gt;Microsoft Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt;, and steals login information by recording keystrokes when the machine connects to certain websites, usually banks or other financial institutions. The stolen data is transmitted to a remote server and sold to cyber-criminals. "We expect this new version of Zeus to significantly increase fraud losses, since nearly 30% of Internet users bank online with &lt;a href="w%3AFirefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; and the infection is growing faster than we have ever seen before," said Amit Klein, chief technology officer at Trusteer, to BBC.

The trojan has also affected ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ users, including &lt;a href="Brian%20McNeil"&gt;Brian McNeil&lt;/a&gt;, who is the founder of Wikinewsie, a restricted-access wiki used to collaborate on sensitive news reports. McNeil reported : "On Saturday [April] 17, a Windows-based PC in the house issued a cry for help, the Avira package running on the system had just detected a piece of malware; full scans indicated several known pieces of malware and numerous hidden files. Additional scans revealed that all but one of the USB memory sticks and portable hard drives in the house were infected with something. The Zeus botnet, as it turned out." E-mail accounts for have also been affected.

<h1>News briefs:April 24, 2010</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Saturday, April 24th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Two%20children%20killed%20in%20fire%20in%20Derbyshire%2C%20England%3B%20man%20arrested"&gt;Two children killed in fire in Derbyshire, England; man arrested&lt;/a&gt; (0:16)</h3>

In breaking news, police arrested a 17 year old in the early hours of Saturday morning following the deaths of two children that were killed in a suspicious house fire in Buxton, Derbyshire, England, on Friday evening. 

During the fire, 23-year-old Fiona Adams and an eight-month-old baby successfully escaped through a first floor window, jumping down onto a child's trampoline. Both mother and child are currently in a hospital, having suffered from severe burns. The two children killed have been identified as five-year-old Niamh and two-year-old Cayden.

Please visit wikinews.org for more information as this story develops.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20state%20of%20Arizona%20signs%20into%20law%20controversial%20immigration%20bill"&gt;US state of Arizona signs into law controversial immigration bill&lt;/a&gt; (0:58)</h3>

In a move that has already ignited protests around the United States, Arizona governor Jan Brewer yesterday signed into law a bill that would severely crack down on immigration across the Mexican border.

Widely regarded as the harshest measure against illegal immigration in the US, the bill would allow police to legally question and detain anyone if they have "reasonable suspicion" to do so, as well as as making the failure to carry immigration papers a crime. Critics say that the bill would lead to discrimination and harassment against Hispanic people, whether or not they are legal citizens.

The bill has been widely criticized both within Arizona and across the country. The law is expected to face several court challenges as soon as it enters into effect, and US President Barack Obama, who has sharply criticized the bill, has ordered the US Justice Department to determine the legality of the bill.

Governor Brewer is defending the bill, however, saying that it would be an important asset in the fight against illegal immigration, particularly as Arizona is a major crossing point on the US-Mexico border.

<h3>&lt;a href="Six%20policemen%20killed%20in%20Ciudad%20Juarez%2C%20Mexico"&gt;Six policemen killed in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico&lt;/a&gt; (2:09)</h3>

A shootout in the northern Mexican city of Juárez has killed six police officers and a seventeen-year-old girl who had been walking by at the time of the shooting. 

The incident started when gunmen ambushed two police vehicles at an intersection when the police had tried to stop three vehicles suspected of transporting drug gang hitmen.

This is the latest in ongoing conflicts among drug cartels and clashes with police in Juárez that since December 2006 has seen the deaths of about 22,700 people.

<h3>&lt;a href="Iranian%20president%20Ahmadinejad%20in%20Zimbabwe%20for%20trade%20fair"&gt;Iranian president Ahmadinejad in Zimbabwe for trade fair&lt;/a&gt; (2:45)</h3>

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president of Iran, is visiting Zimbabwe to sign trade agreements and to meet with Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe.

Ahmadinejad claims that the amount of trade between the two nations should be increased and he remarked that Zimbabwe and Iran are creating a friendship based on a principled stand against Western interference. He went on to accuse the West of seeking control over Zimbabwe’s natural resources.

Ahmadinejad’s visit brought another source of friction between Mugabe and the Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party said that Mugabe's invitation to Iran sent the wrong message to the rest of the world as Zimbabwe was re-engaging the West and trying to rebuild its economy.

These developments come just a day after US Vice Predsident Joe Biden said that he expects the United Nations to implement new sanctions against Iran by early next month due to that nations refusal to stop its uranium enrichment program. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Belgian%20prime%20minister%20offers%20resignation"&gt;Belgian prime minister offers resignation&lt;/a&gt; (3:54)</h3>

Belgian prime minister Yves Leterme has offered to resign amid a political dispute concerning a long-term power struggle between the country's French-speaking Walloons and Flemish-speaking majority. The Belgian king, King Albert II, has not yet accepted the prime minister's offer and said that the resulting political turbulence from the resignation "seriously threatens" the country's standing in the European Union.

The latest disagreement centers on special rights for Walloons living near Brussels; specifically, the location of electoral boundaries around the capital. Frustrated over the failure to resolve the dispute, the Flemish liberal Open VLD Party pulled out of the government because they no longer have confidence in the government to negotiate a solution. 

This is the second time Yves Leterme has resigned as Prime Minister of Belgium. In 2008, he left office amid a banking scandal but he returned to office when the interim Prime Minister gave up the post to become the first, full-time head of the European Union.

<h3>&lt;a href="Illinois%20Fair%20Map%20Amendment%20could%20die%20before%20appearing%20on%20ballot"&gt;Illinois Fair Map Amendment could die before appearing on ballot&lt;/a&gt; (5:01)</h3>

A citizen-led initiative known as the Fair Map Amendment in the US state of Illinois that seeks to reform the state constitution's procedures on legislative redistricting, which is the redrawing of district lines every ten years following the nationwide census, may not gather enough signatures to be presented before voters during the next election cycle on November 2nd. As of last Friday, organizers have collected only 120,000 of the 279,000 signatures needed to bypass the state legislature and have the issue decided on solely by the voters in the election.

The current process of redistricting lies with the state legislature. The maps are often drawn by party leaders, allowing incumbent legislators to minimize and discourage opposition in their districts and perpetuate the leading party's dominance statewide. 

The Democrat Party has dominated legislative elections since they were able to draw the redistricting map in 2001 through a process known as "spoking", which involves extending districts in Chicago — a Democratic stronghold — out into the more Republican-leaning suburbs. This has allowed more Chicago residents to become legislators and potentially weakens the strong Republican presence in the suburbs. Republicans, if given the chance to draw the maps, could overturn this trend by keeping key Republican-leaning suburban and downstate communities intact within their districts. 

The Fair Map Amendment, supported by Republicans and good-government groups such as the League of Women Voters of Illinois, would take the redistricting process out of legislators' hands and instead give that task to an independent, nine-member commission.

Proponents of the amendment initially aimed to collect the required signatures by April 1 but now have until May 3 to send the necessary paperwork to the Illinois Secretary of State's office. 

<h3>&lt;a href="New%20York%20man%20pleads%20guilty%20in%20New%20York%20City%20subway%20bomb%20plot"&gt;New York man pleads guilty in New York City subway bomb plot&lt;/a&gt; (7:02)</h3>

Zarein Ahmedzay, a man from New York, has pleaded guilty to conspiring to blow up subway trains in New York City. In a plea entered in federal court in the city, he admitted to having flown to Pakistan in the summer of 2008 with two friends, one of whom has also pleaded guilty, for training with al-Qaeda. 

The three men met with al-Qaeda leaders and offered their assistance in fighting US troops in Afghanistan but were instead ordered to plan suicide-bombings in New York City similar to the 2005 London subway bombings. The men began planning their attack in time for Ramadan in September 2009, but their attack was foiled when their car was stopped entering New York City after testing bombs in Denver, Colorado. 

Ahmedzay plead guilty to conspiracy to use a weapon of mass of destruction against people in the United States; conspiracy to commit murder; and providing material support to a foreign rebel organization. He is expected to be sentenced in late July, and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20indicts%20eleven%20alleged%20pirates%20from%20Somalia"&gt;US indicts eleven alleged pirates from Somalia&lt;/a&gt; (8:08)</h3>

Eleven suspected Somali pirates have been indicted in the US in connection with recent attacks on two US navy ships off the coast of Africa.

The men were brought to a courthouse in Virginia on Friday to face piracy charges after being detained on US ships as the cases against them were being prepared.

A first group of five suspected pirates were indicted in connection with what authorities say was a firefight on March 31st between the USS Nicholas and their vessel in the Indian Ocean. The six other defendants were charged with an alleged attack on the USS Ashland in the Gulf of Aden on April 10th. If convicted, they could face life in prison.

Until recently, pirates detained in international operations off the African coast were generally tried in Kenya. Kenyan authorities, however, recently indicated they needed more international financial help for this because Kenyan courts are becoming overloaded with piracy cases.

<h3>&lt;a href="Somali%20al-Shabaab%20group%20seizes%20three%20towns"&gt;Somali al-Shabaab group seizes three towns&lt;/a&gt; (9:11)</h3>

According to witness reports, three towns in the Galgudud region of Somalia have been taken over by the counter-government group al-Shabaab, taking them from a rival group, the pro-government Ahlu Sunna.

The al-Shabaab group controls large portions of southern central Somalia, and part of Mogadishu which is near the three towns that have been over taken. A senior al-Shabaab official has stated that their Islamic group is attempting to take control of the entire region in an effort to promote the spread of the Islamic religion in the area.

<h3>&lt;a href="Zeus%20botnet%20trojan%20horse%20is%20back"&gt;Zeus botnet trojan horse is back&lt;/a&gt; (9:44)</h3>

The web security company Trusteer, reports that a trojan horse virus called Zeus and targets users of Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer, has infected one out of every 3,000 computers of the 5,500,000 million which the company monitors in the United States and the United Kingdom. The trojan works by stealing login information and recording the keystrokes when the machine connects to certain websites, usually banks or other financial institutions, then transmits the stolen data to a remote server and is sold to cyber-criminals.

Amit Klein, the chief technology officer at Trusteer told the BBC that "the infection is growing faster than we have ever seen before". The trojan has also affected some key users here at wikinews, including Brian McNeil, who is the founder of Wikinewsie, a restricted-access wiki used to collaborate on sensitive news reports. E-mail accounts for wikinews accredited reporters have also been reported as infected.

<h2>On this day in history (11:03)</h2>
In 1990 The Hubble Space Telescope is launched from the Space Shuttle Discovery. While initially considered a failure by the public due to its incorrectly ground primary mirror; after a repair mission in 1993, the telescope has since become not only a key tool in the understanding of the early universe, but also one of the most famous scientific instruments ever built.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABairnsdale"&gt;Bairnsdale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will return to Gippsland's major Australian rules football league after members voted to join the &lt;a href="Gippsland%20Football%20League"&gt;Gippsland League&lt;/a&gt; (GL). The GL, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Gippsland%20Football%20League"&gt;East Gippsland Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Country%20Football%20League"&gt;Victorian Country Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , regional Victoria's governing Aussie rules body, have all approved the move.

Bairnsdale will field teams in the seniors, under 18 and under 16 grades, but not a reserves side like the rest of the competition. Players not selected in the senior side will be able to play for a club in the East Gippsland minor league, under a unique transfer agreement. 

They will play their first game back in the major league in Warragul on April 9 before playing their first home game against Moe a week later.

Their furthest away game will be to Wonthaggi &amp;ndash; a one way trip of approximately 224 kilometres.

<h1>News brief: April 26, 2010</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Monday, April 26, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>&lt;a href="NATO%20tankers%20in%20Pakistan%20attacked%2C%20four%20killed"&gt;NATO tankers in Pakistan attacked, four killed&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Several NATO oil tankers were set on fire in the Punjab province of Pakistan, and four policemen were killed in a gunfight with unknown gunmen yesterday, reports say. The Deutsche Presse-Agentur reports it was the Taliban.

The incidents occurred in the town of Talagang. Aslam Tareen, the regional police chief, said that "around a dozen" tankers were set on fire after being attacked with rocket-propelled grenades. Tareen said there was an exchange of intensive fire killing four of his officers leaving two injured and there was petrol station that caught on fire.

DPA says the attack was the deadliest on NATO supply convoys in the province. Close to three quarters of all oil, food, and military supplies to landlocked Afghanistan first pass through Pakistan.

<h3>&lt;a href="Thai%20prime%20minister%20dismisses%20offer%20by%20anti-government%20protesters"&gt;Thai prime minister dismisses offer by anti-government protesters&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Thai prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has ruled out a compromise offer by anti-government protest leaders for parliament to be dissolved in thirty days. In a televised address on Sunday, with army chief General Anupong Paochinda at his side, the prime minister dismissed the offer made by the United Democratic Front against Dictatorship, saying such issues could not be resolved in such a short period of time.

Abhisit said the government stood by an offer made during earlier talks with the UDD for the house to be dissolved within the next nine months.

In reaction, the UDD maintained an earlier call for parliament to be dissolved immediately. The group also withdrew from any further negotiations with the government.

<h3>&lt;a href="WHO%20starts%20simultaneous%20immunization%20campaigns%20in%20over%20100%20countries"&gt;WHO starts simultaneous immunization campaigns in over 100 countries&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
The World Health Organization has started simultaneous immunization campaigns in 112 countries and territories across the world. The unprecedented vaccination drive will last for a week.

This is the first time the WHO has launched such an event across multiple regions at once. WHO officials say their goal is to expand immunization coverage and raise awareness of the importance of vaccines, and that such cross-border activities can prevent disease and save lives.

The agency says an important goal of the immunization campaigns is to reach those who have been excluded up to now. It notes that every year, in the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region, a quarter of deaths among children younger than five are attributed to preventable diseases. 2.1 million children in the Middle East hadn't received a shot against tetanus, whooping cough, or diphteria last year.

<h3>&lt;a href="Mississippi%20tornado%20kills%20at%20least%20ten"&gt;Mississippi tornado kills at least ten&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

At least ten people are dead after a large, destructive tornado tore through Yazoo City, Mississippi yesterday. 21 people have been hospitalized as a result of the storm, and others have been trapped in cars and houses. Multiple injuries resulted from cars being blown off of Interstate 55 during the storm.

The tornado moved along a path 200 miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide. Among damaged or destroyed buildings included at least twenty houses, a church, and several businesses. According to Yazoo City mayor McArthur Straughter, the storm ripped the roofs off of every building in the area.

The tornado occurred on the third, and most active, day of a severe weather outbreak that had previously affected states such as Kansas, Texas, and Arkansas. The Storm Prediction Center has received 104 reports of tornadoes so far during this outbreak.

<h3>&lt;a href="Five%20dead%20after%20continuing%20violence%20in%20Nigeria"&gt;Five dead after continuing violence in Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Fresh violence has broken out in the central Nigerian city of Jos earlier today, killing at least five people, according to witness reports.

The clashes began when the body of a seventeen year old Muslim teenager, supposedly strangled, was thrown onto a main street in the town in a sack, prompting riots. The AFP news service reports the dead body was that of a seventeen-year-old student. According to security officials, the riots have been calmed down, although a youth curfew is still in place.

The area has seen repeated conflicts between Christians and Muslims in the past.

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio Wikinews brief for Sunday, April 25th, 2010. The current time is 2:00 UTC. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Five%20dead%20after%20continuing%20violence%20in%20Nigeria"&gt;Five dead after continuing violence in Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; (0:19)</h3>

Fresh violence has broken out in the central Nigerian city of Jos earlier today, killing at least five people.

The clashes began when the body of a seventeen year old Muslim teenager, supposedly strangled, was thrown onto a main street in a sack, prompting riots. Military spokesman, Donald Oji, said that after the body had been found, Muslim rioters took to the streets and began stabbing passers-by indiscriminately. The riots have since been calmed down, although a youth curfew is still in place. 

<h3>(0:56)</h3>

A gun battle took place between Pakistani soldiers and insurgents on Sunday leaving eight insurgents dead and ten others injured. The incident occurred when about 40 rebels attacked a checkpoint near the Goain village in the Orakzai district of the North-West Frontier Province of the country.

Officials said the attack at the Goain checkpoint was resisted by the army and that two underground hideouts of the rebels had also been captured by the army.

This latest fighting comes just over a week after seventeen insurgents were killed in clashes with security troops in the same region.

<h3>&lt;a href="Mississippi%20tornado%20kills%20at%20least%20ten"&gt;Mississippi tornado kills at least ten&lt;/a&gt; (1:34)</h3>

At least ten people have been reported killed after a large, destructive tornado tore through Yazoo City, Mississippi yesterday. A further 21 people have been hospitalized as a result of the storm, and others have been trapped in cars and houses. Multiple injuries resulted from cars being blown off of Interstate 55 during the twister. The Salvation Army is aiding relief efforts by providing hot meals, coffee, cold drinks, and spiritual counseling to tornado victims in Yazoo and Warren Counties.

The tornado occurred on the third, and most active, day of a severe weather outbreak that had previously affected areas of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana, the latter two of which were also effected during Saturday's outbreak. The Storm Prediction Center has received 104 reports of tornadoes so far during this outbreak.

<h3>&lt;a href="Fire%20sweeps%20Manila%2C%20Philippines%20slum"&gt;Fire sweeps Manila, Philippines slum&lt;/a&gt; (2:33)</h3>

A large fire has swept thru suburban Manila in the Philippines and has destroyed many houses, leaving many homeless. At least two hundred fire engines have been sent to extinguish the flames.

The fire spread quickly due to strong winds and summer high temperatures. No fatalities were reported, although one resident suffered first degree burns and a Manila fire marshal told BBC News that two people have been reported missing. The fire started on Sunday afternoon and was still burning at nightfall, while people were trying to rescue some of their belongings.

Slum areas in the city are exposed constantly to fires because the houses, often made from wood, are in close proximity to one another.

<h3>&lt;a href="Thai%20prime%20minister%20dismisses%20offer%20by%20anti-government%20protesters"&gt;Thai prime minister dismisses offer by anti-government protesters&lt;/a&gt; (3:20)</h3>

Thailand's prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, has ruled out a compromise offer by anti-government protest leaders for that nations parliament to be dissolved in thirty days, with elections to be held in 90 days.

In a televised address on Sunday, with army chief General Anupong Paochinda at his side, the prime minister dismissed the offer made by the United Democratic Front against Dictatorship, saying such issues could not be resolved in such a short period of time and adding that his refusal to accept was due to the protestors alledgedly using violence and intimidation.

In reaction, the UDD, commonly known as the Red Shirts, maintained an earlier call for parliament to be dissolved immediately. The UDD also withdrew from any further negotiations with the government and UDD leaders have warned supporters rallying in central Bangkok's retail and business areas of the threat of new government crackdowns. There have been two large incidents of street violence in the past month or so, resulting in 26 deaths and injuries to hundreds of people. 

The Red Shirts primarily consist of supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was ousted in a 2006 in a coup. Shinawatra was later given a two-year prison term on charges of corruption, although he left the country in self-exile to avoid being jailed.

<h3>&lt;a href="Condemned%20US%20killer%20to%20face%20execution%20by%20firing%20squad"&gt;Condemned US killer to face execution by firing squad&lt;/a&gt; (4:49)</h3>

Convicted killer Ronnie Lee Gardner has chosen to die by firing squad in the US state of Utah's first execution in more than 10 years. Gardner indicated his preference at a state court in Salt Lake City on Friday, after being informed that an appeal against his death sentence had been rejected.

Gardner was convicted in 1985 of fatally shooting an attorney during a failed escape attempt at a courthouse in Salt Lake City. Under state law, the 49-year-old had a choice between death by lethal injection or by a five-person team of shooters. 

Utah is one of two states that permit execution by firing squad and though Utah outlawed the method in 2004, prisoners convicted before then still have it as an option. The state of Oklahoma also permits death by firing squad.

The 1979 novel, The Executioner's Song by Norman Mailer focused on one of the most famous executions in Utah history, the firing squad execution of Gary Gilmore on January 17, 1977. The book took a central position in the national debate over the revival of capital punishment by the US Supreme Court as Gilmore was the first person in the United States executed since the re-instatement of the death penalty in 1976.

<h3>&lt;a href="Paul%20Sch%C3%A4fer%2C%20founder%20of%20Colonia%20Dignidad%2C%20dies%20at%2088"&gt;Paul Schäfer, founder of Colonia Dignidad, dies at 88&lt;/a&gt; (6:16)</h3>

Paul Schäfer, the founder and former leader of Colonia Dignidad (the Dignified Colony), an enclave used for torturing and exterminating political prisoners during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile, died at 88 from cardiac-respiratory arrest on early Saturday morning in a Chilean prison hospital. 

Schäfer had been convicted for sexually abusing 26 children and retained thousands of people under his own tyrannical regime that worked as an aside territory in the country. 

Schäfer was born in 1921, in Siegburg, Germany and had been a a non-commissioned Nazi officer, who moved to Chile after the Second World War, evading accusations of sexual abuse of minors. He established an organization in a rural area of Chile which he named Villa Babiera, located 400 kilometers south of Santiago. 

His rule of this area began in 1961 where he oversaw almost 300 Germans who worked for decades without pay. Men and women were segregated, and people who tried to escape were killed. 

When Pinochet's regime ended, Schäfer escaped from Chile in 1996 to avoid being imprisoned after he came under investigation for human rights violations and abuse to minors. Eventually, he was detained in Argentina and then extradited back to Chile in 2005.

<h3>&lt;a href="British%20government%20apologises%20for%20suggesting%20the%20Pope%20could%20create%20a%20brand%20of%20%26quot%3BBenedict%26quot%3B%20condoms"&gt;British government apologises for suggesting the Pope could create a brand of "Benedict" condoms&lt;/a&gt; (7:50)</h3>

The British foreign office has apologized after a leaked memo about a visit by Pope Benedict XVI suggested that he might launch a "Benedict" brand of condoms, bless a gay marriage, and open an abortion clinic during a papal visit to the UK.

The memo followed a brainstorming session, where members of the Papal Visit Team came up with ideas for the first papal visit to Britain in 28 years, and was sent to senior civil servants via email on the 5th of March, with the title "Policy planning ahead of the Pope’s visit". Other suggestions were that the pope should change policy to allow female bishops, sponsor AIDS clinics, "spend a night in a council flat in Bradford" and "do forward rolls with children to promote healthy living." A further idea was to change the national anthem to a charity song "God Save the World", performed as a duet by Queen Elizabeth II and the pope.

The ministry apologized, saying that it was "ill-judged, naive and disrespectful," and that the responsible member of staff had been transferred to other duties.

A four-day papal visit to England and Scotland is scheduled to take place in September 2010, but a highly-placed source in the Vatican said, "It’s even possible the trip could be canceled as this matter is hugely offensive."

<h3>&lt;a href="WHO%20starts%20simultaneous%20immunization%20campaigns%20in%20over%20100%20countries"&gt;WHO starts simultaneous immunization campaigns in over 100 countries&lt;/a&gt; (9:22)</h3>

The World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday began simultaneous immunization campaigns in 112 countries and territories across the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, and European regions. The unprecedented vaccination drive will last for a week.

WHO officials say their goal is to expand immunization coverage and raise awareness of the importance of vaccines, and that such cross-border activities can prevent disease and save lives.

WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein says that many countries are working to eliminate measles, adding that some countries in the European region are very concerned that they have stalled in their goal of eliminating measles and rubella this year. According to Epstein, immunization coverage is below the 95 percent recommended level (known as herd immunity) and there have been ongoing measles outbreaks in some of these countries. Measles cases have also been reported to the US and Canada

Epstein added that the biggest obstacle to reaching the goals of vaccination are lack of awareness, lack of information and people being ignorant that they should be vaccinated.

The WHO also began a large polio immunization campaign across sixteen countries in central and West Africa on Saturday saying that 78 million children under the age of five will be vaccinated to stop a major outbreak of the disease. This is the first time the World Health Organization has launched such an event across multiple regions at once. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Stephen%20Hawking%20thinks%20aliens%20%26quot%3Balmost%20certain%20to%20exist%2C%26quot%3B%20could%20invade%20Earth"&gt;Stephen Hawking thinks aliens "almost certain to exist," could invade Earth&lt;/a&gt; (11:00)</h3>

After three years of working on a new series for the Discovery Channel, famed University of Cambridge theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking concludes that aliens are "almost certain to exist," and could even be dangerous. However, he believes that the most likely forms of life would be microbes or possibly small animals.

Hawking thinks that it is rational to assume that intelligent life exists somewhere in the Universe, and that it is mathematically unlikely that life is unique to the Earth, given the existence of a hundred billion galaxies, each of them containing hundreds of millions of stars.

Hawking imagines nomadic aliens who, after having exhausted their home's resources, could attempt to take control of other planets, invading with "massive ships". He draws a comparison with Christopher Columbus discovering America, resulting in similar devastating consequences.

His rationale stems from the famous Drake equation, created by Frank Drake in 1961, which takes into consideration such factors such as the average rate of star formation per year in our galaxy, the fraction of those stars that have planets and the fraction of civilizations on those planets that develop a technology that could transmit detectable signs of their existence into space. 

However, another famous experiment known as the Fermi Paradox theorizes a contradiction between the high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, as per the Drake equation, and the lack of evidence for, or contact with, such civilizations. Enrico Fermi, who devised the paradox, came up with this idea when he wondered "Where are they?" after he concluded that Earth should have been visited long ago and many times over. 

<h2>On this day in history (12:49)</h2>

In 1939, DC Comics publishes its second major superhero in Detective Comics #27; his name is Batman and he has become one of the most popular comic book superheroes of all time. But why is he "so serious"?

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMorwell%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Morwell, Victoria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Traralgon defeated Morwell last Monday in round three of the 2010 (officially Gippsland League, GL) season. The two teams, along with Maffra, were the only teams undefeated through two games played going into this weekend.

In other round three matches, Warragul lost to Sale, Maffra defeated Wonthaggi and Drouin defeated Moe.
Traralgon cemented the top spot with a thirty-three-point win over Morwell. A six goal haul from Lauchlan Dowling couldn't bring Morwell towards victory. Traralgon shared around the goals with thirteen individual goal scorers.

Morwell lead Traralgon by three points at the end of the first quarter but had lost that lead to trail by nine points at half time. Traralgon extended their lead to twenty-three points at the end of the third quarter, ultimately winning 20–15 (135) to 15–12 (102).

Traralgon are on top with three wins, ahead of Maffra on percentage and a game clear of Sale and Morwell. Drouin rounded out the top five a game further back.

Wonthaggi, behind Drouin on percentage, Moe, Leongatha and Warragul, all with no wins, would miss the finals if they were to start next weekend. 

The Gippsland Football League is considered one of the "major leagues" controlled by the &lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Country%20Football%20League"&gt;Victorian Country Football League&lt;/a&gt;, the governing body of in regional &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. At the league's annual general meeting in December, it changed it's name from the West Gippsland Latrobe Football League.

Singer &lt;a href="w%3ABret%20Michaels"&gt;Bret Michaels&lt;/a&gt; has remained in a critical condition after suffering a &lt;a href="w%3Abrain%20haemorrhage"&gt;brain haemorrhage&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3APoison"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; singer was rushed to a &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; hospital on Friday with complaints of a severe headache.
His publicist released a statement saying that "Bret is a fighter and we are hopeful that once all is complete, the slurred speech, blurred vision and dizziness etc will be eliminated and all functions will return to normal." He added that Michaels is conscious. 

Michaels reached fame in the 1980s along with the glam rock band Poison. The group released such songs as “&lt;a href="w%3AEvery%20Rose%20Has%20Its%20Thorn"&gt;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="w%3ATalk%20Dirty%20to%20Me"&gt;Talk Dirty to Me&lt;/a&gt;”. They are still recording and releasing music after 25 years. Michaels also recently recorded a song with teen singer &lt;a href="w%3AMiley%20Cyrus"&gt;Miley Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;. 

The singer can currently be seen on US television on reality show The &lt;a href="w%3ACelebrity%20Apprentice"&gt;Celebrity Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;. The show which was recorded six months ago, is only half way through the current series. Michaels is one of the favourites to win. Fellow celebrities have sent messages to Michaels, British music manager &lt;a href="w%3ASharon%20Osborne"&gt;Sharon Osborne&lt;/a&gt; said "I'm thinking of you and wishing you a speedy recovery", while former Professional wrestler &lt;a href="w%3AMaria%20Kanellis"&gt;Maria Kanellis&lt;/a&gt; asked fans to keep Michaels in their prayers. The show’s host &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; also sent Michaels his well wishes.

<h2>Intro</h2>
For Monday, April 26th, 2010, this is the audio Wikinews brief, your free news source. The current time is 22:30 UTC. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>(0:20)</h3>

At least 55 people have been killed in the city of Darfur, Sudan after clashes between the Rezeigat tribe, a Muslim and Arabic tribe of nomadic Bedouin's, and the Southern Sudanese army.

Mohammed Issa Aliou, a spokesman for the Rezeigat tribe, said they had been looking for water and new pastures when they were attacked by armed forces near the border with the partially autonomous South Sudan. The South Sudanese army, however, responded by saying that the tribal members were the ones who had started the attacks.

The United Nations reports that so far this year, nearly 500 people have been killed in this region over cattle raiding and revenge violence. This is the largest outbreak of violence in the region since elections were held in the nation earlier this month.

<h3>&lt;a href="6.5%20magnitude%20earthquake%20hits%20off%20coast%20of%20Taiwan"&gt;6.5 magnitude earthquake hits off coast of Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; (1:11)</h3>

A 6.5 magnitude earthquake struck off the southeast coast of Taiwan today at 10:59 local time according to the US Geological Survey. 

The quake's depth was at ten kilometers, which is considered relatively shallow, and the epicenter was 269 kilometers east of T'ai-tung, Taiwan.

Both the Taiwanese Central Weather Bureau and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said no tsunami warning was issued as there is no threat of a Pacific-wide tsunami. According to the Associated Press, some buildings in the capital Taipei swayed for about twenty seconds, although there were not any immediate reports of damage, injuries, or deaths. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Nearly%20100%2C000%20protest%20for%20closure%20of%20US%20military%20base%20in%20Japan"&gt;Nearly 100,000 protest for closure of US military base in Japan&lt;/a&gt; (1:56)</h3>

A protest on the Japanese island of Okinawa calling for the closure of a United States military base attracted almost 100,000 people on Sunday, after speculations that the Japanese government may back out of an election promise to force it off the island entirely.

The base, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, has been long criticized by the Japanese people, as it and other bases on the island have served as the location for most of America's 47,000 troops stationed in Japan. The US military presence on the island is seen by some as a legacy of Japan's defeat in World War II by the US.

Japan's current prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, pledged to move the base off of Okinawa entirely, and transfer 8,000 military personnel to Guam, superseding a 2006 agreement between the Japanese and American governments to move the base to a less urbanized part of Okinawa. Hatoyama said that he would make a decision about the matter by the end of May, and on Friday told Parliament that he would "stake his job" to do so. Opposition leaders in Japan have demanded that Hatoyama should resign as Prime Minister if he does not make a decision by the end of May.

Last week, Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada met with U.S. Ambassador John Roos but the content of their conversation has been disputed. Media reports stated that Okada told the American Ambassador that Tokyo was in favor of most of the 2006 deal, but Okada has denied the statement, saying that while he had met with Roos, no concessions on the matter had been made. The reports inflamed Okinawans, and the mayor of Nago, Okinawa said that the government was "playing with the Okinawans' feelings."

Support for Hatoyama's government has fallen sharply in recent months to a 30% approval rating, down from 70% late last year. He has been criticized both in Japan and in the US for his handling of the situation as he has been unable to gain support for alternate sites for the naval base, and has thus far been unable to conduct talks with local officials about the matter. 

The United States is pushing Japan for compliance with the original 2006 agreement, saying that it is the most viable solution.

<h3>&lt;a href="Poison%20lead%20singer%20Bret%20Michaels%20in%20critical%20condition"&gt;Poison lead singer Bret Michaels in critical condition&lt;/a&gt; (4:25)</h3>

Singer Bret Michaels of the rock group Poison, was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital on Friday with complaints of a severe headache and has remained in critical condition after suffering a brain hemorrhage.

The singer rose to fame in the 1980's during the Los Angeles era of chart topping hair bands and is most famous for the songs “Every Rose Has Its Thorn”, "Nothin' but a Good Time" and “Talk Dirty to Me”. The band still records and releases music after 25 years together and Michaels recently recorded a song with the teen singer Miley Cyrus. 

Michaels is also one of the favorites to win the current season of The Celebrity Apprentice, a reality show that pits contestants against each other in an elimination-style competition to become an apprentice to real estate mogul, Donald Trump. Trump, who also hosts the show, has sent Michaels his best wishes.

After &lt;a href="Oil%20rig%20in%20Gulf%20of%20Mexico%20sinks%20after%20explosion%3B%20eleven%20missing"&gt;an explosion&lt;/a&gt; aboard an oil rig four days ago, an oil spill caused by the sinking of the rig has expanded to cover an area of around 600 square miles (1550 square kilometers), and efforts to shut off the leak have thus far been unsuccessful.

Officials have begun to use robotic submersible vehicles to stop the leak. The efforts began yesterday, although it could be as late as tomorrow before they are completed. The vehicles will attempt to engage a device called a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ablowout%20preventer"&gt;blowout preventer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which can seal the well shut to prevent sudden releases of pressure within the well, like the one that may have caused the rig to explode. According to &lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt;, the company that operated the well, the attempt was the first of its kind in the world.

The leaks are on a pipe from the ocean floor called a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amarine%20riser"&gt;riser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They are currently estimated to be releasing around 42,000 gallons of oil a day into the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and the oil slick on the surface of the ocean is estimated to cover an area about 48 by 39 miles at its widest points. Officials say oil is not expected to reach land until at least Thursday, and would remain at least 30 miles from land through Tuesday. The impact of the spill on wildlife is currently unknown; there have been no reports of animal casualties, though whales were seen in the vicinity of the spill yesterday.

According to officials, there are two other possible ways to contain the oil spill if the attempt to seal the well is unsuccessful. One option would be to install a large dome over the leak and send the collected oil to the surface, where it would be collected by ships. This has been done before, although only in shallow water. The second option is to drill an entirely new well that would intersect the original, although this could take months to complete.

People should be free to enjoy the fruits of their labor and government should be limited to protecting the life, liberty and property of its citizens. That includes such things as national defense, a court system to resolve disputes, and the enforcement mechanisms to enforce contracts between consenting adults and legal entities. A key characteristic of the Libertarian Party is that we do not believe that coercion should be used to effect change. When joining the LP, we take the following oath: "I certify that I oppose the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals."

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡On one of California's major issues today, how do you propose to fix our failing economy?♡❤♡

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0AD; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; We need to roll-back spending to the level of 1998, adjusted for inflation and population (does anyone think we didn't have enough government in 1998?); lower taxes significantly (especially income and sales taxes); eliminate harmful, useless, and duplicate regulatory agencies; significantly reduce the number of employees at most state agencies; and permanently limit future spending increases based on population and inflation and limited to the tax receipts available (no more deficit spending).

We need to roll-back excessive salaries and pensions for state employees and increase the retirement age for both current and future state employees to 65 to 70 (from the current 50 or 55). We need to end collusion between politicians, bureaucrats and government employee unions. No elected or appointed official should ever get a pension or post-employment benefits.

The friendly business and low tax environment in California will attract tens of thousands of businesses and millions of jobs to California and, eventually, tax receipts will soar. However, any excess revenue should be used to retire debt or returned to the taxpayers.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡What is your stance on gay marriage?♡❤♡

Let people choose how to live their lives, choose with whom they share it, and decide for themselves what arrangements (marriage or otherwise) should be made for all of life’s situations. Treat every individual equally. Do not discriminate in favor of or against married couples (or groups). Let them decide what promises to make to one another and embed those promises in contracts. The state can then enforce the contracts, as it should enforce all contracts between consenting adults. If religions want to put their “stamp of approval” on a wedding, let them; let the people involved decide what to do.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Do you believe in the legalization of marijuana and why?♡❤♡

I believe in the legalization of &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;. The government does not have either the right nor the moral authority to prohibit what substances people put into their bodies for either medicinal or recreational or other purposes. Practically, the war on drugs has been a dismal failure. Just like prohibitions on alcohol, gambling, prostitution, etc., they do not work. They push the activity underground and create opportunities for the criminal element and, likewise, opportunities for the corruption of police and other public officials. Generally, such laws are enforced inconsistently and to the detriment of the most vulnerable individuals in society.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Explain how you think California's immigration laws should work.♡❤♡

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0AD; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Philosophically, I believe in open borders. People should be able to come and go as they please. However, the government should not take money from one group of individuals (taxpayers) and give it to others. We should not subsidize nor penalize immigrants. If people want to come to the United States and California to work and take care of their families, they should be allowed to do so. However, those who commit crimes against persons or property should be either imprisoned (for serious offenses) or deported. In that regard, the United States government needs to monitor and control its borders.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Why should California "permanently roll-back spending to or below the level of 1998... and absolutely limit future spending increases?" ♡❤♡

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0AD; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Over the past 20-30 years, the state of California has continuously increased the share of the economy that it confiscates through taxes and spends, mostly, on unionized government employees and social welfare. It has reduced the amount of money that benefits the general populace in infrastructure. I chose 1998 because that pre-dates the pension scam perpetrated by Gray Davis, the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat%20Party"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; in the state legislature, and the government employee unions, in which retirement ages were reduced to absurd levels and benefits were increased by about 50%. Were we to roll back spending to 1998 levels, we could both eliminate the state income tax and have a budget surplus. In my opinion, that process was a fraud perpetrated on the taxpayers of California and should be prosecuted criminally. The politicians took bribes in the form of campaign contributions and support and the leaders of the government employee unions paid bribes.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Why is it necessary to repeal the global warming laws?♡❤♡ 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0AD; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; There is no global warming crisis. The alleged warming trends do not exist and there has actually been a cooling trend over the last ten or so years. The "scientists" who raise the alarm on global warming trends have been discredited as having manipulated their data and destroying data that does not support their beliefs (if they even believe them). Billions of dollars of taxpayer money has been diverted to politically correct scientists and scammers like Al Gore who have gotten rich from this falsehood and who propose to use global warming as an excuse to control mankind's behavior (their real intent). Even if there is some minor global warming (which there has been in some earlier periods in history), there is no reason to believe that it would be harmful to the climate as a whole. Some areas may benefit and some may lose, but that would be true if we had global cooling, too. As an intellectual exercise, ask yourself these questions (originally posed by &lt;a href="w%3AVaclav%20Klaus"&gt;Vaclav Klaus&lt;/a&gt;)

Even if we can say yes, with some degree of probability, to the first question, the answers to the remaining questions clearly is no.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡Why should the state remove itself from the education of children? Would you also cut funds for the University of California?♡❤♡

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0AD; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Like everything the government does, it does a miserable job of educating children and spends way too much doing so. Private competitive schools, perhaps funded by vouchers, would be better. Public school systems have way too many administrators and lack accountability. Teacher unions have the same adverse effect on education that government employee unions have on other government "services." Let's give parents choices by eliminating the monopolistic, union-controlled schools. Competition works and freedom works.

As far as the UC &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;University of California|&lt;/a&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; system, it is a massive overfunded boondoggle. Higher education has been protected from price competition for many decades. The more government subsidizes education, the higher the price charged for that education with the result that the students and their parents end up paying as much as before. The cost of education has increased far faster than inflation over the past several decades. From what I've seen and read, most university professors are grossly underworked. They need to spend more time teaching; there needs to be more innovation in teaching to keep the cost down (like online education, but certainly not limited to that). Many of the services provided to students at our universities are more baby-sitting than education. We need real competition in education and we need to privatize our public universities. Let people keep their tax money and use it to decide where to go to school. I propose we sell the UC system to private owners and let it compete.

Thousands of &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; public school students walked out of classes Tuesday, in protest of Governor &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Christie"&gt;Chris Christie's&lt;/a&gt; proposed budget cuts. Although there is no definite number, it is estimated that around 18,000 students did not attend classes.

The walk-out was spurred by a &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; event calling on students to skip classes and picket their local school boards. The leader of the group, former student Michelle Ryan Lauto, said that she "just want to draw attention to the entire issue and I want to show both the governor and his administration that the youth is not apathetic towards these cuts and that we care very very much so about what happens to our education and our extra curricular activities."

The demonstrations come soon after voters in 59% of the state school districts opposed a proposal to increase property tax levies to pay for schools.

The state's largest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, said that the students, who "were engaging in civil disobedience", should not walk-out on classes.

The governor's office responded to the protests in a statement, saying: "It is also our firm hope that the students were motivated by youthful rebellion or spring fever &amp;mdash; and not by encouragement from any one-sided view of the current budget crisis in New Jersey. Students would be better served if they were given a full, impartial understanding of the problems that got us here in the first place and why dramatic action was needed."

<h2>Intro</h2>
From wikinews, the free news source, this is the audio wikinews brief for Tuesday, April 27th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Sudanese%20president%20declared%20winner%20of%20elections"&gt;Sudanese president declared winner of elections&lt;/a&gt; (0:17)</h3>

Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, has been declared the winner of this month's elections, after the first multiparty polls in 24 years. In a separate election, Salva Kiir, a former rebel leader, was declared president of the semi-autonomous southern Sudan.

According to the Sudanese election commission, al-Bashir won 68% of the vote, while Salva Kiir obtained 93% of the vote out of slightly more than 2.5 million total votes.

Two of al-Bashir's main opponents withdrew before the voting began, accusing the polling process of being rigged and observers along with the opposition have complained of fraud. 

Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes, although al-Bashir denies the allegations.

<h3>&lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico%20oil%20spill%20expanding%3B%20submarines%20to%20try%20to%20stop%20leak"&gt;Gulf of Mexico oil spill expanding; submarines to try to stop leak&lt;/a&gt; (1:10)</h3>

Officials are using a robotic submersible vehicle to stop an oil leak after an explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico last Thursday. 

An estimated 42,000 gallons of oil a day have been leaking from a pipe on the ocean floor called a riser, which is a spring tensioned pipe that runs between the sea floor and the rig. The remotely operated submersible is attempting to engage a device known as a blowout preventer, which is a large valve which can seal the well shut to prevent a sudden release of pressure within the well, such as the one that may have caused the rig to explode. According to BP, the company that operates the well, the attempt is the first of its kind in the world.

The environmental impact of the spill on wildlife is currently unknown; there have been no reports of animal casualties, though whales were seen in the vicinity of the spill yesterday. Officials say an oil slick on the surface of the ocean is estimated to cover an area about 48 by 39 miles at its widest points and that it could begin to impact coastal regions by Thursday. 

Should the submersibles fail in their attempt to close the blowout preventer, two other possible ways to contain the oil spill are possible. One option would be to install a large dome over the leak and send the collected oil to the surface, where it would be collected by ships. This has been done before, although only in shallow water. The second option is to drill an entirely new well that would intersect the original, although this could take months to complete.

115 of the 126 workers on board the rig at the time of the explosion were rescued, however, 11 still remain missing.

<h3>&lt;a href="Snap%20election%20fails%20to%20end%20political%20deadlock%20in%20Nauru"&gt;Snap election fails to end political deadlock in Nauru&lt;/a&gt; (3:04)</h3>

A snap election on the island nation of Nauru in Micronesia, has failed to end a political deadlock with all eighteen members of parliament having been re-elected. President Marcus Stephen called this early election in the hopes that he could gain a clear mandate in Parliament which is currently evenly split with nine Members of Parliament representing both political parties. Because neither side can decide who should be speaker of the house, a government cannot be formed.

President Stephen has attempted to revitalize Nauru, but during his term in office, he has been faced with numerous issues. Nauru was once one of the richest countries in the world due to its phosphate mineral deposits, but because of bad investments, the nation has become one of the poorest and now relies upon aid from Russia. For the time being, Stephen will remain in power with a caretaker government.

<h3>&lt;a href="Hungarian%20conservative%20party%20wins%20majority%20in%20parliament"&gt;Hungarian conservative party wins majority in parliament&lt;/a&gt; (4:01)</h3>

The conservative party of Hungary, known as Fidesz, a Hungarian acronym which translates into "Alliance of Young Democrats", has won a two-thirds majority in parliament, according to official results. 

With about 99% of all votes counted, Fidesz is projected to have won 263 seats in the 386-seat parliament, ending eight years of Socialist government.

The incumbent Socialists placed a distant second, obtaining 59 seats, while the far-right Jobbik took 47 seats. A new Green party, called Politics Can Be Different, received sixteen seats, and an independent candidate took the remaining seat.

With this power change, Fidesz now has the ability to unilaterally alter the constitution, having more than the required two-thirds majority - or 258 seats - needed to do so.

Viktor Orbán, the leader of Fidesz, is widely considered to take office as Prime Minister.

<h3>&lt;a href="Smoke%20bomb%20thrown%20in%20Ukrainian%20parliament%20during%20naval%20base%20debate"&gt;Smoke bomb thrown in Ukrainian parliament during naval base debate&lt;/a&gt; (5:03)</h3>

Chaos broke out in the Ukrainian parliament as several smoke bombs were thrown during a debate about the extended lease on a Russian naval base in Ukraine. Members of parliament were seen fighting on the chamber floor while opposition MPs threw eggs at the speaker of the house.

It is not clear who threw the smoke bombs, although opposition MPs were thought to be responsible, but the debate continued despite the lingering smoke and chaos. The speaker had to be protected by two aides holding umbrellas and politicians held handkerchiefs to their mouths.

Along with the brawling MPs, thousands of people waited outside the parliament building protesting the extended lease.

The Russians have offered Ukraine cheaper supplies of Russian natural gas in exchange for a further 25 years on the lease of the naval base which was currently set to end in 2017. 

After the chaos had calmed down, MPs voted on the agreement and the deal extending the lease was backed 236 to 214. The deal was then put forward in the Russian lower house of parliament, where all 410 Russian MPs voted in favor of the deal.

<h3>&lt;a href="New%20Zealander%20William%20Trubridge%20breaks%20freediving%20world%20record"&gt;New Zealander William Trubridge breaks freediving world record&lt;/a&gt;, (6:17)</h3>

In sports today, 29-year-old William Trubridge from New Zealand set a new freediving record on Sunday, reaching a depth of 116 meters (380 feet) in the Atlantic Ocean, holding his breath for four minutes nine seconds — breaking the world record for the deepest free immersion dive.

Trubridge wore a silicon-coated wetsuit and used the breaststroke and a set of fins to plunge into world's deepest blue hole, a submarine cave, in a bay west of Clarence Town on Long Island, in the Bahamas.

Trubridge already holds nine world records, and the dive put him into first place in the "Vertical Blue Suunto Dive-Off" competition.

On the other side of the planet, at Morwell, Victoria, in Australian rules football, Traralgon cemented the top spot in round three of the 2010 Gippsland Football League with a thirty-three-point win over Morwell. 

Traralgon are on top in the series with three wins, ahead of Maffra on percentage and a game clear of Sale and Morwell. Drouin rounds out the top five a game further back.

<h3>&lt;a href="Dale%20Ogden%2C%202010%20California%20gubernatorial%20candidate%2C%20talks%20with%20Wikinews"&gt;Dale Ogden, 2010 California gubernatorial candidate, talks with Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; (7:27)</h3>

Be sure to check out Mike Morales' interview with 2010 California gubernatorial candidate, Dale Ogden. In today's wikinews feature article, Mike presses the Libertarian on the issues of fixing California's ailing economy, immigration and his views of global climate change.

In 1810, Ludwig van Beethoven composes his famous piano piece, Für Elise. While it is uncertain who Elsie was, perhaps a mistress or a friend whom rejected his marriage proposal, whoever she was, his love for her has endured for two centuries through this beautiful composition.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; government today approved plans for a controversial wind power project off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Cod"&gt;Cape Cod&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, which, if built, would be the nation's first offshore wind farm.

The company responsible for the project, &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Wind"&gt;Cape Wind&lt;/a&gt;, received a permit from the federal government to commence construction of the wind farm, which was announced by Interior Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Salazar"&gt;Ken Salazar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;. Salazar said in statements at the event that he was "approving the Cape Wind project," which would "be the first of many projects up and down the Atlantic coast." 
Massachusetts governor &lt;a href="w%3ADeval%20Patrick"&gt;Deval Patrick&lt;/a&gt; said that "America needs offshore wind power, and with this project, Massachusetts will lead the nation." He also commented that "Cape Wind is good for our environment and good for our energy needs," despite opposition from some groups. 

Construction of the wind farm in the near future is not certain, as there are additional regulatory procedures the company must complete, and opponents have threatened to take the project to court. According to the leader of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, a group opposed to the wind farm's construction, numerous permits related to the project were being appealed, and close to a dozen parties intend to sue the project, claiming it violates environmental regulations.

Supporters of the project say that it will provide up to 75% of the power for the region, and will benefit the environment by providing a clean and renewable source of power, as well as providing hundreds of new jobs in the area during construction of the wind farm. Opponents, which included deceased US Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, claim it will destroy the natural beauty of the region, and will raise the costs of electricity in the area.

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the Audio Wikinews Brief for Wednesday, April 28th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Suicide%20bombing%20in%20Afghanistan%20kills%20three%2C%2035%20injured"&gt;Suicide bombing in Afghanistan kills three, 35 injured&lt;/a&gt; (0:17)</h3>

A suicide bombing near an airfield in Kandahar, Afghanistan yesterday killed at least three people and injured a further 35.

According to a commander of southern Afghan armed forces, Sher Mohammed Zazai, the explosion hit the airfield as well as a compound giving logistical help to NATO troops.

A correspondent for Al Jazeera in Kabul reports at least three suicide bombers were involved in the attack. The news agency also attributed the attack to the Taleban.

This attack comes soon after the United Nations said it would be closing its Kandahar office temporarily due to concerns about security. At least twenty civilians, among them eight children, have been killed in attacks in Kandahar since April 12. 

<h3>(1:05)</h3>

Across the border in Pakistan, officials have said that missiles fired from a U.S. drone aircraft killed at least five suspected rebels in the northwest part of the country near the Afghan border on Monday.

Authorities say three missiles struck a compound about 25 kilometers east of Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan.

This is the second drone strike made by a US unmanned aerial vehicles in the area within two days; on Saturday, seven people were killed in another such attack.

<h2>On this day in history (1:37)</h2>

In 1789, about 1,300 miles west of Tahiti, near Tonga, Fletcher Christian, the master's mate on board the Royal Navy ship HMAV Bounty, led a mutiny against the ship's commander William Bligh.

<h1>&quot;Bigoted woman&quot;: controversial Gordon Brown remarks caught on air</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%26quot%3BBigoted%20woman%26quot%3B%3A%20controversial%20Gordon%20Brown%20remarks%20caught%20on%20air&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; is now at the centre of controversy when, on Thursday, a live microphone caught him describing a voter he had talked to as being a "bigoted woman".

The incident occurred after Brown, encouraged by his advisors to interact with ordinary people more often before next week's parliamentary elections, went for a walkabout in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ARochdale"&gt;Rochdale&lt;/a&gt;, located near &lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;. There, he spoke with Gillian Duffy, aged 65, who challenged him on topics such as health and education, before asking about immigration: "All those Eastern Europeans what are coming in, where are they flocking from?" she asked him.

Brown responded by saying that "[a] million people come from Europe, but a million people, British people, have gone into Europe." The prime minister, upon finishing the discussion, said it was "very nice to meet you" and returned to his car.

Unbeknownst to him, however, the Sky News microphone attached to his lapel was still turned on and picked up the conversation that followed inside the vehicle: "That was a disaster ... they should never have put me with that woman," Brown said. "Whose idea was that? It’s just ridiculous." When an aide asked what Duffy had said, Brown responded: "Everything, she was just a bigoted woman that said she used to be Labour [...] I don't know why Sue [an aide] brought her up towards me." 

Duffy, speaking to reporters immediately after having talked with the PM, described Brown as being "very nice", but later said she was "very upset" when informed what Brown had said off-camera. "Why has he come out with words like that? He's supposed to be leading the country and he's calling an ordinary woman who's come up and asked questions that most people would ask him," she said in an interview with the BBC.

"[...] It's going to be tax, tax, tax for another twenty years to get out of this national debt, and he's calling me a bigot," later adding: "I want to know why - them [sic] comments I made there - why I was called a bigot."

<h3>Media and opposition parties react</h3>

Some political analysts have said the gaffe may hurt Labour's chances in the upcoming elections; the party had managed to narrow the Conservatives' lead in recent opinion polls. 

The Conservatives responded to the incident &amp;mdash; dubbed by some media outlets as "Bigotgate" &amp;mdash; with Shadow chancellor George Osborne saying that "general elections [...] do reveal the truth about people."

Liberal Democrat leader &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Clegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile said: "You should always try to answer the questions as best you can. He has been recorded saying what he has said and will have to answer for that."

Andrew Russell, a politics lecturer for Manchester University, commented on the situation. "A politician in a stronger position could recover from this. What we know is that Gordon Brown is not in that position."

<h1>Nine of Alfred Hitchcock's films are restored; 30 years since his death</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Nine%20of%20Alfred%20Hitchcock%27s%20films%20are%20restored%3B%2030%20years%20since%20his%20death&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
At least nine of &lt;a href="w%3AAlfred%20Hitchcock"&gt;Alfred Hitchcock&lt;/a&gt;'s rare silent films, made at the beginning of his career, will be staged in 2012 in many public screenings, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Independent"&gt;♡❤The Independent♡❤&lt;/a&gt; has reported. 

These forgotten silent films made by a young Hitchcock are said to feature elements that characterize his later Hollywood works. These footages are going to be released in 2012 and expected to be aired as part of the Cultural Olympiad, although it still needs to be officially confirmed. 

Robin Baker, the British Film Institute's head curator, calls Hitchcock's silent movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Mountain%20Eagle"&gt;The Mountain Eagle&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ the "holy grail" of lost British films. "It was made in 1926 and was his last silent film featuring a sexually vulnerable young woman and a case of miscarriage of justice," he said to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Independent"&gt;♡❤The Independent♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

Three of Hitchcock's restored silent films are ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pleasure%20Garden%20%281925%20film%29"&gt;The Pleasure Garden&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1925), ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lodger%3A%20A%20Story%20of%20the%20London%20Fog"&gt;The Lodger&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1927) and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Farmer%27s%20Wife"&gt;The Farmer's Wife&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1928).

<h3>30 years since his death</h3>
Thursday marked the 30th anniversary since &lt;a href="w%3AAlfred%20Hitchcock"&gt;Alfred Hitchcock&lt;/a&gt;'s death. Hitchcock was an &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; filmmaker and producer, who produced several films in a career of sixty years.

Hitchcock was born in &lt;a href="w%3ALeytonstone"&gt;Leytonstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; on August 13, 1899. He described his childhood as being very lonely and sheltered, a situation aggravated by his obesity. His father died when he was 14. After he graduated, he became intrigued by photography and started working in film production in London on a branch of what would become Paramount Pictures. After a successful career with silent movies and the early talkie ones in the United Kingdom, in March 1939, David O. Selznick signed Hitchcock onto a seven-year contract beginning in March 1939 as the Hitchcock family was moving to &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. He was nominated for five Academy Awards as a best director but never took home the prize, and one of his most succesful movies during his Hollywood stay was the 1958 film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVertigo%20%28film%29"&gt;Vertigo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, featuring &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Stewart"&gt;James Stewart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Novak"&gt;Kim Novak&lt;/a&gt;. Hitchcock became a United States citizen in 1956 while retaining his British citizenship.

Hitchcock's last successful production was the 1972 film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFrenzy"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The 1976 film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20Plot"&gt;Family Plot&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was his last film. Hitchcock died from &lt;a href="w%3Akidney%20failure"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt; in his home at &lt;a href="w%3ABel%20Air"&gt;Bel Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, at 80. His body was cremated and his ashes were thrown in the Pacific Ocean.

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the Audio Wikinews Brief for Thursday, April 29th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20official%20warns%20of%20Hezbollah%20missile%20threat"&gt;US official warns of Hezbollah missile threat&lt;/a&gt; (0:16)</h3>

US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, along with Israeli defense minister Ehud Barak, issued a statement claiming that Hezbollah, the Shi'a Islamist political and paramilitary organization based in Lebanon, is in possession of more weapons than some governments.

Following a meeting with Barak, Gates said that both Syria and Iran were responsible for providing weapons of "ever increasing capability" to Hezbollah, although he declined to confirm that the group had gained possession of ballistic missiles called Scuds that are capable of striking targets across Israel. Gates said of Hezbollah's military capabilities, that they were "obviously destabilizing for the whole region.". Barak reiterated the sentiment of destabilization in the region, but does not foresee a military conflict over the current situation.

Syrian Prime Minister Muhammad Naji al-Otari denied arming Hezbollah and added that Israel is only trying to find an excuse for military action.

During the 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah launched thousands of missiles into Israel and according to an American report released last week, Hezbollah had indeed rearmed itself to higher levels than during the 2006 conflict.

<h3>&lt;a href="Thai%20police%2C%20protesters%20in%20violent%20clashes%3B%20at%20least%20one%20dead"&gt;Thai police, protesters in violent clashes; at least one dead&lt;/a&gt; (1:32)</h3>

There was more violence in Thailand today as protesters clashed with government police killing at least one soldier and wounding eighteen.

The conflict took place along a highway that a convoy of protesters was traveling along when Thai security forces, attempting to disperse the demonstrators, fired on protesters, apparently with both rubber bullets and live ammunition, which police had been authorized to use in self-defense. 

The demonstrators have largely paralyzed the city of Bangkok for the past seven weeks in protests that have killed at least 26 people. Largely rural and urban poor, the protesters say they will not leave until the Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, resigns and new elections are held. Many support former PM Thaksin Shinawatra and believe they were deprived of their votes when he was ousted in a coup in 2006. 

<h3>&lt;a href="New%20Jersey%20students%20protest%20proposed%20budget%20cuts"&gt;New Jersey students protest proposed budget cuts&lt;/a&gt; (2:25)</h3>

An estimated 18,000 New Jersey public school students walked out of classes Tuesday, in protest of Governor Chris Christie's proposed budget cuts. Spurred by a Facebook event calling on students to skip classes and picket their local school boards, the leader of the group, former student Michelle Ryan Lauto, said that she wanted to draw attention to the issue and show the govenor that students are not apathetic towards the quality of their education. 

The state's largest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, said that the students should not walk-out on classes. The governor's office also responded to the protests stating that they hoped this was just a case of youthful rebellion and not a one sided view of the current budget crisis in New Jersey. The demonstration came soon after voters in 59% of the state school districts opposed a proposal to increase property tax levies to pay for schools.

<h3>(3:24)</h3>

UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has caught himself up in a bit of a row, now being called "Bigotgate", when a live microphone caught him describing a voter he had talked to as being a "bigoted woman". The incident occurred after Brown, encouraged by his advisors to interact with ordinary people more often before next week's parliamentary elections, spoke with 65 year old Gillian Duffy. Duffy challenged him on topics such as health and education, before asking about immigration.

Unbeknownst to him, however, the Sky News microphone attached to his lapel was still turned on and picked up the conversation that followed inside his vehicle. Brown commented that the discussion was "a disaster" and he wondered aloud which of his advisors allowed Duffy to speak with him. When an aide asked what Duffy had said, Brown responded: "Everything, she was just a bigoted woman that said she used to be Labour".

Duffy, speaking to reporters immediately after having talked with the PM, described Brown as being "very nice", but later said she was "very upset" when informed of what Brown had said off-camera. The PM, upon being informed of what happened, returned to Duffy's home to personally apologize. 

Some political analysts have said the gaffe may hurt Labour's chances in the upcoming elections having recently managed to narrow the Conservatives' lead in recent opinion polls. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Sixteen-year-old%20boy%20charged%20with%20murder%20over%20use%20of%20Playstation%20in%20Chile"&gt;Sixteen-year-old boy charged with murder over use of Playstation in Chile&lt;/a&gt; (4:52)</h3>

A sixteen-year-old boy from Santiago, Chile has been charged with the murder of his brother after the pair got in a fight over whose turn it was to use their PlayStation 3. Police reported that the sixteen-year-old had stabbed his eighteen-year-old brother in the chest after he turned the PlayStation on without his younger brother’s permission. If convicted, the boy could face five years in prison.

The boys were home alone when the attack occurred; their guardian, a Belgian woman who adopted the pair after their birth mother abandoned them ten years ago, had been visiting her home country. 

<h2>On this day in history (5:28)</h2>

In 1945, Heinrich Wicker, a German Non Commissioned Officer, formally surrendered the Dachau concentration camp to the 42nd Rainbow Division of the United States Army. Approximately 32,000 prisoners were liberated and 300 SS camp guards were taken into custody; some of whom were shot and killed after surrendering by American troops who were horrified upon seeing the conditions of the camp.

Maffra defeated Drouin in the 2010 Gippsland Football League grand final. The Gippsland Football League, officially the Gippsland League, is the only major &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20rules%20football"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; competition in the Gippsland region according to the Victorian Country Football League.

Maffra finished on top of the ladder and won through to the grand final by winning the second semi final against Traralgon, their only match for the finals series.

Drouin finished fourth on the ladder and qualified by defeating Leongatha in the elimination final, Morwell in the first semi final and Traralgon in the preliminary final.

Scores are quoted as ♡❤goals-behinds (total)♡❤.

<h2>Background</h2>

The Gippsland League traces it roots to the Central Gippsland Football League of the 1930's. More recently, it is a merger of the Gippsland Latrobe Valley and West Gippsland leagues and was known as the West Gippsland Latrobe Football League.

"When you say the Gippsland League, people talk about the distance from Wonthaggi to Maffra (170km)," GL General Manager Chris Soumilas told the Weekly Times, discussing travelling times for teams. "They don’t say from Drouin to Moe (40km), or from Moe to Traralgon (32km). Most of our clubs do have the majority of our games within an hour’s drive, but from one end of the league to the other, travel is an issue."

At the league's annual general meeting in December, it changed it's name from the West Gippsland Latrobe Football League. At the same meeting, Wonthaggi joined the GL after dominating the Alberton Football League during the past decade. The Power made five consecutive Alberton Grand Finals winning three, losing only to Yarram (2007) and Stony Creek (2009).

Wonthaggi Power Football Club is a result of a merger between Wonthaggi Blues, a former Gippsland FL team, and Wonthaggi Rovers, an Alberton FL team. In February, the Gippsland Football League announced that Wonthaggi would be changing their uniforms, because their original one was similar to that of Warragul.

Towards the end of the season, Moe had to transfer a game from Yallourn North due to that ground not coping with the stress of hosting extra games. "[T]he Yallourn Nth ground is not coping with the extra Moe home games and the wetter than normal winter," said Soumilas in an email to First XV News. They played their last home game in Yalourn Noth.

<h3>The Ladder</h3>
Maffra clinched top spot after fifteen rounds of the 2010 GL season. After eighteen rounds of football, they finished on 56 points and 179.45. Traralgon finished second with 44 and 132.34.

Moe, finished third on 48 points and 100.5%. Drouin, finished fourth on 48 points and 100.4%. Leongatha finished fifth on 36 points and 106.81% after they defeated Moe in round 18.

Missing the finals in 2010, in order, Moe with 28 points and 88.1%, Sale with 20 points and 96.08%, Wonthaggi with 16 points and 63.3% and Warragul with 4 points and 38.04%.

<h3>Finals Series</h3>
The Gippsland League uses the McIntyre Final Five finals system. In this sytem, the top team receives a bye in week one of the finals while second place plays third place in the qualifying final and fourth place playing fifth place in the elimination final.

The teams progressed as demonstrated below.

<h2>Grand Final 2010</h2>

Three goals each to Gary Jones, Nicholas Horsford and Daniel Bedggood handed Maffra there second premiership in as many years. Having as many scoring shots as in , Maffra straightened the scoring shots - kicking ten more goals this year.

Drouin were not unimpressive as they stayed in the contest for the duration of the match. Jordan Wyatt kicked three goals for the match, while Bob McCallum and Andrew Soumilas put in around the ground.

At the end of the day, Maffra ran out winners 17-17 (119) to Drouin, in their first grand final, 15-11 (101).

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the Audio Wikinews Brief for Friday, April 30th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Controversial%20wind%20farm%20approved%20by%20US%20government"&gt;Controversial wind farm approved by US government&lt;/a&gt; (0:16)</h3>

The United States government has approved plans for a controversial wind power project off the coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts, which, if built, would be the nation's first offshore wind farm. 

The company responsible for the project, Cape Wind, received a permit from the federal government to commence construction of the wind farm for what Interior Secretary Ken Salazar says will be the first of many such projects up and down the Atlantic coast. 

However, construction of the wind farm in the near future is not certain, as there are additional regulatory procedures the company must complete, and opponents have threatened to take the project to court. According to the leader of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, a group opposed to the wind farm's construction, numerous permits related to the project were being appealed, and close to a dozen parties intend to sue the project, claiming it violates environmental regulations.

Supporters of the project say that it will provide up to 75% of the power for the region, and will benefit the environment by providing a clean and renewable source of power, as well as providing hundreds of new jobs in the area during construction of the wind farm. Opponents, which included deceased US Senator Ted Kennedy, claim it will destroy the natural beauty of the region, and will raise the costs of electricity in the area.

<h3>&lt;a href="Taliban%20commander%20reportedly%20alive%2C%20despite%20claims%20of%20January%20death"&gt;Taliban commander reportedly alive, despite claims of January death&lt;/a&gt; (1:40)</h3>

According to Pakistani intelligence, the leader of the Taliban in Pakistan, Hakimullah Mehsud, is still alive, contradicting claims by US and Pakistani officials that he was killed in a January drone attack. At the time of the attack, officials reported that Mehsud was killed along with ten other rebels, but Pakistani sources now say he was only wounded in the attack.

Despite his apparent survival, US defense officials downplayed the significance of the revelation. According to unidentified sources, his authority within the Taliban had significantly diminished after the attack, and is now overshadowed by other commanders such as Waliur Rehman, a senior Taliban commander based in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. A spokesman for the Pentagon in Washington, DC said that there was "no evidence" that Mehsud was "executing or exerting authority over the Pakistan Taliban as he once did"

<h3>&lt;a href="Algerian%20driver%20released%20by%20hostage%20takers%20in%20Niger"&gt;Algerian driver released by hostage takers in Niger&lt;/a&gt; (2:41)</h3>

An Algerian driver who was abducted on April 20th along with a French tourist he was driving, has been released by his hostage takers in Niger. Apparently, he was released in the Mali desert and made his way back to Algeria after the pair were taken at gunpoint near the Mali and Algerian boarders. According to a Nigerien military source, the man had been wandering around in the area until some people on camels found him and took him to Algeria.

The pair were abducted only days after four countries near the Sahara opened a military base to combat al-Qaeda, with whom the gunmen have ties to.

Hostage takings have become more frequent and foreign offices recommend that tourists avoid the area near the Sahara, known as the "red zone", as governments there are having more trouble controlling the problem.

The second hostage, a Frenchman in his 70’s, is still being held captive. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Pakistani%20peace%20mediator%20killed%20in%20tribal%20area"&gt;Pakistani peace mediator killed in tribal area&lt;/a&gt; (3:40)</h3>

Noted for his controversial attempts to foster peace deals with the Taliban, Pakistani Non-governmental organization leader Khalid Khawaja was killed early Friday morning, a week after being kidnapped in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas while helping a British filmmaker. He had been shot twice, in the head and chest, and his body dumped near Miranshah in North Waziristan, Pakistan, the location of a refugee camp for displaced Afghans from the Soviet invasion.

Khawaja was a former associate of Osama bin Laden, he fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and was an outspoken critic of the American-led invasion. The leader of the Defense of Human Rights NGO, Khawaja was often accused of being an apologist for Islamist militants due to his stringent demands for better treatment and legal rights for prisoners captured by both the American and Pakistani forces.

Khawaja was traveling into North Waziristan along with former colleague Colonel Imam, to help British cameraman Ased Qureshi meet with a Pashtun warlord and a senior Taliban commander as he sought to film a documentary about the rise of Islamic militancy in the region. The three were kidnapped, and their captors demanded the release of ten imprisoned militants as well as $10 million for the release of the two former Inter-Services Intelligence officers. Pakistani officials anonymously confirmed the money would likely be paid, but the insurgent leaders were unlikely to be released.

Khawaja had most recently landed on the legal defense team of five Americans arrested by Pakistan who were accused of membership in Jaish-e-Mohammed, an Islamic freedom-fighter organization based in Pakistan whose primary motive is to separate Kashmir from India. Immediate reports suggest that a note was pinned to his body, claiming responsibility for his death in the name of the Asian Tigers, a splinter group of the militant organization. The note blamed the government for refusing to negotiate on the desired release of jailed Pakistani militants.

<h3>&lt;a href="Belgium%20passes%20ban%20on%20full%20face%20veil"&gt;Belgium passes ban on full face veil&lt;/a&gt; (5:53)</h3>

Lawmakers in Belgium voted almost unanimously on Friday to ban the public wearing of full face veils. Under the new rule, any clothing that fully obscures the face will be prohibited in public areas such as parks and anyone who ignores it will be fined $20 to $35 and/or a jail sentence of up to a week. Exceptions could be made during certain festivals, or if the wearer has police permission to use the veil.

Daniel Bacquelaine, head of the liberal MR party in the parliament, said that the law was "not about introducing any form of discrimination", but rather veils were "aimed at stopping people from being identified".

Vice-president of the Muslim Executive of Belgium, Isabelle Praile, opposed the proposal, saying "the wearing of a full-face veil is part of the individual freedoms."

The proposal will now go to the Belgian Senate, where it is not expected to be blocked and some reports suggest the law could go into full effect by this June or July.

<h2>On this day in history (6:55)</h2>

In 1006, in the constellation Lupus (Latin for Wolf), light from an exploding star 7,200 LY away reached Earth. The event is the brightest supernova in history and was recorded by early astronomers in China, Egypt, Iraq, Japan, Switzerland, and possibly North America. Nova means "new" in Latin, and what makes them "super" is that in the period of just a few days or weeks, they can outshine an entire galaxy and radiate as much energy as our own sun does over its entire lifespan.

As reports came out yesterday that the oil spill caused by the explosion and sinking of an oil rig in Gulf of Mexico near &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; had reached the coast, the Obama administration announced a ban on all future offshore drilling at least until the investigation into the incident is completed.

Early Friday morning, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;US Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; received reports that oil from the spill had washed ashore, and while officials have not confirmed the reports, winds continue to push the slick northward towards land, and conditions are deteriorating, making cleanup of the spill increasingly difficult. The Coast Guard said it was planning to conduct a flyover of the slick to determine its extent sometime on Friday. According to the National Weather Service, strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted to continue through the weekend, hindering cleanup efforts.

Also early on Friday morning, a senior government official, White House advisor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Axelrod"&gt;David Axelrod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that the government was immediately banning all new offshore drilling until the investigation into the spill had been completed. His announcement came just after a month the administration relaxed restrictions of offshore drilling. 

The operation to clean up the spill has accelerated in recent days, with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Navy"&gt;US Navy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; having joined the effort, as well as resources from the Coast Guard and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Petroleum"&gt;British Petroleum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (BP), the lessor of the rig at the time of the explosion. The total assets deployed in the operation are estimated to be around 1,900 people and more than 300 ships and aircraft. Additionally, six remotely operated submarines are trying to stem the leaks, which now number three, at the ocean's floor.

On Wednesday, the estimated amount of oil spilling from the damaged well was raised to 5,000 barrels, or around 210,000 gallons, a day, five times the original estimate of 1,000 barrels a day. This figure was later revised upwards again to 25,000 barrels (1.05 million gallons) per day. So far, the cleanup operation has laid around 210,000 feet of containment booms to protect vulnerable wildlife refuges on the Gulf Coast, and an additional 66,000 feet of boom has been provided by the US Navy. Since the beginning of the operation, more than 18,000 gallons of an oil/water mix have been recovered from the ocean, and after a successful test burn of oil, plans are being made to scale the burns up. According to a BP official, "We believe we can now scale that up and burn between 500 and 1,000 barrels at a time." The first test burned around 100 barrels of oil.

Despite the efforts, many are still worried about the potential consequences of the spill, and officials said that the damage could end up being more than that caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill 20 years ago, which spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. One analyst said that he expected "that movement is going to continue to stress and fatigue the pipe and create more leaks," adding that "this is not on a good trajectory."

BP has developed two options to stop the flow of oil at the source, but both are expected to take at least weeks to complete. The first option is to lower large structures over the leak, which would allow the oil to be safely transported to the surface. BP is building one such structure, but it isn't expected to be completed for at least several weeks. The second option is to drill a second well which would then plug the leak at the source. A well for this purpose will begin to be drilled within two days, although it could be up to three months before the leak is completely plugged.

The &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; House of Representatives failed last Thursday to approve a &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;-sponsored amendment to the state constitution's redistricting procedures, killing any hope of reforming the controversial process this year. The vote was 69–47, just two votes short of the 71-vote supermajority needed to propose constitutional amendments for ratification by voters in the next election cycle. 

In the redistricting process, the boundaries of legislative districts are redrawn every ten years following the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; census. Districts are redrawn such that they contain constituencies roughly equal in population. During the last three redistricting periods, however, discussions have resulted in deadlock such that the maps were essentially chosen by lottery. Democrats, &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, and regular citizens alike have all unsuccessfully attempted to reform that process this year. All constitutional amendments must be proposed by Monday in order to be voted on in a referendum during the election next November. 

The Democratic bill, Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 121, was sponsored by State Senator Kwame Raoul and State Representative Barbara Flynn Currie, both from &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. The representatives voted mostly on party lines: Democrats hold 70 seats in the House, and 69 of them voted for the amendment. 46 Republicans and one Democrat voted against it. Currie presented the amendment as an improvement because it "gets rid of the tiebreaker." In fact, she argues that the public benefits from giving the job of redistricting to the legislature as a whole, rather than an appointed committee. "...leaving the decision in the hands of 177 people who are elected by the geographic diversity...is more democratic than giving it instead to the hands of four legislative leaders."

Currie was referring to the Fair Map Amendment, a citizen-led proposal to create a nine-member commission that would contain no legislators. The party leaders would select eight of the members, however, which Democrats have opposed as intoducing too much bias. Others are against the amendment on the grounds that it does not adequately ensure minority representation. 

The lone Democratic dissenter, Representative Jack Franks from &lt;a href="w%3AMarengo%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Marengo&lt;/a&gt;, disagrees. "I couldn’t get past that because I want to have a system where it’s not legislators choosing their electors, it should be the electors choosing the legislators," he said. Even Illinois Governor Pat Quinn was not enthusiastic about the bill and thought it was not "true reform".

Republicans have introduced the citizen-initiated Fair Map Amendment in the legislature as an alternative and have pushed for its passage. The bill was quickly struck down by a Democrat-led committee. At the same time, organizers of the petition drive for the Fair Map Amendment announced that they fell short of the nearly 300,000 signatures needed to bypass the legislature and directly place the question on the ballot.

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the Audio Wikinews Brief for Saturday, May 1st, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Bomb%20blasts%20in%20Somalia%20kill%20at%20least%2030"&gt;Bomb blasts in Somalia kill at least 30&lt;/a&gt; (0:16)</h3>

Two bomb blasts at a mosque in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, occurred shortly before the beginning of noon prayers and, according to reports, have killed at least 30 people and injured upwards of 70 more.

The mosque is believed to have ties to the Islamic insurgent group al-Shabaab and the location is often used as a venue for speeches by the insurgents. 

Fuad Mohamed Qalaf, a high-ranking member of al-Shabaab, was reportedly inside the mosque when the explosions occurred and is believed to be the target of the attack. Al-Shabaab has been fighting against UN forces, which are in control of only parts of the capital, and has been reported to have ties with al-Qaeda.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks.

<h3>&lt;a href="Redistricting%20reform%20efforts%20in%20Illinois%20fail%20for%20this%20year"&gt;Redistricting reform efforts in Illinois fail for this year&lt;/a&gt; (1:05)</h3>

The Illinois House of Representatives failed last Thursday to approve a Democratic Party-sponsored amendment to the state constitution's redistricting procedures, killing any hope of reforming the controversial process this year. The vote was 69–47, just two votes short of the 71-vote supermajority needed to propose constitutional amendments for ratification by voters in the next election cycle. 

The Democratic bill, Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 121, was sponsored by State Senator Kwame Raoul and State Representative Barbara Flynn Currie, both from Chicago. The representatives voted mostly on party lines: Democrats hold 70 seats in the House, and 69 of them voted for the amendment. 46 Republicans and one Democrat voted against it.

An alternative plan lead by a Republican initiative known as the Fair Map Amendment, a citizen-led proposal to create a nine-member commission which would decide district lines but would contain no legislators, had been quickly struck down by a Democrat-led committee. Organizers for a petition to put the amendment on this November's election ballot announced that they fell short of the nearly 300,000 signatures needed to bypass the legislature and directly place the question to the voters. 

In the redistricting process, the boundaries of legislative districts are redrawn every ten years following the US census. Districts are redrawn such that they contain constituencies roughly equal in population. During the last three redistricting periods, however, discussions have resulted in deadlock such that the maps were essentially chosen by lottery. Democrats, Republicans, and regular citizens alike have all unsuccessfully attempted to reform that process this year.

<h3>(3:01)</h3>

The UN’s special representative on sexual violence in conflict, Margot Wallstrom, has called the Democratic Republic of the Congo the “rape capital of the world”. 

Data collected by the UN shows that 200,000 cases of sexual assault have been reported in the last 14 years, 8,000 of which occurred last year and 1,244 of which occurred in the first three months of 2010. The UN’s mission has been trying to combat the problem by escorting women when they go to market and working closely with the local officials.

The Harvard Humanitarian Society issued a report in April showing that in South Kivu, an eastern province in DR Congo, 60% of the women raped were raped by armed men. More than half were raped in their own home, and more civilians are committing the attacks than ever before.

Despite the country’s war ending in 2003, DR Congo is still plagued with militia violence.

<h3>&lt;a href="Nine%20of%20Alfred%20Hitchcock%27s%20films%20are%20restored%3B%2030%20years%20since%20his%20death"&gt;Nine of Alfred Hitchcock's films are restored; 30 years since his death&lt;/a&gt; (4:06)</h3>

At least nine silent films made by a young Alfred Hitchcock have been restored and will be made available for public screenings beginning in 2012 and are expected to be aired as part of the Cultural Olympiad pending confirmation.

Robin Baker, the British Film Institute's head curator, calls Hitchcock's 1926 silent movie The Mountain Eagle the "holy grail" of lost British films. Three other restored Hitchcock films are 1925's The Pleasure Garden, about two chorus girls at The Pleasure Garden Theatre in London, 1927's The Lodger, concerning the hunt for a "Jack the Ripper" type serial killer and 1928's The Farmer's Wife which centers on a middle-aged farmer who decides to remarry.

This past Thursday marked the 30th anniversary since Hitchcock's death. Born in England on August 13, 1899, he directed some of the most famous films in cinema including Psycho, Rear Window, North By Northwest and Vertigo, however, though he was nominated for five Academy Awards as best director, he never took home the prize. 

Hitchcock died in 1980 from kidney failure in his home at Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, at the age of 80. His body was cremated and his ashes were thrown in the Pacific Ocean.

<h3>On This Day In History (5:32)</h3>

In 1960, a U2 spy plane, flying over the former Soviet Union and piloted by Francis Gary Powers, was shot down and the pilot captured. 

The Soviet military had actually been anticipating the flight but shooting down the plane was difficult due to the extreme high altitude it operated in. After failing to intercept the plane with MIG fighters and an initial missile barrage, a surface-to-air missile battery commanded by Mikhail Voronov engaged and shot down the U2, along with one of their own MiG-19 fighters which had been pursuing Powers, over the Ural Region. 

Initially the United States government reported that an airplane had gone missing north of Turkey, claiming the pilot had fallen unconscious due to lack of oxygen and even grounded the U2 fleet to maintain the facade. Nikita Khrushchev, then the Soviet Premier announced that his country had shot down an American spy plane, intentionally leaving out the detail that Powers had been captured alive and so the Eisenhower Administration, thinking the pilot had been killed, claimed it had been a "weather research aircraft", and not a spy plane. Khrushchev took advantage of this lie, and finally announced that Powers was indeed alive, and the plane was mostly intact thus greatly embarrassing the Eisenhower Administration. 

The Four Power Paris Summit between president Eisenhower, Premier Khrushchev and other world leaders, which had been scheduled to commence just over two weeks after the flight, fell apart largely because Eisenhower refused to accede to Khrushchev's demands that he apologize for the incident.

A large portion of the wreck, as well as Powers' survival pack are still on display at the Central Museum of Armed Forces in Moscow.

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the Audio Wikinews Brief for Sunday, May 2nd, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Bomb%20scare%20closes%20Times%20Square%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Bomb scare closes Times Square, New York&lt;/a&gt; (0:17)</h3>

A suspicious vehicle containing a bomb was discovered in New York City's Times Square yesterday, causing the evacuation of streets surrounding the area. Reports say the vehicle, a Nissan Pathfinder, had smoke coming from the back of it around 6.30 p.m. local time, and unconfirmed reports say an unknown man ran away from the car.

The area was evacuated and a bomb squad, using a remotely operated robot, removed a package from the vehicle. Officials removed gunpowder, consumer-grade fireworks, two five-gallon cans of gasoline, three propane tanks, electrical wiring, and two clocks with batteries that apparently were fashioned as one or two detonators. The bomb has been described as "amateurish" but could have caused serious damage to Times Square if it had detonated. No casualties or injuries were reported.

Police have not named a suspect and are reviewing security footage in the area. The car used by the suspect was stolen with a non-matching license plate but its legitimate owner owner does not appear to be involved in the accident.

<h3>&lt;a href="Oil%20spill%20in%20Gulf%20of%20Mexico%20reported%20to%20have%20reached%20coast%3B%20offshore%20drilling%20ban%20announced%20by%20Obama%20administration"&gt;Oil spill in Gulf of Mexico reported to have reached coast; offshore drilling ban announced by Obama administration&lt;/a&gt; (1:24)</h3>

The Obama Administration in the United States has announced that the government was immediately banning all new offshore drilling until the investigation into an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has been completed. The announcement came just a month after the administration relaxed restrictions on offshore drilling.

Oil from the spill, which occurred on April 20th when the oil platform Deepwater Horizon exploded, killing 11 workers, has begun washing ashore, and while officials have not confirmed the reports, winds continue to push the slick northward towards land, and conditions are deteriorating, making cleanup of the spill increasingly difficult. 

On Wednesday, the estimated amount of oil spilling from the damaged well was raised to 5,000 barrels, or around 210,000 gallons, a day, five times the original estimate of a thousand gallons a day. This figure was later revised upwards again to 25,000 barrels or 1.05 million gallons per day. 

Since the beginning of the operation, more than 18,000 gallons of an oil/water mix have been recovered from the ocean, and after a successful test burn of oil, plans are being made to scale the burns up.

The operation to clean up the spill has accelerated in recent days, with the US Navy having joined the effort, as well as resources from the Coast Guard and British Petroleum, the lessor of the rig at the time of the explosion.

So far, the cleanup operation has laid around 210,000 feet of containment booms to protect vulnerable wildlife areas along the Gulf Coast. Yet, despite the efforts, many are still worried about the potential consequences of the spill, and officials said that the damage could end up being more than that caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill 20 years ago, which spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound.

<h3>&lt;a href="Stones%20thrown%20by%20protesters%20in%20Kashmir%20kill%20civilian"&gt;Stones thrown by protesters in Kashmir kill civilian&lt;/a&gt; (3:24)</h3>

A middle-aged civilian has been killed in Indian-administered Kashmir after anti-India separatists threw stones at a bus in Srinagar. The victim, Shafiq Ahmad Sheikh, died in hospital after the stone struck his head.

The stone-pelting incident occurred in the Batmaloo area before the separatists marched to the local United Nations office to protest against Indian administration in Kashmir and "growing human rights abuses".

Farooq Ahmad, Inspector General of Police of the state, said Sheikh was an employee of the State Board of School Education and was traveling by bus to his office when the attack occurred. The attackers have since been charged with murder.

<h2>On this day in history (4:11)</h2>

In 1952, The world's first ever jet airliner, the De Havilland Comet 1 made its maiden flight from London to Johannesburg. 

While initially a hit with passengers, including Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother of England, who were early passengers, problems with the plane soon surfaced. Exactly one year after the plane began operations, on May 2 1953, a flight leaving from Calcutta, India, crashed in a severe tropical storm six minutes after take off, killing all 43 on board. The crash was attributed to a structural failure of the airframe due to metal fatigue. 

In the wake of these and other disasters, all remaining Comets were withdrawn from service. When a new design, the Comet 4, was introduced to service in 1958, the new Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8 were already being flown and orders for the Comet dried up, with the last one delivered in 1964.

Stormy weather in &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; left at least 23 people dead over the weekend and thousands more homeless. The storms, which are common between April and June, swept over the &lt;a href="w%3AMymensingh"&gt;Mymensingh&lt;/a&gt; area and destroyed crops and trees.

Most of the deaths were said to have occurred when farmers harvesting rice paddy fields were struck by lightning. Six were in the Habiganj District. Additionally, the lightning killed two teenage brothers in Haluaghat tending to cattle in a field near their home. 

Dozens of other people received injuries and were transported to hospitals. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department had issued warnings for continued severe weather.

The &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; oil company &lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; has said it will pay the cleanup costs from a severe oil spill in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.

In a statement on its website posted earlier today, BP pledged to take responsibility for cleaning up after the &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon"&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/a&gt; oil well ruptured, adding it would pay what it called "legitimate and objectively verifiable" compensation for claims of damage or injury.

"We are responsible, not for the accident, but we are responsible for the oil and for dealing with it and cleaning the situation up," said BP chief executive Tony Hayward on the TV show &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Morning%20America"&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , claiming the company was not at fault for the collapse of the oil rig itself, whose equipment was provided by another company, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATransocean"&gt;Transocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Transocean spokesman Guy Cantwell responded by saying: "We will await all the facts before drawing conclusions and we will not speculate."

The Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 and killed eleven workers. The cause of the disaster is not known.

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the Audio Wikinews Brief for Monday, May 3rd, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="New%20ash%20flight%20bans%20ordered%20in%20Ireland"&gt;New ash flight bans ordered in Ireland&lt;/a&gt; (0:17)</h3>

Aviation authorities in Ireland have said that a temporary ban on flights coming in and out of the country will be implemented tomorrow, due to potential risks from volcanic ash from an Icelandic volcano. The restrictions would apply from 07.00 to 13.00 local time.

The Irish Aviation Authority is concerned that Irish airports may be impacted by the drift south of the volcanic ash cloud caused by north easterly winds based on the safety risks to crews and passengers. IAA noted that flights over the UK and mainland Europe wouldn't be affected by the restrictions.

Last month, many flights to and from Europe were canceled for almost a week, over fears that volcanic ash could cause jet engines to fail. The decision to close the airspace had stranded thousands and cost the already struggling European airline industry billions of dollars.

<h3>&lt;a href="Bangladesh%20storms%20kill%20at%20least%2023"&gt;Bangladesh storms kill at least 23&lt;/a&gt; (1:15)</h3>

Stormy weather in Bangladesh left at least 23 people dead over the weekend and thousands more homeless. Most of the deaths were said to have occurred when farmers harvesting rice paddy fields were struck by lightning. The storms, which are common between April and June, swept over the Mymensingh area and the Bangladesh Meteorological Department has issued warnings for continued severe weather.

<h3>&lt;a href="Oil%20company%20BP%20to%20pay%20for%20Gulf%20of%20Mexico%20spill"&gt;Oil company BP to pay for Gulf of Mexico spill&lt;/a&gt; (1:42)</h3>

The British oil company BP has said it will pay the costs of cleaning up after the Deepwater Horizon oil well ruptured on April 20th killing eleven workers and creating a large oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In a statement on its website posted earlier today, BP pledged it would pay what it called "legitimate and objectively verifiable" compensation for claims of damage or injury.

BP chief executive Tony Hayward appearing on the American TV show Good Morning America, claimed the company was not at fault for the collapse of the oil rig itself, whose equipment was provided by another company, Transocean.

Transocean spokesman Guy Cantwell responded to BP's statement saying they will await all the facts before drawing any conclusions.

<h3>&lt;a href="Eurozone%20approves%20Greece%20bailout"&gt;Eurozone approves Greece bailout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Protests%20in%20Greece%20over%20proposed%20budget%20cuts"&gt;Protests in Greece over proposed budget cuts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Wikinews%20interviews%20spokesman%20for%20Greek%20far-left%20party%20Xekinima"&gt;Wikinews interviews spokesman for Greek far-left party Xekinima&lt;/a&gt; (2:32)</h3>

The European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have agreed to provide the ailing Greek economy with 110 billion euros (US$146 billion) worth of loans over three years. Finance ministers from the sixteen countries that use the euro – known as the eurozone – approved the plan on Sunday.

According to the plan, the EU is to provide 80 billion euros of the loans, and the IMF the other 30 billion; it is aimed at preventing Greece from defaulting on debt.

Before being fully implemented, however, the proposal must be individually approved by all fifteen other countries in the eurozone.

The Greek government yesterday predicted that the country's gross domestic product would drop by four percent this year; it also forecast the national debt, currently at 115% of GDP, will increase to 149% in 2013, before going down.

In response to efforts by the Greek government to cut spending in order to reduce the severe debt crisis, demonstrations were called by three separate political groups in Athens to protest against government plans to cut major portions of the national budget in order to receive 110 billion euros in aid from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

During the protests, small groups of youth broke windows of several buildings, set a government press van on fire, burned trash barrels in barricades and threw rocks and firebombs at police officers. Riot police arrested at least fourteen people and sprayed tear gas to disperse crowds. Seven policemen and two demonstrators were reported to be injured.

The reductions in spending are expected to cut both pensions and salaries to public service workers, while raising consumer taxes. Greek unions have opposed the measures and were a major part of the protests. A nation-wide strike in protest of the budget cuts is planned on May 5th.

For more insight into this story, visit wikinews.org and read Iain Macdonald's exclusive interview with Petros Tzomakas, a Greek far-left politician and spokesperson for Xekinima, which is the Greek division of the Committee for a Workers' International. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Nepal%20Maoists%20begin%20strike%20to%20overthrow%20government"&gt;Nepal Maoists begin strike to overthrow government&lt;/a&gt; (4:49)</h3>

The Maoist opposition political group in Nepal has begun a nationwide strike after Nepal's Prime Minister, Madhav Kumar Nepal refused demands of the Maoists to resign on Sunday. The Maoists say that the ruling government is not supported by Nepal's citizens, as it has been unable to draft a constitution for the country or made any effort to continue the peace process in the country. The Maoists, which have a majority in Nepal's parliament, are advocating to lead a national government.

After the Prime Minister's refusal to step down, a strike was immediately called and thousands of protesters descended on Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. Most businesses across the country have been closed for the strike and emergency vehicles are the only traffic allowed to move in the streets. Protesters say they are peaceful, although police claim to have confiscated weapons and explosives. Although so far no violence has broken out, and the mood in the streets is described as festive, the government has deployed additional police in the capital, and security forces are on high alert.

<h3>&lt;a href="5.9%20magnitude%20earthquake%20in%20Pichilemu%2C%20Chile%20revives%20fears%20of%20new%20tragedy"&gt;5.9 magnitude earthquake in Pichilemu, Chile revives fears of new tragedy&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href="Wikinews%20interviews%20Juana%20Bustamante%2C%20Chilean%20earthquake%20survivor%20from%20Paniahue"&gt;Wikinews interviews Juana Bustamante, Chilean earthquake survivor from Paniahue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Wikinews%20interviews%20Diego%20Grez%2C%20Chilean%20earthquake%20survivor"&gt;Wikinews interviews Diego Grez, Chilean earthquake survivor&lt;/a&gt; (5:56)</h3>

Another strong aftershock hit Chile early Sunday morning. The aftershock reached a magnitude of 5.9 with the epicenter located 19 kilometers west of Pichilemu, according to the University of Chile Geological Survey.

The aftershock comes after a 6.2-magnitude aftershock struck a large part of central and southern Chile on April 23rd, reviving fears of new tragedy in the country which suffered an 8.8 magnitude earthquake on February 27th, killing nearly 500 people. 

For a look at the impact of the earthquake in Chile and to see how people living in the area have reacted to the devastation, visit wikinews.org for our own reporter Diego Grez's photo essay of the aftermath. Diego has been on-scene reporting on events as they happen and also has an interview with Juana Bustamante, a Chilean earthquake survivor from Santa Cruz, who lost her home.

<h3>(6:57)</h3>

Traralgon and Maffra sit atop the 2010 Gippsland Football League ladder after convincing wins over Sale and Morwell respectively. 

Traralgon kept Sale to five goals and fourteen behinds for the first three quarters while scoring eleven goals and eleven behinds, a lead of thirty three points. In the end they ran out 40 point winners, 17-15 (117) to 10-17 (77).

<h3>&lt;a href="Wikinews%20interviews%20Brittany%20Phelps%2C%20administrator%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Pirate%20Party"&gt;Wikinews interviews Brittany Phelps, administrator of the United States Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt; (7:37)</h3>

In the interview, Brittany speaks with Peter about her job, the goals of the Pirate Party and her greatest concerns in regards to making changes in the government.

<h2>On this day in history (7:58)</h2>

In 1915, the poem In Flanders Fields was written by Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae, a Canadian physician, after he witnessed the death, and presided over the funeral, of his friend, 22 year old Lt. Alexis Helmer. It became one of the most notable poems written during World War I and was first published on December 8th of that year in the London-based magazine Punch.

The poppies referred to in the poem grew in profusion in Flanders in the spoiled earth of the battlefields and cemeteries where war casualties were buried and thus they became a symbol of Remembrance Day, Armistice Day and Veterans Day.

&lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; vetoed a bill that would ban smoking in California state parks and beaches, insisting that the bill would not help curb littering at parks and beaches.

California senator &lt;a href="w%3AJenny%20Oropeza"&gt;Jenny Oropeza&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; and author of the bill, stated this is "already being done at more than 100 local cities and counties statewide." 

Oropeza wrote in a statement, "I'm sorry the governor did not agree with this widely supported effort to increase public awareness about the environmental threats carelessly tossed cigarettes are doing to our marine life and to the great outdoors"

The bill, called Senate Bill 4, would have allowed for a &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;100 for potential violators.

Severe flooding in the southern &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; left 28 people dead and caused extensive damage over the weekend. Two days of torrential rainfall, amounting to 13 inches (330 mm) in Nashville, Tennessee, swelled rivers and triggered rapidly rising waters.

The states of &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Mississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; were hit the hardest. The deluge caught many off-guard, forcing stranded residents to be rescued by boat. Parts of downtown Nashville were evacuated, and bus service there was suspended. Thousands of homeowners also lost electricity. 

The Cumberland River rose to extremely high levels, nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) above flood stage, and is not expected to return to normal levels until Wednesday morning.

Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear issued a state of emergency in response to the floods. He said, "The safety of our citizens is my first priority. That is why I urge individuals who encounter high waters to use extreme caution and avoid unnecessary contact with flood waters if at all possible. Our thoughts are especially with those who lost loved ones in the tragic deaths that have been attributed to the weekend's storms." Forty-five counties in the state posted emergency declarations.

In Tennessee, where the storms' death toll continues to rise, Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Bredesen"&gt;Phil Bredesen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; requested federal assistance from President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;. After surveying the damage, Bredesen remarked, "We’re going to need a lot of help over these weeks ahead to get out of this."

Total damages from what may be a 500- or 1,000-year flood event could be worth billions of dollars. Many prominent buildings were submerged in the Nashville area, where about 50 schools sustained damage. 

Meteorologists explain that the flooding came as a result of a slow-moving weather system that tapped into moisture from the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and pulled it northward into an unstable air mass. The storms' effects were even felt in Atlanta, &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28US%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, although to a lesser degree.

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the Audio Wikinews Brief for Tuesday, May 4th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Severe%20flooding%20leaves%2028%20dead%20in%20southern%20United%20States"&gt;Severe flooding leaves 28 dead in southern United States&lt;/a&gt; (0:16)</h3>

Severe flooding in the southern United States left 28 people dead and caused extensive damage over the weekend after two days of torrential rainfall. 13 inches of rain fell in Nashville, Tennessee which swelled rivers and triggered rapidly rising waters. The Cumberland River rose to extremely high levels, nearly 12 feet above flood stage, and is not expected to return to normal levels until Wednesday morning.

The deluge caught many off-guard and meteorologists explain that the flooding came as a result of a slow-moving weather system that tapped into moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and pulled it northward into an unstable air mass. Total damages from what may be a 500 or 1,000 year flood event could be worth billions of dollars. Many prominent buildings were submerged in the Nashville area, where about 50 schools sustained damage.

The states of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Mississippi were hit the hardest. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear issued a state of emergency in response to the floods and forty-five counties in the state posted emergency declarations. In Tennessee, where the storms' death toll continues to rise, Governor Phil Bredesen has requested federal assistance from President Barack Obama.

<h3>&lt;a href="6.4%20magnitude%20earthquake%20hits%20Chile"&gt;6.4 magnitude earthquake hits Chile&lt;/a&gt; (1:37)</h3>

Another earthquake hit Chile on late Monday according to the United States Geological Survey. The epicenter was located 132 kilometers southwest of Concepción and 558 kilometers southwest of Santiago. Chile's National Office of Emergency of the Interior Ministry has reported no casualties but that some telephone lines have collapsed. Even after more than two months after a major 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the South American nation, many people continue to live in tents or temporary huts.

Wikinews' Diego Grez reported that the earthquake was clearly felt in Pichilemu, almost 300 kilometers to the north of the epicenter. For more information, visit wikinews.org for the latest developments and for Diego Grez's original reporting on the events in Chile.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20criticizes%20Iran%20for%20remarks%20at%20nuclear%20conference"&gt;US criticizes Iran for remarks at nuclear conference&lt;/a&gt; (2:31)</h3>

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has criticized Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after he made a string of remarks against Western nations and Israel at a UN conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in New York. He accused other countries of preventing Iran from developing what he called a civilian nuclear program. He also said that nuclear arms are "a fire against humanity, rather than a weapon of defense. The possession of nuclear bombs is not a source of pride. Its possession is disgusting and shameful."

Hilary Clinton, who spoke at the UN conference later that same day, responded that "Iran will do whatever it can to divert attention away from its own record in an attempt to evade accountability." 

Iran has thus far been increasingly under pressure over its nuclear program, and US officials characterized his latest speech, which caused several delegates to walk out, as a sign of increased Iranian isolation from the rest of the world.

<h3>&lt;a href="Continental%20and%20United%20Airlines%20to%20merge"&gt;Continental and United Airlines to merge&lt;/a&gt; (3:36)</h3>

The American carriers Continental Airlines and United Airlines officially announced Monday their plans to merge after both companies' boards of directors approved the plan on Sunday afternoon. The joint company will remain branded as United Airlines, keeping the United name but will use the Continental Globe and colors and will be formally known as United Continental Holdings Inc. This merger will allow Continental and United to surpass the recent Delta and Northwest merger, becoming the largest airline in the world when the merger is finalized. Stock price of both companies rose when news of their merger was announced.

Unlike most mergers, this one is relatively even in terms of what each company receives as a result. United Airline is taking 55% control of the combined company, as well as becoming the main base for the group in Chicago. Continental’s Chief Executive Officer will become the CEO of the combined company, and will gain control of the other 45% of the new airline.

For now, the companies will remain operating independently pending a United States Department of Justice anti-trust review which will set the stage for finalization of the merger later this year.

<h3>&lt;a href="Iraq%20starts%20manual%20vote%20recount"&gt;Iraq starts manual vote recount&lt;/a&gt; (4:52)</h3>

The Iraqi election commission has started to manually recount about 2.5 million ballots cast in the capital of Baghdad during parliamentary elections from two months ago. According to officials, the counting could take from two to three weeks.

The recount was requested by incumbent Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki, who is accusing the opposition of fraud, when provisional results gave the bloc led by rival Iyad Allawi a two-seat lead. al-Maliki's election coalition, however, now says the recount should be stopped, saying the election commission isn't using the correct procedures and will have an incorrect result.

The Iraqi parliamentary poll, held on March 7, resulted in the Iraqiya bloc receiving 91 seats, while the incumbent PM's State of Law coalition taking 89 seats; in order to form a government, a block must obtain 163 parliament seats.

<h3>&lt;a href="California%20governor%20Schwarzenegger%20vetoes%20smoking%20ban%20in%20parks"&gt;California governor Schwarzenegger vetoes smoking ban in parks&lt;/a&gt; (5:49)</h3>

California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill that would ban smoking in California state parks and beaches, insisting that the bill would not help curb littering at parks and beaches.

California senator Jenny Oropeza, a Democrat and author of the bill, stated this is "already being done at more than 100 local cities and counties statewide." and the she is "sorry the governor did not agree with this widely supported effort to increase public awareness about the environmental threats carelessly tossed cigarettes are doing to our marine life and to the great outdoors"

The bill, called Senate Bill 4, would have allowed for a US$100 fine for potential violators.

<h2>On this day in history (6:34)</h2>

In 1970, The Kent State shootings occurred at Kent State University. 

The incident began as a student protest to the United States involvement in the Vietnam war, specifically, the Nixon Administration decision to escalate the war into neighboring Cambodia. 

Protests at Kent State actually started on May 1st when about 500 students gathered for a rally early in the day, but by late that night in the town of Kent, where the University is located, people began rioting, throwing beer bottles and breaking store fronts. When the authorities were called in, the crowd threw beer bottles and shouted obscenities at the police officers.

The next day, on May 2nd, the mayor of Kent, Leroy Satrom, declared a State of Emergency and asked Ohio Governor James A. Rhodes to send the National Guard to Kent to help maintain order.

That night, when the National Guard had arrived, a large demonstration was already underway and arsonists had set fire to the school's Reserve Officer Training Corps building. As firemen attempted to put out the blaze, students slashed the fire hoses and the National Guard used tear gas to disperse the crowd and they made several arrests.

On May 3rd, Governor Rhodes called the protesters un-American and referred to the protesters as revolutionaries set on destroying higher education in Ohio. During the speech, Rhodes said he would obtain a court order ordering an official state of emergency, thus banning further demonstrations which gave the impression that he was putting Kent under martial law. 

Finally, on May 4th, a scheduled student demonstration took place at noon on campus grounds. The National Guard attempted to disperse the crowd initially using tear gas on the protesters, but because of winds, it had little effect. Next the Guardsmen, with bayonets fixed on their rifles, advanced on the crowd and this managed to disperse many demonstrators, but not all of them.

Then at 12:24 p.m., 29 of the 77 guardsmen fired their M1 Garand rifles at the students using a total of 67 bullets. The shooting was determined to have lasted 13 seconds killing four students and wounding nine. 

The shootings led to protests on college campuses throughout the United States, and a student strike – causing more than 450 campuses across the country to close with both violent and non-violent demonstrations. Just five days after the shootings, 100,000 people demonstrated in Washington, D.C., against the war and the killing of the unarmed student protesters.

On May 14, ten days after the Kent State shootings, two students were killed (and 12 wounded) by police at the historically black Jackson State University under similar circumstances, but that event did not arouse the same nationwide attention as the Kent State shootings.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Scottish%20airspace%20to%20be%20closed%20over%20volcanic%20ash%20concerns&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;'s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says it will close some airspace in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, after meteorologists cautioned that ash from &lt;a href="w%3AEyjafjallajokull"&gt;Eyjafjallajokull&lt;/a&gt;, an erupting volcano in &lt;a href="Iceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, may make it unsafe for airplanes to fly.

The CAA announced that the airspace will be shut down from 07.00 (06.00 UTC) local time on Wednesday; travellers are advised to check with their airlines to see if their flights will be operating. A spokesman for the agency also added that "[t]he forecasts also show that it is likely that the ash cloud will continue to move south, potentially affecting airports in the north-west of England and North Wales."

"Met Office forecasts show that levels of ash in the atmosphere over Scotland and Northern Ireland will exceed the concentrations that engine manufactures have agreed are safe for operations," said a spokesman for the authority. "Unfortunately, this means that the CAA anticipates all Scottish and Northern Ireland airports will be closed from 7.00 am local time." 

The Irish Aviation Authority, meanwhile, warned that aviation in the vicinity could face a "summer of uncertainty" as the volcano continues to sporadically erupt. "We could be faced with this periodically [in] the summer," said Eamon Brennan, the chief executive of the group.

The restrictions come a day after a temporary ban on flights in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; was implemented yesterday, from 07.00 to 13.00 local time (06.00 to 12.00 UTC); flights from there have now resumed. Flights going to and from locations in mainland &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; have not been affected thanks to new flight rules that allow planes fly through low-density ash clouds.

Layla Trawick, 34, was arrested by police for allegedly stabbing four people with two knives at a &lt;a href="w%3ATarget%20Corporation"&gt;Target store&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Hollywood"&gt;West Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

Paramedics arrived at the scene at 12:48 pm local time on Monday. They took one critically injured person to a local hospital and another with minor injuries. The other two did not require hospitalization and were treated on-the-spot.

An armed, off-duty police officer, Clay Grant, Jr., was able to use his service weapon to stop the accused. Captain Michael Parker praised Grant for his efforts to stop the suspect.

A shopper at the store and journalist, Allison McNamara, reported she witnessed Trawick stab the victims. McNamara said, "You could see where the knife was going into his back. The knife had ridges and a tag on it. She was going as fast and strong as she could... She looked like she was going to stab everyone there."

Trawick is being held on &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1 million bail.

The oil company &lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; has said that one of three leaks from a ruptured oil well in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; has been sealed off, in an attempt to stop the oil from the destroyed &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon"&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/a&gt; rig from contaminating the sea further.

Although 800,000 litres of oil a day are still pouring into the sea, officials say it will be easier to combat the spill with only two leaks.

"As we speak today we now only have two leak sources but I would stress the amount of oil being leaked is still the same," commented BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles.

Meanwhile, remote-controlled submarines will be used tomorrow to try to place a large iron dome over the other two leaks, according to BP spokesman John Curry.

The Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20, killing eleven workers; the cause of the disaster is not known.

This table shows the results for 649 of 650 constituencies in the &lt;a href="w%3A2010%20UK%20general%20election"&gt;2010 general election&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (not including the delayed constituency of &lt;a href="w%3AThirsk%20and%20Malton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Thirsk and Malton&lt;/a&gt;, which will hold its election on 27 May).

The "Constituency" column shows the name of each constituency, linked to the relevant ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ article. the "Result" column shows the winning party, and whether they held or gained the seat (and, if relevant, who they gained it from). The "Votes" column shows how many votes were received by the winning party, the "Share" column their share of the vote, and the "Swing" column the &lt;a href="w%3ASwing%20%28politics"&gt;swing&lt;/a&gt; in the direction of the gaining party.

In the general election, people over the age of eighteen around the United Kingdom may choose to vote for a candidate at their local polling booth, and Members of Parliament are elected to each constituency based on the &lt;a href="w%3Afirst%20past%20the%20post"&gt;first past the post&lt;/a&gt; system. Whichever party has a majority of MPs after all constituencies have announced their results has the opportunity to form a government.

The incumbent party before the dissolution of parliament was &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, exit polls suggested a small &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; majority, which—when this swing is projected nationally—would cause a &lt;a href="w%3Ahung%20parliament"&gt;hung parliament&lt;/a&gt;. The exit polls also suggested that despite reports that support for the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; had surged following the first national televised leaders' debates in the United Kingdom, the Liberal Democrats would suffer from a third party squeeze.

On the morning of Friday 7, 2010 the accuracy of the exit polls was demonstrated when it was revealed that there was indeed a hung Parliament and that although the Conservative Party had the greatest number of seats and votes it would be impossible for them to achieve an outright majority. The constitution of the United Kingdom allows for the incumbent Labour Party to first attempt to form a government and incumbent Prime Minister, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; announced that he would allow civil servants from the Cabinet Office to help facilitate negotiations. Despite the Labour Party openly courting the Liberal Party, their leader &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANick%20Clegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt; has stated that as the party with the most seats and most votes the Conservatives have the right to attempt to form a government.

Some seats were also be contested by one or more of a number of smaller parties and independents, including the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20Independence%20Party"&gt;United Kingdom Independence Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20National%20Party"&gt;British National Party&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20England%20%20and%20Wales"&gt;Green Party of England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;, who all already hold seats in the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and local government authorities, all hoped to gain their first seats in the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons%20%28UK%29"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; in this election.

<h2>&lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews%3AAudio_Wikinews/News_Briefs/Workspace/archive/May1-8%23May_5.2C_2010"&gt;Show Notes&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the Audio Wikinews Brief for Wednesday, May 5th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>(0:16)</h3>

The oil company BP has said that one of three leaks from a ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has been sealed off, in an attempt to stop the oil from the destroyed Deepwater Horizon rig. 

Although 800,000 liters of oil a day are still pouring into the sea, officials say it will be easier to combat the spill with only two leaks. However, BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles stressed that "the amount of oil being leaked is still the same".

Meanwhile, remote-controlled submarines will be used tomorrow to try to place a large iron dome over the other two leaks, according to BP spokesman John Curry.

The Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank on April 20th, killing eleven workers; the cause of the disaster is not known.

<h3>&lt;a href="Taleban%20launches%20attack%20on%20Afghan%20city%3B%20several%20dead"&gt;Taleban launches attack on Afghan city; several dead&lt;/a&gt; (1:06)</h3>

At least eight suicide bombers with the Taleban attacked Zaranj, a city in southwestern Afghanistan, earlier today, killing at least four people. Reports say the rebels blew themselves up near the governor's compound. Witnesses also reported gun battles between rebels and officials in the area. The Taleban contacted the Reuters news service, confirming that they were responsible for the attack.

Afghanistan's interior ministry said the victims consisted of a provincial council minister, a civilian, and two policemen. Police say eleven others were injured as well.

<h3>&lt;a href="Scottish%20airspace%20to%20be%20closed%20over%20volcanic%20ash%20concerns"&gt;Scottish airspace to be closed over volcanic ash concerns&lt;/a&gt; (1:44)</h3>

Airspace across much of Scotland has been shut down since 7:00 a.m. local time due to volcanic ash from an eruption in Iceland. Flights across Europe are unaffected since new rules now permit aircraft to enter clouds of low-density volcanic ash.

A spokesperson for the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) cautioned that "forecasts also show that it is likely that the ash cloud will continue to move south, potentially affecting airports in the north-west of England and North Wales." The CAA stated that ash over Scotland and Northern Ireland is denser than that which engine manufacturers have deemed to be safe.

The Republic of Ireland's airspace was closed yesterday but was open again today. The Irish Aviation Authority warned that sporadic disruption is possible throughout the summer as the eruption continues.

<h3>&lt;a href="Heavy%20rains%20start%20in%20central%20and%20southern%20Chile%20while%20aftershock%20takes%20place"&gt;Heavy rains start in central and southern Chile while aftershock takes place&lt;/a&gt; (2:42)</h3>

Heavy rains started to fall on early Wednesday morning through most of central and southern Chile. The rains have affected thousands of people that lost their homes after the great 8.8 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami earlier this year. In Chiguayante, firefighters emptied a camp that was completely inundated by the rains. It is expected that the downfalls will provoke chills and respiratory problems in children and the elderly.

President Sebastián Piñera visited some locations affected by the rains where people told him and Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter that the mediaguas, or small houses, given out by the government don't block out the water and humidity. There are also people that haven't received tents or mediaguas yet. The government announced that ambulances will constantly patrol the cities.

Meanwhile, an earthquake hit the area, with the epicenter offshore of Maule at 11:24 am local time. The USGS reported the quake measured at magnitude 4.9, although the University of Chile Geological Survey reported it as 6.1. There was no tsunami warning.

<h3>&lt;a href="Knife-wielding%20woman%20arrested%20after%20allegedly%20stabbing%20four%20at%20store%20in%20West%20Hollywood"&gt;Knife-wielding woman arrested after allegedly stabbing four at store in West Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; (3:58)</h3>

Police in West Hollywood, California have arrested 34 year old Layla Trawick who is alleged to have stabbed four people in a Target shopping store on Monday. At least one witness claims to have seen Trawick perform the attacks who described the assailants behavior as "look[ing] like she was going to stab everyone there."

When paramedics arrived on-scene shortly after midday local time, they discovered one person critically injured along with a second person who sustained minor injuries; both of whom were transported to a local hospital. Two other victims only required treatment at the scene.

Armed off-duty police officer, Clay Grant Jr, was able to stop the assailant who has since been arrested and is currently being held on $1 million bail.

<h3>&lt;a href="Tanker%20seized%20by%20Somali%20pirates%3B%20Russian%20warship%20en%20route"&gt;Tanker seized by Somali pirates; Russian warship en route&lt;/a&gt; (4:49)</h3>

Somali pirates seized the Moscow University, an oil tanker bound for China, 900 kilometers off the coast of Somalia earlier today, prompting a Russian warship to be dispatched to the scene. The vessel's owner, Novoship, says the pirates, armed with automatic weapons, shot at the vessel from two speed boats.

There were 23 Russian crew members aboard the tanker; all of whom are said to have locked themselves in a secure room on the ship. The crew sent out distress calls to the warship Marshal Shaposhnikov before communications were cut off. According to a reporter with the BBC, the warship probably would not intervene, as it may put the lives of the crew in danger.

Pirates are currently holding over 350 hostages and twenty vessels in various locations around Somalia and though international warships have been patrolling the Gulf of Aden, they have been unable to entirely halt the hijacking of ships.

<h3>&lt;a href="Investigation%20into%20US%20Airways%20river%20ditching%20in%20New%20York%20completed"&gt;Investigation into US Airways river ditching in New York completed&lt;/a&gt; (5:49)</h3>

The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has completed its investigation into the ditching of US Airways Flight 1549 into New York's Hudson River. The fifteen-month probe began after the Airbus A320 performed a water landing when bird strikes damaged both engines in a move dubbed the "Miracle on the Hudson" by the media. Nobody was killed.

The NTSB's final report, adopted after a board meeting yesterday, concluded that a combination of safety equipment better than the mandatory minimums and good reactions by the crew were the main reasons the 150 passengers and five crew survived. Although not required, the plane also had equipment designed for safety on flights over long stretches of water.

Other factors cited by the NTSB that helped the situation included good visibility, calm water, nearby ferries which provided rescues within twenty minutes and good co-operation in the cockpit, allowing the crew to maintain control. However, the report also cautioned that bird strikes are ultimately unpreventable and criticized safety briefings and life vests. The report also said that ditching procedures are designed for gradual descent from high altitude and not the lower altitude the jet lost power at.

The captain's decision to land on water was vindicated as the best option available.

<h3>&lt;a href="FDA%20report%20criticizes%20conditions%20in%20factory%20that%20produced%20recalled%20medications"&gt;FDA report criticizes conditions in factory that produced recalled medications&lt;/a&gt; (7:25)</h3>

The United States Federal Drug Agency (FDA) has issued a report into an investigation which began last April in which it heavily criticizes a medicine factory. The company in question, Johnson &amp; Johnson, issued a product recall last weekend which affected medications sold in twelve countries.

The FDA found that an unidentified bacterium was contaminating ingredients, quality control was ineffective and workers had not been properly trained in safety procedures for manufacturing pharmaceuticals. Security issues were also found. In all, the report listed twenty problems identified.

Johnson &amp; Johnson's division McNeil Consumer Healthcare stated that the products recalled could contain foreign particles, excess active ingredients or improperly tested material. McNeil said the factory has been temporarily shut down and said the breaches were "unacceptable to us".

<h3>&lt;a href="Wikinews%20interviews%20Dr.%20Phil%20Klotzbach%20on%20upcoming%20hurricane%20season"&gt;Wikinews interviews Dr. Phil Klotzbach on upcoming hurricane season&lt;/a&gt; (8:24)</h3>

On June 1, hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean and surrounding areas will commence, signaling the potential for a tropical storm to develop at any time. After last year's relatively quiet season, with only nine named cyclones, meteorologists are on-guard for increased activity over the upcoming summer and autumn. Hurricane season runs until November 30, and while storms have been known to develop at practically any time of the year, most tend to form within those bounds.

Wikinews contacted Dr. Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert at the Colorado State University, for an exclusive interview. You can visit Wikinews.org to read the interview and learn about predictions for the upcoming hurricane season.

<h2>On this day in history (9:13)</h2>

Today is Cinco de Mayo! 

In 1862, under the leadership of General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguín, the Mexican army won an unlikely victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla. The battle is widely celebrated as the holiday Cinco de Mayo, the 5th of May, in the United States and, to a lesser degree, in Mexico. Cinco de Mayo is considered a celebration of Mexican heritage and pride but should not be confused with Mexico's Independence Day, that day is celebrated on September 16th.

An NBC employee won &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;266 million from the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Lottery"&gt;California Lottery&lt;/a&gt;'s Mega Millions drawing.

The winner, wishing to remain anonymous, will receive $165 million in total, after federal taxes, reports spokesperson for the lottery Cathy Doyle Johnston.

David Reese, a &lt;a href="w%3AKNBC"&gt;KNBC&lt;/a&gt; assistant manager, was informed by the winner around 2:30 local time Wednesday. Reese told the employees working the night shift to keep the name a secret until the winner wishes to step forward.

Reese said the winner worked for NBC as a freelancer for four years, and her husband was laid off two weeks ago.

L &amp; L Hawaiian BBQ in &lt;a href="w%3APico%20Rivera"&gt;Pico Rivera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, sold the winning ticket with the numbers 9, 21, 31, 36, 43, and the "Mega Number" 8. Danny He, the owner of the BBQ, will receive $1 million from the lottery for selling the winning ticket.

According to lottery officials, there was a 1 in 175,711,536 chance in winning with all six numbers with 38 other states and the &lt;a href="District%20of%20Colombia"&gt;District of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; playing as well.

The Internet has already brought great things to the world, but has also brought spam, phishing, scamming, etc. We all have seen them across the Internet. They promise money, weight loss, or other things a person may strive for, but they usually amount to only a lighter pocket. Online advertising has become something that the increasingly Internet-reliant society has become used to, as well as more aware of. As this is true, online ads have become more intricate and deceptive in recent years.

However, a certain type of advertisement has arisen recently, and has become more deceptive than any other Internet ad, and has tricked many users into credit card charges. These sites claim to be news websites that preach a "miracle product", and they offer a free trial, and then charge the user's credit card a large amount of money without informing them after the trial ends. These sites appear to be operating under one venture and have caught ad pages of high-traffic websites by storm. In this report, Wikinews' investigates news advertisement sites.

These Internet ads work in different ways:

<h3>Attracting the customers</h3>

Hypothetically speaking, a reader is browsing the web, and then happens to come across something that they believe is too good to be true. A link on one of these high-traffic pages promises white teeth, weight loss, or huge profits from working at home part-time. Out of curiosity, they click on the link.

This is the way that people are attracted to these fake news sites on the internet. The domain owners draw in customers by purchasing advertising on some of the World Wide Web's most visited pages. Curious users click and are led to what they believe is a news article. From anti-aging to shedding weight, these "articles" from non-existant newspapers and television stations depict a skeptical news reporter trying a product because they were instructed to by a superior.

As the user reads on, they find that the "reporter" miraculously achieves significant weight loss, teeth whitening, or other general health and beauty improvement. The reporter states that the reader can get the same results as they did by using a "free trial" of the product.

Next, the user looks to the bottom of the page, where there seems to be a set of user comments, all of them praising the product or products that are advertised &amp;mdash; this is where we first see something suspicious. Across several of these false articles, the comments appear to show the exact same text, sometimes with even the same usernames as other sites.

There is obviously some kind of correlation. Although this appears to be true, most users who purchase these products do not look at multiple versions of these similar pages of what appears to be a fast-growing network of interconnected fake news sites.

<h3>The free trial</h3>

Once customers have convinced themselves into buying the product, they are led to a product (or products) website which promises a free trial for a very low price. What they do not know about this, however, is that they are giving their credit card data to a company that will charge it automatically after the trial ends. In about 14 days, the user receives a charge on their credit card for an excessive amount of money, usually from about $80 to $100 (&lt;a href="USD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;). All attempts to contact these companies and cancel their shipments usually prove to be futile.

What these sites have is a large amount of legal copy located at the bottom of each site, stating their right to charge the user. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.consumernewsreporting.com/2/index1.php%3Ft202id%3D91828%26amp%3Bt202kw%3D"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt;, a fake news article claiming to offer teeth-whitening benefits, has several paragraphs of fine print, including this: ♡❤"...Upon signing up for the 10 day trial membership you will be charged up to $4.97 depending on various shipping and initial offer promotions at that time but not more than $4.97 upon signing. If not cancelled, you will be charged $89.97 upon completion of the 10 day trial period. Monthly thereafter or 30 days from the original order date, the charge will reoccur monthly at a total of $89.97 until cancelled...,"♡❤ the site says.

Practices like this have alerted the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABetter%20Business%20Bureau"&gt;Better Business Bureau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an American organization that studies and reports on the reliability and practices of US businesses. In a press release, a spokesman from the BBB spoke out against sites like this. "Many businesses across the country are using the same selling model for their products: They lure customers in with claimed celebrity endorsements and free trial offers, and then lock them in by making it extremely difficult to cancel the automatic delivery of more products every month...," said the report that denounced the websites.

<h3>An advertising "empire"</h3>

When a user looks at several of these sites, they notice that all of them have the same exact structure. Because of this, Wikinews decided to look into where some of the domains were owned, and if they were all in fact part of one company.

However, the results that Wikinews found were ones that were not expected. Out of the three random websites that were found in Internet ads, all using similar designs and methods to attract the customers, came from three different locations in three countries and two separate continents. The first came from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScottsdale%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Scottsdale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, while the next two came from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%2C%20Canada"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHamburg%2C%20Germany"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . There is no location correlation, but surely, there has to be something that connected these sites together. We had to look even further to try to find a connection.

There is some correlation within the product's contact information. A large amount of the teeth-whitening products analyzed actually shared the same phone number, which lead to a distribution center located in St. Petersburg, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and several other similar distribution centers located across the Southern United States. But, that explains only one of the categories of products that these websites cover, teeth whitening. 

What about the other products? The other products such as weight loss and work-at-home kits all trace back to similar distribution centers in similar places. So, what do we make of all of this?

There is obviously some company that promotes these products through the fake news advertisements, but that company is nowhere to be found on the websites. All contact information is given on the product pages, and websites are copyrighted under the name of the domain, not a company. Whatever company has been the setup for these pages has been very good at hiding themselves from the Internet, as there is no information across the web about that mysterious large advertiser.

<h3>Customer response</h3>

As a result of customers buying the products and having unauthorized charges on their credit cards, a large volume of complaints are currently present on awareness sites, complaint sites, and even the Better Business Bureau. Several customers point out that they were not informed of the steep charges and the company made it extremely difficult to cancel their subscription, usually resulting in the loss of several hundred dollars.

<h4>Specific complaints</h4>

<ul>
BULLET::::- "♡❤The trial offer was to pay for $3.95 for the cost of the shipping for one bottle. I noticed shortly after placing the order I had a charge on my credit card for $149.95. Unknown to myself the company charges for a membership if you don't cancel within 14 days, I cancelled within 18 days...When I called the customer service number they told me the decision has been made and my refund request was denied. When I questioned the person on the other line about what I was getting for my $149.95 she told me I was not getting anything because I cancelled the membership.♡❤"
BULLET::::- "♡❤This is a "free sample" scam: Pay only postage and handling and get a free sample of a tooth whitening system, they say. I looked for the "catch," something that would indicate that there'd be hidden or recurring charges, but didn't see anything, and ordered. Sure enough, a couple of weeks later, I see a charge for $88.97 on my bank statement...When I called, the guy answering the phone had obviously answered the same angry question many, many times: "Why has your company charged $88.97 to my card?" "Because you didn't cancel your subscription in time," he said tiredly.♡❤"

</ul>
<h3>Legal issues and lawsuits</h3>
One notable lawsuit has occurred as a result of these articles. Some of the articles about work at home kits specifically advertise things like "work for &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;", or "job openings at Google". However, Google asserts these claims as false and has taken the case to court, as it is a copyright violation. "Thousands of people have been tricked into sending payment information and being charged hidden fees by questionable operations," said Google in a statement.

The BBB has received over 3,000 complaints about products such as the ones that Google took offense to. The lawsuit has yet to begin in court, and no date has been set.

<h2>Intro</h2>
From Wikinews, the free news source, this is the Audio Wikinews Brief for Thursday, May 6th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and here are today's top stories:

<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>&lt;a href="2010%20UK%20general%20election%20results"&gt;2010 UK general election results&lt;/a&gt; (0:16)</h3>

While results have yet to be determined in today's elections in the UK, exit polls are suggesting a small Conservative Party majority over the incumbent Gordon Brown's socialist Labour Party. When this swing is projected nationally, it would cause a hung parliament. This would be a favored result by the third party, the Liberal Democrats, whose support has surged following the first national televised leaders' debates. However, the party's support is still not strong enough, according to polls, for them to form a government, so their most realistic aim is to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament.

In the general election, people over the age of eighteen around the United Kingdom vote for a candidate at their local polling booth, and Members of Parliament are elected to each constituency based on the first past the post system, which means an election is determined by the highest polling candidate. Whichever party has a majority of MPs after all constituencies have announced their results has the opportunity to form a government.

<h3>&lt;a href="Athens%20bank%20fire%20kills%20three%20as%20Greece%20goes%20on%20strike"&gt;Athens bank fire kills three as Greece goes on strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greek%20demonstrators%20protest%20austerity%20measures"&gt;Greek demonstrators protest austerity measures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greek%20parliament%20passes%20austerity%20bill"&gt;Greek parliament passes austerity bill&lt;/a&gt; (1:26)</h3>

The Greek parliament has approved an austerity bill proposed by the government to help rescue the country's ailing economy.

The proposal, which includes increases in taxes, as well as salary and pension cuts, needed at least 151 votes to pass in the 300 seat parliament. The vote comes after a debate that took the entire day and was passed with 172 members of parliament supporting, 121 opposing, and several abstaining. 

Prime minister George Papandreou described the situation to parliament ahead of the vote, saying "The future of Greece is at stake. The economy, democracy and social cohesion are being put to the test."

The Eurozone and the International Monetary Fund had asked for austerity plans, an economic measure in which a government reduces its spending and/or increases user fees to pay back creditors, to be implemented so that Greece can access a rescue loan package worth US$146 billion in order not to default on their debts. The austerity program is estimated to save $38 billion. Greece also aims to lower the public deficit to less than 3% of the GDP in four years; at the moment it is at 13.6%.

Meanwhile, rallies and strikes have been held across the country, particularly in Athens, to protest against the measures. 

During the first day of the protests, demonstrations were mostly peaceful, though some protesters threw stones at riot police, who responded with pepper spray. Members of the Greek Communist Party, the KKE, broke through locks securing the Acropolis in Athens and hung up banners saying "Peoples of Europe — Rise Up".

Present at the protests were 150 members of the armed forces, who protested having their bonuses lowered and they were joined by teachers, hospital workers and other public servants. 

However, on the second day of protests, yesterday, an apparent firebombing at the Marfin Bank bank killed three, including a pregnant woman, as the sweeping 24-hour strike shut down most services, including schools, hospitals, public transport and government-run offices. 

Up to 100,000 people were reported to have taken part in the demonstrations, the largest since Greece's economic crisis began last year. In addition to the bank bombings, protesters attempted to storm riot police guarding the parliament building, using broken marble torn from buildings as weapons. Protesters have also reportedly set fire to other buildings, cars and bins, as well as setting up barricades in the streets. Police responded by using tear gas and water cannons against the protesters.

The Greek Communist Party has indicated to Wikinews reporter Iain Macdonald that they are willing to provide an exclusive interview about the current situation. The interview is likely to appear on wikinews.org within the next few days. Please stay tuned to wikinews.org for all the latest developments in this story.

<h3>&lt;a href="Nigerian%20President%20Umaru%20Yar%27Adua%20reported%20dead"&gt;Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua reported dead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nigeria%20swears%20in%20new%20president%20after%20death%20of%20Umaru%20Yar%27Adua"&gt;Nigeria swears in new president after death of Umaru Yar'Adua&lt;/a&gt; (4:36)</h3>

Presidential aides and state television announced yesterday that the Nigerian president, Umaru Yar'Adua, died.

Yar'Adua ascended to the presidency in 2007, but was later taken ill, and had not been publicly seen for the last few months. He was hospitalized in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to get treatment for inflammated tissue around his heart.

According to the BBC, Nigerian reports indicated the president died between 21.00 and 22.00 local time (20.00 to 21.00 UTC) in Abuja, the capital.

Goodluck Jonathan, the vice-president, became the acting president this February and was formally sworn in today. According to the constitution, Jonathan will be the country's leader until next elections next April; he is also to nominate a vice president, who must be approved by the senate.

Tomorrow is to be a national holiday, and Nigeria will observe a week of mourning for the deceased president. In his statement, acting president Jonathan said: "Nigeria has lost the jewel on its crown, and even the heavens mourn with our nation tonight."

<h3>&lt;a href="Black%20boxes%20from%20Air%20France%20Flight%20447%20localized"&gt;Black boxes from Air France Flight 447 localized&lt;/a&gt; (5:43)</h3>

According to French officials on Thursday, the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, or "black boxes", from an Air France plane that crashed on June 1 last year in the Atlantic Ocean, have been localized to within about 2 square miles (5 square kilometers). The French government and military officials have urged caution, however, saying there is no guarantee the flight recorders will be found.

The aircraft, an Airbus A330-200, carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew members, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean after flying in bad weather. The pitot tubes, which measure airspeed, are considered likely to have been a contributing factor to the crash. However, the actual cause has yet to be determined.

<h3>&lt;a href="Mumbai%20gunman%20given%20death%20penalty%2C%20to%20be%20hanged"&gt;Mumbai gunman given death penalty, to be hanged&lt;/a&gt; (6:27)</h3>

Ajmal Amir Kasab, the only surviving terrorist from the 2008 gun and grenade attacks in Mumbai, India, has been sentenced to death by hanging, on 86 charges, including conspiracy, murder, terrorism, and waging war against India.

The sentence was handed down after being in the courts for over a year, and after a 90-minute sentencing hearing. Kasab can still appeal to the high Mumbai court, that nations Supreme Court, and the Indian president to have the sentence reversed. According to the Christian Science Monitor, people on death row frequently are not actually executed for years; the last available data from 2007 indicates 308 people are on death row. 

Kasab's defense lawyer had argued that his client carried out the attack under pressure from the Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terrorist organization blamed for the attacks but today's ruling rejected the position prompting the public prosecutor to state "Terrorism and terrorists like Kasab cannot be tolerated. The death penalty is the only option."

At least 166 people in Mumbai were killed and 234 injured when several hotels, a rail station, and other locations were attacked by terrorists over a 60-hour period in November 2008.

<h3>&lt;a href="New%20York%20bridge%20shut%20down%20after%20suspicious%20truck%20found"&gt;New York bridge shut down after suspicious truck found&lt;/a&gt; (7:50)</h3>

New York City's Triborough Bridge was shut down yesterday while bomb squads investigated a suspicious vehicle. A toll booth operator noticed a strong smell of gasoline coming from a U-Haul rental truck which had been abandoned nearby.

Witnesses told police they saw a man flee the vehicle last night. No bomb was found. The incident comes just three days after a failed bombing in the city's Times Square.

<h3>&lt;a href="Russian%20forces%20storm%20oil%20tanker%20seized%20by%20Somali%20pirates%2C%20crew%20freed"&gt;Russian forces storm oil tanker seized by Somali pirates, crew freed&lt;/a&gt; (8:18)</h3>

Russian special forces aboard the Marshal Shaposhnikov warship stormed an oil tanker that was recently seized by Somali pirates.

The forces boarded the Moscow University tanker, where they freed the 23 crew members, who had been hiding in a secure room on the ship after disabling the vessel's motor. There was a shootout between the pirates and the forces, after which one pirate was killed and ten others taken into custody.

The Moscow University was carrying 86,000 tons of crude oil, which was valued at US$50 million.

<h3>&lt;a href="British%20political%20candidate%20Nigel%20Farage%20injured%20in%20plane%20crash%20on%20polling%20day"&gt;British political candidate Nigel Farage injured in plane crash on polling day&lt;/a&gt; (8:53)</h3>

A political candidate for the United Kingdom Independence Party has been injured in a polling day plane crash. Nigel Farage, the former leader of the party, was a passenger on a two-seater plane when it crashed at an airfield in Winchester just one hour after voting began.

The pilot received serious injuries while Farage's were not thought to be life-threatening, although a fellow UKIP member stated that Farage has been drifting in and out of consciousness. The plane was towing a UKIP banner to be flown over Buckinghamshire, the constituency for which Farage is a candidate. Initially, UKIP said unconfirmed reports stated the banner had become snagged or that crosswinds were a factor, but stated that after contacting an aviation expert they believed the banner was not a factor.

An investigation into the crash has been launched.

<h3>&lt;a href="British%20oil%20firm%20claims%20discovery%20off%20coast%20of%20Falkland%20Islands"&gt;British oil firm claims discovery off coast of Falkland Islands&lt;/a&gt; (9:50)</h3>

A British oil firm has claimed to have discovered oil off the coast of the Falkland Islands in the North Falkland Basin. Rockhopper Exploration would be the first company to strike oil in the Falklands if the claim is proven.

After the discovery, Rockhopper Exploration’s shares doubled. Other oil companies in the Falklands, including Desire Petroleum, also saw shares rise after the discovery.

The sovereignty of the Falkland Islands have always been disputed. Both the United Kingdom and Argentina claim the islands.

<h3>&lt;a href="African%20leaders%20start%20drive%20to%20eradicate%20malaria"&gt;African leaders start drive to eradicate malaria&lt;/a&gt; (10:22)</h3>

The African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA), consisting of leaders from 26 African countries, are beginning a drive to eradicate malaria from the continent by distributing medication, insecticides, and bed nets. In a budget announced at the World Economic Forum yesterday, US$100 million will be spent in the countries worst affected by the disease.

Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete told the World Economic Forum that the strategy of mass-covering beds with nets to keep out disease-carrying mosquitoes, distributing plenty of medicine and the use of insecticides has already reduced Zanzibar's malaria incidence from 40% to 1%. Ray Chambers, a special envoy for malaria with the United Nations, said the US President's Malaria Initiative will provide the money. Chambers also commented that ALMA has recently purchased 50 million "long lasting" insecticidal nets.

Malaria costs the continent an estimated US$40 billion every year in lost work time and medical care.

<h3>&lt;a href="NBC%20employee%20wins%20%24266M%20from%20California%20lottery"&gt;NBC employee wins $266M from California lottery&lt;/a&gt; (11:31)</h3>

An NBC employee won US$266 million from the California Lottery's Mega Millions drawing.

The winner, wishing to remain anonymous, will receive $165 million in total, after federal taxes.

David Reese, a KNBC assistant manager, was informed by the winner around 2:30 local time Wednesday. Reese told the employees working the night shift to keep the name a secret until the winner wishes to step forward.

Reese said the winner worked for NBC as a freelancer for four years, and her husband was laid off two weeks ago.

L &amp; L Hawaiian BBQ in Pico Rivera, California, sold the winning ticket with the numbers 9, 21, 31, 36, 43, and the "Mega Number" 8. Danny He, the owner of the BBQ, will receive $1 million from the lottery for selling the winning ticket.

According to lottery officials, there was a 1 in 175,711,536 chance in winning with all six numbers with 38 other states and the District of Colombia playing as well.

<h3>&lt;a href="Peruvian%20bolero%20singer%20Lucho%20Barrios%20dies%20aged%2075"&gt;Peruvian bolero singer Lucho Barrios dies aged 75&lt;/a&gt; (12:46)</h3>

In our final story today, Peruvian bolero singer Lucho Barrios died in a Lima, Peru hospital, of renal failure and respiratory problems. Barrios was well-known through all the South American countries.

Barrios, who was a diabetic, was taken to the Dos de Mayo Hospital on Monday due to a pulmonary thromboembolism. He remained in the intensive care unit in a serious condition, until his death on Wednesday at 7:32 AM local time.

Here is Barrios singing "La Joya Del Pacifico (The Jewel Of the Pacific)"

According to his daughter, Milagros Barrios, she said of her father after he had recovered from his first thromboembolism almost a year ago, that "He was okay, he was healthy, and he started singing again because he told me, 'I'm gonna die on the stage'," 

Barrios was 75.

<h2>On this day in history (13:53)</h2>

In 1937, the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg caught fire and was destroyed as it was attempting to dock with its mooring mast at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. Of the 97 people on board, 35 people died in addition to one fatality on the ground. The disaster was the subject of spectacular newsreel coverage, photographs, and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness report from the landing field, which was broadcast the next day.

The actual cause of the fire remains unknown, although a variety of theories have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire.

The accident served to shatter public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship, and marked the end of the airship era.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Red%20Wings"&gt;Detroit Red wings&lt;/a&gt; beat the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%20Sharks"&gt;San Jose Sharks&lt;/a&gt; 7–1 in their fourth quarter final match of the &lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs"&gt;2010 Stanley Cup playoffs&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday night, reducing San Jose's series lead to three games to one.

Detroit would go up to a five goal to zero lead in the first period, with &lt;a href="w%3AJohan%20Franz%C3%A9n"&gt;Johan Franzén&lt;/a&gt; scoring three goals (commonly known as a hat-trick). In the second period, Detroit scored one another goal to take a six goal to zero lead. &lt;a href="w%3ADany%20Heatley"&gt;Dany Heatley&lt;/a&gt; of the San Jose Sharks eventually scored to reduce Detroits lead to six goals to one in the same period, but could not lift the team to score any more.

In the third period, Franzén scored his fourth and final goal of the game. Detroit won seven goals to one. 

The next game will be hosted by San Jose on Saturday night. If the San Jose Sharks win Game 5, they will advance to the &lt;a href="w%3ANHL%20Conference%20Finals"&gt;Conference Finals&lt;/a&gt;. Detroit are forced to win three games in a row in order to advance to the Conference Finals. The winning team in this series (first team to win 4 games) will advance to the Conference Finals of the &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Conference%20%28NHL%29"&gt;Western Conference&lt;/a&gt;, where they'll either meet the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Blackhawks"&gt;Chicago Blackhawks&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Canucks"&gt;Vancouver Canucks&lt;/a&gt;. The Canucks are currently leading that series, 3 games to 1.

The winning team in the Conference Finals of the Western Conference will advance to the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Stanley%20Cup%20champions"&gt;Stanley Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, also a best-of-7-games-series, where they meet the winner of the Conference Finals of the &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Conference%20%28NHL%29"&gt;Eastern Conference&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>UK elections: Hung parliament, Cameron to negotiate with Liberal Democrats</h1>

A day after general elections were held in the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, results indicate there will be a &lt;a href="w%3Ahung%20parliament"&gt;hung parliament&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; where no party obtains the simple majority needed to pass legislation on its own &amp;mdash; raising the prospect of a minority or coalition government being formed, which would require cooperation between parties.

With only one constituency not yet counted, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;'s Conservatives have taken 306 seats, incumbent Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;'s Labour party 258 seats, and &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Clegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; with 57. Cameron has said he will negotiate with the latter party to try and form a coalition to attain more than 325 seats, or half those in the parliament.

After Labour's large losses at the polls yesterday, both in terms of seats and votes, Cameron said Brown has "lost his mandate to govern". Clegg, meanwhile, says he thinks the result allows the Conservatives to try to form a government first, contrary to past tradition, under which the incumbent prime minister and his party in a hung parliament try first to form a coalition.

"I've said that whichever party gets the most votes and the most seats, if not an absolute majority, has the first right to seek to govern either on its own or by reaching out to other parties, and I stick to that view," Clegg said this morning.

"It seems this morning that it is the Conservative Party that has more votes and more seats though not an absolute majority. That is why I think it is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest."

Clegg described his party's performance as "disappointing" during the night, as they had failed to make any significant advances in their target seats. Overall, the general swing varied, with all parties failing to gain many of their targets, and suffering unexpected losses in others.

<h3>Brown: 'prepared to discuss' issues with Lib Dems</h3>

Pre-empting a statement from Cameron, Brown said at lunchtime in a short statement outside Downing Street that if any negotiations between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats failed, he would be prepared to form an alliance with Nick Clegg, offering "far-reaching political reform", in reference to the Liberals' long held position that the UK's &lt;a href="w%3Afirst%20past%20the%20post"&gt;first past the post&lt;/a&gt; voting system must be reformed into some form of proportional representation system, historically opposed by the Conservatives.

"I understand and completely respect the position of Mr. Clegg in stating that he wishes first to make contact with the leader of the Conservative Party," he commented, but noting that, "should the discussions between Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg come to nothing [...] I would be prepared to discuss with Mr. Clegg the areas where there may be some measure of agreement between our two parties." He said there is "substantial common ground" between his party and the Liberals.

"I understand as I know my fellow party leaders do that people do not like the uncertainty or want it to be prolonged. We live, however, in a parliamentary democracy, the outcome has been delivered by the electorate. It is our responsibility now to make it work for the national good," Brown said.

Cameron made his position known in a statement delivered in the early afternoon, in which he offered the prospect of both a Lib Dem supported minority Conservative government, or an alliance "stronger, more stable, more collaborative government than that". Cameron stated: "I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems &amp;mdash; the debt crisis, our deep social problems, and our broken political system."

He went on to describe how both parties had "common ground" they could work together on to form a government in the "national interest". On the issue of electoral reform, Cameron ruled out holding a referendum, but suggested forming an all party commission on electoral and voting reform. He also ruled out concessions on other Lib Dem positions like greater integration with the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; or altering the position on defence and the nuclear deterrent, although offering to adopt other Lib Dem policies, such as on schools.

The AFP news agency says this is the first time the Liberal Democrats have considered working with Conservatives; previously, the former were thought likelier to negotiate with Labour due to them being considered more "progressive". 

<h3>Brown not to step down after 'lost mandate'</h3>

Brown, however, has made it clear he has no intention of stepping down as PM, saying he has "a duty as Prime Minister to take all steps to ensure Britain has a strong, stable and principled government".

When asked whether it was "inconceivable" that the PM should step down, Mandelson responded: "Frankly, there are quite a number of permutations. And the reason I don't want to start getting into hypotheses about what may or may not happen is because, quite frankly, I think it's premature. I am not ruling out or ruling in anything."

Under British parliamentary convention, in the event of a hung parliament, Brown remains Prime Minister and the Labour Government continues to operate until it is demonstrated it cannot command a majority. The Government effectively gave approval for talks to begin by giving civil servants permission to support all parties in hung parliament negotiations. Brown described how the negotiations could be "prolonged", and while recognising people might want a swift conclusion, "the outcome has been delivered by the electorate. It is our responsibility now to make it work for the national good".

The &lt;a href="British%20National%20Party"&gt;British National Party&lt;/a&gt; (BNP) has lost all 12 of its councilors in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarking%20%26amp%3B%20Dagenham"&gt;Barking &amp; Dagenham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarking%20and%20Dagenham%20Council%20election%2C%202010"&gt;local elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The new local council will be composed entirely of councillors from the &lt;a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, with no BNP candidate placing higher than fourth in any of the authority's 13 wards.

Before the election, it had been considered possible that the BNP might control Barking &amp; Dagenham Council, giving the party, which believes that immigrants, Muslims and non-whites represent a threat to the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, control of a local authority for the first time in its history. The BNP has played the role of official opposition in Barking &amp; Dagenham since 2006. The BNP has no &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amember%20of%20parliament"&gt;MPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but party leader &lt;a href="Nick%20Griffin"&gt;Nick Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, as well as party member &lt;a href="Andrew%20Brons"&gt;Andrew Brons&lt;/a&gt;, represent regions of northern &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="European%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.

Griffin also failed in his attempt to unseat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Hodge"&gt;Margaret Hodge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarking%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29%23Elections%20in%202010s"&gt;UK general election in Barking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , his party losing support in Barking compared to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202005"&gt;2005 general election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Many anti-far right groups such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnite%20Against%20Fascism"&gt;Unite Against Fascism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASearchlight%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Searchlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHope%20Not%20Hate"&gt;Hope Not Hate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had been involved in campaigning in Barking &amp; Dagenham, with marches, rallies and door-to-door canvassing taking place daily in the lead-up to the election. A spokesman for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYouth%20Fight%20For%20Jobs"&gt;Youth Fight For Jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; campaign, which organised a march against both Nick Griffin and Margaret Hodge in Barking, said of the defeat of the BNP: "I think it shows the value of campaigning work and spreading a positive alternative. The danger of the BNP is still there and so we need to continue campaigning and putting forward a positive alternative."

The BNP also suffered from internal dissent late in the election, with its former webmaster launching a scathing attack on the party's internal operations and accusing it of corruption the day before voting booths opened. The party's finances are also under investigation by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectoral%20Commission"&gt;Electoral Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>, &lt;a href="Voters%20turned%20away%20from%20polling%20stations%20in%20UK%20general%20elections"&gt;Voters turned away from polling stations in UK general elections&lt;/a&gt; (0:44)</h3>

In our top story, a day after general elections were held in the UK, results indicate there will be a hung parliament — where no party obtains the simple majority needed to pass legislation on its own — raising the prospect of a minority or coalition government being formed, which would require cooperation between parties.

With only one constituency not yet counted, David Cameron's Conservatives have taken 306 seats, incumbent Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour party 258 seats, and Nick Clegg with his Liberal Democrats with 57. Cameron has said he will negotiate with the latter party to try and form a coalition to attain more than 325 seats, or half those in the parliament.

After Labour's large losses at the polls yesterday, both in terms of seats and votes, Cameron said Brown has "lost his mandate to govern". Clegg, meanwhile, says he thinks the result allows the Conservatives to try to form a government first, contrary to past tradition, under which the incumbent prime minister and his party in a hung parliament try first to form a coalition.

Clegg described his party's performance as "disappointing" during the night, as they had failed to make any significant advances in their target seats. Overall, the general swing varied, with all parties failing to gain many of their targets, and suffering unexpected losses in others.

In a short statement outside Downing Street, Gordon Brown stated that if any negotiations between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats failed, he would be prepared to form an alliance with Nick Clegg, offering "far-reaching political reform", in reference to the Liberals' long held position that the UK's first past the post voting system must be reformed into some form of proportional representation system, historically opposed by the Conservatives.

Brown, however, has made it clear he has no intention of stepping down as PM, saying he has "a duty as Prime Minister to take all steps to ensure Britain has a strong, stable and principled government".

Under British parliamentary convention, in the event of a hung parliament, Brown remains Prime Minister and the Labour Government continues to operate until it is demonstrated it cannot command a majority. The Government effectively gave approval for talks to begin by giving civil servants permission to support all parties in hung parliament negotiations.

The turmoil in UK politics was also felt at the citizen level as scores of polling stations were unable to cope with one of the highest voter turn outs in thirty years, leaving thousands of voters unable to cast their vote in yesterday's general election.

Police had to intervene in some areas when angry voters refused to leave after the 10.00pm deadline and at other polling stations, voters were turned away before ten when the stations ran out of ballot papers. A late surge in voter registrations also saw hundreds of voters eligible to vote but unable to do so because electoral rolls had not been updated.

The Electoral Commission sets national standards for elections, and promised an inquiry into elections where people were unable to vote.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20stocks%20see%209%25%20drop%20before%20making%20recovery"&gt;US stocks see 9% drop before making recovery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="US%20economy%20added%20390%2C000%20jobs%20last%20month%2C%20unemployment%20at%209.9%25"&gt;US economy added 390,000 jobs last month, unemployment at 9.9%&lt;/a&gt; (3:58)</h3>

Moving on now to the US economic sector; the latest figures from the US government say that the country's economy gained 290,000 jobs in April, the largest single-month gain since March 2006.

According to the Labor Department, excluding temporary workers for this year's census, the number of non-farm jobs increased by a seasonally adjusted 224,000.

The unemployment rate, meanwhile, increased from 9.7% to 9.9%; the apparent contradiction is because 195,000 people who previously gave up searching for jobs started looking for work again, entering the labor force and augmenting the jobless rate.

The increases were larger than expected by economic analysts; according to a survey done by MarketWatch, economists believed the country would have added 185,000 jobs for last month.

News of job growth was tempered, however, after US stock markets saw an unusually turbulent day yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) losing almost a thousand points in thirty minutes, although later recovering somewhat to end the day with a smaller loss to close with down 3.30% or 347.80 points to a level of 10,520.

According to some reports, the quick loss happened because a trader mistyped an order to sell a large amount of stock, causing the stock price to go down enough to trigger orders to sell elsewhere in the market.

However, Chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group Charlie Smith said: "I think the machines just took over. There's not a lot of human interaction. We've known that automated trading can run away from you, and I think that's what we saw happen today."

Some stocks saw extreme, but short, changes; for instance, consulting firm Accenture saw its shares plummet from about $42 to four cents, although it later rebounded to close the day at $41.09 and stock for the Procter &amp; Gamble company fell almost 37% during the sell-off, about 75 minutes to the closing bell.

Meanwhile, oil prices also dropped to lows not reached since February. Benchmark crude was down $2.86 to $77.11 in New York.

Delaware senator Edward Kaufman said of the situation, "The battle of the algorithms — not understood by nor even remotely transparent to the Securities and Exchange Commission — simply must be carefully reviewed and placed within a meaningful regulatory framework soon." Kaufman, along with senator Mark Warner from Virginia, called on Congress to investigate the cause of the mass sell-offs.

In the past three days, the DJIA has lost 631 points, or 5.7%, mainly over concerns about Greece's ailing, debt-burdened economy. Peter Boockvar an equity strategist for Miller Tabak, commented: "The market is now realizing that Greece is going to go through a depression over the next couple of years. Europe is a major trading partner of ours, and this threatens the entire global growth story."

And finally,

<h2>On this day in history (7:03)</h2>

In 1915, Leslie Morton, an eighteen year old lookout on the bow of the RMS Lusitania, spotted a torpedo in the water which had been fired from Unterseeboot 20, a German submarine commanded by Walther Schwieger. The torpedo struck Lusitania under her bridge and according to Schwieger's captains log, "An unusually heavy explosion takes place with a very strong explosive cloud. The explosion of the torpedo must have been followed by a second one ..." 

At this point in his log, we wonders if the second explosion had been from the boiler or possibly coal or powder igniting, then continues his entry, stating "... The ship stops immediately and heels over to starboard very quickly, immersing simultaneously at the bow... the name Lusitania becomes visible in golden letters".

On board the Lusitania, an SOS is sent out and Captain William Thomas Turner, who was known as "Bowler Bill", gave the order to abandon ship. By now, water was flooding the ship's starboard longitudinal compartments, causing a 15-degree list to starboard. Captain Turner tried turning the ship toward the Irish coast in the hope of beaching her, but the helm would not respond because the torpedo had knocked out the steam lines to the steering motor. Meanwhile, the ship's propellers continued to drive the ship at 18 knots, forcing more water into her hull.

Despite Turner's efforts to beach the liner and reduce her speed, Lusitania did not answer the helm. According to Schwieger, who had been observing the disaster through U-20's periscope, there was panic and disorder on the decks. At 14:25, he finally dropped periscope and headed out to sea.

Later in the war, Schwieger was killed in action when, as commander of U-88, he was chased by HMS Stonecrop, hit a British mine, and sank on 5 September 1917. There were no survivors from U-88's sinking. Since the sinking of Lusitania, Schwieger had been condemned in the Allied press as a war criminal.

Captain Turner remained on the bridge of Lusitania until the water rushed upward and destroyed the sliding door leading onto the bridge, washing him overboard and into the sea. He had managed to take the ship's logbook and charts with him as he escaped the rapidly sinking Lusitania and found a chair floating in the water which he clung to. He was pulled unconscious from the water, and survived despite having spent three hours in the water.

By the time it was over, Lusitania sank in 18 minutes eight miles off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland, taking 1,198 lives with her.

In the aftermath of the sinking, the German government tried to justify it by claiming in an official statement that she had been armed with guns, and had "large quantities of war material" in her cargo. Lusitania had been carrying, according to her manifest, an estimated 4,200,000 rounds of rifle cartridges, 1,250 empty shell cases, and 18 cases of non-explosive fuses, but the cartridges were not officially classed as ammunition by the Cunard Line, the company who owned the vessel.

The sinking turned public opinion in many countries against Germany, and was instrumental in bringing the United States, which up to this point had been reluctant to enter into European hostilities, into World War I.

<h1>Football: Falkirk relegated from Scottish Premier League</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Football%3A%20Falkirk%20relegated%20from%20Scottish%20Premier%20League&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AFalkirk%20F.C."&gt;Falkirk&lt;/a&gt; were today relegated from the Scottish Premier League (SPL), after they failed to beat &lt;a href="w%3AKilmarnock%20F.C."&gt;Kilmarnock&lt;/a&gt; away from home. It was their final game of the season. The teams fought out a 0&amp;ndash;0 draw at &lt;a href="w%3ARugby%20Park"&gt;Rugby Park&lt;/a&gt;, a game which did not see many shots on goal with only nine in the whole game. It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005.

Kilmarnock had previously been two points clear of twelfth position, occupied instead by Falkirk. The team in last place would be relegated, and, only needing a draw, Kilmarnock played a slow and defensive game. It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005. With only two shots on target the entire game, much of the credit for the draw went to each team's defensive line, putting in several last-ditch tackles to stifle attacks.

While Falkirk had the upper hand in the first half possession-wise, the contest was more even in the second. On 77 minutes, the Falkirk side had the ball in the net, but the goal was disallowed for a clear foul on the Kilmarnock goalkeeper. Shortly after, Kilmarnock clipped the crossbar with a Craig Bryson effort. Falkirk had a glorious opportunity to win the game on 86 minutes, when the ball landed for Ryan Flynn with the goal empty, but the young midfielder put it over from ten yards.

Kilmarnock manager &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Calderwood"&gt;Jimmy Calderwood&lt;/a&gt;, speaking after the game, spoke of his experiences: "It was a long, long day. I wouldn't advise it for anybody to be honest, you know. It's the first time and hopefully the last time.

"They didn't really cause us any problems. We had a chance on the counter attack, we didn't take it, and then I think it was the 92nd or 93rd minute young Flynn missed a dottie of a chance. It could have been over and out. All credit to Falkirk."

When asked about his future at the club, Calderwood replied: "I'll see what the idea is. I wouldn't want to stay with too many games like this."

The manager of Falkirk, &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Pressley"&gt;Steven Pressley&lt;/a&gt;, also told &lt;a href="w%3ARadio%20Scotland"&gt;Radio Scotland&lt;/a&gt; his views on the game: "It was a very emotional day, you know, we're bitterly disappointed, but once again I couldn't ask any more from this group of players. The things we talk about, the desire, the effort, the application, they were in abundance today. They gave me their absolute lot. It just wasn't to be."

This was Pressley's first season as a manager, and he was questioned on his experience in the role: "I love it. It's been an emotional day today, but in terms of my three months in charge, it's been a terrific experience. I very much enjoy it here and hopefully we can certainly build for next season."

Falkirk will be replaced in the Scottish Premier League next season by &lt;a href="w%3AInverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C."&gt;Inverness Caledonian Thistle&lt;/a&gt;, who bounced straight back into the top flight after their relegation in 2009.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Police%20Department"&gt;New York Police Department&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AStaten%20Island%20Ferry"&gt;Staten Island Ferry&lt;/a&gt; has crashed into a passenger terminal, causing over 60 injuries. The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Fire%20Department"&gt;New York Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; reports to the press that they are on the scene and are giving emergency treatment.

No life-threatening injuries have been reported, although a few of the passengers were transported by the NYFD to local city hospitals. The accident is still under investigation by the NYPD. In all, 252 passengers were aboard the ship, along with eighteen various crew members.

According to some of the passengers that were on the ship, the boat sped up right before hitting the dock, when it should have actually been slowing down so that it could let passengers on from the station. An early report of the investigation is that the captain of the ship mistakenly lost engine control.

The Staten Island Ferry is a major form of transportation between the two New York city boroughs of &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStaten%20Island"&gt;Staten Island&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Death%20toll%20from%20China%20rainstorm%20reaches%2065"&gt;Death toll from China rainstorm reaches 65&lt;/a&gt; (0:42)</h3>

At least 65 people have been killed and 9,900 houses destroyed in southern China after torrential rainstorms hit the area over the past week. Fourteen people are missing, and 2.55 million people have been affected by the rains.

According to meteorologists, the inclement weather is expected to continue and China's state news agency reports that as much as 157 millimeters of rain fell throughout the region from Wednesday evening to Thursday afternoon. 

The rains started when a heat wave in the southern part of the country mingled with a cold front from the north.

<h3>&lt;a href="Nineteen%20Spanish%20airports%20closed%20due%20to%20ash"&gt;Nineteen Spanish airports closed due to ash&lt;/a&gt; (1:16)</h3>

Weather is also playing havoc in Europe as Spanish authorities have closed nineteen airports, including Spain's second largest airport at Barcelona, due to an ash cloud from the volcano in Iceland which has been erupting since last month.

The closures are forecast to affect nearly 40,000 people, and over 400 flights are to be canceled. Limited traffic into the affected airports will be allowed to resume at 02:00 local time Sunday morning. Authorities warned, however, that the cloud had the potential to affect air travel into next week.

The cloud of ash causing the latest closure is 1,200 miles long, the result of recently intensifying eruptions from the volcano. Ash is rising up to 30,000 feet into the air, although Eurocontrol said the risk of ash contamination was particularly high up to 20,000 feet.

Passengers who were not traveling by air, but rather on water, ran into trouble today in New York and more tragically in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<h3>&lt;a href="Boat%20in%20DR%20Congo%20capsizes%2C%2080%20feared%20dead"&gt;Boat in DR Congo capsizes, 80 feared dead&lt;/a&gt; (2:06)</h3>

At least eighty people in DR Congo are feared dead after a boat capsized on the Congo River.

The boat was carrying 125 people when it turned over on Wednesday evening near the city of Kindu, the capital of the eastern Maniema province; 45 people were rescued from the waters, but the rest are missing, and some reports say twenty people were already confirmed dead. Rescue efforts are still ongoing.

It wasn't immediately clear why the accident happened; however, boats in the DRC frequently are overcrowded as they are a popular means of transport.

<h3>&lt;a href="New%20York%27s%20Staten%20Island%20Ferry%20crashes%2C%2060%20injured"&gt;New York's Staten Island Ferry crashes, 60 injured&lt;/a&gt; (2:50)</h3>

Halfway around the globe, in New York City. according to the New York Police Department, New York City's Staten Island Ferry has crashed into a passenger terminal, causing over 60 injuries.

No life-threatening injuries have been reported, although a few of the passengers were transported by the NYFD to local city hospitals. The accident is still under investigation by the NYPD. In all, 252 passengers were aboard the ship, along with eighteen various crew members.

According to some of the passengers that were on the ship, the boat sped up right before hitting the dock, when it should have actually been slowing down so that it could let passengers on from the station. An early report of the investigation is that the captain of the ship mistakenly lost engine control.

The Staten Island Ferry is a major form of transportation between the two New York city boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island. Five different ships carry approximately 60,000 passengers each day across the New York Harbor.

The ship, the Andrew J. Barberi, was also involved in another crash in 2003, where it crashed into the same dock and killed eleven people.

<h3>&lt;a href="Two%20Egyptian%20peacekeepers%20killed%20in%20Darfur%20by%20gunmen"&gt;Two Egyptian peacekeepers killed in Darfur by gunmen&lt;/a&gt; (4:00)</h3>

Violence, once again, has flared up in Darfur where two peacekeepers from Egypt, working for the joint United Nations-African Union mission, were killed and three others injured by gunmen in an ambush yesterday. The incident happened near Edd al-Fursan in South Darfur. Nobody has, as of yet, claimed responsibility for the attack. 

Darfur and the surrounding region are prone to violence, caused by a civil war; with these deaths, 24 peacekeepers have been killed since deploying to the area two years ago.

<h3>&lt;a href="British%20National%20Party%20loses%20all%20seats%20in%20Barking%20%26amp%3B%20Dagenham%20after%20elections"&gt;British National Party loses all seats in Barking &amp; Dagenham after elections&lt;/a&gt; (4:33)</h3>

Following the elections in the UK, The British National Party has lost all 12 of its councilors in Barking &amp; Dagenham, London. The new local council will be composed entirely of councilors from the Labour Party, with no BNP candidate placing higher than fourth in any of the authority's 13 wards.

Before the election, it had been considered possible that the BNP might control Barking &amp; Dagenham Council, giving the party, which believes that immigrants, Muslims and non-whites represent a threat to the United Kingdom, control of a local authority for the first time in its history.

The BNP has no MPs but party leader Nick Griffin, as well as party member Andrew Brons, represent regions of northern England in the European Parliament.

Many anti-far right groups such as Unite Against Fascism, Searchlight and Hope Not Hate had been involved in campaigning in Barking &amp; Dagenham, with marches, rallies and door-to-door canvassing taking place daily in the lead-up to the election.

The BNP also suffered from internal dissent late in the election, with its former webmaster launching a scathing attack on the party's internal operations and accusing it of corruption the day before voting booths opened. The party's finances are also under investigation by the Electoral Commission.

Finally, in the world of sports, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Falkirk%20relegated%20from%20Scottish%20Premier%20League"&gt;Falkirk relegated from Scottish Premier League&lt;/a&gt; (5:52)</h3>

Falkirk were today relegated from the Scottish Premier League, after they failed to beat Kilmarnock away from home in their final game of the season. The teams fought out a 0–0 draw at Rugby Park in a game which only saw nine shots on goal the entire game. It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005.

This was Steven Pressley's first season as a manager of Falkirk and he was questioned on his experience in the role stating : "I love it. It's been an emotional day today, but in terms of my three months in charge, it's been a terrific experience. I very much enjoy it here and hopefully we can certainly build for next season."

Falkirk will be replaced in the Scottish Premier League next season by the Caley Jags, who bounced straight back into the top flight after their relegation in 2009.
Still holding out a sliver of hope in the sport of hockey, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings%20beat%20San%20Jose%20Sharks%207-1%20in%20fourth%20NHL%20quarter%20final%20match"&gt;Detroit Red Wings beat San Jose Sharks 7-1 in fourth NHL quarter final match&lt;/a&gt; (6:41)</h3>

The Detroit Red wings beat the San Jose Sharks 7–1 in the fourth game of the quarter final match in the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs on Thursday night, reducing San Jose's series lead to three games to one and keeping the Wings playoff hopes alive. Game 5 of the series will be hosted by San Jose this evening.

The winning team in this best of 7 series will advance to the Conference Finals of the Western Conference, where they'll meet either the Chicago Blackhawks or the Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks are currently leading that series, 3 games to 1.

<h2>On this day in history (7:17)</h2>

In 1945, Allied forces in Europe formally accepted the unconditional surrender of the armed forces of Nazi Germany and the end of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France, and ratified on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.

In the United States, President Harry Truman, who turned 61 that day, dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April. Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period, which ended on May 12.

Here is Harry Truman announcing Germany's surrender:

More than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. Many hardships remained, however, including continued rationing of food and clothing, which lasted even longer in peacetime than it had during the war.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; football team today won the English &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APremier%20League"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the first time since 2006, with an emphatic win over &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWigan%20Athletic%20F.C."&gt;Wigan Athletic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Chelsea, who went into the game top of the table, knew that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United%20F.C."&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had to beat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStoke%20City%20F.C."&gt;Stoke City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to have any chance of catching them.

The first goal came early, with French striker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANicolas%20Anelka"&gt;Nicolas Anelka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scoring from a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorent%20Malouda"&gt;Florent Malouda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; knock on, despite calls for offside, in the sixth minute. Just after the half-hour mark, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Lampard"&gt;Frank Lampard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was pulled down in the box by Wigan defender &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Caldwell"&gt;Gary Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This earned the defender a straight red card, and the resulting penalty was scored by Lampard. After half-time, a third goal came from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASalomon%20Kalou"&gt;Salomon Kalou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , before Alenka converted an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABranislav%20Ivanovic"&gt;Ivanovic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cross to extend the lead to four just minutes afterwards.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADidier%20Drogba"&gt;Didier Drogba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Chelsea's top goalscorer this season, finally got onto the scoresheet with Chelsea's hundredth goal of the season, heading in from Lampard's lofted ball. When &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAshley%20Cole"&gt;Ashley Cole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was fouled in the area by former Chelsea man &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Melchiot"&gt;Mario Melchiot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Drogba stepped up to take the penalty, scoring Chelsea's sixth. On 80 minutes, Drogba completed his hat-trick with a close-range rebound, as this became the third time Chelsea had scored seven in one game this season. Ashley Cole scored the eighth just before the end of the game with a low shot under the goalkeeper.

Chelsea captain &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Terry"&gt;John Terry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , whose private life had been the subject of intense scrutiny over the course of the season, was exuberant over the title win: "Forget everything else, this is about Chelsea Football Club and our day today. It has been a hard three years not winning the Premiership and today we deserved it. It's been hurting inside of me for three years, seeing Man United lifting it season after season." &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarlo%20Ancelotti"&gt;Carlo Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the winning manager, compared the win to that of former Chelsea manager &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Mourinho"&gt;Jose Mourinho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : "Mourinho did some fantastic work and won two titles consecutively. This is my first and I hope to do the same as Mourinho. Now we have the opportunity to win the double and I hope that my players can, after these celebrations."

<h2>Manchester United 4 – 0 Stoke</h2>

Manchester United, who were hoping for a Chelsea slip-up to stand any chance of taking the title for a fourth year in a row, still recorded a comfortable win over Stoke City.

The scoring was opened by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADarren%20Fletcher"&gt;Darren Fletcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who tapped in from close range just after the half-hour mark. Seven minutes later, experienced winger &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Giggs"&gt;Ryan Giggs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; slotted past the goalkeeper from a low &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADimitar%20Berbatov"&gt;Berbatov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; through ball. Just before half time, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Fuller"&gt;Ricardo Fuller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; forced a reflex save from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdwin%20van%20der%20Sar"&gt;van der Sar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In the second half, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Higginbotham"&gt;Higginbotham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; own goal gave Manchester United their third goal of the afternoon after a cross from striker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWanye%20Rooney"&gt;Wanye Rooney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Several shots were saved from either side, before &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APark%20Ji%20Sung"&gt;Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; made it four with a close-range header with six minutes to go.

Afterwards, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Ferguson"&gt;Sir Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spoke of his disappointment: "When we heard Wigan was down to 10 men, our hopes evaporated then. Losing this title makes you appreciate the achievement of winning the last three and also getting so near. We've got to try again."

<h2>Around the League</h2>
In other games: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hit four against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFulham%20F.C."&gt;Fulham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the London derby at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Emirates%20Stadium"&gt;the Emirates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlackburn%20Rovers%20F.C."&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; got a narrow 1–0 away win at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAston%20Villa%20F.C."&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABolton%20Wanderers%20F.C."&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; beat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%20City%20F.C."&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at home; already relegated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABurnley%20F.C."&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; managed a 4–2 victory over fourth-placed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C."&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEverton%20F.C."&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; edged &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APortsmouth%20F.C."&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 1–0 at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGoodison%20Park"&gt;Goodison Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; relegated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHull%20City%20F.C."&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; held seventh-placed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to a goalless draw; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Ham%20United%20F.C."&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; drew 1–1 with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City%20F.C."&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C."&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; beat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASunderland%20Athletic%20F.C."&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 2–1.

Back in London, Arsenal assured their third-place finish with a 4–0 victory over Fulham. Andrey Asharvin opened the scoring for Gunners in the 21st minute with strike partner Robin van Persie following 5 minutes later. Eight minutes after that, Arsenal went three clear when Chris Baird deflected the ball into his own net after Emmanuel Eboue flicked on a Theo Walcott cross. Substite Carlos Vela completed the day with a low shot in the right side of the goal.

Fourth-place Tottenham Hotspur travelled to Burnley needing win and for Arsenal to drop points to move up to third in the table. The game started brightly for the north London club, going 2-0 up on 32 minutes, with goals from &lt;a href="Gareth%20Bale"&gt;Gareth Bale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuka%20Modri%C4%87"&gt;Luka Modrić&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Just before the break, Wade Elliott slotted one home for Clarets. With Arsenal already up 3–0, the Spurs relaxed in the second half, having assured a place in European football with a victory in the mid-week. Ten minutes in Jack Cork headed home, while Martin Paterson and Steven Thompson finished of the comeback. The win moved Burley to 18th place in the table -- relegation as assured at the beginning the day -- and earned the Clarets and extra £800,000 from the Premier League in prize money. The victory was their second over a top-four club this season, winning 1–0 against Manchester United. Also earned points with draws with Manchester City and Arsenal. Burley had previously lost 5–0 at Tottenham.

Burnley manager Brian Laws addressed his future and praised club supporters after the game: "Everybody seems to question whether I'm going to be here next season, but we are planning for the future and I want to be part of that," Laws said, according the BBC. "It's a fantastic club with magnificent supporters who deserve to have another go at it in the Premier League."

Fifth-place Manchester City needed just one point to keep their spot -- having a decisive goal difference edge with sixth-place Aston Villa -- and they got the needed point with a one-all draw with West Ham. Both goals game within minutes of each other, with Luis Boa Morte putting the Hammers up with a chip in the 17th minute and four minutes later City levelled through a Sean Wright-Phillips header.

Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini praised fans in his post-match conference calling them fantastic as well as acknowledging the work of his players. "I think we played a good game and had plenty of chances to score," Mancini said. "It is important that we finished in fifth position and it is an important result for us."

Manchester City did not need the point after all was said and done, as Blackburn defeated Aston Villa at Villa Park. A late Richard Dunne own goal handed the Rovers the three points need to finish in the top half of the table.

Liverpool squeezed in the seventh-place spot, just two points above Everton. The Reds could not capitalize on Villa's defeat, though did earn a point in a goalless draw with relegation-side Hull. One of the so called "Big Four" of English football, the seventh-place finish -- while enough to qualify for the Europa League next season -- matches their lowest finish since the 1998–99 season. Since, Liverpool has always been as high as fifth and then only twice.

Assured the eighth spot at the start of the day, Everton played host to bottom-of-the table Portsmouth. American national keeper Tim Howard was denied the chance to square of against England keeper David James by Pompey manager Avram Grant, though substitute Jamie Ashdown filled in nicely. The game appeared to be headed to a goalless draw until Diniyar Bilyaletdinov slotted a goal to lift Merseyside club over the 60-point mark. Bilyaletdinov, a Russian national player, will get the distinction of scoring the last goal in the 2009–10 Premier League season.

&lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Braden"&gt;Dallas Braden&lt;/a&gt;, a left-handed pitcher for &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20Athletics"&gt;Oakland Athletics&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, became one of only nineteen players in the history of the MLB to pitch a &lt;a href="w%3Aperfect%20game"&gt;perfect game&lt;/a&gt;, in a 4-0 win against the &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%20Bay%20Rays"&gt;Tampa Bay Rays&lt;/a&gt;. Braden, aged 26, who retired all 27 batters consecutively on 109 pitches, also earned his first career &lt;a href="w%3Acomplete%20game"&gt;complete game&lt;/a&gt;. In the process of throwing the perfect game, Braden also &lt;a href="w%3Astruck%20out"&gt;struck out&lt;/a&gt; six Tampa Bay hitters.

The perfect game was the second pitched in the Athletics' franchise history, the other being thrown by &lt;a href="w%3AMLB%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; pitcher &lt;a href="w%3ACatfish%20Hunter"&gt;Catfish Hunter&lt;/a&gt; on May 8, 1968 against the &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Twins"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt;. Braden, at 26, also became the youngest pitcher to throw a complete game since &lt;a href="w%3AAnaheim%20Angels"&gt;Anaheim Angels&lt;/a&gt; pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Witt"&gt;Mike Witt&lt;/a&gt; did so at age 24 in 1984.

The low crowd at the &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%20Coliseum"&gt;Oakland Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;, at only 12,228, was due to the &lt;a href="w%3AMother%27s%20Day"&gt;Mother's Day&lt;/a&gt; holiday occurring across the United States, Braden, along with every other Major League Baseball player, donned pink equipment for awareness of breast cancer, which has become a tradition for baseball players on Mother's Day. Braden's own mother died of skin cancer when he was a senior in high school, but his grandmother attended the game.

Braden recently drew controversy in the league after publicly criticizing &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; all-star third baseman &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Rodriguez"&gt;Alex Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; for crossing the pitcher's mound after a foul ball, which Braden claimed to be an "unwritten rule" in baseball. When asked about the no hitter, Rodriguez simply responded, "Good for him, he threw a perfect game. And even better, he beat the Rays," he said, as the Rays lead the American League East division, the same division that Yankees play in.

"Mother's Day hasn't been a joyous day for me in a while. But to know that I still get to come out and compete and play a game on that day, that makes it a little better. With my grandma in the stands, that makes it a lot better. To be able to give her this today was perfect...," said Braden in a post-game interview with &lt;a href="w%3AMLB.com"&gt;MLB.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Warragul lead Traralgon early in the third quarter but were quickly over taken and convincingly beaten.

To that point in the game, the defence of both sides dominated not allowing many scoring opportunities. From the fifth minute of the third quarter, the game belonged to Traralgon.

Tim Aitkin kicked six of his nine goals in the last quarter to help Traralgon stamp their authority on the game.
Sale upset ladder leaders Maffra at home. One could have argued that Maffra's inaccurate kicking in the second half cost it the win.

In the latest developments in discussions between the Liberal Democrats and the two largest parties, &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; has announced his resignation as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister.

Gordon Brown made his statement at 5.00 pm local time in front of 10 Downing Street, London, following a meeting he had yesterday with &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANick%20Clegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party.

He stated that a strong and stable "progressive alliance" of the Labour and Liberal parties would be in the best interest of the country and made his resignation as a means to forward this, saying that he would set in motion the process needed for a new leader of the Labour Party to be selected and that a new leader will be in place in the autumn by the time of the next &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29%20Conference"&gt;Labour Party Conference&lt;/a&gt;.

However, unlike a Conservative-Liberal alliance, a Labour-Liberal one would not command a majority in Parliament. For the "progressive alliance" to have its majority, it would therefore need to bring in MPs from the smaller parties, something that both the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AScottish%20National%20Party"&gt;Scottish National Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APlaid%20Cymru"&gt;Plaid Cymru&lt;/a&gt; have stated they would be amenable to.

The current move follows the return of a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHung%20parliament"&gt;hung parliament&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdon general election on Thursday. The Liberal Democratic Party, who hold the balance of power, have been in negotiations with the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Script</h2>

In our lead story today, 

<h3>(0:33)</h3>

Following the return of a hung parliament in the United Kingdon's general election on Thursday, Gordon Brown has announced his resignation as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister.

Gordon Brown made his statement at 5.00 pm local time in front of 10 Downing Street, London, following a meeting he had yesterday with Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrat Party.

He stated that a strong and stable "progressive alliance" of the Labour and Liberal parties would be in the best interest of the country and made his resignation as a means to forward this, saying that he would set in motion the process needed for a new leader of the Labour Party to be selected and that a new leader will be in place in the autumn by the time of the next Labour Party Conference.

However, unlike a Conservative-Liberal alliance, a Labour-Liberal one would not command a majority in Parliament. For the "progressive alliance" to have its majority, it would therefore need to bring in MPs from the smaller parties.

Meanwhile, as the ground shook under the feet of UK politics, 

<h3>&lt;a href="7.2%20magnitude%20earthquake%20hits%20Indonesia"&gt;7.2 magnitude earthquake hits Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; (1:32)</h3>

a large, 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck near Sumatra, Indonesia on Sunday. 

The epicentre was 390 miles west of Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, at a depth of 28 miles according to the USGS. The tremors started at about 13.00 local time and a tsunami alert was made by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, but rescinded about an hour and a half later.

The Associated Press news agency quotes local media as saying some power lines were knocked down and some buildings damaged.

The epicentre of the earthquake was near that of 2004's magnitude 9.2 earthquake, which generated a large tsunami and killed an estimated 170,000 people. Indonesia sits atop very geologically active part of the world known as the Ring of Fire, and experiences earthquakes frequently.

Violence in India broke out again as 

<h3>&lt;a href="Landmine%20blast%20in%20Chattisgarh%2C%20India%20kills%20eight"&gt;Landmine blast in Chattisgarh, India kills eight&lt;/a&gt; (2:32)</h3>

suspected Maoist guerrillas killed eight Central Reserve Police Force soldiers in India yesterday, blowing up a police patrol in the Bijapur district of the state. It was the first major attack by Maoists in the area since 76 people were killed in an ambush incident at Dantewada.

According to the Director General of Police, the extremists detonated an improvised explosive device near Pedakodepal village, located on National Highway 16 in Bijapur, then opened fire at a security team. The driver of the vehicle was killed in the incident and one soldier was severely wounded and another missing. 

The injured are being treated in a Jagdalpur hospital.

As Russia was gearing up for Victory Day celebrations, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Multiple%20explosions%20in%20Russian%20coal%20mine%2C%20eleven%20dead"&gt;Multiple explosions in Russian coal mine, eleven dead&lt;/a&gt; (3:20)</h3>

Reports suggest methane gas was to blame for two explosions in a Russian coal mine which are thought to have left up to twelve miners dead and eighty others unaccounted for. Local officials say at least 41 miners have been injured.

Over three hundred miners were underground when the first explosion occurred just prior to midnight on Saturday night but most of them were brought safely to the surface. However, officials report that eleven miners died in the first explosion.

Around three hours later a second explosion occurred and authorities on the surface lost contact with a rescue team below. Following the second explosion, an emergency services ministry spokeswoman told the media that rescue operations had been suspended indefinitely.

Aman Tuleyev, the governor of Siberia's western Kemerovo region, has taken charge of the rescue operation. Tuleyev said the second blast had caused more injuries and destroyed the main air shaft. He also stated that there was a risk of more explosions.

The mine, owned by Russian company Raspadskaya, is the largest underground coal mine in Russia. A worker was killed after part of the mine collapsed in January 2010. The explosions come after calls for coal mines in Russia to improve their poor safety records.

Despite the trajedy, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Russia%20celebrates%20Victory%20Day"&gt;Russia celebrates Victory Day&lt;/a&gt; (4:47)</h3>

Russia yesterday celebrated Victory Day, to commemorate the 65th anniversary since Nazi Germany surrendered, thus ending the Second World War in Europe.

In a first for the annual celebrations, soldiers from other countries joined in the parade, including those from former Soviet allies in the war: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Poland.

Media reports describe the events as being among the most elaborate since the Soviet Union fell apart two decades ago. Anti-aircraft rockets, mobile howitzers, and missiles rolled through Red Square, and 150 airplanes and helicopters performed a flyover shortly thereafter.

Finally, in sports, 

<h3>(5:29)</h3>

Traralgon remain the only undefeated team after five rounds of the 2010 Gippsland Football League season after they defeated Warragul by seventy points and Sale defeated Maffra by one point. Warragul remain the only team without a win.

Warragul lead Traralgon early in the third quarter but were quickly over taken and convincingly beaten.

To that point in the game, the defence of both sides dominated not allowing many scoring opportunities. From the fifth minute of the third quarter, the game belonged to Traralgon.

Tim Aitkin kicked six of his nine goals in the last quarter to help Traralgon stamp their authority on the game.

<h3>&lt;a href="Oakland%20A%27s%20pitcher%20Dallas%20Braden%20throws%20perfect%20game"&gt;Oakland A's pitcher Dallas Braden throws perfect game&lt;/a&gt; (6:29)</h3>

Dallas Braden, a left-handed pitcher for Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics, became one of only nineteen players in the history of the league to pitch a perfect game, in a 4-0 win against the Tampa Bay Rays. Braden, aged 26, who retired all 27 batters consecutively on 109 pitches, also earned his first career complete game. In the process of throwing the perfect game, Braden also struck out six Tampa Bay hitters.

The perfect game was the second pitched in the Athletics' franchise history, the other being thrown by Hall of Fame pitcher Catfish Hunter on May 8, 1968 against the Minnesota Twins. Braden, at 26, also became the youngest pitcher to throw a complete game since Anaheim Angels pitcher Mike Witt did so at age 24 in 1984.

Due to the Mother's Day holiday occurring across the United States, attendance at the Oakland Coliseum was only 12,228 fans, but Braden's grandmother was in attendance. Braden, along with every other Major League Baseball player, donned pink equipment for awareness of breast cancer, which has become a tradition for baseball players on Mother's Day. Braden's own mother died of skin cancer when he was a senior in high school

Braden recently drew controversy in the league after publicly criticizing New York Yankees all-star third baseman Alex Rodriguez for crossing the pitcher's mound after a foul ball, which Braden claimed to be an "unwritten rule" in baseball. When asked about the no hitter, Rodriguez simply responded, "Good for him, he threw a perfect game. And even better, he beat the Rays". The Rays lead the American League East division, the same division that Yankees play in.

<h2>On this day in history (8:18)</h2>

In 1893, The Supreme Court of the United States rules in Nix v. Hedden that a tomato is a vegetable, not a fruit under the Tariff Act of 1883. 

The Tariff Act required a tax to be paid on imported vegetables, but not fruit and the case was an attempt by the Nix family to recover back duties paid under protest to Edward L. Hedden, the Collector of the Port of New York. 

Botanically, a tomato is a fruit, however, the court unanimously ruled in favor of the defendant stating that the Tariff Act used the ordinary meaning of the words "fruit" and "vegetable" – where a tomato is classified as a vegetable – not the technical botanical meaning.

Nix has been cited in three Supreme Court decisions as a precedent for court interpretation of common meanings, especially dictionary definitions, and in 2005, supporters in the New Jersey legislature cited Nix as a basis for a bill designating the tomato as the official state vegetable.

&lt;a href="David%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; was today appointed the new &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;. This follows five days of negotiation after the May 6 general election resulted in a &lt;a href="w%3Ahung%20parliament"&gt;hung parliament&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20and%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; won the largest number of seats, they lacked enough for a majority government, and will consequently form a coalition with the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, who took the third-largest number. The agreement induces &lt;a href="Nick%20Clegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt;, Liberal Democrat leader, becoming Deputy Prime Minister, five Cabinet seats for Liberal Democrat members and a compromise between policies.

Cameron, at 43, is the youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812, and had only been a Member of Parliament for nine years prior to taking the most senior political office in the country. He is the twelfth Prime Minister of the reign of &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20II"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;. The post-election negotiations see the end of thirteen years of &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; rule beginning with the victory of &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; in 1997.

Earlier today Cameron's predecessor &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, recently resigned as leader of the Labour Party, officially stood down from office with immediate effect. The news followed the in which he declared he was standing down to secure a coalition for Labour and other parties and avoid a Conservative government.

In a speech outside &lt;a href="w%3A10%20Downing%20Street"&gt;10 Downing Street&lt;/a&gt;, following his initial statement, Brown admitted he had "learned a lot about human frailties, including [his] own", and thanked the armed forces, his wife, &lt;a href="w%3ASarah%20Brown%20%28wife%20of%20Gordon%20Brown%29"&gt;Sarah&lt;/a&gt;, his family and staff before wishing the new Prime Minister well.

The possibility of a Labour-LibDem parliament was ruled out as negotiations between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats drew to a close. Brown was officially relieved of his role as Prime Minister by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3AHarriet%20Harman"&gt;Harriet Harman&lt;/a&gt;, who has been deputy leader of the Labour Party since 2007, will stand in temporarily as acting Labour party leader and &lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;leader of the opposition&lt;/a&gt;. David Cameron arrived at Buckingham Palace at about 20:10 British Summer Time (1910 UTC) and was asked by the Queen to form a new government.

Today on Wikinews : David Cameron becomes the UK's youngest Prime Minister since 1812, Iraq sees its deadliest day of violence this year and Constantinople changes its name ... but not to what you think.

Today is Tuesday, May 11th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>(0:29)</h3>

David Cameron was today sworn in as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, following five days of negotiation after the British General Election resulted in a hung parliament. While the Conservatives were the largest party, they did not have enough seats to meet the threshold for majority rule, and so formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. In the agreement, Nick Clegg, leader of the LibDems, will become the Deputy Prime minister.

Cameron, at 43, is the youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812, after accepting the Queen's invitation to form a government. He is the 12th Prime Minister to be confirmed by Queen Elizabeth II. He had only been a Member of Parliament for nine years before this. This resolution represents the end to thirteen years of Labour rule, starting with Tony Blair in 1997.

Earlier today, Gordon Brown, former leader of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, officially stood down from his role with immediate effect. The news followed the initial announcement yesterday in which he declared he was standing down to secure a coalition for Labour and other parties and avoid a Conservative government.

In a speech outside 10 Downing Street, following his initial statement, he admitted he had "learned a lot about human frailties, including [his] own", and thanked the armed forces, his wife, family and staff before wishing the new Prime Minister well.

According to The Guardian, Harriet Harman will stand in temporarily as party leader as Brown is officially relieved of his title by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. The possibility of a Labour-LibDem parliament was ruled out as negotiations between the Tories and the Liberal Democrats drew to a close, with Brown handing power over to Cameron in a meeting with the Queen at around 20.00 BST.

<h3>&lt;a href="Attacks%20in%20Iraq%20kill%20over%20100"&gt;Attacks in Iraq kill over 100&lt;/a&gt; (2:20)</h3>

Several attacks in three different parts of Iraq on Monday killed over 100 people and injured almost 350 more, making it the deadliest day in the country this year.

Early on Monday morning, attacks with automatic weapons against six army and police checkpoints in the city of Baghdad killed seven police officers, with three other bombings in the city killing another two policemen. An official from Iraq's interior ministry said that the attacks in Baghdad began at around 0630 local time (0330 UTC), not ending until around 0800 local time (0500 UTC). The official also said that most of those wounded were security personnel.

At around 1330 local time (1030 UTC), three car bombs exploded in the city of Hilla outside a textiles factory; the bombings came as workers were leaving the factory, which increased the death toll. An hour later, with emergency responders on the scene, a fourth car bomb exploded. In total, 50 people were killed in the four explosions. A factory worker said that "[w]hen I heard the explosions, I rushed outside and saw the massive damage--there were bodies everywhere, people were crying and screaming."

In the southern city of Basra, three separate car bombs in two locations occurred between 1800 and 1900 local time (1500 to 1600 UTC). The attacks were at two markets in central Basra, and killed a total of around 20 people.

Another car bombing in the city of Suwayrah, around 40 miles southeast of Baghdad, killed 11 people and wounded 70 more. According to a police official in the city, there were two bombings, both near the city's mosque.

According to a government spokesman in Baghdad, more than 20 total attacks occurred in the country, and were targeted at both the military and civilians. The attacks are also seen as emphasizing the ability of insurgent groups in Iraq to continue to be able to attack on a large scale, despite government efforts to increase security in the country, as well as the killings and arrests of numerous extremist leaders in recent months.

<h2>On this day in history (4:28)</h2>

In the year 330, Byzantium is renamed Nova Roma during a dedication ceremony, but it is more popularly referred to as Constantinople. Why'd they change it? I can't say. People just liked it better that way.

Tuesday saw Colonel &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Ethell"&gt;Donald Ethell&lt;/a&gt; assume the post of provincial &lt;a href="w%3ALieutenant%20Governor%20%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Lieutenant Governor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AEdmonton"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt;, capital of &lt;a href="Alberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. The swearing-in ceremony took place at Edmonton's Legislative Building, with the retired colonel inspecting the guard afterwards. As is traditional, the taking of the oath of office was accompanied by a fifteen-gun salute.
The 72-year-old decorated war veteran assumes the post from &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%20Kwong"&gt;Norman Kwong&lt;/a&gt;, who served from January 20 in 1995. &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; announced the appointment last Thursday.

Ethell has served Canada, with distinction, spending 38 years in the armed forces, and involved in over fourteen peacekeeping missions. "I can assure you that I will not be stuffy and aloof just because I've got a whole lot of medals on my shoulder", said Ethell ().

Alongside his military medals, the new Lieutenant Governor is a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20Canada"&gt;Order of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta%20Order%20of%20Excellence"&gt;Alberta Order of Excellence&lt;/a&gt;, and the Order of St. John. "I'm very grateful for the opportunities that were presented to me by the military. It was shape up or get out. And that's exactly what I did." said Ethell. a believer in second chances. He was known as a leading &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;]' Peacekeeping diplomat, and in later years with the Canadian Association of Veterans.

Alberta &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Stelmech"&gt;Ed Stelmech&lt;/a&gt; said, "[h]is Honour's compassion and dedication to the well-being of his fellow citizens has been a constant. Those traits are the hallmark of Albertans and will guide him well in his work on their behalf."

The first Lieutenant Governor of Alberta was sworn in during 1905, as Alberta became a province of Canada. Ethell is the seventeenth holder of the office.

"Colonel Ethell has had a distinguished career in the Canadian Armed Forces and as a humanitarian. He is one of Canada’s most decorated soldiers as well as a champion for veterans and the welfare of those in the world's most vulnerable nations.” said Harper.

<h1>US Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan meets with senators on Capitol Hill</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Supreme%20Court%20nominee%20Elena%20Kagan%20meets%20with%20senators%20on%20Capitol%20Hill&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

It is currently unclear what the meetings mean for Kagan: Senator James Inhofe (R-&lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;) guessed that around half of the Senate's 100 members already have strong opinions about the nominee. Some Republicans are worried about her move to block military recruiters from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's campus to protest the federal "&lt;a href="Don%27t%20ask%2C%20don%27t%20tell"&gt;Don't ask&lt;/a&gt;" policy against openly gay and lesbian members of the US military. Kagan's background is also of concern to some. If confirmed, she would be the first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Justices%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US Supreme Court Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; without ever having held a judicial position in 38 years. Kagan, currently the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Solicitor%20General"&gt;US Solicitor General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , spent much of her early career as a professor of law and the dean of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20School"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . She was previously nominated for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Court%20of%20Appeals"&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; Circuit in 1999, but the nomination was unsuccessful.

However, the nominee is also gathering support from both Republicans and Democrats. Despite her controversial decision at Harvard, Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Brown"&gt;Scott Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (R-&lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;) said Thursday that he found Kagan to support the military, after meeting with her. In addition, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Collins"&gt;Susan Collins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (R-&lt;a href="Maine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;) said that she does not believe Kagan's "lack of judicial experience in any way disqualifies her" to the position. Neither Senator, however, has committed to supporting Kagan yet, choosing to wait until after confirmation hearings finish this summer. On the other hand, the ♡❤&lt;a href="Washington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ estimates that Kagan will pass the Senate, if only because of the Democratic majority that currently exists there. Most, if not all Democrats are expected to vote for Kagan.

The 50-year-old lawyer was nominated to the highest court in the United States by President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, after current Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;John Paul Stevens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced his retirement earlier. Kagan is seen as a moderate, having been criticized by both &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aleft-wing"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aright-wing"&gt;right-wing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; politicians, although "she's identified with the American liberal position", according to Sessions.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Over%20100%20dead%20in%20Libyan%20plane%20crash"&gt;Over 100 dead in Libyan plane crash&lt;/a&gt; (0:38)</h3>

An Afriqiyah Airways-owned airplane, originating from South Africa, crashed on approach to Tripoli International Airport in Libya at around 06:00 Eastern European time. Initial reports indicated everyone on board died, which officials say is 93 passengers and 11 crew, but later developments say an eight-year-old boy was the sole survivor.

The plane left Johannesburg in South Africa with the aim of transferring at Tripoli before heading to the final destination, United Kingdom's London Gatwick Airport. Officials have ruled out terrorism as a cause of the crash, which is still undetermined. A security official said the plane "exploded on landing and totally disintegrated."

Terrorism has been suspected in Chile where 

<h3>&lt;a href="Explosives%20investigation%20at%20US%20Embassy%20in%20Chile%3B%20Pakistani%20man%20detained"&gt;Explosives investigation at US Embassy in Chile; Pakistani man detained&lt;/a&gt; (1:23)</h3>

a Pakistani man, identified as Muhammad Saif-ur-Rehman Khan, 28, was arrested in Chile on Monday after he was found with traces of explosives in the US Embassy.

Chilean police say that traces of Tetryl, used to help detonate explosives, were detected. Yesterday a judge ordered Khan's continued detention under anti-terrorism laws. It has been reported that Khan was in Chile for four months, and was called to the embassy to be told that his visa for the US had been revoked. A US official declined to give the reason behind the decision, saying only that "[we] are required to notify individuals when we take that action and we invited him in."

Khan spoke briefly to Chilean journalists and denied he was a terrorist or that he was handling explosives.

This is not the first incident involving explosives at the US Embassy in Santiago; after the September 11 attacks of 2001, the embassy was sent a letter bomb that was defused.

Unrelated to the events in Chile, 

<h3>&lt;a href="At%20least%20fourteen%20dead%20in%20Pakistan%20after%20drone%20strikes"&gt;At least fourteen dead in Pakistan after drone strikes&lt;/a&gt; (2:30)</h3>

at least fourteen people in Pakistan's North Waziristan region have been killed in drone strikes earlier today by suspected US unmanned aircraft.

The attacks happened in a village located near the Afghanistan border; as many as eighteen missiles were fired at targets, according to security authorities. A local intelligence official said that "Three missiles hit a vehicle and three militants sitting in it were killed."

A nearby compound used by rebels was also attacked with around a dozen missiles fired by drones. The dead in that attack are alleged to have been fighters. A reporter for Al Jazeera says the strikes lasted from twenty to 25 minutes.

As US drone strikes continue in Pakistan, 

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20Secretary%20of%20State%20Hillary%20Clinton%20pledges%20support%20for%20Afghanistan"&gt;US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledges support for Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; (3:12)</h3>

United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in remarks made at a meeting with officials from Afghanistan, said that the US would continue to support Afghanistan even after the withdrawal of US troops from the country next summer.

Clinton made her statements at the beginning of a meeting between US and Afghan officials in Washington DC to forge a plan on how to handle the conflict with the Taliban in the future. The talks are intended to mend some of the disagreements between the governments of the two countries, which have been in conflict with each other in the past; the US has claimed the Afghan government is corrupt and Afghan president Hamid Karzai has accused the US of giving his government insufficient support.

In her speech, Clinton played down concerns that a sudden US exit from Afghanistan could lead to the Afghan government forging agreements with the Taliban in response, an action that has been threatened by Karzai.

Clinton stated that the US "will not abandon the Afghan people," and that "Our civilian commitment will remain long into the future." Karzai, in his statements, acknowledged differences between the two governments, saying that "As two mature nations and two mature governments ... we will be having disagreements from time to time." Even as they acknowledged differences in views, both Clinton and Karzai stressed the accomplishments both countries have achieved.

Finally, while there has been political strains between the US and Afghanistan, on 

<h3>&lt;a href="New%20Albertan%20Lieutenant%20Governor%20takes%20office"&gt;New Albertan Lieutenant Governor takes office&lt;/a&gt; (4:39)</h3>

Tuesday, Colonel Donald Ethell assumed the post of provincial Lieutenant Governor in Edmonton, capital of Alberta, Canada. The swearing-in ceremony took place at Edmonton's Legislative Building, with the retired colonel inspecting the guard afterwards. As is traditional, the taking of the oath of office was accompanied by a fifteen-gun salute.

The 72-year-old decorated war veteran assumes the post from Norman Kwong, who served from January 20 in 1995. Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the appointment last Thursday.

Ethell has served Canada with distinction, spending 38 years in the armed forces, and was involved in over fourteen peacekeeping missions. His honors include being a member of the Order of Canada, the Alberta Order of Excellence, and the Order of St. John. He is known as a leading United Nations' Peacekeeping diplomat, and in later years has been part of the Canadian Association of Veterans.

The first Lieutenant Governor of Alberta was sworn in during 1905, as Alberta became a province of Canada. Ethell is the seventeenth holder of the office.

In 1884, the Czech composer Bedrich Smetana, died in an asylum in Prague. 

Smetana was seen as a pioneer in the development of a musical style which became closely identified with his country's aspirations to independent statehood and he is widely regarded in his homeland as the father of Czech music. Internationally he is best known for his opera The Bartered Bride, and for the symphonic cycle "My Fatherland" which portrays the history, legends and landscape of the composer's native land.

Smetana was naturally gifted as a pianist, and gave his first public performance at the age of six and wrote his first piece of nationalistic music during the 1848 Prague uprising, in which he briefly participated.

During the liberal political climate in his country during the 1860's, he threw himself into the musical life of Prague, primarily as a champion of the new genre of Czech opera. His first two operas, The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride premiered in 1866, the latter achieving great popularity. 

That same year, he became Prague's new Provisional Theatre principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner at odds to the development of a distinctively Czech opera style. 

Smetana soon became ill and a throat infection was followed by a rash and an apparent blockage to the ears which soon rendered him deaf A press announcement stated that Smetana had "become ill as a result of nervous strain caused by certain people". Soon after, he reluctantly accepted an annual pension of 1,200 gulden and resigned as principal conductor due to his health problems. 

It was after this event in his life which he had begun a cycle of six symphonic poems called "My Fatherland" as well as other major works which cemented his reputation as the principal exponent of Czech national music.

However, in 1879, Smetana had written to a friend revealing fears of the onset of madness. By the winter of 1882–83 he was experiencing depression, insomnia, and hallucinations, together with giddiness, cramp and a temporary loss of speech. In October 1883 his behavior at a private reception in Prague disturbed his friends and by the middle of February 1884 he had ceased to be coherent, and was periodically violent. On 23 April his family, unable to nurse him any longer, removed him to a lunatic asylum in Prague, where he died on 12 May 1884.

According to musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism, and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have tended to affect the objectivity with which his work has been assessed, particularly in his native land.

Though in his own homeland the general public was slow to recognize Smetana and he had been twice married, lost three daughters in infancy, and eventually went mad, he laid the groundwork for the flowering of Czech music, paving the way for the even more famous Antonín Dvorák.

Wikinews reporter Iain Macdonald has performed an interview with Dr Isabella Margara, a &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-based member of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Greece"&gt;Communist Party of Greece&lt;/a&gt; (KKE). In the interview Margara sets out the communist response to current events in &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; as well as discussing the viability of a communist economy for the nation. She also hit back at Petros Tzomakas, a member of another Greek far-left party which criticised KKE in a previous interview.

The interview comes amid tensions in cash-strapped Greece, where the government is introducing controversial austerity measures to try to ease the nation's debt-problem. An international rescue package has been prepared by &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; member states and the &lt;a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; should Greece require a bailout; protests have been held against government attempts to manage the economic situation.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iain Macdonald&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡ Has slavish pursuit of free-market capitalism been the cause of Europe, and particularly Greece's, economic woes?♡❤♡

What we are experiencing today – not only in Greece, but in all capitalist countries – is a crisis of overproduction. The exploitation of the working class and the other popular &lt;a href="wikt%3Astrata"&gt;strata&lt;/a&gt; is intensified due to the fact that the bourgeoisie has been keeping for itself larger and larger parts of the produced wealth. Behind overproduction lies the over-accumulation of capital. The average profit rate is decreased in the main sectors of the economy. This leads to destruction of part of productive forces, closing factories, inflation, mass redundancies of superfluous workers as waste – in order to permit a new process of accumulation to begin, when new sectors of the economy will secure the increase of the average profit rate. This has nothing to do with the ‘management’ of the system by social democrats or liberals; it is an inevitable outcome of capitalism.

The national deficits do exist. In fact, behind the debt are the huge tax reliefs for large monopolies, the massive bank bailouts, the inconceivable &lt;a href="NATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; military expenses, the subsidies in the name of capitalist development. In Greece at the moment, there is a clear expression of the imperialist rivalries between the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and EU, between EU countries and especially between &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is now becoming clearer every day that the ruling class is using the existing deficits, in Greece and in Europe, in order to promote new anti-labour policies which will secure the profits of the capital. These measures have been pre-decided a long time ago in the &lt;a href="w%3AMaastricht%20Treaty"&gt;Maastricht Treaty&lt;/a&gt; and are here to stay. Their aim is not just to exit the crisis, but to ensure stability and high profits for the capital in the next phases of the economic cycle.
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡ How, given the &lt;a href="w%3Acollapse%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet collapse&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; being communist in name only, would your vision of a communist system have been better for the majority of citizens?♡❤♡

Despite the various problems of socialist countries, the socialist system of the 20 century proved the superiority of socialism over capitalism and the huge advantages that it provides for peoples’ lives and working conditions. The Soviet Union and the world socialist system constituted the only real counterweight to imperialist aggression – we recently celebrated the 65th anniversary of the Anti-fascist victory. The achievements of workers in the socialist states were a point of reference for many decades and contributed to the gains won by the working class in capitalist societies as well. In this way, everyone had guaranteed work, public free health care and education, housing, and access to intellectual and cultural creativity. The complete eradication of the terrible legacy of illiteracy, in combination with the increase in the general level of education and specialization and the abolition of unemployment, constitute unique achievements of socialism. In the Soviet Union in 1975 it was guaranteed by law that the hours of work could not surpass 41 per week, among the lowest in the world. All workers were guaranteed days for rest and relaxation and annual paid holidays. Non-working time was extended and its content was changed. It was transformed into time for the development of the cultural and educational level of the workers, for the enhancement of their participation in workers’ power and in the control of the administration of productive units. Social Security for working people was of utmost priority for the socialist state. A comprehensive system of retirement benefits, with the important achievement of low age limits for retirement (55 years for women, 60 for men), was created. Socialist power laid the foundation for the abolition of inequality of women, overcoming the great difficulties that objectively existed. Socialism ensured in practice the social character of motherhood and socialized childcare. It instituted equal rights for women and men in the economic, political and cultural realm, although not all forms of unequal relations between the two genders, which had become entrenched over a long period of time, had been successfully eradicated.

Our critical approach regarding various issues of building socialism in the USSR, namely decisions in the economy in critical times, or the extend of workers’ control and participation, do not change the fact that the first historical attempt to abolish the exploitation of man by man had many achievements for the majority of people and many of the rights that Soviet people had in 1975 seem like a dream for us today. Also, it does not change the fact that the contradictions of the capitalist way of production become deeper. The counter-revolution may have won one fight, but it has not won the war. As long as there is socialised production combined with capitalist property of the means of production, there will be crisis, unemployment and poverty – and socialism will remain the only way out.

Our Party in 2009 held its 18th Congress, during which we discussed and studied socialism and the causes of counter-revolution in the USSR. The conclusions we drew have been published and we have enriched our programme based on them. See &lt;a href="http%3A//inter.kke.gr/News/2009news/18congres-resolution-2nd"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡ For right or for wrong, we have now reached a situation where Greece is on the brink of an international bailout. If you were given power tomorrow, what steps would you take immediately to get Greece back on track?♡❤♡

At the moment we are trying to build a front of workers, small farmers, the self-employed and working young people. This front needs to become a huge social and political anti-imperialist anti-monopoly coalition with only one duty - to bring the working class into power and socialise the basic means of production, namely energy, telecommunications, mines, manufacturing, and transportation. We would implement public and free education, health and national insurance systems. Next to the socialised sectors, there can be the co-operatives of small farmers and small tradesmen in sectors of the economy where concentration is still low. The production and distribution in both the socialised and the co-operative sectors will be under workers’ control as part of a centrally planned economy. This is a vital need in order to fulfil our contemporary needs, in order to ensure that all productive forces are mobilised, that science and technology will develop in favour of the people, and that all international economic co-operation will be used, on the basis of mutual benefit. The government, which will be the organ of the popular power, will have to ensure the participation of the people in building this new society. The debt is due to the power of monopolies. There will be no solution if the capitalist profits remain untouchable, if we don’t disengage from EU and NATO, if the capitalists continue to rule at the expense of the working class.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡ Why do you oppose the current austerity measures? What has the government, in your view, got so wrong?♡❤♡

Massive and drastic cuts to public and private sector salaries and pensions, further cuts of benefits, reduced overtime payments, increase of the VAT up to 23%, increase of the indirect taxes, abolishment of collective labour agreements, massive redundancies to public services and merges, right of unrestricted redundancies to private companies, and increases to the retirement age: Huge masses will be condemned to unemployment and extreme poverty. Health and Education will become a privilege only for a small minority. The recovery phase will lead to new concentration of wealth to the capital, to an increase in the degree of exploitation. The recovery, when it happens, will not have a positive impact on the people on one hand, and will lead relatively soon to a new crisis on the other. That is why we oppose the measures.

That is also why the working class should not be trapped in a discussion about bonds or interest rates, the simple reason being that it has nothing to gain from this discussion. The international loans will end up in the capital’s pockets, not the working class. The Greeks have suffered when the rates were down, they suffer now that the rates are up. We do not intend to share the capital's 'anxiety' about the &lt;a href="wikt%3Abourse"&gt;bourse&lt;/a&gt;, because it is becoming clearer every day that if &lt;a href="w%3Aplutocracy"&gt;plutocracy&lt;/a&gt; does not go bankrupt, then the people will.

The government is not doing anything wrong – in fact, it is doing a great job representing the interests of its bosses, the Greek capitalists, the imperialists of E.U., the I.M.F. But they want the working class partners to their crime. They are telling us that our sacrifice to live in poverty and work until we die is our patriotic duty. What they are not telling us is that the workers, the farmers, the owners of small shops; we do not have the same country as these E.U. fans of the &lt;a href="w%3AHellenic%20Federation%20of%20Enterprises"&gt;Hellenic Federation of Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, the City-educated bankers, the corporate media owners. Their country and their god is exploitation and profit. Our people have proven their patriotism in every single crucial point in history for thousands of years now. But this case is different, the working Greek man and women should not make any sacrifices for plutocracy! The only ‘sacrifice’ that should be made is to fight the dangerous fear and hesitation and organise the struggle. That’s what will help our own country and our class.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡ I have heard that people in Greece are upset that the euro has weakened Greece’s economic position, as the &lt;a href="w%3ADrachma"&gt;Drachma&lt;/a&gt;’s low value actually encouraged spending by foreigners. What steps would a socialist government take to encourage new spending in Greece by both foreign tourists and investors?♡❤♡

As mentioned earlier, since the agreements signed within the EU do not allow for manoeuvres in favour of the people, our disengagement would be inevitable and would be an essential term in order to plan the economy based on how we will fulfil our contemporary needs. The currency itself is not the main issue.

Tourism is another sector of the economy whose fate depends again on who owns the means of production. Only with a different economy the country will develop the infrastructures and provide quality services that will first of all guarantee decent working conditions, will be accessible to all the population and will be cheap.

So far, the development of Greek tourism has been based on profit. Therefore, the fees for ships and other means of transport are outrageous; many islands are left with no regular connection with the mainland because these lines are not considered to be profitable. Both PASOK &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APanhellenic%20Socialist%20Movement"&gt;Panhellenic Socialist Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and ND &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democracy"&gt;New Democracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; governments, under the EU guidance, have implemented policies that led to rough working conditions and wages in tourism. Besides, more than 60% of Greeks at the moment cannot go on any holiday and after the latest measures these numbers will increase; another significant portion reduces the time off work, and a third one relies on the hospitality of friends and family for their holidays, due to their low income.

For us, tourism and holidays are not a trade, they are a social right – for both the Greek workers and the tourists that will choose to visit our country. 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡How do you respond to the assertion that 'democracy is the least-worst of all the political systems tried'? Would the Greek communists accept a multi-party system where some parties would be stridently advocating free-market economics?♡❤♡

Democracy is not synonymous with the number of parties that exist in a country. For example, today in Greece we have dozens of political parties but despite the fact that the vast majority of the population opposes the austerity measures, the Parties that have the majority support them. How is that democratic? Nearly all strikes in Greece over the last decade have been declared illegal by the bourgeois court. In the workplace, there is no other law but the law of the employer.

In the process of building an anti-imperialist anti-monopoly Front, there will be a social coalition of the small farmers, the self employed, or other poor popular strata that will follow the working class since that will be their objective interest. Besides, people’s power is the real democracy, since capitalists and monopolies do not exist: it’s the democracy which is guaranteed by the direct political action of millions of people – in their workplaces, in their industrial units, in their neighbourhoods, in their popular organisations.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡How would you respond to allegations that the recent protest from the &lt;a href="w%3AAcropolis%20of%20Athens"&gt;Acropolis&lt;/a&gt; was not appropriate for a historic monument?♡❤♡

The Acropolis is more than a touristic attraction. For the Greek people, it is a symbol of hope and dignity. KKE made this symbolic demonstration in order to emphasize that the attack against the Greek working class is a preview of the attack that follows to the other European people. And that the struggle of the Greek working class is indeed at the moment a struggle that gives hope to all the peoples abroad, who suffer the same. From that point of view, our demonstration not only was not inappropriate, but actually highlighted the true meaning of the monument. And judging by the impact this symbolic occupation had, I would think it has been very successful as well!

Those who accuse us of ‘blasphemy’ are those who have been shamelessly privatising most historic and archaeological monuments in Greece during the last decades. In 1992, &lt;a href="w%3ACoca%20Cola"&gt;Coca Cola&lt;/a&gt; used the Acropolis for a commercial, where the monument was built on bottles instead of columns! &lt;a href="w%3ASamsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; recently filmed its own commercial, let alone the various fashion shows that take place there. They have been selling out our beaches and forests to touristic monopolies and have been offering the monuments in order to promote commercial products – and that is not considered to be inappropriate. They accuse us of undermining tourism – in fact all visitors had free entry to Acropolis on that day!

A few days ago, being annoyed by the fact that the seamen prevented the strike breaking in a cruise ship, the bourgeoisie and its journalists accused the seamen of anti-patriotism for attacking tourism which is ‘the only thing we have left’. They even encouraged the government to ban the organisation of strikes. Despite the media efforts to turn even the tourists against the seamen, the majority of travellers expressed their solidarity to the strike. Their problem is not the historical meaning of Acropolis or tourism, their problem is organised struggle.

We have said it before and we'll say it again: the images broadcast by the media of our struggle are an honour for the working people of our country. 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡How would you respond to the criticisms levelled by Petros Tzomakas of Xekinima, who denounced the KKE's lack of co-operation with SYRIZA &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20of%20the%20Radical%20Left"&gt;Coalition of the Radical Left&lt;/a&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in a recent interview?♡❤♡

SYRIZA are the tail of social democracy in Greece. Their analysis on the crisis is similar to PASOK. According to them, the way out is a more ‘human capitalism’, where ‘people will come first’ and profits will follow. What they are hiding from the people is that capitalist profits cannot co-exist with pro-popular policies, the basic contradiction between capital and labour cannot be overcome.

SYRIZA, being consistently pro-E.U. (it has voted for the Maastricht treaty after all), prefers the implementation of the same measures by the E.U. rather than the IMF and fights for different versions of the ‘&lt;a href="w%3AStability%20Pact"&gt;Stability Pact&lt;/a&gt;’. As if the E.U. is the good cop and the IMF the bad one. We say: this is a fake dilemma; there is no good or bad imperialism. All of them are good for serving their own monopolies, their own fat cats. The bottom line is that there is increasing antagonism between the different imperialist centres and the Greek government is trying to play the game with all of them. KKE has warned that this leads to our even deeper involvement in the inter-imperialist rivalries, and this can be a very dangerous path. They all agree 100% on the measures taken by the government and they ask for more blood now. Contrary to the party of Syriza, we do not plan to choose our assassin or negotiate the terms of the assassination with any of them.

It is also important to notice that for years now, in the trade union movement and during the latest strikes and rallies, SYRIZA has been following the compromised leaderships of GSEE &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Confederation%20of%20Greek%20Workers"&gt;w:General Confederation of Greek Workers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and ADEDY (the Greek &lt;a href="w%3ATUC"&gt;TUC&lt;/a&gt; in the private and public sector respectively, controlled by PASOK) who originally boycotted the strikes, went on strike breaking and then dragged them in unwillingly under public pressure, in order to minimise the damage to the government. 

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡I notice that the KKE is seeking to distance itself from the recent deaths in Athens. Are the people responsible completely wrong in their actions, or can you sympathise with their anger? Do you believe they should be prosecuted?♡❤♡

The burning of the bank at Stadiou Avenue by ‘anarchist’ provocation groups, which led to the death of three people, is clearly a crime and a provocation aiming at the intimidation of the people and the defamation of the struggle. It proves that the mechanisms of this system are ruthless when it comes to attacking the popular movement. Both the Greek as well as the international movement have had similar experiences in the past. Do you remember the bomb at Chicago’s Heymarket after the demo for the 8-hour workday in 1886, for which the pioneers of that movement were sentenced to death? Or the arson of the German parliament by the fascists, which allowed them to unleash the chase against the communists? Even the large scale provocations of today that are used in order to justify the ‘preventive wars’...

The question we urge people to ask themselves in order to understand why this happened is: who benefited from these actions? Clearly, it was the supporters of the anti-popular measures, all those who are scared by the huge numbers of working people who participated in the protests: the capitalists. Since they are the ones who are really responsible for the deaths, we have no illusions that they are going to be prosecuted. The main thing is that the Greek workers have got enough experience now and can differentiate between massive, organised and protected political struggle and isolated, criminal provocations that cause innocent victims, intimidate the people and at the end of the day, only facilitate the monopolies’ goals.

&lt;a href="w%3AViswanathan%20Anand"&gt;Viswanathan Anand&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="chess"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; grandmaster from &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, has retained the world championship title after a match with &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n challenger &lt;a href="w%3AVeselin%20Topalov"&gt;Veselin Topalov&lt;/a&gt;.

The match, consisting of a dozen games, was played in the Bulgarian capital Sofia over the last twenty days. Anand received the first-place prize of 1.2 million euro, whilst Topalov took 800,000 euro. The awards ceremony was attended yesterday by the Bulgarian prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3ABoyko%20Borisov"&gt;Boyko Borisov&lt;/a&gt;, and the international chess federation &lt;a href="w%3AFIDE"&gt;FIDE&lt;/a&gt;'s president &lt;a href="w%3AKirsan%20Ilyumzhinov"&gt;Kirsan Ilyumzhinov&lt;/a&gt;.

Going into the last game, both sides had two wins apiece, and seven draws. However, the Bulgarian's manager, Silvio Danailov, told the &lt;a href="w%3ADnevnik"&gt;Dnevnik&lt;/a&gt; that Topalov played the last game "rather nervously", saying: "A draw would have been a good result for him but he made a few mistakes and the Indian exploited them.

"We should concentrate on the positive sides of the match. This was a historic match for Bulgaria. The country was in the spotlight for millions of people worldwide who love the game. We should be happy and proud that we organised this event."

Today on Wikinews : Madagascar’s leader Andry Rajoelina decides not to run in this years elections, Russia agrees to build a Turkish nuclear power plant, the UK does away with "the Bin Laden" problem, wikinews reporter Iain Macdonald interviews Dr Isabella Margara of Greece's Communist Party and in history, the Great Comet of 1861 makes its dazzling debut.

Today is Thursday, May 13th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Madagascar%E2%80%99s%20leader%20Andry%20Rajoelina%20%E2%80%98will%20not%20run%20in%20polls%E2%80%99"&gt;Madagascar’s leader Andry Rajoelina ‘will not run in polls’&lt;/a&gt; (0:40)</h3>

Andry Rajoelina, the leader of Madagascar, has announced that he will not run in elections due to be held later this year. He stated his reasons as an attempt to end the country’s political crisis.

The crisis began in early 2009 when Rajoelina ousted then president Marc Ravalomanana in a military coup on March 17th. After the coup, Norway and the US froze all non-humanitarian aid to Madagascar, whilst the African Union suspended Madagascar's membership. The South African Development Community (SADC) stated that it "completely rejected the legitimacy" of the new president. 

After the coup, Rajoelina named Colonel Camille Albert Vital, a high-ranking army officer, as the country's new prime minister and announced he was abandoning a power-sharing deal with opposition leaders thus blocking Eugene Mangalaza who was supposed to become prime minister under the deal.

Rajoelina announced his decision on television saying he declares in the name of the superior interest of the nation and of the people, his decision not to stand as a candidate in the presidential elections for a fourth republic.

Madagascar had previously been ruled by France and today France's secretary of state for co-operation Alain Joyandet released a statement saying that Rajoelina's move "demonstrated a sense of responsibility". 

Following a peaceful transfer of power in the African nation of Nigeria, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Airport%20named%20after%20late%20Nigerian%20President%20Umaru%20Yar%E2%80%99Adua"&gt;Airport named after late Nigerian President Umaru Yar’Adua&lt;/a&gt; (2:04)</h3>

Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has announced plans to re-name Nigeria's Katsina Airport after late president Umaru Yar’Adua who died earlier this month after being ill for several months. 

The announcement comes at the end of seven days of mourning for the late President. Tributes were paid by President Jonathan, Nigerian ministers and former President of Ghana, John Kufuor.

The airport is located in Katsine, Yar’Adua’s home state. A road in Abuja is also to be renamed after the late president.

In an agreement that "really looks rather impressive," according to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Russia%20agrees%20to%20construct%20Turkish%20nuclear%20reactor"&gt;Russia agrees to construct Turkish nuclear reactor&lt;/a&gt; (2:43)</h3>

the Russian and Turkish governments today signed a deal that would lead to Russia building a US$20 billion nuclear power plant in Turkey, that nation's first.

The plant will be built on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and construction will commence as soon as the deal is approved by both countries with the building process expected to take around seven years. The reactor will also be owned by Russia, which will hold "no less than a controlling stake," in the plant, according to Sergey Kiriyenko, the head of Rosatom, a Russian nuclear energy corporation.

The contract for the reactor was one of 20 signed by the two countries today, expected to result in around US$25 billion of Russian investment in Turkey. Other major contracts signed include projects to transport Russian oil and natural gas through Turkey to ports on the Mediterranean Sea. One such project is a major pipeline between the Turkish ports of Samsun on the Black Sea and Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea, built in conjunction with an oil refinery in Ceyhan.

In a press conference, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that the agreements signal "a new page in our cooperation" and Turkish President Abdullah Gul added that the two countries "share a determination to increase the trade volume from a current US$38 billion to US$100 billion in five years."

Speaking of large sums of money, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Five%20hundred%20Euro%20note%20withdrawn%20from%20sale%20in%20UK"&gt;Five hundred Euro note withdrawn from sale in UK&lt;/a&gt; (4:09)</h3>

currency exchange offices in the United Kingdom have today stopped the sale of €500 notes after an investigation by the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) concluded that up to 90% of the notes were being used by money launderers and other organized criminals. Ian Cruxton, deputy director of SOCA, said that the Euro had been chosen as the currency of choice by criminal gangs due to the large denomination of the notes. Cruxton added that criminals "are going to have to find other means of trying to move their money."

The note was introduced by the European Central Bank in 2002, when the currency itself officially entered into circulation. The notoriety of the note's criminal uses has earned it the nickname "the Bin Laden" after Al-Qaeda suspect Osama bin Laden. Since its introduction, there has been mounting international concern over criminal use of the large denomination note, which facilitates money laundering by allowing large concentrations of cash to be concealed in small spaces, for example, €20,000 can be concealed in a cigarette packet and £1 million in €500 notes weighs 2.2kg

When asked if criminal demand for the note would simply be displaced to other high-value notes, such as the €200 note (the next-highest denomination), Ian Cruxton said he believed that would be the case, however, with less of the €200 note in circulation, their movements would be easier to track than those of the €500.

Tourists returning to the UK from holidays in Europe will still be able to change their €500 notes for Sterling. However, the European Central Bank has no plans for a withdrawal of the note across the entire Eurozone, given the legitimate demand for it in countries such as Germany and Italy, where cash is used far more frequently than alternatives such as credit cards.

Recently, events in Greece have had a dramatic impact on the Euro, and the world economy at large, and so in our

<h3>(6:06)</h3>

continuing coverage of the Greek financial crisis, wikinews reporter Iain Macdonald has performed an interview with Dr Isabella Margara, a London-based member of the Communist Party of Greece. In the interview, Margara sets out the communist response to current events in Greece as well as discussing the viability of a communist economy for the nation. She also hit back at Petros Tzomakas, a member of another Greek far-left party which criticized KKE in a previous wikinews exclusive interview.

Margara's interview comes amid tensions in cash-strapped Greece, where the government is introducing controversial austerity measures to try to ease the nation's debt-problem. 

Finally, in the world of sport, 

<h3>&lt;a href="El%20Salvador%20suspended%20from%20world%20football%20by%20FIFA"&gt;El Salvador suspended from world football by FIFA&lt;/a&gt; (6:55)</h3>

El Salvador has been suspended from competing in all world football internationals. FIFA, the governing body in football, suspended the Salvadorian Football Association after the Salvadorian government refused to recognize the local football officials that FIFA had appointed.

Last year, the head of the Salvadorian Football Association, Rodrigo Calvo, resigned so FIFA stepped in and appointed a special commission to reform the finances of the association. However, Salvadorian president Mauricio Funes refused to recognize the commission which FIFA saw as political interference.

The suspension affects next month’s World Cup in South Africa. Despite the national team not qualifying, three referees have been selected to participate in the tournament. If the suspension is not overturned by the start of the tournament, they will not be able to participate.

A meeting of an executive commission is due to take place on June 8th; should the El Salvadorian government not change its stance on the issue, the suspension will be finalized and El Salvador will remain suspended for the entire year until the FIFA congress meets again in June 2011.

Moving from current controversy in sport to historical controversy, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Canadian%20track%20and%20field%20coach%20Charlie%20Francis%20dies%20at%20age%2061"&gt;Canadian track and field coach Charlie Francis dies at age 61&lt;/a&gt; (8:09)</h3>

Canadian track and field coach, Charlie Francis, has died at the age of 61 after a five year battle with cancer, according to his family. 

Francis had worked with several athletes including disgraced runner Ben Johnson. Johnson won a gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later disqualified after testing positively for steroid use. During a national inquiry Francis admitted introducing Johnson to steroids.

Though Francis was banned for life by the national governing body of athletics in Canada, he briefly trained Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones for a time in 2003 and continued to believe that steroids are necessary in athletics.

<h2>On this day in history (8:56)</h2>

The Great Comet of 1861 is discovered by John Tebbutt of Windsor, New South Wales, Australia. 

The comet of 1861 interacted with the Earth in an almost unprecedented way. For two days, when the comet was at its closest, the Earth was actually within the comet's tail, and streams of cometary material converging towards the distant nucleus could be seen. By day the comet's gas and dust even obscured the Sun.

By the middle of August the comet was no longer visible to the naked eye, but it was visible in telescopes until May 1862. Measurements made at the time observed it had an elliptical orbit with a period of about 400 years, which would indicate a previous appearance from about the middle of the 15th century, and will make a return in the 23rd century.

As of 1992 this Great Comet had traveled more than 100 AU from the Sun, making it even further away than dwarf planet Eris. It will come to aphelion, the point in which it is furthest from the sun, around 2063.

Comets have been observed since ancient times and have historically been considered bad omens but in reality, they are mostly a loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles, ranging from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across. When a comet is close enough to the Sun, it displays a thin, fuzzy, temporary atmosphere called a coma, and sometimes also has a tail. These phenomenon are the result of the solar radiation and the solar wind interacting with the comet nucleus.

As of May 2009, there are a reported 3,648 known comets and this number is steadily increasing. However, this represents only a tiny fraction of the total potential comet population: the reservoir of comet-like bodies in the outer solar system may number one trillion. The number visible to the naked eye averages roughly one per year, though many of these are faint and unspectacular.

Schwarzenegger said in a &lt;a href="Sacramento"&gt;Sacramento&lt;/a&gt; press conference that California must cut spending to &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;12.4 billion.

To achieve this goal, the governor proposed cutting the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalWorks"&gt;CalWorks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; welfare system; however, state lawmakers quickly rejected this. Schwarzenegger said cutting the state welfare system for low-income families would save the state government $1.6 billion.

The governor also proposed freezing funds to local public schools and cutting state workers' incomes.

He wants to cut programs for the treatment of narcotics addiction for those using &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMedi-Cal"&gt;Medi-Cal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and cut state mental heath services by 60%.

California is set to receive monetary aid from &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; worth $3.4 billion.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Senate"&gt;California State Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADarrell%20Steinberg"&gt;Darrell Steinberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said, "The cuts are absolutely unacceptable," and the governor should focus on delaying business tax cuts.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Google%20mistakenly%20collects%20private%20data%20from%20Wi-Fi%20networks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; revealed late yesterday that it had mistakenly collected information about &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; sites people had visited on public &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWi-Fi"&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; networks.

The admission came from Google engineering head Alan Eustace in the form of a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Ablog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; post on Friday afternoon. In the statement, Google said that it had been unknowingly gathering the personal data for over three years through its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStreet%20View"&gt;Street View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; photo-mapping feature. The discovery was made during internal investigation resulting from earlier concerns by &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; regulators over the issue. Two weeks ago, Google told European officials that, while it did collect data from Wi-Fi services for location technologies, it did not save private user data. In yesterday's announcement, however, Google admitted that these claims were actually incorrect.

An estimated 600 gigabytes of personal data had apparently been collected because of a software error from 2006. Google Street View vehicles caught bits of information from unsecured or public Wi-Fi networks in both &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, as well as around 30 other countries where Street View is used. Eustace said that Google has "never used that data in any Google products" and that it would stop the collection of Wi-Fi data altogether. He also said that Google was discussing with regulators about how to properly dispose of the data it had accumulated.

This incident is the latest in the Internet privacy debate, following &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's move this week to update privacy and security settings for its users' accounts. European officials are expected to move on this issue, which has been controversial to both their citizens and governments for some time. Google had already agreed to take additional privacy measures in Germany last July after the nation's data protection agency raised concerns about Street View.

Hong Kong legislator, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamson%20Tam"&gt;Samson Tam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that Google may have violated Hong Kong's laws on 'interception of communications and surveillance', and was suspected of 'dishonest use of computers'.

<h3>&lt;a href="Violence%20in%20Bangkok%20prompts%20closure%20of%20US%20embassy%20in%20Thailand"&gt;Violence in Bangkok prompts closure of US embassy in Thailand&lt;/a&gt; (0:44)</h3>

A string of anti-government protests in Bangkok yesterday resulted in at least one fatality, numerous others injured, and the temporary closure of several foreign embassies in Thailand.

Philip Crowley, a spokesperson for the US State Department, announced early Thursday morning that the US embassy would be closed to the public due to its location near the violence. The embassy will be operating with a reduced staff and will not offer American citizens services until the conflict is resolved. The British and Dutch embassies in Thailand also halted their services after the Thai government said that it would seal off the area.

The leader of the protests was fugitive Major-General Khattiya Sawasdipol, the radical leader of the militant Red Shirt movement. While giving interviews with foreign journalists, Sawasdipol appeared to have been shot in the head by a sniper. He was later taken to a local hospital for emergency treatment. 

One other protester, 25-year-old Chartchai Bualao, was killed in the incident, but it is still unclear as to who is responsible for the shooting.

Thai military forces moved in quickly to suppress the protesters just after the shooting, aiming to put down the opposition movement and secure the area in which they had barricaded themselves since early April. The Thai government declared a state of emergency for seventeen of the country's 76 provinces in the wake of the protests.

This incident is only the latest in an ongoing series of violent outbreaks among protesters and the Thai government. The violence is a result of the belief of the protesters that Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva took power through illegitimate means with the support of the Thai military.

Violence in South East Asia was averted, this time in Indonesia, as

<h3>(2:28)</h3>

authorities said earlier today that they have uncovered a plot by rebels to assassinate several senior government officials, among them president Susilo Yudhoyono.

National police chief Hendarso Danuri commented on the matter earlier today, saying that several rebels intended to conduct the attack and declare an Islamic state during the August 17 independence day ceremony. Danuri added that the attacks also included a plan to attack foreigners and hotels in the capital Jakarta - somewhat similar to the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 174 after rebels attacked tourist spots such as hotels and a train station.

The plot was revealed in part due to several anti-terror raids near the capital, which saw twenty people arrested. Many of those now in custody were reportedly trained at a camp in Aceh, and operated by a branch of the Jemaah Islamiyah group called al-Qaeda in Aceh.

This is reportedly the second alleged plot to assassinate the Indonesian president in a year; last August, security forces said they had evidence suggesting rebels would blow up a car by Yudhonoyo's motorcade. The last large rebel attack was in last July, when suicide bombers targeted hotels in the capital.

Today in China,

<h3>&lt;a href="At%20least%2021%20dead%20after%20coal%20mine%20explosion%20in%20Chinese%20mine"&gt;At least 21 dead after coal mine explosion in Chinese mine&lt;/a&gt; (3:51)</h3>

at least 21 miners were killed after an explosion at the Yuanyang coal mine in the city of Anshunin located in southwestern Guizhou province. According to the Chinese state news agency, there were ten other workers in the mine who were rescued; five of whom were hospitalized due to carbon monoxide inhalation.

It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, although it is being investigated. Despite an initiative to increase safety, Chinese mines are among the most dangerous in the world; official statistics say 2,631 workers died in 1,616 separate incidents last year, although the figure is down 18% from 2008.

Political unrest has also been reported in Eastern Europe as

the interim government of Kyrgyzstan regained control of several government offices after a day of violent clashes with supporters of former Kyrgyzstan President Kurmanbek Bakiyev.

Backers of the ousted president took over regional government offices in Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Batken in the southern part of the country yesterday. Afterward, they released a statement calling for the reinstatement of Bakiyev's administration. The provisional government, led by Roza Otunbayeva, said later that it had managed to retake the offices in Batken after the demonstrators left the buildings there. The governor of Osh also managed to reclaim the buildings in his city with the aid of civilian government supporters.

Approximately 250 protesters were reported to have forced their way into government buildings in Osh yesterday morning, unstopped by local law enforcement officials. Up to 200 other Bakiyev supporters, most of whom were women, managed to seize administration buildings in Jalal-Abad, and were also untouched by police.

A group of 4,000 pro-government citizens approached the occupied buildings in Jalal-Abad, but was quickly dispersed when gunfire was heard. Hospitals in the city reported receiving 37 people wounded in the incident, and at least one person has died. A group loyal to Bakiyev later said that they had 25,000 supporters to march into Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyz government said that they would use counter-protests, rather than police forces, to combat the demonstrators.

<h3>&lt;a href="Moscow%20Metro%20attack%20suspects%20killed%20by%20police"&gt;Moscow Metro attack suspects killed by police&lt;/a&gt; (6:12)</h3>

three people suspected of involvement in the bomb attack on the Moscow Metro system on March 29th which killed at least 40 people and wounded over 100. The suspects were killed after "fierce armed resistance" with police in the city.

According to a statement released by Alexander Bortnikov of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the suspects were killed in "an attempt to detain three members of an illegal group."

One of the suspects killed in the incident was suspected by Russian authorities to have escorted the two suicide bombers to Moscow in preparation for the attack while another was suspected of escorting one of the bombers to a Metro station to carry out the attack.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev released a statement in which he said authorities had no choice but to kill the suspects, referring to them as "terrorists", adding that "there was nothing to be sorry about". 

In the immediate aftermath of the March attacks, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had said the catching those involved should be viewed as a "matter of honour" but that the security forces would be heavily criticised by Russian media if they were to drag the suspects "from the bottom of the sewers".

According to Bortnikov, all those involved in the attacks have now been identified and efforts to locate further suspects in the bombings are ongoing.

In the Russian province of Dagestan, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Eight%20killed%20in%20Dagestan%2C%20Russia%20after%20ambush"&gt;Eight killed in Dagestan, Russia after ambush&lt;/a&gt; (7:33)</h3>

At least eight people have been killed after an ambush which has been blamed on gangs and separatists supposedly inspired by rebels in neighboring Chechnya.

The incident occurred in the Sergokailinsky district last night about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Dagestan's capital Makhachkala, when workers were being dispatched to fix a cell phone tower owned by the "Beeline" telecommunications company that had earlier been damaged by bomb blasts set off by the rebels. When driving up to the tower, the convoy of workers, accompanied by police officers, came under fire.

A member of the security force of the Sergokalinsky district said that "eight people in the [rebels'] vehicle were killed [and the] other passengers received injuries or concussions".

In a story not heard much since the end of the cold war, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Russian%20citizen%20jailed%20for%20sending%20military%20intelligence%20to%20US"&gt;Russian citizen jailed for sending military intelligence to US&lt;/a&gt; (8:17)</h3>

a Russian citizen identified as Gennady Sipachyov has been convicted of "state treason in the form of espionage" and was sentenced to four years in a Russian maximum-security prison.

According to the Russian intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), Sipachyov was found guilty of giving the American government classified military maps, which can be used to target American missiles against targets in Russia more accurately. According to the FSB, the exchange of of information occurred in 2008, when Sipachyov emailed the documents to an organization called "East View Cartography," which was a cover for the intelligence service of the US military.

In its verdict, the court said that "The Pentagon required the maps in order to correct its guidance system for cruise missiles to increase the accuracy of targeting." While no motive was identified, and the trial was barred to the media, speculation has been that any motive involved was financial in nature.

Sipachyov, whose age and profession were not released, was convicted under Article 275 of Russia's criminal code, pertaining to "state treason in the form of espionage." Such a conviction ordinarily carries a sentence of 20 years, but according to the FSB, Sipachyov had "co-operated actively in the detection and investigation and also pointed to criminal activity by other individuals which helped prevent further damage to the security of Russia," leading to his sentence being reduced.

The incident has been seen as embarrassing for both the Russian and American governments, as the two countries are currently trying to repair their previously rocky relationship. Earlier this year, a treaty reducing the number of nuclear weapons each country held was signed by both nations leaders in a widely publicized event. 

The US government has not commented on the ruling.

As Russia attempts stabilize relations with the United States in the wake of the espionage case, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Russian%20meeting%20with%20Hamas%20provokes%20criticism%20from%20Israel"&gt;Russian meeting with Hamas provokes criticism from Israel&lt;/a&gt; (10:12)</h3>

Russian president Dmitriy Medvedev met with the Khaled Meshaal, leader of the Hamas group, earlier this week in Syria, prompting criticism from Israel.

Medvedev, during the meeting, had encouraged Hamas to reconcile with rival Fatah; a spokeswoman quoted him as saying that "no one" should be left out of the peace process.

He also requested that an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in 2006, Gilad Shalit, be released, although this was refused by Hamas, who says that Shalit wouldn't be released unless there was an "honourable" prisoner exchange with Israel. Shortly before his conversation with Meshaal, Medvedev also held a meeting with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.

In a statement by the Israeli foreign ministry, Israel described Hamas as "a terror organization whose declared goal is the destruction of the state of Israel" and went on to remind Russia that Israel had "stood by Russia in its struggle against the Chechnyan terrorism" and that they expect Russia to do the same concerning Hamas' actions towards the Jewsih state.

However, Andrei Nesterenko, a spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry, responded to Israel's comments, saying: "Hamas is not an artificial structure. It is a movement that draws on the trust and sympathy of a large number of Palestinians. We have regular contacts with this movement."

Only a few countries in Europe, including Russia, maintain ties with Hamas; the European Union and the United States regard it as a terrorist organization.

<h3>(11:47)</h3>

An Iraqi electoral commission has said that no fraud was found during a partial recount of votes from the country's parliamentary elections two months ago.

The recount was requested by Nouri al-Maliki, the current prime minister, after his party came second. Since the recount was done manually, it took 11 days to go through the 2.5 million votes cast in the Baghdad area.

al-Maliki had alleged fraud after the coalition of his main political opponent, Iyad Allawi, took a two-seat lead in parliament. The prime minister wanted recounts for all five provinces in Iraq, although only one - for Baghdad and the surrounding vicinity - was accepted. The Baghdad province accounts for around a fifth of the 325 overall seats. The recount, supervised by observers with the European Union and the United Nations, was conducted in the capital's Green Zone.

The Independent High Electroral Commission will make the full results of the recount publicly available on Monday.

In what is turning out to be a surprisingly uncontentious confirmation,

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20Supreme%20Court%20nominee%20Elena%20Kagan%20meets%20with%20senators%20on%20Capitol%20Hill"&gt;US Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan meets with senators on Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt; (12:44)</h3>

US Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan began the first of a long series of meetings with US Senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, called her "the right choice to replace Justice Stevens on the Supreme Court", while Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky hoped "that the Obama administration doesn't think the ideal Supreme Court nominee is someone who would rubber-stamp its policies."

Kagan is seen as a moderate, having been criticized by both left- and right-wing politicians, although "she's identified with the American liberal position", according to Illinois Republican Jeff Sessions.

If confirmed, she would be the first US Supreme Court Justice without ever having held a judicial position in 38 years. Kagan, currently the US Solicitor General, spent much of her early career as a professor of law and the dean of the Harvard Law School. She was previously nominated for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C. Circuit in 1999, but the nomination was unsuccessful. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, said that she does not believe Kagan's "lack of judicial experience in any way disqualifies her" to the position.

It is currently unclear what the meetings mean for Kagan. Some Republicans are worried about her move to block military recruiters from Harvard University's campus to protest the federal "Don't ask" policy against openly gay and lesbian members of the US military. However, despite that controversy, the nominee is also gathering support from both Republicans and Democrats. Republican Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts said Thursday that he found Kagan to support the military, after meeting with her. 

The Washington Post estimates that Kagan will pass the Senate, if only because of the Democratic majority that currently exists there. Most, if not all Democrats are expected to vote for Kagan.

The 50-year-old lawyer was nominated to the highest court in the United States by President Barack Obama on Monday, after current Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement late last month.

<h3>&lt;a href="Nigerian%20ex-governor%20James%20Ibori%20arrested%20in%20Dubai"&gt;Nigerian ex-governor James Ibori arrested in Dubai&lt;/a&gt; (14:46)</h3>

James Ibori, a former Nigerian governor, has been arrested in Dubai on corruption charges. Ibori was the governor of Nigeria's Delta State from 1999 until 2007 but was accused of stealing US$290m and has been wanted by Nigeria’s anti-corruption agency and by law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom. Ibori's UK assets, which amounted around US$35m against his annual salary of US$25,000, were frozen in 2007. 

The former governor has been a senior figure in the People's Democratic Party for many years and played a major role in getting former President Umaru Yar'Adua elected to office. In 2009, Ibori was cleared of 170 charges filed against him due to a lack of evidence and just last month, police attempted to arrest him in Nigeria but were attacked by Ibori's supporters.

London's Metropolitian Police released a statement saying that Ibori had been arrested at the United Kingdom's request on suspicion of money-laundering and conspiracy to defraud and they are seeking his extradition to Nigeria.

Finally, in the cut-throat world of professional chess, 
<h3>&lt;a href="India%27s%20Anand%20defends%20chess%20world%20championship%20title%20against%20Bulgarian%20challenger%20Topalov"&gt;India's Anand defends chess world championship title against Bulgarian challenger Topalov&lt;/a&gt; (15:57)</h3>

Viswanathan Anand, a grandmaster from India, has retained the world championship title after a match with Bulgarian challenger Veselin Topalov.

The match, consisting of a dozen games, was played in the Bulgarian capital Sofia over the last twenty days. Anand received the first-place prize of 1.2 million euro, whilst Topalov took 800,000 euro. 

The awards ceremony was attended yesterday by the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borisov, and the international chess federation FIDE's president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov.

Going into the last game, both sides had two wins apiece, and seven draws. However, the Bulgarian's manager, Silvio Danailov, observed that Topalov played the last game "rather nervously", saying: A draw would have been a good result for him but he made a few mistakes and the Indian exploited them

<h2>On this day in history (16:48)</h2>

To honor the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Atlantis%20launches%20for%20the%20final%20time"&gt;final flight of the Space Shuttle Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, which lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida this afternoon, on this day in history, in 1973, Skylab was launched aboard a modified Saturn V rocket and became the United States' first space station, and the second space station visited by a human crew. The 100-ton space station was in Earth's orbit from 1973 to 1979 and it was visited by crews three times in 1973 and 1974.

Skylab came into existence due to NASA budget cutbacks during the Apollo missions and NASA's plans for further lunar exploration were canceled but the plans for a scientific, Earth-orbiting mission remained. Skylab took form on 8 August 1969, when the McDonnell Douglas Corporation received a contract to convert two existing stages of the Saturn IV rocket into an Orbital Workshop configuration. The Orbital Workshop was renamed "Skylab" as a result of a NASA contest. The orbiter would be coupled with the Apollo Telescope Mount, which was a solar observatory.

Yet, when Skylab was launched, she suffered severe damage during launch.

<ul>

</ul>
The station had to undergo extensive repairs and a spacewalk by the first Skylab crew, which launched 11 days later on 25 May 1973 did an initial flyby of the station to assess the damage.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Audio credit &lt;a href="http%3A//www.archive.org/details/Skylab_TheFirst40Days"&gt;The Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
What had happened was that debris from a lost micrometeoroid shield pinned the remaining solar panel to the side of the station, preventing its deployment and thus leaving the station with a huge power deficit. 

If the crew were to fail to repair Skylab in time, the plastic insulation inside the station would have melted, releasing poisonous gas and making Skylab completely uninhabitable. However, after numerous spacewalks and coordinating with engineers on the ground, NASA put together a plan to get the station operational. 

<ul>
BULLET::::- Audio credit &lt;a href="http%3A//www.archive.org/details/Skylab_TheFirst40Days"&gt;The Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
The crew stayed in orbit with Skylab for 28 days and two additional missions followed on 28 July 1973 and 16 November 1973 with mission durations of 59 and 84 days, respectively. The last Skylab crew returned to the Earth on 8 February 1974.

Skylab orbited Earth 2,476 times during the 171 days and 13 hours of its occupation during the three manned Skylab missions. Astronauts performed ten spacewalks totaling 42 hours 16 minutes. Skylab logged about 2,000 hours of scientific and medical experiments, including eight solar experiments and the Sun's coronal holes were discovered because of these efforts. Many of the experiments conducted investigated the astronauts' adaptation to extended periods of microgravity and each Skylab mission set a record for the amount of time astronauts spent in space.

Skylab was abandoned by human crews in February 1974 because there were no more launch vehicles available to actually reach the station until the Space Shuttle was launched in 1981 and so Skylab was left in a parking orbit that was expected to last at least eight years. 

However, before the Shuttle ever went into operation, increased solar activity heated the outer layers of the Earth's atmosphere and thereby increased drag on Skylab, leading to an early re-entry. NASA realigned the station via computer and Skylab's re-entry occurred on 11 July 1979 in an area covering portions of the Indian Ocean and Western Australia.

Debris was found all through this region including The Shire of Esperance which fined the United States $400 for littering, a fine which remained unpaid for 30 years. The fine was paid in April 2009, when radio show host Scott Barley of Highway Radio raised the funds from his morning show listeners and paid the fine on behalf of NASA.

<h1>Efforts to cap Deepwater Horizon oil spill delayed again</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Efforts%20to%20cap%20Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill%20delayed%20again&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An attempt to cap the massive &lt;a href="2010%20Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill"&gt;oil spill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; has hit yet another obstacle, reported officials from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Petroleum"&gt;British Petroleum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (BP).

Friday night's attempt to install a 6-inch (15.2cm) tube into the leaking drill pipe was only the latest in a series of efforts by BP to stop or slow down the spill. Previously, the oil company had tried to enclose the pipe with a large container dome, and then lowered a smaller "top hat" container dome. The siphon tube method is designed to reduce the amount of oil flowing into the ocean, but is not a permanent solution to stopping the leak altogether. It will draw the oil from the broken pipe to a tanker at the surface, said BP.

The tube was to be inserted into the broken pipe by robotic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asubmarine"&gt;submarines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but the attempt on Friday to do so was unsuccessful, causing it to be taken back up for changes. The problem was a metal frame on the tube, which had changed position and this prevented the tube sent down from the drill ship ♡❤Discover Enterprise♡❤ from connecting. The tube had not been inserted into the leaking drill pipe before it was brought back up.

BP said that it would try again Saturday night (local time) to slow the leak using a reconfigured tube. If this attempt is unsuccessful, they will use the smaller dome to cap the leak, and may also try to plug the leak by covering it with trash, mud, or concrete. The company is already in the process of drilling relief wells to completely stop the leak, but this is expected to take several more months. The amount of oil currently leaking from the pipe is disputed, and BP said it has spent several hundred million &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in response to the oil spill.

BP was also given permission yesterday by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;US Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to use chemical oil dispersants to combat the spill.

Today on Wikinews : UK Prime Minister Cameron goes to Scotland, California's "Governator" attempts to "terminate" that states budget crisis, a Spanish judge is suspended for inquiring into Franco's regim and in history, something that would make Dick Cheney proud, the pope lays out the guidelines concerning how to torture heretics.

<h3>&lt;a href="UK%20PM%20Cameron%20and%20Scottish%20First%20Minister%20Salmond%20meet%20in%20Edinburgh"&gt;UK PM Cameron and Scottish First Minister Salmond meet in Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; (0:35)</h3>

Newly-elected UK Prime Minister David Cameron today traveled north to Scotland to meet with the country's First Minster, Alex Salmond, for the first time since the general election. According to The Scotsman, around 200 noisy protesters greeted the new PM, forcing security staff to take him into the devolved parliament via a back door.

Cameron's Conservative Party have traditionally been unpopular in Scotland. They won just one out of 59 Scottish seats in the election, gaining around seventeen per cent of the vote. Prior to the meeting, Salmond told reporters he intended to press Cameron for greater Scottish financial independence from Westminster, including greater tax powers— something supported by the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives' new coalition partners, and Danny Alexander the Lib Dem Scottish Secretary and on which Cameron has promised a cross-party commission.

Cameron had been seeking what he called a "fresh start" to restore ties between the parliaments and after the meeting, both Salmond and Cameron agreed that the conversation had been "positive and constructive"

Cameron also outlined part of his spending plans in preparation for an emergency budget, scheduled for fifty days after the election. He announced that no cuts would be made to the £30 billion annual budget for Scotland though that £6 billion in spending cuts would have to be made— something likely to cause controversy in Cameron's coalition government. However, both Cameron and Salmond anticipate that cuts may need to be made in subsequent years.

While the UK attempts to settle its economic issues, 

<h3>&lt;a href="California%20governor%20Schwarzenegger%20presents%20new%20budget%20plan"&gt;California governor Schwarzenegger presents new budget plan&lt;/a&gt; (2:06)</h3>

The governor of the 8th largest economy in the world, Arnold Schwarzenegger, unveiled a new budget plan for California on Friday, claiming that the Californian economy faces growth and budget problems like eurozone countries such as Greece and Ireland.

Schwarzenegger said in a Sacramento press conference that California must cut spending to US$12.4 billion.

To achieve this goal, the governor proposed cutting the CalWorks welfare system; however, state lawmakers quickly rejected this. Schwarzenegger said cutting the state welfare system for low-income families would save the state government $1.6 billion.

The governor also proposed freezing funds to local public schools and cutting state workers' incomes.

He also wants to cut programs for the treatment of narcotics addiction for those using Medi-Cal and cut state mental health services by 60%.

California State Senate president Darrell Steinberg, a Democrat, said, "The cuts are absolutely unacceptable," and the governor should focus on delaying business tax cuts.

At least one economy, this time the 27th largest in the world, received a bit of good news as 

<h3>&lt;a href="IMF%20approves%20US%241.13%20billion%20loan%20to%20Pakistan"&gt;IMF approves US$1.13 billion loan to Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; (3:12)</h3>

the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said yesterday that its board has approved a loan package worth US$1.13 billion to be granted to Pakistan.

The IMF described Pakistan's economic situation as having improved in spite of "adverse security developments and a rapidly changing political environment", although saying the economy was still vulnerable.

Pakistan requested a bailout package two years ago from the IMF, as it was struggling with three-decade-high inflation rates; the country has also seen much violence from rebel groups, with bombings having killed over 3,200 people since July of 2007.

The IMF board also noted that it would grant waivers for several performance criteria Pakistan did not meet, namely overrunning the budget deficit and surpassing State Bank of Pakistan borrowing limits.

While other nations struggle to tackle their nations issues, at least one nation is taking a more proactive approach.

<h3>&lt;a href="VI%20Congress%20of%20Mayors%20and%20Councilors%20of%20the%20O%27Higgins%20Region%20takes%20place%20in%20Pichilemu%2C%20Chile"&gt;VI Congress of Mayors and Councilors of the O'Higgins Region takes place in Pichilemu, Chile&lt;/a&gt; (4:08)</h3>

The VI Congress of Mayors and Councilors wraps up a two day program of annual activities of the Chilean Association of Municipalities today in Pichilemu, Chile.

The congress will be discussing the topic of regional reconstruction as well as how to manage setbacks in education, homes and health for each municipality.

The event so far has been attended by almost 300 regional authorities and a Brazilian delegation that viewed the work of the mayors and other government officials in the region. Chilean Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter, was also invited to become acquainted with the needs of the region.

Moving now from the world of big government to big business, 

<h3>&lt;a href="European%20airline%20Ryanair%20fined%20over%20ash-triggered%20flight%20cancellations"&gt;European airline Ryanair fined over ash-triggered flight cancellations&lt;/a&gt; (4:50)</h3>

Italy today fined the Irish airline Ryanair three million euros over the airline's failure to assist passengers after their flights were canceled due to the ash cloud from an Icelandic volcano which erupted last month and dramatically hindered air travel all across Europe.

According to the civil aviation authority of Italy, ENAC, there were 178 cases of passengers not receiving mandatory assistance, such as accommodations and food, after Ryanair canceled their flights. Such assistance is required by European regulations to be given to passengers who have chosen to be re-routed.

ENAC noted that despite the situation, most other European airlines had succeeded in fulfilling their obligations to passengers.

Ryanair had no comment on the announcement.

Not keeping silent, however, is

<h3>&lt;a href="Google%20mistakenly%20collects%20private%20data%20from%20Wi-Fi%20networks"&gt;Google mistakenly collects private data from Wi-Fi networks&lt;/a&gt; (5:39)</h3>

search giant Google, which revealed late yesterday that it had mistakenly collected information about Internet sites people had visited on public Wi-Fi networks.

The admission came from Google engineering head Alan Eustace in the form of a blog post on Friday afternoon. In the statement, Google said that it had been unknowingly gathering the personal data for over three years through its Street View photo-mapping feature. The discovery was made during an internal investigation resulting from earlier concerns by German regulators over the issue. 

Two weeks ago, Google told European officials that, while it did collect data from Wi-Fi services for location technologies, it did not save private user data. In yesterday's announcement, however, Google admitted that these claims were actually incorrect.

An estimated 600 gigabytes of personal data had apparently been collected because of a software error from 2006. Google Street View vehicles caught bits of information from unsecured or public Wi-Fi networks in both Europe and the United States, as well as around 30 other countries where Street View is used. 

Eustace said that Google has "never used that data in any Google products" and that it would stop the collection of Wi-Fi data altogether. He also said that Google was discussing with regulators about how to properly dispose of the data it had accumulated.

This incident is the latest in the Internet privacy debate, following Facebook's move this week to update privacy and security settings for its users' accounts. European officials are expected to move on this issue, which has been controversial to both their citizens and governments for some time. Google had already agreed to take additional privacy measures in Germany last July after the nation's data protection agency raised concerns about Street View.

Keeping secrets is, unfortunately, still in vogue, this time in Spain as 
<h3>&lt;a href="Spanish%20judge%20suspended%20over%20abuse%20of%20power%20charges"&gt;Spanish judge suspended over abuse of power charges&lt;/a&gt; (7:39)</h3>

A prominent Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzón, has been suspended from his post by Spain's General Council of the Judiciary.

The suspension comes after Spain's Supreme Court ruled that an inquiry Garzón opened in 2008 into crimes committed during Spain's civil war, which lasted from 1936 to 1939, abused his powers by opening the investigation since the events are covered by an amnesty dating from 1977. The general amnesty act barred any investigations related to criminal offenses with a political aim previous to 1976.

Garzón formally declared the acts of repression committed by the Franco regime to be crimes against humanity, and accounted them in more than one hundred thousand killings during and after the Spanish Civil War. He also ordered the exhumation of 19 unmarked mass graves, one of them believed to contain the remains of the avant-garde poet and playwright Federico García Lorca.

Garzón appealed the ruling, claiming that had conducted a legitimate inquiry, as crimes against humanity had been conducted during the war, and are not covered under the amnesty. A date for his trial has not yet been set; if convicted, Garzón would not serve jail time, but would be suspended for as long as 20 years.

The Human Rights Watch was critical of Garzón's suspension; a statement from the group said that "This is a sad day for the cause of human rights. Garzón was instrumental in delivering justice for victims of atrocities abroad and now he is being punished for trying to do the same at home."

In 1252, Pope Innocent IV issues the papal bull ♡❤ad exstirpanda♡❤, which explicitly authorized (and defined the appropriate circumstances for) the use of torture by the Inquisition for eliciting confessions from heretics.'

The bull, which, by the way, is similar to an open letter but with some legal backing, argued that as heretics are "murderers of souls as well as robbers of God’s sacraments and of the Christian faith ...", they are "to be coerced—as are thieves and bandits—into confessing their errors and accusing others, although one must stop short of danger to life or limb." 

The bull also introduced some parameters that were to placed on the use of torture:

The requirement that torture only be used once was effectively meaningless in practice as it was interpreted as authorizing torture with each new piece of evidence that was produced and by considering most practices to be a continuation (rather than repetition) of the torture session.

While the bull did not discuss methods of torture, it is unlikely that victims were coerced by the Inquisition &lt;a href="http%3A//people.csail.mit.edu/paulfitz/spanish/script.html"&gt;in the Comfy Chair until lunch time, with only a cup of coffee at eleven.&lt;/a&gt;

Today on Wikinews : BP fails again to cap the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a Cathay Pacific airliner is escorted by military jets after a bomb scare, students in Chile celebrate Student's Day, and in history, American pioneers set out along the Oregon Trail.

Today is Sunday, May 16th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Efforts%20to%20cap%20Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill%20delayed%20again"&gt;Efforts to cap Deepwater Horizon oil spill delayed again&lt;/a&gt; (0:37)</h3>

Officials from British Petroleum have reported their latest attempt to cap the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has hit yet another obstacle.

Previous efforts to contain the spill failed when the company had first tried to enclose the leaking pipe with a large container dome and when that failed, it tried a smaller "top hat" dome. This latest setback occurred when a siphon tube designed to be inserted into the broken oil pipe on the sea floor had to be brought back to the surface aboard the drill ship Discover Enterprise and altered because a metal frame on the tube had changed position and thus could not be connected to the pipe via robotic submarines. 

The siphon tube method, which will be attempted again on Saturday night, is designed to reduce the amount of oil flowing into the ocean, but is not a permanent solution to stopping the leak altogether but it will allow a tanker at the surface to draw the oil from the broken pipe.

If this latest attempt is unsuccessful, BP will use the smaller dome to cap the leak, and may also try to plug the leak by covering it with trash, mud, or concrete. BP was also given permission yesterday by the US Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency to use chemical oil dispersants to combat the spill. 

The company is already in the process of drilling relief wells to completely stop the leak, but this is expected to take several more months. The amount of oil currently leaking from the pipe is disputed, and BP said it has spent several hundred million US dollars in response to the oil spill.

In an effort to take a more relaxed approach to relations with the US,

<h3>&lt;a href="UK%20Foreign%20Secretary%20meets%20US%20Secretary%20of%20State%20in%20Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;UK Foreign Secretary meets US Secretary of State in Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; (2:08)</h3>

British Foreign Secretary William Hague traveled to Washington, D.C. on Friday to meet his opposite number, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Hague, who was leader of the UK's Conservative party between 1997 and 2001, traveled to the United States in his first overseas visit in his capacity as foreign secretary almost as soon as his appointment to the post was confirmed since the election ten days ago and the formation of a coalition government six days later.

Hague was keen to point out that US President Barack Obama had been the first foreign leader to telephone David Cameron and congratulate him upon becoming the UK's new Prime Minister and that the promptness of his visit was intended "to ... reciprocate that warmth" shown by the US to the new coalition government.

Clinton told Hague that she was "enthusiastic" about the new government in the UK and the "chemistry" between Cameron and his Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg. The talks focused on the major foreign policy concerns shared by both countries, such as Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle-East and the pair ended the subsequent press conference by expressing their unity on those issues, particularly on further UN sanctions against Iran and on the ongoing campaign in Afghanistan.

Clinton, who ran against Obama in the Democratic Party's primaries during the 2008 presidential election, was at pains to emphasize that any future disharmony in the Westminster coalition government would not affect US–UK relations, nor the ability of the US to rely on the UK as partner in the future. Comparing the two political systems, Clinton said "We don't formally have a coalition government in the way that you have formed one in the UK now, but we have enough of our own internal differences that we have to sort through."

Cameron and Obama are scheduled to meet in person at next month's G20 meeting in Canada.

In the skies over Canada,

a Cathay Pacific passenger aircraft from Hong Kong was escorted by two Canadian military aircraft after the pilot issued an alert of a bomb threat to the aircraft.

Two Canadian CF-18 fighter jets had taken off from a military base on Vancouver Island to intercept the plane after the pilot's alert and, according to a Canadian official, "[the] fighters escorted the aircraft until it landed safely ..." at Vancouver International Aircraft at around 1:40pm local time. Passengers were initially kept on board the aircraft before being allowed to deplane and according to an unidentified passenger from the flight "They told us there was some sort of terrorist problem and the baggage would be held up."

The plane was then moved to a secure section of the airport while police investigated the incident, though no dangerous substances had been found on board and passengers had not been in danger.

While passengers from Hong Kong are dealing with the bomb scare over Canada, back home, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Hong%20Kong%20by-elections%20start"&gt;Hong Kong by-elections start&lt;/a&gt; (4:54)</h3>

A special election will be held today following the resignation of five legislators in Hong Kong's Legislative Council earlier this year in protest of the government's indifference towards universal suffrage and the abolishment of functional constituencies.

Prominent politicians Leung Chun Ying and Anthony Cheung have refused to vote as have the heads of the DAB and Liberal Party, the former going on a trip to avoid voting. Their absence provoked the criticism of several pan-democrats, including Audrey Eu, party leader of the Civic Party. 

The elections began at 07.30 local time and are due to end at ten o'clock tonight. Results are expected to be released tomorrow morning.

<h3>&lt;a href="Jessica%20Watson%20becomes%20youngest%20solo%20sailor%20to%20sail%20the%20world"&gt;Jessica Watson becomes youngest solo sailor to sail the world&lt;/a&gt; (5:41)</h3>

Jessica Watson, a 16-year-old Australian, became the youngest person to sail around the world unassisted and alone when she arrived in Sydney Harbor on Saturday.

As Watson neared land, a large assortment of other watercraft began to parade alongside her yacht. She was greeted by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who called her "Australia's newest hero." and congratulated her with a free driving lesson and a copy of the Australian "Keys to Drive" program. Watson completed her journey days before her seventeenth birthday.

Watson departed from Sydney on October 18th of last year and after 210 days, she traveled, by herself, for over 23,000 nautical miles on a 34-foot yacht, called Ella's Pink Lady. 

Watson caught some criticism when she first announced her intention to sail solo around the world. Some thought that she was too young and too inexperienced to safely travel alone, but Watson's mother stated that she had been sailing since she was eight years old. And last week, it was questioned whether Watson had sailed far enough past the Equator to satisfy the requirements for achieving the record.

Watson's record is unofficial because the World Speed Sailing Record Council no longer has a category for the sailors under eighteen. Jesse Martin, also Australian, held the previous record in 1999, when he was eighteen.

Meanwhile, young people on dry land celebrated

Students' Day in schools across Chile. 

Student's Day was created in May 11, 1990 by Chile's Ministry of Education and allows students to engage in fun and team building activities such as live music performances by local bands and an event known as gymkhana which pits teams of students against each other in fun competitions that include threading a needle and eating a pear while playing with a basketball.

In the town of Pichilemu, team Verde edged out team Rojo in these student competitions. 

All across the nation, students enjoyed a wide range of activities, most notably free food, especially in Parral where Savory's ice cream was given to people in front of the the city's Municipality building.

Meanwhile, the Clerk of the Municipality of Punta Arenas, Orlando Estefó, congratulated students for "making history every day by day, as the main actors in the educational process."

In 1842, the second organized wagon train along the famed Oregon Trail, set out from Elm Grove, Missouri, with more than 100 pioneers. The party was led by Elijah White, a missionary and agent for the United States government in Oregon Country. 

The Oregon Trail was one of the main overland migration routes on the North American continent, leading from locations along the Missouri River to the Oregon Country, located in the America's Pacific Northwest region.

The trail was used extensively between 1841 and 1869 by settlers, ranchers, farmers, miners, and business men looking for new opportunities away from the rapidly growing eastern portion of the pre-Civil War United States. 

To complete the journey in one traveling season most travelers left in April to May as soon as grass was growing enough to support their teams and the trails had dried out. To meet the constant needs for water, grass, and fuel for campfires the trail followed various rivers and streams and the network of trails required a minimum of road work to be made passable for wagons. People using the trail traveled not only by wagon but also on pack trains, horseback, on foot, by raft, and by boat. 

The cost of traveling over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing to a few hundred dollars per person. The cheapest way was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing one to make the trip for nearly nothing or even make a small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the midwest and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. 

The journey itself was arduous and filled with many dangers, but the number of deaths on the trail is not known with any precision and there are only wildly varying estimates. The estimates are made even harder by the common practice then of burying people in unmarked graves that were intentionally disguised to avoid them being dug up by animals. 

While Indian attacks were a hazard and increased significantly after 1860 when miners and ranchers began fanning out all over the country which, incidentally, often encroached on Indian territory, it was diseases such as cholera that were the main killer of travelers with up to 3% of all travelers dying of the disease in the cholera years of 1849 to 1855.

By the time the first transcontinental railroad by the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific railways was completed in 1869, the use of the trail rapidly diminished, yet one of the main enduring legacies of the Oregon Trail is the expansion of the United States territory to the West Coast. Without the many thousands of United States settlers in Oregon and California and thousands more on their way each year, it is highly unlikely that this would have occurred. 

When Elijah White had set out in 1842 with his 100 pioneers, the Oregon Country was subject to competing claims by the United States and Britain, but after years of industrial expansion and western migration the territory was admitted to the Union on November 11, 1889.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have defeated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the final of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20ICC%20World%20Twenty20"&gt;2010 Twenty20 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to win the tournament. England won by 7 wickets at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKensington%20Oval"&gt;Kensington Oval&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABridgetown"&gt;Bridgetown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Barbados"&gt;Barbados&lt;/a&gt; to lift the World Cup. A 111 run partnership between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Kieswetter"&gt;Craig Kieswetter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the man of the match and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Pietersen"&gt;Kevin Pietersen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the man of the tournament, helped them in chasing down the target of 148 runs set by &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; won the toss and opted to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFielding%20%28cricket%29"&gt;field&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Australia scored 147 runs, losing 6 wickets in their twenty overs. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hussey"&gt;David Hussey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was the top scorer, getting 59 runs. Australia scored only 47 runs for 4 wickets in their first ten overs. David Hussey and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACameron%20White"&gt;Cameron White&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; added 22 runs in the thirteenth over, thus helping their team to get to 147 for 6 in their innings. For England, Ryan Sidebottom took two wickets for 26 runs in four overs.

Early in England's innings, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADirk%20Nannes"&gt;Dirk Nannes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Australia took the wicket of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Lumb"&gt;Michael Lumb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of England, when the latter was caught by David Hussey at mid-wicket. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Pietersen"&gt;Kevin Pietersen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of England came when Lumb got out, and helped England to reach 44 runs in the six &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APowerplay%20%28cricket%29"&gt;powerplay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; overs. The partnership between Pietersen and Kieswetter helped their team to reach the target of 148 runs in seventeen overs, with three overs in hand.

England captain &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Collingwood"&gt;Paul Collingwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told the media that he thought "belief ha[d] been the key." "As soon as we got the squad together, seeing how much power we have in the squad, I know that is all on paper but we could tell that we had a lot of potential," he commented.

"I think a lot of credit goes to every single player in the dressing room to have the confidence to go out there and really give it their best shots and have no regrets. I think we have done that throughout the tournament and it has certainly paid off," he noted.

For England, this is the first victory in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALimited%20overs%20cricket"&gt;limited overs championship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as they had never won a single one-day or T20 World Cup or the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChampions%20League%20Twenty20"&gt;Championship League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tournament till this victory. In this connection, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aall-rounder"&gt;all-rounder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Collingwood said: "[t]his is right up there, with the best," adding "[t]o be the first [England] team to win a 'World Cup' is very special. We knew it was a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amonkey%20on%20one%27s%20back"&gt;monkey on our back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

Meanwhile, Australian captain &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Clarke"&gt;Michael Clarke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; admitted his disappointment at the result. He conceded that his performance was poor, saying, "There's no doubt the selectors will need to have a look at my performances. I certainly know they haven't been up to scratch through this whole tournament and probably in Twenty20 cricket in general. I'm sure the selectors will sit down and have a look and if I'm not the right guy for No 3 and the captaincy then they'll make that decision"

Newly elected UK &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="David%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; praised the English team. "Congratulations to Paul Collingwood and the England Twenty20 team on becoming world champions for the first time with a magnificent victory over Australia. Let's hope this marks the start of a great summer of sport for England," he said. 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20Sport%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;English Sports Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHugh%20Robertson%20%28politician%29"&gt;Hugh Robertson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; commented: "I'm absolutely delighted England have won the World Twenty20. They have played exciting and intelligent cricket and are worthy winners."

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Bus%20attack%20in%20India%20kills%20many"&gt;Bus attack in India kills many&lt;/a&gt; (0:48)</h3>

Official reports say that Maoist rebels attacked a bus earlier today in central India, killing up to fifty people, according to the Al Jazeera news service, however, the Agence France-Presse news service places the death toll at twenty.

The incident occurred in the Dantewada district of the Chhattisgarh state, when the fighters blew up a landmine underneath the bus. An official said the vehicle, although intended as a regular transport bus, was occupied primarily with security forces.

Violence in Chhattisgarh has increased recently, blamed on an Indian Maoist movement. In October 2009, the Indian government initiated a "massive anti-Maoist offensive" deploying 50,000 troops to several states, though last month alone rebels killed 75 security personnel.

In Afghanistan today, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Plane%20crash%20in%20northern%20Afghanistan%20kills%20at%20least%2043"&gt;Plane crash in northern Afghanistan kills at least 43&lt;/a&gt; (1:35)</h3>

An airliner carrying 43 passengers, including six foreigners, is reported to have crashed in the mountains in the northern region of Afghanistan. Authorities say that Pamir Airways flight 112 went down earlier today while on its way from the northern city of Kunduz to the capital, Kabul.

Rescuers were headed to the presumed crash site near the Salang Pass in the Hindu Kush mountains, north of the Afghan capital; however, poor weather conditions, including fog, reportedly hampered an aerial search.

According to Tom Popyk, a Canadian freelance reporter working with the CTV News Channel, he described the region as "... terrain that is very, very difficult to reach," 

Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary said NATO-led forces had been asked to help locate the plane using pilotless drones. NATO said in a statement that it had dispatched a manned aircraft to the last known position of the missing plane; two helicopters were also en route to the area.

The privately-owned Pamir Airways began operations in 1995. The Afghan airline has daily domestic flights and also flies to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

<h3>&lt;a href="Seven-year-old%20girl%20killed%20in%20Detroit%2C%20Michigan%20police%20raid"&gt;Seven-year-old girl killed in Detroit, Michigan police raid&lt;/a&gt; (2:45)</h3>

A seven year-old girl was shot and killed Sunday during a police raid in Detroit, Michigan, United States when one of the officer's guns was accidentally set off during an argument with the girl's grandmother, Mertilla Jones. Police were raiding the home in search of a 34 year-old male suspect accused of murdering teenager Jarean Blake near a local liquor store the previous night.

According to police reports, Mertilla Jones got into a verbal confrontation with a police officer, which quickly turned physical. The woman, according to the police, then came into contact with the officer which inadvertently set off the gun that he was carrying. The bullet then struck the girl, Aiyana Jones, in the neck while she was sleeping on the family's couch.

The murder suspect was apprehended later that day. However, the family and public became outraged at the killing of seven year-old Aiyana. In response, the Detroit Police Department held a press conference. Assistant Police Chief Goodbee, speaking on behalf of the Police Chief, who was on vacation at the time of the shooting, said "We cannot undo what occurred this morning [...] All we can do is to pledge an open and full investigation and to support Aiyana's family in whatever way they may be willing to accept from us at this time,"

Meanwhile the girl's father, Charles Jones, was outraged about the incident. Jones described the girl as a "lively, free spirit" and of the police, said that they are falsely accusing his mother of resisting the police, and killing his baby and he wants "someone to tell the truth".

The incident is currently under investigation by the Detroit Police Department. It is not known who fired the shot that killed the girl, or whether or not they will receive any disciplinary action from the department.

<h3>&lt;a href="Iran%2C%20Turkey%2C%20Brazil%20reach%20nuclear%20agreement"&gt;Iran, Turkey, Brazil reach nuclear agreement&lt;/a&gt; (4:23)</h3>

Iran, Turkey, and Brazil emerged with an agreement yesterday from talks regarding Iran's nuclear program.

In this new deal, Iran will send its uranium to Turkey for processing in return for nuclear fuel. Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu revealed the agreement Sunday night, which may alleviate international tensions about Iran's nuclear program. However, he did not specify how much uranium would be transferred, or how the plan will be implemented. Leaders of each country will finalize the plan later today.

The eighteen-hour discussion in Tehran yesterday included Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who acted as a neutral broker in the deal. Lula da Silva also visited Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, although only Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was actively involved in the talks.

Prior to the meeting, many had thought the chance of an agreement slim. Iran, however, seemed to be open to new ideas. Iranian atomic director Ali Akbar Salehi said Saturday that “things are moving along positively” in regard to such proposals. Iran had originally refused to trade its uranium, but seemed to indicate last week that it had changed its mind.

Earlier, Iran denied claims by other countries that it plans to advance its nuclear arms program using enriched uranium, saying that it will be used for energy purposes only. The country had also rejected a previous plan by the United Nations for processing uranium elsewhere.

In the world of sports,

<h3>&lt;a href="England%20defeats%20Australia%20and%20wins%202010%20Twenty20%20Cricket%20World%20Cup"&gt;England defeats Australia and wins 2010 Twenty20 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt; (5:54)</h3>

England defeated Australia in the final of the 2010 Twenty20 Cricket World Cup, winning the tournament. England won by 7 wickets at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados to lift the World Cup. 

Newly elected UK Prime Minister David Cameron praised the English team as did English Sports Minister Hugh Robertson who commented: "I'm absolutely delighted England have won the World Twenty20. They have played exciting and intelligent cricket and are worthy winners."

For England, this is the first victory in a limited overs championship as they had never won a single one-day or T20 World Cup or the Championship League tournament until this victory.

Finally, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Metal%20singer%20Ronnie%20James%20Dio%20dies%20aged%2067"&gt;Metal singer Ronnie James Dio dies aged 67&lt;/a&gt; (6:35)</h3>

American metal singer Ronnie James Dio died Sunday at the age of 67, as announced by his wife, Wendy. Dio passed at 07:45 (CST) (13:45 UTC) at the Mayo Clinic, an American disease treatment center, after a two-year fight with stomach cancer that caused him to stop singing while he received treatment. 

A statement posted on Dio's website by his wife said, "Ronnie knew how much he was loved by all...Please know he loved you all and his music will live on forever."

Dio (born Ronnie James Padavona) was born in July 10, 1942 in the American city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He was most noted for his high pitched vocals and lyrical tales involving battles and themes of good versus evil.

He performed with several hard rock and metal groups, but he was most notable for his first act, when he joined as singer of the British metal group Black Sabbath after lead singer and frontman Ozzy Osbourne left the band in 1979. Before Black Sabbath he performed with several less successful bands, including Rainbow, led by former Deep Purple's Ritchie Blackmore.

He also had a very successful solo career under the simple name "Dio", and had recently reunited with former Black Sabbath band mates under the moniker Heaven and Hell.

Dio's hit songs included "Holy Diver", "Neon Knights", and "The Last In Line".

<h2>On this day in history (7:59)</h2>

BULLET::::- Music credit &lt;a href="http%3A//www.archive.org/details/Tribute_to_Satie"&gt;Je Te Veux(I want you), performed on a Korg Wavestation and Akai S5000 sampler.&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
In 1866, French composer and pianist, Éric Alfred Leslie Satie, was born in Paris to his father Alfred, a translator, and his English born mother, Jane. At the age of four, Erik's mother died and he was sent, together with his younger brother Conrad, to Honfleur, to live with his paternal grandparents. It was here that he received his first music lessons from a local organist but when his grandmother died in 1878, the two brothers were reunited with their father in Paris, who remarried a piano teacher shortly afterwords.

In 1879 Satie entered the Paris Conservatoire, where he was soon labeled untalented by his teachers. Émile Descombes, believed to be one of the last pupils of Frédéric Chopin, called him "the laziest student in the Conservatoire" and he was sent home from the school. In 1886, he resolved to take up military service, but that career did not last long and within a few weeks he left the army through deceptive means.

It was a year later, in 1887, that he started publishing his Gymnopédies which consisted of three short and atmospheric piano compositions. These compositions represent his attempt to cut himself loose from the conventional 19th century "salon music" environment of his father, who had also become a composer, and stepmother.

The name Gymnopédies derives from an anecdote when Satie introduced himself as a "gymnopaedist" in December 1887 to the director of the Chat Noir cabaret, Rodolphe Salis, who in the grand French tradition, was famous for serving sharp comments. Being coerced to mention his profession, Satie, lacking any recognizable professional occupation, presented himself as a "gymnopaedist", supposedly in an attempt to outwit the director. 

One of the criticisms of Satie's work was that his harmonisations were erratic, and this is somewhat reflected in his social life and choice of friends in the avant-garde scene of Paris. Satie befriended famous artists such as filmmaker Jean Cocteau, writer Gertrude Stein, the composer Igor Stravinsky and artists Pablo Picasso and Man Ray with whom he helped create the dada sculpture "The Gift", a clothes iron with 14 nails glued to its sole. Satie contributed written work for a range of publications, including the American top culture chronicle Vanity Fair and kept a filing cabinet with a collection of imaginary buildings, which he drew on little cards that he would, occasionally, publish as anonymous small announcements in local journals, offering some of these buildings, such as "castle in lead" for sale or rent.

On 1 July 1925, after years of heavy drinking, Satie died from cirrhosis of the liver. At the time of his death absolutely nobody had ever entered the room he had moved into twenty-seven years earlier. What his friends would discover there, after Satie's burial, had the allure of the opening of the grave of Tutankhamun. Inside, they found four pianos, two of which were back to back, and the others sitting upside-down on top of the other two, a great numbers of umbrellas and seven velvet suits from his Velvet gentleman period.

Though not considered a major composer, his work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, repetitive music, and the Theatre of the Absurd.

<h3>&lt;a href="Twelve%20people%20dead%20after%20blast%20in%20north-west%20Pakistan"&gt;Twelve people dead after blast in north-west Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; (0:44)</h3>

A bomb explosion in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan has killed at least twelve people. The Deputy Superintendent of Police was said to be the target and the bomb, which was planted on a bicycle, killed the superintendent along with the driver and guard of his convoy. Officials stated the bomb, which was remote controlled, was detonated when he had been leaving his house as he was entering his car.

The death toll was confirmed at 12 dead and 10 wounded who are being treated at a local hospital. According to the head of the hospital's casualty department, "The dead included three policemen, including one officer, and nine civilians," and that there were women and children among the dead. A state of emergency has been declared by the hospital.

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.

Across the border in Afghanistan,

<h3>(1:30)</h3>

a car bomb attack which targeted a NATO convoy in the capital of Kabul, has killed or wounded dozens of people. The death toll was not confirmed, and estimates range from ten to twenty deaths. 47 people were injured in the attack.

The incident occurred at the Darulaman crossroads, near a US-Afghan military base and the parliament. According to Iain Baxter, a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force, the target of the attack was an ISAF convoy. Six NATO troops died in the attack alongside several civilians. The bomber had been driving a car filled with explosives, which was detonated at around 0815 local time.

The Taliban claimed have responsibility for the attack, saying a resident of Kabul had been sent to "destroy five foreign vehicles and damage one more ... Today's attack was part of the Al Fatah operation and we will continue attacking foreigners and government security forces and their associates,". 

Hamid Karzai, President of Afghanistan, said on national television that it was a "heartbreaking" attack and that "We are condemning the attack in the strongest terms."

Meanwhile, yesterday, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Karzai%20visits%20UK%20for%20talks%20with%20new%20PM"&gt;Karzai visits UK for talks with new PM&lt;/a&gt; (2:38)</h3>

Karzai visited the UK for talks with newly-elected Prime Minister David Cameron. The meeting took place at Chequers, the prime minister's official country residence and is Cameron's first since last week's general election. Karzai was en route back to Afghanistan from a visit to the United States where he held talks with President Barack Obama.

Downing Street called the meeting "an opportunity for early discussions" between the Afghan president and the new prime minister, pointing out that Karzai himself had requested the meeting to follow up on conversations the two leaders had had while Cameron was leader of the opposition.

According to a spokesman, the discussions had centered around Karzai's visit to the US, which he called "very successful", and "[b]oth the president and prime minister agreed that the relationship between Afghanistan and Britain should be further strengthened [...] The president and the prime minister expressed their admiration for the courage and skill of the British military in Afghanistan, and the sacrifices that British forces have made".

After the meeting with Karzai, Cameron held further discussions with his Defense Secretary Liam Fox along with senior civil servants and service chiefs. The UK's contingent of the NATO force in Afghanistan currently numbers around 9,500— the second largest contingent after the United States.

<h3>&lt;a href="French%20teacher%20returns%20home%20after%20being%20held%20in%20Iran%20for%20ten%20months"&gt;French teacher returns home after being held in Iran for ten months&lt;/a&gt; (3:54)</h3>

24-year-old Clotilde Reiss, a French teaching assistant who had been detained in Iran for ten months, returned to France Sunday.

Iranian officials arrested Reiss as she was about to leave the country on July 1, 2009. The arrest came after she had attended a protest regarding the country's elections, with the officials calling her a foreign spy. Reiss was in Iran for a five-month teaching position in Isfahan, and was later sent from Tehran's Evin Prison to the French Embassy on bail. 

During the trial, which included over 100 others who were thought to be trying to start a coup, she pleaded not guilty and said that she only went to the protest because she was curious. Reiss was originally given two five-year sentences of jail time for spying and provoking unrest, but the sentence was reduced to a fine equal to about about USD300,000. Reiss' lawyer said that the money was given on Saturday, freeing the young academic.

Reiss landed at Vélizy – Villacoublay Air Base Sunday afternoon. She met French President Nicolas Sarkozy at the Élysée Palace in Paris shortly after. Sarkozy later released a statement thanking the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for aiding in Reiss' return, but did not elaborate on the role each played.

The governments of both France and Iran have denied rumors that Reiss' freedom was part of a deal involving two Iranians in France. One of the two, Majid Kakavand, was released a couple of weeks ago after France refused on May 5 to extradite him to the U.S. 

The other, Ali Vakili Rad, will likely receive parole and return to Iran later today. Kakavand had supposedly tried to give U.S. goods to the Iranian military, while Rad was responsible for the assassination of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in 1991.

<h2>On this day in history (6:09)</h2>

It was 30 years ago today that Mount Saint Helens in Washington State erupted causing massive damage to the landscape and killing 57 people, as well thousands of animals and damaging or destroying more than 4 billion board feet of timber, mainly by the lateral blast. 

The eruption was classified on the 9 point Volcanic Explosivity Index as a VEI 5 event, meaning an event that releases a volume of at least 1 cubic kilometer with immediate exceptional effects on the surrounding area. Such events average about once per 50 years around the globe and Mt. St. Helens was the only significant eruption to occur in the lower 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California which was actually slightly more powerful.

The event began back on March 15, 1980 with the detection of several small earthquakes which indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano. Prior to this, Mount. St. Helens had remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s. Then on March 18 at 3:45 p.m. local time, a shallow 4.2 magnitude earthquake, centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return after 123 years of hibernation.

A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 4.5 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude 2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.

Then, on March 27th,

</ul>
Two days later, on March 29th, a second, new crater and a blue flame, probably created by burning gases, was observed on the mountain. Static electricity generated from ash clouds rolling down the volcano sent out lightning bolts that were up to two miles long. Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30th, and increasingly strong harmonic tremors were first detected on April 1, alarming geologists and prompting Governor Dixy Lee Ray to declare a state of emergency on April 3.

With scientists now in place all around the mountain, predictions of what may happen became more accurate, especially those of David A. Johnston, a vulcanologist from the United States Geological Survey.

However, not everyone was heading the warnings,

</ul>
For the rest of April and early May a bulge on the mountain was growing 5 to 6 ft per day, and by mid-May it had extended more than 400 feet north. This bulge presumably corresponded to the volume of magma below that was pushing into the volcano, deforming its surface. Geologists announced that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger.

Again, David Johnston,

</ul>
Yet, despite the warnings and visible signs of the mountain preparing to erupt, some people who lived in the area had no intention of leaving. Most famously was Harry R. Truman, the owner of Mount St. Helens Lodge at Spirit Lake, right at the base of the mountain.

</ul>
At 7 a.m. on May 18, USGS vulcanologist David A. Johnston, who had Saturday night duty at an observation post about 6 miles north of the volcano, radioed in the results of some laser-beam measurements he had made moments earlier. Mount St. Helens' activity that day did not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rate of bulge movement, sulfur dioxide emission, and ground temperature readings did not reveal any unusual changes that might have indicated a catastrophic eruption.

Suddenly, at 8:32 a.m., a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide, approximately 10 seconds after the shock. One of the largest landslides in recorded history, the slide traveled at 110 to 155 miles per hour and moved across Spirit Lake's west arm.

</ul>
Most of St. Helens' former north side became a rubble deposit 17 miles long, averaging 150 feet thick. Thousands of trees were torn from the surrounding hillside after the lake was sloshed 800 feet up the hillside. All the water in Spirit Lake was temporarily displaced by the landslide, sending 600-foot high waves crashing into a ridge north of the lake. As the water moved back into its basin, it pulled with it thousands of trees felled by a super-heated wall of volcanic gas and searing ash and rock that overtook the landslide seconds before.

Gary Rosenquist, who was camping 11 miles away from the blast, managed to take a series of photographs of the initial blast which allowed scientists to be able to reconstruct the landslide. 

Rosenquist, and his photographs survived because the blast was deflected by local topography 1 mile short of his location, however, Harry R. Truman and David A. Johnston were not so fortunate; both men were killed in the blast.

The event was the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States. Fifty-seven people were killed and 200 homes, 27 bridges, 15 miles of railways and 185 miles of highway were destroyed. In all, the cost of the eruption was $1.1 billion dollars in damage. 

Then U.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage and said it looked more desolate than a moonscape. A film crew was dropped by helicopter on St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. Their compasses, however, spun in circles and they quickly became lost.

</ul>
In all, Mount St. Helens released 24 megatons of thermal energy, 7 megatons of which was a direct result of the blast. This is equivalent to 1,600 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.

The ash fall created some temporary but major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane was closed for a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted up to 2 weeks as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. 

Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.

Though the area around the eruption was devastated, some life had survived.

In the months and years that followed the blast, scientists were given a unique opportunity to study the biology of the landscape and in 1982, President Ronald Reagan and the U.S. Congress established the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, a 110,000 acre area around the mountain which would allow the region to gradually return to its natural state. In 1987, the U.S. Forest Service reopened the mountain to climbing, though in 2004 it was closed for 2 years during a period of renewed geological activity.

Mount Saint Helens is still considered an active volcano and though it is unknown when it will erupt again, scientists know it is just a matter of time before the next major eruption.

According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NOAA), limited amounts of oil have entered the current, and could reach Florida's coast in as few as six days, although it would be highly diluted by the time it did so. Other estimates place the time before oil reaches Florida as closer to ten days.

Satellite images show oil moving south from the main slick into the current, which is a rapidly-moving body of water that flows from the &lt;a href="Caribbean%20Sea"&gt;Caribbean Sea&lt;/a&gt; towards the &lt;a href="Atlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. The speed of the current is predicted to disperse the oil that is picked up, which would lead to difficulties in tracking it.

NOAA qualified their warning by saying that the amount of oil in question is a small percentage of the total spilled, most of which is to the north of the current. The agency's Scientific Support Coordinator, Charlie Henry, said that "[t]here is some light oil filling the loop current," though he said the agency "expect[s] it to degrade before it comes close to threatening South Florida."

NATO has said that members of the Taleban launched an attack on the US-run Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan earlier today. Varying media reports say that between five to seven foreign service members and at least ten rebels were killed.

NATO said the rebels started their assault before dawn using small arms, rockets, and grenades.

A spokeswoman for the base, Major Virginia McCabe, said the attackers did not gain access to Bagram, but that one building received minor damage, adding that gunfire had become more sporadic by midday.

The Taleban claimed responsibility for the attack; a spokesman for the group said twenty suicide bombers were involved.

Bagram is one of the largest bases in Afghanistan, lying 50 kilometers north of the capital, Kabul. Wednesday's violence comes a day after the Taleban launched an attack on a NATO convoy in Kabul, killing at least eighteen people, including six NATO soldiers, five US troops and one Canadian.

US scientists say that oil from the spill in the Gulf of Mexico has reached the Loop Current, which could propel the oil towards the coast of Florida.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), limited amounts of oil have entered the current, and could reach Florida's coast in as few as six days, although it would be highly diluted by the time it did so. Other estimates place the time before oil reaches Florida as closer to ten days.

The loop current is part of the Gulf Stream and is a warm ocean current in the Gulf of Mexico that flows northward between Cuba and the Yucatán peninsula, moves north into the Gulf of Mexico, loops west and south before exiting to the east through the Florida Straits.

Satellite images show oil moving south from the main slick into the current. The speed of the current is predicted to disperse the oil that is picked up, which would lead to difficulties in tracking it.

NOAA qualified their warning by saying that the amount of oil in question is a small percentage of the total spilled, most of which is to the north of the current. The agency's Scientific Support Coordinator, Charlie Henry, said that "[t]here is some light oil filling the loop current," though he said the agency "expect[s] it to degrade before it comes close to threatening South Florida."

Authorities in Thailand have put around a third of the country, including the capital of Bangkok, under a curfew after leaders of the street protesters known as Red Shirts surrendered.

The curfew is the first in Bangkok in fifteen years, and is to run from 8:00pm to 6:00am local time. As part of the curfew, only government-sanctioned media is to be allowed on television stations. The crackdown by the Thai government comes after army troops entered an area held by protesters and arrested six prominent rebel leaders.

At least six people are confirmed dead after Wednesday's violence, and military operations are expected to continue for at least another night. The government has also authorized security forces to shoot protesters. Around 40 people in total have been killed since the beginning of military operations against protesters last week.

Protesters have set fire to numerous buildings in Bangkok, and the violence has spread to other areas of the country. The second largest shopping center in Southeast Asia was destroyed by fire; Bangkok's stock exchange has been set ablaze. Several other buildings have been evacuated, including those of a state-run television company, Channel 3, which was later set on fire and destroyed, and two other English media companies.

Thailand's Prime Minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, said in an appearance on television that he was "confident and determined to end the problems and return the country to peace and order once again."

Ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra, who most protesters support, warned that the military crackdown could lead to open warfare in Thailand, saying that "[t]here is a theory saying a military crackdown can spread resentment and these resentful people will become guerrillas."

The investigation into the plane crash that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski has revealed that passengers were in the cockpit of the crashed plane. According to the head of the technical commission involved with investigating the crash, Alexei Morozov, the crew of the aircraft had been warned of limited visibility, although it has not been determined whether or not the crew's decision to land had been influenced by the passengers on board. The cause of the crash has not been identified, although the possibility of an explosion or terrorist attack on board the aircraft has been ruled out.

Morozov also said that the crew on board the plane had not been properly trained for the flight, and had been assembled only a few days before the flight. He said that the crew "did not undergo regular simulated training, including the practice of co-ordination and emergency situations during flights."

The overall leader of the investigation, Tatyana Anodina, confirmed that unauthorized people had been in the cockpit near the end of the flight, saying that "in the cockpit there were individuals who were not members of the crew." One person had been identified, although their name has not been released. Anodina said that "[t]he voice of one of them has been identified exactly, the voice of the other, or the others, will require additional information from the Polish side."

The investigation also found that the aircraft involved had been in normal operating condition; Anodina said that "[t]he engines were working up till the moment the plane collided with the ground."

<h3>&lt;a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20allowed%20in%20Portugal"&gt;Same-sex marriage allowed in Portugal&lt;/a&gt; (6:52)</h3>

On Monday, the Portuguese President, Anibal Cavaco Silva, signed into law a bill that allows same-sex marriages, making the predominately Catholic Portugal the eighth country in the world where same-sex marriage is allowed country-wide. The law will become effective within a few days, after publication in the official gazette.

The new law removes the previous legal stipulation that marriage is between two people of different sexes. Gay rights activists note that the law does not include provisions for same-sex couple's parental rights, including adoption, for which they say they will continue to fight.

In 1982, homosexuality was decriminalized in Portugal. In 2001, "civil unions" were granted to same-sex couples and provided certain legal, tax and property rights. However, the União de Facto limited a surviving partners ability to inherit his or her partner's possessions or state pensions.

Portugal will become the sixth country in Europe to legalize same-sex marriages (after Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden). Canada and South Africa also have legalized same-sex marriage.

On the morning of Friday May 19th, 1536, Anne Boleyn was judicially executed upon a scaffold erected on the north side of the White Tower, in front of what is now the Waterloo Barracks in London. She wore a red petticoat under a loose, dark gray gown of damask trimmed in fur and a mantle of ermine.

A few weeks before, on May 2nd, Anne had been arrested and taken to the Tower of London and three days later, Anne and her brother George Boleyn were tried separately in the Tower of London where she was accused of adultery, incest, and high treason.

Anne had been King Henry VIII's second wife, following Catherine whose marriage had been annulled. However, like Catherine, Anne too was unable to bear Henry a son, and thus heir to the throne and so with the help of Thomas Cromwell, the court conspired and spied on her, eventually condemning her with the testimony of a low-born, Flemish musician named Mark Smeaton. 

Smeaton's confession came under the supervised torture of Cromwell who also managed to acquire confessions from some of Anne's higher-born friends, one of whom said that she had had an incestuous affair with her brother. She, of course denied all charges, but the so called evidence against her was too persuasive and she was found guilty.

When Anne climbed the scaffold, she made a short speech to the crowd then knelt upright, in the French style of executions. Her final prayer consisted of her repeating, "To Jesus Christ I commend my soul; Lord Jesus receive my soul." 

According to historian Eric W. Ives, her executioner was so taken by Anne that he was shaken, and found it difficult to proceed with the execution. In order to distract her, he shouted, "Where is my sword?" just before killing her so that Anne would never know the sword was coming.

The execution was swift and consisted of a single stroke.

The Pakistani government has blocked access to Youtube, the popular video-sharing website, citing "growing sacrilegious" content. The move comes after a Pakistani court ordered a temporary block of social networking site Facebook on Wednesday, when a row unfolded concerning a group urging users to draw pictures of the Prophet Mohammed.

The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, the government agency responsible for the operation and maintenance of Pakistani telecommunications, ordered all internet service providers to "completely shut-down" all access to Facebook and YouTube from the interior of Pakistan. According to a spokesman, the agency only did so after "all possible" options had been exhausted.

The spokesman, Khoram Ali Mehran, said that they were "just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court", and that "if the government decides to unblock it, then that's what we will do".

The Facebook user who created the group, entitled "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", said that she had got the idea for the group after watching an episode of South Park on the television channel Comedy Central, in which a line involving the Prophet had been 'bleeped out'. The site was blocked the day before the event was scheduled to take place.

YouTube was blocked in Pakistan in 2008, when material deemed "offensive to Muslims" led to restrictions.

Five paintings, including pieces from Picasso and Matisse, in total valued at almost €100 million, were stolen from the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris overnight on Wednesday.

The thief is believed to have entered the museum by climbing through a window and the museum is investigating how the theft took place despite the presence of guards and a complex security system. The Paris prosecutor's office said that a single masked man was captured on CCTV walking away with the works, which had been removed from their frames with care rather than being sliced out.

Christophe Girard, deputy mayor of Paris with responsibility for culture, told a press conference: "This is a serious crime to the heritage of humanity", adding that the perpetrator or perpetrators were "obviously organised". It is thought that the paintings are too well known to be easily sold and there has been speculation that they will be used as "currency" by criminal gangs, as opposed to having been "stolen for hire" on behalf of a collector. Investigators are questioning museum staff after speculation that the perpetrator may have had assistance from somebody on "the inside".

The museum itself has been closed and cordoned off and the theft is being investigated by an elite French police unit.

The Surf Championship Competition, "Ceremonial Quiksilver Pichilemu 2010", took place on Wednesday in the Chilean city of Pichilemu, which is nicknamed "Capital of the Surf". Waves nine meters high or larger were predicted in Punta de Lobos, 6 kilometers from the urban center of Pichilemu.

Some of the most important surfers were in the championship including the South African Grant "Twiggy" Baker, Hawaiians Jamie Sterling and Mark Healey, as well as the Chilean Ramón Navarro, who won the Master Drop award last December.

"Many of the surfers there have never seen waves like the ones of this 2010 Championship", said Ramón Navarro to La Nación, some minutes before the competition started. He added "I'm prepared and anxious," 

From the 24 surfers in the competition, just six contested in the finals. Chilean Cristián Merelló took top prize and the Peruvian Gabriel Villarán obtained second place. Meanwhile the most-known surfer, Ramón Navarro, just managed to reach semifinals. Diego Medina, also Chilean, received the Big Drop and Surf Spirit awards as recognition given by the other competitors.

More than a thousand people went to Punta de Lobos to attend the championship, including the Mayor of Pichilemu, Roberto Córdova

The competitors accorded to donate US$15,000 (almost 16 million pesos) from the final prize of US$30,000 to help people affected in the Pichilemu area after the February 27 earthquake. 

The tour will continue as the surfers now head to the beaches of California, Peru, South Africa and Hawaii.

In 1622, Sultan Osman II, also known as Osman the Young, died after ruling as Sultan of the Ottoman Empire after a reign of only 4 years.

Osman II had been born in Istanbul and because his mother paid a lot of attention to his education, he became a known poet and had mastered many languages, including Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin and Italian. He ascended the throne at the early age of 14 as the result of a coup d'état against his uncle Mustafa I. 

Despite his youth, Osman II soon sought to assert himself as a ruler and he personally led the Ottoman invasion of Poland during the Moldavian Magnate Wars. However, during the Battle of Khotyn against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's army, Osman II was unable to advance any further and by October 9th, due to lateness of the season and after sustaining heavy losses in several assaults on the fortified Commonwealth lines, he was forced to abandon the siege. The battle ended in a stalemate and a treaty was signed which in some sections favored the Ottomans and others the Commonwealth.

Osman II returned home to Istanbul in shame, blaming the cowardice of the Janissaries, who were infantry units that formed the Ottoman sultan's household troops and bodyguards.

Osman II probably became the first Sultan to identify and attempt to tackle the Janissaries as a praetorian institution doing more harm than good to the modern empire, and he closed their coffee shops which were the gathering points for conspiracies against the throne. He started planning to create a new, loyal and ethnic Turkic army consisting of Anatolian, Mesopotamian and Egyptian Turks and Turkmens. The result was a palace uprising by the janissaries, who promptly imprisoned the young sultan.

On May 20th, an executioner was sent to strangle him but when the cord was thrown over his neck, Osman 'had the presence of mind to slip it with his hand, and knock down the principal executioner; on which his grand vizier, Davut Pasha, seized him by the most sensible part of his body and when Osman fainted with pain he was strangled. Compression of the testicles was a mode of execution reserved by custom to the Ottoman sultans.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="biology"&gt;biologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Venter"&gt;Craig Venter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has announced that he has created the first ever "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASynthetic%20life"&gt;artificial life form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " on Earth at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJ.%20Craig%20Venter%20Institute"&gt;J. Craig Venter Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a U.S. laboratory and research center.

The breakthrough is the culmination of fifteen years of research and builds upon earlier work, research which saw the creation of a synthetic bacterial &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Agenome"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the transplant of a genome from one species of bacteria into a second. "Synthia", a nickname derived from ♡❤synthetic lifeform♡❤, combines these two techniques to create a "new lifeform".

A genome was created using synthetic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Achromosome"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; made from bottles of chemicals, the chromosomes sequenced to create a genome using as a template an existing bacterium. A bacterium from different species then had its own genome removed and the synthetic one transplanted in its place. Venter's achievement is that the new genome switched on and the new cell was able to replicate. A process likened to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Abooting"&gt;booting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of a computer with a new operating system.

Venter's achievement has been dismissed by some as falling short of a true technological breakthrough, claiming that rather than creating a new genome, that he has merely recreated the genome of an existing bacterium: "a technical tour de force" but not breakthrough science, according to Caltech geneticist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Baltimore"&gt;David Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Amongst the possibilities of artificial bacteria talked about are bacteria tailored to solve climate change by taking &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20dioxide"&gt;CO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; out of the atmosphere and to develop new vaccines. More complex organisms could include algae which would both be a source of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abiofuels"&gt;biofuels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and a CO remover. This is not, however, the instant solution to the Earth's major problems. Although enough is now known to duplicate a genome, there is insufficient knowledge as to what the role of individual chromosomes within the genome do. Any advances in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asynthetic%20biology"&gt;synthetic biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to design life forms would require a much greater understanding of how the creation of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProtein"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are coded in a genome's chromosomes.

A strong earthquake hit Chile at approximately at 14:52 local time on Friday. The United States Geological Survey reported that it reached a magnitude of 5.6, at a depth of 7.3 kilometers with the epicenter located 28 kilometers to the south of Pichilemu, a coastal town in the O'Higgins Region about 165km to the southwest of the capital, Santiago. The University of Chile Geological Survey reported it is most likely an aftershock to the March 11 earthquake.

Wikinews reporter Diego Grez, who was in Santa Cruz at the time of the tremor, reported that the power went out for approximately 30 minutes and people evacuated their houses quickly. In Pichilemu, the power also went out, but came back in a few minutes. 

Chile's National Emergencies Office has reported no casualties or structural damage.

Cyclone Laila (LAY-LUH) packing winds of 110 kilometers per hour closed in on the east coast of India on Thursday as tens of thousands of people evacuated their homes, fearing major storm damage.

American biologist Craig Venter has announced that he has created the first ever "artificial life form" on Earth at the J. Craig Venter Institute, a U.S. laboratory and research center.

The breakthrough is the culmination of fifteen years of research and builds upon earlier work, research which saw the creation of a synthetic bacterial genome and the transplant of a genome from one species of bacteria into a second. This new lifeform has been nicknamed "Synthia", a name derived from synthetic life form, and is a combination of these two previous techniques.

A genome was created using synthetic chromosomes made from bottles of chemicals, the chromosomes sequenced to create a genome using as a template an existing bacterium . A bacterium from different species then had its own genome removed and the synthetic one transplanted in its place. Venter's achievement is that the new genome switched on and the new cell replicated to create new cells. A process likened to the booting of a computer with a new operating system.

Venter's achievement has been dismissed by some as falling short of a true technological breakthrough, claiming that rather than creating a new genome, that he has merely recreated the genome of an existing bacterium: "a technical tour de force" but not breakthrough science, according to Caltech geneticist David Baltimore.

Amongst the possibilities of artificial bacteria being talked about, are bacteria tailored to solve climate change by taking CO2 out of the atmosphere and to develop new vaccines. More complex organisms could include algae which would both be a source of biofuels and a CO2 remover. This is not, however, the instant solution to the Earth's major problems. Although enough is now known to duplicate a genome, there is insufficient knowledge as to what the role of individual chromosomes within the genome do. Any advances in synthetic biology to design life forms would require a much greater understanding of how the creation of proteins are coded in a genomes chromosomes.

In 1879, The Naval Battle of Iquique was fought between Chile and the alliance between Peru and Bolivia taking place off the, by then, Peruvian port of Iquique (which is currently Chilean). The battle took place during the War Of The Pacific, also known as the "Saltpeter War", which arose from disputes over the control of territory that contained substantial mineral-rich deposits. 

In the battle, the Peruvian warship Huáscar, commanded by Captain Miguel Grau Seminario, managed to sink the Chilean corvette Esmeralda. 

Esmerelda's commander, Arturo Prat Chacón, died when the iron clad Huáscar rammed his less powerful wooden ship, but he had stood bravely, shouting "To boarding, boys!", before a Peruvian sailor delivered a deadly axe wound to his head. 

Though the Esmeralda was lost and Prat killed, the battle had destroyed many other Peruvian ships, leaving the Huáscar to fight the Chilean Navy alone and with thousands of Chilean youths inspired by Prat's bravery, Chile was reinvigorated and the battle became one of the most important factors leading to victory in the war and Prat eventually became Chile's greatest naval hero.

&lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; Supreme Court Justice &lt;a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;John Paul Stevens&lt;/a&gt; has given federal prosecutors until next Friday to respond to the request of former &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href="Rod%20Blagojevich"&gt;Rod Blagojevich&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Robert&lt;/span&gt; to delay their corruption trial. 

The trial is set to begin on June 3, and many of the charges they face are based on a federal honest-services law. The Blagojevich brothers challenge the &lt;a href="US%20Constitution"&gt;constitutionality&lt;/a&gt; of this law and believe the trial should be delayed until the high court is expected to decide the issue next month. The request had already been denied by District Judge &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Zagel"&gt;James Zagel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeventh%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals"&gt;Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Stevens, who handles appeals from the Seventh Circuit, had three options: reject the request for a delay of trial, grant it, or allow the federal government to respond. He chose the third. 

The decision brings hope to the Blagojevich defense team. "We believe that means he sees this as not frivolous, and he's going to decide it on the merits," said Michael Ettinger, Robert's attorney. "We're somewhat cautiously hopeful he'll do the right thing."

Prosecutors added new charges, including bribery, against the brothers in case the &lt;a href="US%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; finds the honest-services law unconstitutional. They believe the June 3 start date should not be held back.

&lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; astronomer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANicolaus%20Copernicus"&gt;Nicolaus Copernicus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was buried for the second time yesterday, in the &lt;a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; church of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrombork"&gt;Frombork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. Copernicus is considered the founder of modern astronomy, and known for declaring that the Earth revolved around the Sun, contrary to popular belief at the time.

His body was discovered and exhumed in 2005 by Polish archaeologists in a nameless tomb in the same church. After the extraction, the body was sent for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; testing, which confirmed it was Copernicus, who died in 1543.

His funeral was presided over by Archbishop &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%B3zef%20Kowalczyk"&gt;Józef Kowalczyk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In his time, Copernicus was considered a heretic due to his theory, which was published shortly before his death.

He studied in the &lt;a href="Krak%C3%B3w"&gt;Kraków&lt;/a&gt; University and in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABologne"&gt;Bologne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; University. In his work &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADe_Revolutionibus_Orbium_Coelestium"&gt;♡❤De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; he demonstrated, through mathematical and astronomical calculations, that the planets &amp;ndash;including Earth&amp;ndash; rotated around the Sun.

&lt;a href="Toronto%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; police are currently investigating human remains encapsulated in concrete from Lake Ontario. A barrel held the concrete-encased body found offshore at the Toronto waterfront. The neighbouring area is currently under development for another new city park as the harbourfront is a popular tourist destination.

Detective Justin Vander Heyden stated that the barrel holds "a victim of murder, encased in concrete", and that he has "a good idea of who's in the barrel" but conclusive information should be forthcoming by Tuesday from the coroner's office.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20provincial%20police"&gt;Ontario provincial police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (OPP) are also investigating two other bodies this long weekend in May. Human remains were found in a construction area near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarrie%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Barrie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and a body was also found near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHuntsville%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Huntsville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a roadside ditch. A firebombing at a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Bank%20of%20Canada"&gt;Royal Bank of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; branch in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has resulted in an urgent call for OPP re-inforcements. Ontario security has been increased in preparation for the June 26-27 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20G-20%20Toronto%20summit"&gt;G20 summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMetro%20Toronto%20Convention%20Centre"&gt;Metro Toronto Convention Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the G8 summit in Huntsville and the ensuing arrival of international leaders and delegations.

<h1>New BP oil spill plan</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20BP%20oil%20spill%20plan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; energy company &lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; will be attempting a "top kill" on the leaking Deepwater Horizon oil well by firing a mud and cement mixture into the blowout preventer on the sea floor later this week. If successful, the oil well will be closed off with cement. A backup plan in case of failure (there is an estimated 30–40% chance of failure) would be another containment apparatus. 

BP has been using the oil dispersant &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acorexit"&gt;corexit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to disperse the oil film into small droplets which mix with the seawater. A riser insertion tube inserted into the largest oil leak site is collecting between 1,360 to 2,000 barrels of oil per day. Two relief oil wells are also currently under construction for what is hoped will be a permanent solution to the oil spill. This pair will take about 90 days to complete.
$500 million will be forthcoming from BP for the gulf spill's impact on the environment and damage to regional ecosystems as far as where water currents may spread the oil. BP also put forward a ten-year research plan to study the long-term effects of the oil spill on the environment.
Controlled surface oil burns and skimming have removed some of the oil spill. It is estimated that 5,000 barrels of oil a day are leaking from the ruptured pipe 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) below sea level. A Natural Resources Defense Council marine biologist, Lisa Suatoni, said that only about 7 to 10 percent of oil from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AExxon%20Valdez"&gt;Exxon Valdez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spill was cleaned up in 1989.

Louisiana Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Jindal"&gt;Bobby Jindal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wants an emergency permit for dredges which will contain the pollution. Homeland Security secretary, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJanet%20Napolitano"&gt;Janet Napolitano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is seeking viable options which may be more effective and better for the environment. 

“I am angry and I am frustrated that BP has been unable to stop this well from leaking and to stop the pollution from spreading. We are 33 days into this effort, and deadline after deadline has been missed,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Salazar"&gt;Ken Salazar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"This is a complex operation requiring sophisticated diagnostic work and precise execution. As a result, it involves significant uncertainties and it is not possible to assure its success or to put a definite timescale on its deployment." said BP. "We’re doing things that have never been done before at that kind of depth, so it’s very fluid. We’re not going to do it until we’re completely sure it’s right."

The oil rig ♡❤&lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon"&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ suffered a gas explosion and sank April 22, 2010 off the coast of &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; resulting in 11 persons missing (and presumed dead) of the 126 on board. BP and its business vendors were completing a new oil well at the time, constructing a layer of cement in the well to reinforce it, which resulted in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlowout%20%28well%20drilling%29"&gt;blowout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Today on Wikinews : A state of emergency declared in Kingston, Jamaica; the black boxes from the airliner that crashed in India have been recovered; North and South Korean tensions heat up; and a 13 year old summits the highest peak on Earth. 

Today is Monday, May 24th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="State%20of%20emergency%20declared%20in%20Kingston%2C%20Jamaica"&gt;State of emergency declared in Kingston, Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; (0:30)</h3>

A state of emergency has been declared in Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, after gunmen besieged and fired at police stations, injuring at least two police officers and a civilian, killing another man. Rioters have erected barricades in the city and one police station was set on fire when it was abandoned after officers ran out of ammunition.

The violence comes after the Jamaican authorities announced that they would extradite Christopher Dudus Coke, an alleged drug lord, to the United States on drugs and firearms charges. However Coke is seen by members of the impoverished Tivoli Gardens neighborhood as a "godfather" like figure, who fulfills roles that the government does not, and his supporters have vowed to protect him, one demonstrator stating "we are willing to die for Dudus,".

The Jamaican police accuse the alliance of gunmen from communities across the island state of a desire to "launch coordinated attacks on the security forces" and urged citizens to evacuate the Tivoli Gardens and Denham Town areas of the city.

Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding called the attacks "a calculated assault on the authority of the state" and promised that "[t]he criminal element who have placed the society under siege will not be allowed to triumph".

<h3>&lt;a href="%26quot%3BBlack%20boxes%26quot%3B%20pulled%20from%20Air%20India%20plane%20wreckage"&gt;"Black boxes" pulled from Air India plane wreckage&lt;/a&gt; (1:50)</h3>

The black boxes from an Air India flight that crashed into a valley near the southern Indian city of Mangalore Saturday, killing 158 of the 166 on board, have been found by investigators. The flight data recorder was recovered late yesterday and the cockpit voice recorder was located today.

At the end of Sunday, 146 of the 158 bodies have been identified, and all have been recovered.

According to reports, the plane touched down at Mangalore's Bajpe airport, overshooting the touchdown point by several thousand feet with one tire not hitting the runway at all. This was followed by sudden braking occurred, the airliner's wings hitting a neighboring cliff, and the plane careening into a heavily forested ravine where it then burst into flames.

The black boxes record communication data, technical information such as speed and altitude, as well as conversation in the airplane cockpit, which could help investigators determine why the jet crashed. This data is, according to one investigator's statement, "vital in finding information about key details like the last moments of the flight and whether there was any error from the pilot's side. The box will be brought to the accident lab of the Director General of Civil Aviation in the national capital where it will be opened and to find out what exactly went wrong,".

The Air India Express Boeing 737-800, which had departed from Dubai of the United Arab Emirates, was bound for Mangalore in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. The Bajpe airport has a "tabletop" runway which means it is set atop a hill surrounded by a deep gorge. The airport, which was constructed in 2006, has seen over 32,000 successful landings since opening.

Tensions between North and South Korea are heating up.

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20and%20South%20Korea%20to%20conduct%20naval%20exercises%20in%20response%20to%20warship%20sinking"&gt;US and South Korea to conduct naval exercises in response to warship sinking&lt;/a&gt; (3:43)</h3>

Following a report blaming North Korea for the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel in March, the United States and South Korea plan to hold joint naval exercises "in the near future."

The exercises are planned to focus on anti-submarine patrols, as well as improving both country's ability to detect shipments of nuclear material, which are currently banned. According to analysts, the patrols are not intended to serve to intimidate North Korea; rather, they are considered a gesture of support towards the South. The announcement marks the first response from the US military to the incident, although economic measures were announced earlier today.

Several hours before the announcement of military patrols, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak announced economic measures against North Korea in response to the attack. The measures, endorsed by the US government, include the following:

The moves are considered the most aggressive steps South Korea could take short of war. In a statement, President Lee said that "[w]e have always tolerated North Korea’s brutality, time and again. But now things are different. North Korea will pay a price corresponding to its provocative acts. Trade and exchanges between South and North Korea will be suspended."

The United States has not said what measures it will take in response to the incident beyond the announced naval patrols. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is to meet with President Lee on Wednesday, after which she will announce the US response.

North Korea has continually denied its involvement in the warship's sinking, and the country's military released a statement warning that "[i]f [South Korea] sets up new tools for psychological warfare such as loudspeakers and leaves slogans for psychological warfare intact, ignoring our demands, we will directly aim and open fire to destroy them."

A North Korean military commander told the state newspaper that "[m]ore powerful physical strikes will be taken to eradicate the root of provocation if [South Korea] challenges to our fair response."

<h3>&lt;a href="Body%20cemented%20in%20barrel%20found%20in%20Toronto%20harbour"&gt;Body cemented in barrel found in Toronto harbour&lt;/a&gt; (6:13)</h3>

In Toronto, Ontario, police are currently investigating human remains which are encapsulated in concrete and found in Lake Ontario. A barrel holding the concrete-encased body was found offshore at the Toronto waterfront.

Detective Justin Vander Heyden stated that the barrel holds "a victim of murder, encased in concrete", and that he has "a good idea of who's in the barrel" but conclusive information should be forthcoming by Tuesday from the coroner's office.

Ontario provincial police (OPP) are also investigating two other bodies. Human remains were found in a construction area near Barrie and a body was found near Huntsville in a roadside ditch.

Ontario security has been increased for the June 26-27 G20 summit at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and the G8 summit in Huntsville in preparation for the ensuing arrival of international leaders and delegations.

<h3>&lt;a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus%20buried%20again"&gt;Nicolaus Copernicus buried again&lt;/a&gt; (7:12)</h3>

Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus was buried for the second time yesterday, in the Catholic church of Frombork, Poland. Copernicus is considered the founder of modern astronomy, and known for declaring that the Earth revolved around the Sun. In his time, Copernicus was considered a heretic due to his theory, which was published shortly before his death.

His body was discovered and exhumed in 2005 by Polish archaeologists in a nameless tomb in the same church. After the extraction, the body was sent for DNA testing, which confirmed it was Copernicus, who died in 1543.

<h3>&lt;a href="British%20ventriloquist%20Ray%20Alan%20dies%20at%20age%2079"&gt;British ventriloquist Ray Alan dies at age 79&lt;/a&gt; (7:51)</h3>

British ventriloquist Ray Alan has died at the age of 79 in his sleep, according to his agent. 

Alan was best known for his sketches with his puppet, Lord Charles and he received the majority of his fame in the 1950’s and 60’s appearing on several children's television shows including the serial The Good Old Days. Later in his career he worked as an entertainer on the QE2 Cruise ship and he stopped work in 2008 due to ill health.

Peter Pritchard, Alan’s agent for 30 years, released a statement saying that “Technically he was regarded as Britain’s top ventriloquist."

In 2006, Alan spoke to the BBC about his puppet stating that “I'm not one of those ventriloquists who thinks he's real. When I finish my work I put it back in the tool box and I don't take it out again until the next job.”

<h3>&lt;a href="California%20teen%20becomes%20youngest%20to%20conquer%20Everest"&gt;California teen becomes youngest to conquer Everest&lt;/a&gt; (8:44)</h3>

Jordan Romero, a thirteen-year-old alpinist from Big Bear Lake, California, is the youngest person to have summited Mount Everest, according to reports circulated by the Associated Press quoting a spokesman based in the United States. The expedition included the boy's father, stepmother, and three Sherpa guides.

Romero ascended 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) breaking the record for the youngest climber on Everest previously set by a 16 year old from Nepal.

"It's something I've always wanted to do before I die — I just happen to be doing it at this age. I happen to be going for a world record. But I just want to climb it," Jordan told AFP reporters before embarking on the trek. On the same day, mountaineer Apa Sherpa, from Nepal, scaled Everest for the 20th time breaking a personal record.

It is anticipated that additional information will become available once the summit team returns to camp on the Tibet side of the mountain.

Finally, in sports and continuing our coverage of Australian Rules Football,

<h3>(9:41)</h3>

the Gippsland Football League's representative team traveled to Bendigo to play the hosts as part of the Victorian Country Football League Country Championships over the weekend. The match was part of a double header with Murray Football League playing Bellarine Football League in the curtain raiser.

The VCFL's Country Championships is an inter-league competition where each of the sixteen major leagues as well as the Mallee, Horsham &amp; District, Geelong &amp; District and Heathcote-District leagues are ranked from one to twenty. A league is promoted if they win, demoted if they lose.

Kane Fraser (Sale), Kal Killoran (Maffra) and Tim Aitken (Traralgon) were called into the Gippsland team after injuries and illness to Sale forward Brenton Martin, Morwell coach Adrian Cox and Traralgon's Micheal Geary.

Scores are quoted as goals-behinds (total). Goals are worth six points, behinds are worth one.

Inaccurate goal kicking from Gippsland cost the visitors the match as Bendigo won 15–11 (101) to Gippsland's 12–20 (92). Had three of Gippsland's behinds gone through the goals, they would have won by one goal (six points).

Dwayne Holt with five goals and Chris Dunne with two goals were the only multiple goal kickers for the visitors. For Bendigo, Justin Maddern with four goals and Grant Weeks and Steven Stroobants with two goals each were the multiple goal kickers.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Byrne"&gt;David Byrne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the former lead singer of 1980s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aart%20punk"&gt;art punk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; band &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATalking%20Heads"&gt;Talking Heads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is suing &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Crist"&gt;Charlie Crist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over the latter's use of the Talking Heads song "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoad%20to%20Nowhere"&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " in an election commercial. Byrne alleges that Crist made use of the song in a campaign commercial without the artist's permission, and that if permission had been asked Byrne would have declined it.

Byrne told the BBC that the lawsuit, in which the musician is claiming &lt;a href="United%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1 million in damages, is "not about politics, it's about &lt;a href="copyright"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt;". In his personal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , though, Byrne commented: "Besides being theft, use of the song and my voice in a campaign ad implies that I, as writer and singer of the song, might have granted Crist permission to use it, and that I therefore endorse him and/or the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , of which he was a member until very, very recently." Governor Crist is running for election to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aindependent%20%28politician%29"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The lawsuit was filed early Monday afternoon in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATampa"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and has been assigned Case Number 8:10-CV1187-T26 (MAP). Byrne is represented by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Iser"&gt;Lawrence Iser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the attorney who represented &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJackson%20Browne"&gt;Jackson Browne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when Browne successfully sued &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a similar lawsuit in 2008.

The advertisement, which premiered on January 12, 2010 and has since been withdrawn from use, attacked politician &lt;a href="Marco%20Rubio"&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt; over reversals in Rubio's public positions. The video has been blocked on video hosting site &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "due to a copyright claim by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Music%20Group"&gt;Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

Governor Crist's campaign had no comment on the lawsuit.

Today on Wikinews : BP attempts a "top kill" on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico; musician David Byrne sues Florida's governor over a campaign song; Slipknot bassist Paul Gray is found dead in hotel room in Iowa; and, in history - don't panic, it's Towel Day!

Today is Tuesday, May 25th, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="New%20BP%20oil%20spill%20plan"&gt;New BP oil spill plan&lt;/a&gt; (0:33)</h3>

The British energy company BP will be attempting a "top kill" on the leaking Deepwater Horizon oil well by firing a mud and cement mixture into the blowout preventer on the sea floor later this week. If successful, the oil well will be closed off with cement. A backup plan in case of failure (there is an estimated 30–40% chance of failure) would be another containment apparatus.

BP has been using the oil dispersant corexit to disperse the oil film into small droplets which mix with the seawater. A riser insertion tube inserted into the largest oil leak site is collecting between 1,360 to 2,000 barrels of oil per day. Two relief oil wells are also currently under construction for what is hoped will be a permanent solution to the oil spill. This pair will take about 90 days to complete.

$500 million will be forthcoming from BP for the gulf spill's impact on the environment and damage to regional ecosystems as far as where water currents may spread the oil. BP also put forward a ten-year research plan to study the long-term effects of the oil spill on the environment.

Controlled surface oil burns and skimming have removed some of the oil spill. It is estimated that 5,000 barrels of oil a day are leaking from the ruptured pipe 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) below sea level. A Natural Resources Defense Council marine biologist, Lisa Suatoni, said that only about 7 to 10 percent of oil from the Exxon Valdez spill was cleaned up in 1989.

Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal wants an emergency permit for dredges which will contain the pollution and homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, is seeking viable options which may be more effective and better for the environment.

In a highly publicized statement, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar stated, "I am angry and I am frustrated that BP has been unable to stop this well from leaking and to stop the pollution from spreading. We are 33 days into this effort, and deadline after deadline has been missed”.

BP also released a statement saying, "This is a complex operation requiring sophisticated diagnostic work and precise execution. As a result, it involves significant uncertainties and it is not possible to assure its success or to put a definite timescale on its deployment."

The oil rig Deepwater Horizon suffered a gas explosion and sank April 22, 2010 off the coast of Louisiana resulting in 11 persons missing (and presumed dead) of the 126 on board. BP and its business vendors were completing a new oil well at the time, constructing a layer of cement in the well to reinforce it, which resulted in the blowout.

<h3>&lt;a href="6.5%20magnitude%20earthquake%20hits%20Acre%2C%20Brazil"&gt;6.5 magnitude earthquake hits Acre, Brazil&lt;/a&gt; (3:16)</h3>

A 6.5 magnitude earthquake occurred in Acre, a Brazilian state 125 kilometers east-southeast of Cruzeiro do Sul, at 11:18am local time and at a depth of 565.3 kilometers, according to the United States Geological Survey.

A civil defense service spokesman in Cruziero do Sul reported to Times Live that the quake was unnoticed, adding, "This zone suffers a lot of earthquakes, but the last one we really felt was 20 days ago. We didn't register any disorder or damage on the surface,".

An official of Brazil's Seismological Observatory told the news agency AFP, "Generally speaking, quakes more than 500 kilometres deep don't leave signals in the surface, they are only detected by instruments,".

<h3>&lt;a href="Washington%20politician%20Dino%20Rossi%20to%20announce%20US%20Senate%20bid"&gt;Washington politician Dino Rossi to announce US Senate bid&lt;/a&gt; (4:05)</h3>

Former Washington Republican state legislator Dino Rossi is to announce on Wednesday that he is running for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Democratic Senator Patty Murray. The story broke Tuesday morning with reports that Rossi had begun hiring senior campaign staffers including Pat Shortidge, who most recently worked on Marco Rubio's Senate campaign in Florida.

While Rossi failed twice at winning the Washington State governor's office in 2004 and 2008, a poll by the University of Washington in early May 2010 showed that a Senate race between Patty Murray and Dino Rossi would be close. Meanwhile, several other Republicans in Washington State have already declared their intentions to run against Murray. A Rossi announcement this Wednesday could cause some turmoil within the Washington State Republican party, as other candidates have already gathered key endorsements and are moving forward with their campaigns.

Washington State will have a primary election on August 17, where the two candidates who get the most votes will advance to the general election in November.

<h3>&lt;a href="Ukrainian%20basketball%20player%20Alexander%20Belostenny%20dies%20at%20age%2051"&gt;Ukrainian basketball player Alexander Belostenny dies at age 51&lt;/a&gt; (5:10)</h3>

Ukraine's basketball federation announced that Ukrainian basketball player Alexander Belostenny has died of lung cancer in Germany at the age of 51. 

Belostenny was a key player on the Soviet Union basketball team and was both a European and Olympic medalist. He won gold in the 1979, 1981 and 1985 European championships and gold in the 1982 FIBA World Championship. He won an Olympic gold medal in 1988.

After retiring in 1994 he opened his own restaurant in Germany.

<h3>&lt;a href="Slipknot%20bassist%20Paul%20Gray%20found%20dead%20in%20hotel%20room%20at%20age%2038"&gt;Slipknot bassist Paul Gray found dead in hotel room at age 38&lt;/a&gt; (5:44)</h3>

In America, bassist of the heavy metal band Slipknot, Paul Gray, was found dead in his hotel room in Iowa. His body was found around 10:50 Monday morning by a hotel employee. 

Chris Diebel, the spokesman for the hotel where Gray was found, released a statement saying “Gray checked into the extended-stay hotel on Saturday and was scheduled to check out today”. He added that Gray had “stayed at the hotel before and was remembered as being a quiet and respectful guest.”

Gray started with Slipknot when it formed in 1995. In 1996, they released their first album, which sold over a million copies worldwide. Over the following years, the group received seven Grammy award nominations and won one in 2006 for “Best Metal Performance” with “Before I Forget”. 

Slipknot became famous for its artistic live performances and the iconic masks that all band members wore in public. Gray was known by his fans by either his band number #2 or his nickname “The Pig”. Along with drummers Joey Jordison and Shawn Crahan, Gray was one of only three original members of Slipknot that still remained in the band.

An autopsy, including toxicology reports, is due later today, however, police investigating the death say that no foul play is suspected.

<h3>&lt;a href="Musician%20David%20Byrne%20sues%20Florida%20governor%20over%20campaign%20song"&gt;Musician David Byrne sues Florida governor over campaign song&lt;/a&gt; (7:01)</h3>

David Byrne, the former lead singer of 1980s art punk band Talking Heads, is suing Florida governor Charlie Crist over the latter's use of the Talking Heads song "Road to Nowhere" in an election commercial. Byrne alleges that Crist made use of the song in a campaign commercial without the artist's permission, and that if permission had been asked Byrne would have declined it.

Byrne told the BBC that the lawsuit, in which the musician is claiming $1 million in damages, is "not about politics, it's about copyright".

The lawsuit was filed early Monday afternoon in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Tampa and Byrne is represented by Lawrence Iser, the attorney who represented Jackson Browne when Browne successfully sued Arizona Senator John McCain in a similar lawsuit in 2008.

The advertisement, which premiered on January 12, attacked politician Marco Rubio over reversals in Rubio's public positions. The video has been been withdrawn from use and was blocked on the video hosting site YouTube "due to a copyright claim by Warner Music Group."

Governor Crist's campaign had no comment on the lawsuit.

You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.

More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with."

— Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

A motorist was injured during a collision that resulted in a rollover in the city of &lt;a href="Naperville%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Naperville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The accident occurred at about 8:15 am (13:15 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) on the interchange of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIllinois%20Route%2059"&gt;Illinois Route 59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2088%20%28west%29"&gt;Interstate 88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Naperville police reported that Pavitra Durgam, a 26-year-old from &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, was traveling southbound on Route 59 and tried to turn left onto the ramp to Interstate 88. In doing so, she cut in front of a car heading north on Route 59. The other, currently unidentified driver swerved to avoid her, hit a curb, and collided with her car anyway. 

Northbound traffic on Route 59 north of Diehl Road, including the entrance into eastbound Interstate 88, was blocked as crews cleaned up the area of the collision. The unidentified motorist complained of back pain and was thus sent to nearby Edward Hospital. Durgam received a citation for failing to yield to oncoming traffic as she turned.

&lt;a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;Space Shuttle Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; landed Wednesday, May 26, at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, after 11 days, 18 hours and 4.8 million miles in space on mission &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASTS-132"&gt;STS-132&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The shuttle landed at 08:48:18 EDT (12:48 UTC), on runway 33 of the Shuttle Landing Facility for the last time Wednesday. Speaking of the smooth landing, Mission Control said, "That was pretty sweet. That was a suiting end to an incredible mission." "It was smooth as silk. We were clearly riding in the middle of a fireball, and it was spectacular. The windows, all of them, were bright, brilliant orange. One of the neatest things was when we flew right into orbital sunrise," STS-132 Commander Ken Ham said of the landing.

Mission STS-132 carried the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARassvet%20%28ISS%20module%29"&gt;Russian-built Mini Research Module ♡❤Rassvet♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and an Integrated Cargo Carrier-Vertical Light Deployable (ICC-VLD) to the &lt;a href="International%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, and featured three spacewalks, after docking with the station on Flight Day 3, May 16. 

It was Space Shuttle Atlantis' 32nd mission and also its last, completing almost 25 years of service. Along with Atlantis, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttles%20Endeavour"&gt;Space Shuttles Endeavour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will also be retired in 2010. The shuttles will be shown at museums around the country.

<h1>Oil spill in Alaska closes 800 miles of pipeline</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Oil%20spill%20in%20Alaska%20closes%20800%20miles%20of%20pipeline&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

800 miles of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrans-Alaska%20Pipeline%20System"&gt;Trans-Alaska Pipeline System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were closed down following a spill of thousands of barrels of crude oil south of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFairbanks"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. A power failure following a routine fire-command system test caused relief valves to open and crude oil overflowed near the Fort Greely pump station 9. The valves opening allowed a pressure release for the system and oil flowed on a pad to a tank that can hold 55,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons). As of Wednesday afternoon, the tank vents were still leaking probably from thermal expansion inside the tank. Another secondary containment area below the tanks capable of holding 104,500 barrels was not yet filled to capacity. 

The spill coordinator for the Department of Environmental Conservation, Tom DeRuter, said that the oil spill contamination should be confined to the graveled oil containment liner. "Safety is their No. 1 objective right now. As soon as it is safe to move in, then they'll get the power on and try to empty that tank out. As long as everything is in that liner, it gives us time," DeRuter explained.

40 people had been evacuated from the Fort Greely site, and the Prudhoe Bay station has been reduced by 84%. "We're going to take as long as we need to make sure the site is safe before we start back up," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlyeska%20Pipeline%20Service%20Company"&gt;Alyeska Pipeline Service Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spokesperson Michele Egan. There is capacity in reserve tanks for 48 hours during this slow down of production.

About 650,000 barrels per day run through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline between Prudhoe Bay to the Port of Valdez oil tankers. The majority of shares in Alyeska are held by &lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP Exploration, Alaska (BPXA)&lt;/a&gt; which is also currently addressing the &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill"&gt;Deepwater Horizon oil spill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.

BP addressed a &lt;a href="%26quot%3BMassive%26quot%3B%20oil%20spill%20in%20Alaska"&gt;267,000 gallon crude oil spill&lt;/a&gt; in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska in 2006 resulting in &lt;a href="US%20government%20files%20lawsuit%20against%20BP%20Exploration%20in%20Alaska"&gt;a lawsuit against BP Exploration&lt;/a&gt;.
