<h1>US claims North Korea helped Syria build reactor bombed by Israel</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20claims%20North%20Korea%20helped%20Syria%20build%20reactor%20bombed%20by%20Israel&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Members of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; were briefed today on &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; intelligence that alleges that &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; has been taking part in proliferation with &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; by helping them build and use a nuclear reactor located in the Syrian desert.

According to news reports, citing sources familiar with matter, members of Congress viewed a video purporting to show North Korean workers at the Syrian plant. The plant was &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Orchard"&gt;destroyed in a airstrike&lt;/a&gt; last September by &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href="w%3AF-15E%20Strike%20Eagle%23F-15I"&gt;F-15I&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href="w%3A69%20Squadron%20IAF"&gt;69 Squadron IAF&lt;/a&gt;. 

The video allegedly also shows that the reactor core design is identical to that of North Korea's &lt;a href="w%3AYongbyon%20Nuclear%20Scientific%20Research%20Center"&gt;Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center&lt;/a&gt; reactor.

In a statement released to reporters the US government said, "We are convinced, based on a variety of information, that North Korea assisted Syrian covert nuclear activities both before and after the reactor was destroyed."

Syria has remained quiet over the incident and the area was bulldozed and the building later rebuilt around January. They have also disallowed international inspectors to visit the area, giving rise to suspicions that the Syrians are covering up something.
The Syrian ambassador to the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASami%20Khiyami"&gt;Sami Khiyami&lt;/a&gt;, has dismissed accusations by the United States that it is helping to build a reactor there that could produce plutonium. "This has nothing to do with North Korea and Syria. They just want to exert more pressure on North Korea. This is why they are coming up with this story." Khiyami said.

He added, "The cooperation between North Korea and Syria has nothing to do with [building] a nuclear facility. Cooperation is mainly economic."

The Syrian ambassador to the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, Bashar Jaafari, concurred by saying, "There was no Syria-North Korea cooperation whatsoever in Syria. We deny these rumours." Syria itself has denied cooperation with North Korea and is suggesting the video has been faked.

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, there are suggestions inside the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20State%20Department"&gt;United States State Department&lt;/a&gt;, that the release of this video is an attempt by hardliners inside the &lt;a href="w%3APresidency%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;, including Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, to undermine the &lt;a href="w%3Asix-party%20talks"&gt;six-party talks&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea%27s%20nuclear%20program"&gt;North Korea's nuclear program&lt;/a&gt;.

"Making public the pictures is likely to inflame the North Koreans,” one senior administration official said off the record. "And that’s just what opponents of this whole arrangement want, because they think the North Koreans will stalk off," he added.
&lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20R.%20Hill"&gt;Christopher R. Hill&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AAssistant%20Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20East%20Asian%20and%20Pacific%20Affairs"&gt;Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs&lt;/a&gt; and the US negotiator in the six-party talks, believes the Syrian incident is a sideshow and that the more important issue is to stop North Korea from producing more plutonium and give up what it has.

Dick Cheney's office and other conservatives have said that a proposed deal, negotiated by Hill in the six-party talks, is unbalanced in favor of North Korea. According to the deal, North Korea would be removed from the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Sponsors%20of%20Terrorism"&gt;State Sponsors of Terrorism&lt;/a&gt; list and have economic sanctions under the &lt;a href="w%3ATrading%20With%20the%20Enemy%20Act"&gt;Trading With the Enemy Act&lt;/a&gt; lifted in return for declaring how much plutonium it has produced.

Representative &lt;a href="w%3APete%20Hoekstra"&gt;Pete Hoekstra&lt;/a&gt;, the ranking member of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Permanent%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Intelligence"&gt;Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, said that as a result of the briefing, the six-party agreements would find it "much harder to go through Congress and get agreements approved." Hoekstra said, "It happened eight months later" than it should have.

"I really believe [that] on an issue that is this critical to the issue of proliferation, to the situation in the Middle East, to what's going on in the six-party talks, and these types of things, Congress needed this information to be a full partner in those efforts," Hoekstra added.

Representative &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Berman"&gt;Howard Berman&lt;/a&gt;, the chairperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs"&gt;Committee on Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; said that details of the briefing were "disturbing" but not a reason to suspend the six-party talks.

"Rather, the information that has been released to the public demonstrates the importance of insisting on a verifiable enforcement mechanism to ensure that North Korea honors its commitments to stop spreading the means to create nuclear weapons and to end its nuclear program permanently," Berman said in a statement released by his office.

On April 22, President Kevin Baugh of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Molossia"&gt;Republic of Molossia&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Amicronations"&gt;micronation&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, announced that his country hosted its first ever official state visit the day before.

&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Duke"&gt;Grand Duke&lt;/a&gt; Paul of the Grand Duchy of Greifenberg, another micronation, arrived in Molossia at 9:39 AM MST (Molossian Standard Time) on Monday. He spent much of the day with President Baugh discussing the current state of the intermicronational community, as well as the League of Small Nations, a near dormant organization dedicated to the prosperity of all land-claiming micronations.

Besides the meeting itself, President Baugh took Grand Duke Paul to nearby &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20City"&gt;Virginia City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; for lunch. Following this, both returned to Molossia where the meeting continued. The visit officially ended late in the afternoon. Some time later, Grand Duke Paul returned to Molossia for an informal dinner. He returned to his country the next day.

The Republic of Molossia and Grand Duchy of Greifenberg are not recognized by any major countries or international organizations. However, both are by other micronations.

In March, Wikinews held an interview with President Baugh.

<h1>US Senate unanimously passes genetic nondiscrimination bill</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Senate%20unanimously%20passes%20genetic%20nondiscrimination%20bill&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In a unanimous 95-0 vote Thursday, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; passed a bill that would forbid employers and health insurance companies from discriminating against someone based on information learned through &lt;a href="w%3Agenetic%20testing"&gt;genetic testing&lt;/a&gt;.

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, described by &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; as "the first major new civil rights bill of the new century," will now be sent back to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, where it could be approved as early as next week. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, who would have to sign the bill for it to become law, has voiced his support for the legislation.

The bill forbids employers from firing, refusing to hire, or otherwise discriminating against employees based on genetic information, such as a family history of a hereditary disease. It also makes it illegal for employers to request genetic information of an employee or the employee's family.

Health insurance companies are also addressed in the bill, which forbids them from requesting genetic information or using such information to set premium rates or determine enrollment eligibility. However, insurance companies would still have the right to base one's health coverage on the actual presence of a genetic disease.
"For the first time we act to prevent discrimination before it has taken firm hold and that's why this legislation is unique and groundbreaking," said &lt;a href="Maine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3AOlympia%20Snowe"&gt;Olympia Snowe&lt;/a&gt;, who sponsored the bill along with Sen. Kennedy and Sen. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Enzi"&gt;Mike Enzi&lt;/a&gt;. Snowe fears the threat of discrimination may discourage people from undergoing genetic testing, which can help to diagnose a wide range of diseases and lead to lifesaving therapy.

Kathy Hudson, director of the &lt;a href="w%3AGenetics%20and%20Public%20Policy%20Center"&gt;Genetics and Public Policy Center&lt;/a&gt;, reports that 92 percent are worried that information gained in genetic testing may be used against them. "After a very long wait," she says, "Americans can now be confident that their genetic information cannot be used by health insurers or employers in harmful or hurtful ways."

One part of the bill addresses this concern. "Federal legislation establishing a national and uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for discrimination," the bill reads, "thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, and new therapies."

&lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Coburn"&gt;Tom Coburn&lt;/a&gt; initially blocked Senate action on the bill, warning that it could potentially lead to excessive lawsuits against employers and insurers. But after changes were made to the bill to ease his concerns earlier this week, he supported the legislation and allowed the Senate to vote on it. "We certainly improved the bill from a liability standpoint," said Coburn, an &lt;a href="w%3Aobstetrician"&gt;obstetrician&lt;/a&gt;.

Similar bills were unanimously passed by the Senate in 2003 and 2005, but in both years the bill stalled in the House. The current bill was passed in the House of Representatives a year ago by a 420-3 vote. A genetic nondiscrimination bill was first introduced 13 years ago by &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; Representatives &lt;a href="w%3ALouise%20Slaughter"&gt;Louise Slaughter&lt;/a&gt;, who says the House will "get it out to the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; as quickly as we can."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Helen%20Thomas%20probes%20White%20House%20on%20torture%3B%20online%20community%20sends%20flowers&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Wednesday, long-time White House correspondent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Thomas"&gt;Helen Thomas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; questioned &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Press Secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bluntly and repeatedly about &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s recent confirmation that he had approved &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; interrogation policies that included &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"Where is everybody?" asked Thomas, apparently frustrated with lack of attention her colleagues had given the issue. The community at the social news site ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Areddit"&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ answered "Here we are"; a message they plan to deliver along with several thousand dollars in flowers and other gifts.

Thomas's questions became front-page news on ♡❤reddit♡❤ this morning, via a ♡❤Think Progress♡❤ blog post that includes a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AC-SPAN"&gt;C-SPAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 2 video clip of Thomas during yesterday's press briefing. Noting the president's repeated assertion that the U.S. does not torture, Thomas characterized the authorized interrogation techniques as torture. 

"Now he has admitted that he did sign off on torture, he did know about it," said Thomas, "so how do you reconcile this credibility gap?" 

Perino reiterated that the "United States has not, is not torturing any detainees in the global war on terror." 
Whether waterboarding, among other techniques, should be categorized as torture has been a subject of political contention in recent months. Thomas was unequivocal, responding to Perino: "That's not my question. My question is, why did he say publicly 'we do not torture', when he really did know that we do?" 

In appreciation of the reporter asking "A REAL QUESTION" (as the headline put it), reddit users (known as "redditors") have collected over $3,000 for the purchase of flowers, edible arrangements and other gifts. Several 'redditors' also claimed to have ordered flowers for Thomas independently.

The bulk of the money was collected through ♡❤Chipin.com♡❤, on a donation page created Micah Fitch, a musician and graphic designer in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. As of publication, the site registered 400 contributors for a total of $3,125. Fitch also created a wiki, ♡❤FlowersWiki♡❤, for organizing the gift purchases and selecting messages to go with them. A large delivery to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; offices of Thomas's employer Hearst Newspapers is being scheduled for Friday morning.

One redditor claims that a friend who works for ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Show"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ is pitching the story to the show's staff.

This is not the first time Thomas has received a high-volume flower gift. In 2006, an e-mail campaign that began on the political website &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Underground"&gt;Democratic Underground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; collected over $2000 and resulted in delivery of 108 dozen roses.

Gavin Webb, a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; City Councilor from the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; party has been suspended from his party and may lose his position as a school governor after making controversial comments on, among other things, the subjects of drugs and prostitution.

When describing his opinion on drugs, Webb said "I believe we should legalise the lot, including the most harmful substance heroin." He also said that the action taken by police on drugs was a "waste of money."

He also called for legalisation of handgun use. "The only person one can trust in protecting one's own life, is oneself. That is why I also advocate that individuals should have the right to carry a handgun," he said.

Mr. Webb also advocated the decriminalisation of driving under the influence and the legalisation of brothels.

On a separate occasion, when speaking on the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Talk%20Live"&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/a&gt; radio show recently, Webb said that he refused to pay some types of tax.

A 15-year-old boy, arrested last Friday in conjunction with criminal threats made on &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, was charged Thursday with seven &lt;a href="w%3AFelony"&gt;felonies&lt;/a&gt; in Pomona Juvenile Court in &lt;a href="w%3APomona%2C%20California"&gt;Pomona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. Prosecutors stated that the teen posted two threats on Wikipedia, saying that six named students as well as members of his school's badminton team would be shot. The court arraignment had initially been set for Tuesday, but was continued until Thursday. ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ interviewed the Wikipedia administrator who contacted police after the threats had been made on the site.

Though officials had said the boy made a full confession that he had made threats to other students via the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, he denied the charges at the Thursday court petition. The court ordered that he remain detained pending a May 9 scheduled appearance before Pomona Juvenile Court. He has remained in custody since his arrest. 

The threats were made via two separate edits to the Wikipedia article about &lt;a href="w%3AGlen%20A.%20Wilson%20High%20School"&gt;Glen A. Wilson High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHacienda%20Heights%2C%20California"&gt;Hacienda Heights&lt;/a&gt;, California on April 16. Wikipedia administrators were made aware of the threats in a post to the "&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AAdministrators%27%20noticeboard/Incidents"&gt;Administrators' noticeboard&lt;/a&gt;" on April 16 by Wikipedia admin Dreadstar. Another Wikipedia administrator, John Reaves, contacted the police in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;, and helped them work with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;Internet service provider&lt;/a&gt; to find more information on the &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; that made the threat. A third Wikipedia administrator, Persian Poet Gal, removed the threats from the edit history of the article after finding out that the student had been arrested.

Students' backpacks were searched prior to entering Glen A. Wilson High School on April 17 and all after-school activities were canceled that day. All classes were canceled April 18, and classes resumed on Monday.

<h2>Interview</h2>

A large series of &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; has hit the northern area of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; recently, particularly in and around the &lt;a href="w%3AReno%2C%20NV"&gt;Reno&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan area. Between the hours of 01:00 &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Daylight%20Time"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt; (08:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) on April 24 and 16:00 PDT (23:00 UTC) on April 25, over 125 earthquakes, ranging in magnitude from 0.7 to 4.2 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20scale"&gt;Richter scale&lt;/a&gt;, hit the Reno area. Six of the earthquakes were of magnitude 3.0 or greater, noticeably shaking local residents. The area has seen at least 500 earthquakes greater than magnitude 0.7 in the last two months; of those, about 45 have exceeded 2.0 on the Richter scale.

Nevada is the third most earthquake-active state in the United States, and the Reno area regularly sees seismological activity. However, recent events, particularly yesterday's series of tremors, have become alarmingly frequent for locals. The recent tremors are also unusual in that the most recent earthquakes have been the largest. The most common earthquake scenario is a large quake followed by smaller aftershocks.

The arsonist responsible for setting fire to the historic &lt;a href="w%3ASungnyemun"&gt;Sungnyemun&lt;/a&gt; gate (more commonly referred to as Namdaemun gate) in &lt;a href="w%3ASeoul"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; in February has been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. The 600-year-old landmark was considred one of the nation's greatest and most iconic, with some sources describing it as the single most important one in the country.

The 69-year-old male defendant has a previous conviction from two years ago for attempting to torch the palace, for which he received a suspended prison sentence and was fined. It is understood he destroyed the Namdaemun gate and attacked the palace over an unconnected land ownership dispute which had angered him. He felt that the &lt;a href="w%3Aeminent%20domain"&gt;compulsory purchase&lt;/a&gt; of his home a decade ago had been inadequatly compensated for by the state.

After the fire, residents left flowers at the scene and wrote grieving notes.

Chae Jong-Gi, who admitted the crime, was told of the seriousness of the offence in a statement by the Seoul district court. "A heavy sentence is inevitable as the accused inflicted unbearable agony on the people and damaged national pride... (The monument was) the treasure among all treasures which had survived all kinds of historic disasters. Even if restored, the gate's originality will never return. Therefore, the nature and consequences of this crime are very serious," said the statement.

The man is thought to have selected the gate as a target due to lax security measures. In the fire's aftermath, officials have been criticised over this and concerns that firefighting efforts were ineffective, and the &lt;a href="w%3ACultural%20Heritage%20Administration"&gt;Cultural Heritage Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s chief resigned to show he accepted responsibility for the blaze.

The two storey gate in &lt;a href="w%3Apagoda"&gt;pagoda&lt;/a&gt; style was constructed in 1398 and despite a 1447 rebuild and multiple renovations still contained original timbers prior to the destruction in the fire. Only the stone base survived.

According to the Cultural Heritage Administration, a reconstruction effort will take two to three years and cost 20 billion &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korean%20won"&gt;won&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;21 million).

At 15:35 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon (23:35 local time), the &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20March%20rocket"&gt;Long March 3C&lt;/a&gt; (CZ-3C) carrier rocket lifted off on its maiden flight, from launch pad 2 at the &lt;a href="w%3AXichang%20Satellite%20Launch%20Center"&gt;Xichang Satellite Launch Centre&lt;/a&gt;. It placed the &lt;a href="w%3ATianlian-1"&gt;Tianlian-1&lt;/a&gt; satellite into a &lt;a href="w%3Ageosynchronous%20transfer%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous transfer orbit&lt;/a&gt;. Tianlian-1, also known as Tian Lian 1 and TL-1, a spacecraft tracking and data relay &lt;a href="w%3Acommunications%20satellite"&gt;communications satellite&lt;/a&gt;, similar in function to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATracking%20and%20Data%20Relay%20Satellite"&gt;Tracking and Data Relay Satellite&lt;/a&gt;s (TDRS), will be used to track and communicate with manned &lt;a href="w%3AShenzhou%20spacecraft"&gt;Shenzhou spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3Alow%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;low Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;. It will be able to cover around half of the spacecraft's trajectory, compared to the 12 percent which can be covered by China's fleet of tracking ships and ground stations. The next Shenzhou mission, &lt;a href="w%3AShenzhou%207"&gt;Shenzhou 7&lt;/a&gt;, is currently scheduled for launch in October. Tianlian-1 is based on the &lt;a href="w%3ADFH-3"&gt;DFH-3&lt;/a&gt; satellite bus.

This is the 19 orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the first this year to be conducted by the People's Republic of China. It is currently believed that China intend to conduct one more launch before the end of April, however due to secrecy surrounding China's space programme, it is difficult to be certain of this.

The Long March 3C is a new version of the &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20March%203"&gt;Long March 3&lt;/a&gt; rocket, which serves as an intermediate between the Long March 3A, and the Long March 3B. It is 55 metres tall, and can place a 3,700 kilogram payload into a geosynchronous transfer orbit.

&lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; congressional candidate Tony Zirkle defended his decision to appear at a Nazi meeting. Zirkle, a personal injury lawyer, is running in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; primary for &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana%27s%202nd%20congressional%20district"&gt;Indiana's 2nd congressional district&lt;/a&gt;.

Zirkle initially created controversy when he gave a speech to the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20National%20Socialist%20Workers%20Party"&gt;American National Socialist Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; on April 20, &lt;a href="Adolf%20Hitler"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;'s birthday. Photos of the event show a picture of Hitler
in the background with a United States flag on one side of the podium and a Nazi flag on the other side and the words "Happy Birthday" on the table in front. In the speech, Zirkle asserted that the pornography industry was run by Jews.

In defending his remarks, Zirkle explained that he saw the location as a valid opportunity to preach his anti-pornography, Christian message and that he would be willing to talk anywhere and noted that he had spoken on an African American radio station. Zirkle also defended his claimed that Jews were involved in pornography. He claimed that in the past male porn stars were generally Jewish but they were now black but the female stars were young white women. Zirkle further asserted that now Jews owned and ran the pornography industry. On his campaign website Zirkle posted a list of links, including a link to &lt;a href="w%3AJew%20Watch"&gt;Jew Watch&lt;/a&gt; which he said backed up views.

When asked if he agreed with the Nazis Zirkle said that he did not know enough about their beliefs to give an opinion. 

Both Republican and Democrats have condemned Zirkle's remarks.

Zirkle had earlier created controversy when he suggested considering bringing back segregation between whites and blacks.

In March, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ held an exclusive interview with &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20third%20party%20presidential%20candidates%2C%202008%23Constitution%20Party"&gt;Max Riekse&lt;/a&gt;, one of the candidates for the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Constitution Party&lt;/a&gt; nomination for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. With the Constitution Party's national convention underway this weekend, we spoke with him one last time before he either becomes his party's candidate or loses.

Riekse is a retired decorated &lt;a href="w%3ALieutenant%20Colonel"&gt;Lieutenant Colonel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; who served in both the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;. He is also a former public school teacher and Assistant Professor of Military Science at &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Michigan%20University"&gt;Western Michigan University&lt;/a&gt;. He has a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20South%20Florida"&gt;University of South Florida&lt;/a&gt; as well as two M.A.s, one in Political Science and International Relations, the other in Education and History. Both are from Western Michigan University.

We asked him if he thinks he has a good shot at winning the Constitution Party nomination and ultimately the presidency. He replied, "I will know Saturday the 26th if I win the nomination of the Constitution Party. As to wining the general election, I'm very sure that I will do far better then we have done in the previous 20 years as a 'third' party. I'm not only more qualified to be commander in chief then either the Democrat or Republican, but will be far better for the country."

When asked about America's illegal immigration problem he replied, "I will send all 20 to 30 million home. End birth right babies; no social security for them, etc. They are here illegally; now what part of that does anyone not understand?"

Riekse is running for president because "the Republicans and Democrats would not be having candidates that would solve the problems we have in this country and I know that I could do a lot better with my 32 years of military experience and over 20 years in Education, both in the K-12 public school venue and teaching at the University level."

<h1>News briefs:April 26, 2008</h1>
It is Saturday, April 26 2008, the time is XX:XX UTC, and this is Wikinews.

<h2>&lt;a href="Helen%20Thomas%20probes%20White%20House%20on%20torture%3B%20online%20community%20sends%20flowers"&gt;Helen Thomas probes White House on torture; online community sends flowers&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

Wednesday saw long-time White House correspondent, Helen Thomas, bluntly questioning press secretary Dana Perino over the U.S. President's recent confirmation that he approved controversial CIA interrogation policies, including waterboarding.

Thomas asserted that a "credibility gap" now existed between the administration's assertion that the United States does not torture, and this admission that certain interrogation techniques were approved by the President.

The attempt to take the White House to task over torture was publicised on the Internet site, Reddit this Friday. As a sign of approval for the journalist's line of questioning visitors to the site have raised over $3,000 USD to send flowers and other well-wishing gifts.

<h2>&lt;a href="UK%20City%20Councillor%20suspended%20from%20party%20after%20expressing%20controversial%20views"&gt;UK City Councillor suspended from party after expressing controversial views&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

British Liberal Democrat councillor, Gavin Webb, has been suspended from the party after making controversial comments on the topics of drugs and prostitution.

On drugs, Webb opined that, "we should legalise the lot, including the most harmful substance heroin". He went on to characterise police action on this issue as a "waste of money". He called for the legalisation of brothels, and handguns, also commenting that driving under the influence of alcohol should be decriminalised.

In addition to the party suspension, Webb may lose his position as a school governor.

<h2>&lt;a href="Series%20of%20earthquakes%20strikes%20Reno%2C%20Nevada%20area"&gt;Series of earthquakes strikes Reno, Nevada area&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

Thursday and Friday saw an unusually large number of earthquakes hit the Reno area of U.S. state Nevada. Over 125 quakes, with several above magnitude 3.0 on the Richter scale, struck during the period. This raises the number of quakes in what is the U.S.' third most seismologically active area to over 500 in the last two months.

Where this is particularly unusual is that quakes have increased in magnitude over time. This differs from the most common earthquake scenario where a large quake is followed by smaller aftershocks.

<h2>&lt;a href="Wikinews%20holds%20a%20follow-up%20interview%20with%20Max%20Riekse%2C%20Constitution%20Party%20candidate%20for%20the%202008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election"&gt;Wikinews holds a follow-up interview with Max Riekse, Constitution Party candidate for the 2008 U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt;</h2>

Wikinews is currently featuring an interview with Max Riekse, one of the hopefuls in the race to obtain the Constitution Party nomination as a Presidential candidate.

Promising to reduce the price of gasoline by building additional refineries, and to apply tariffs to Chinese goods to help the trade imbalance, Riekse is an outspoken candidate. His analysis of the main candidates is scathing, dismissing John McCain as, "not fit to be commander in chief", accusing Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama of being prepared to say anything to get elected.

The full interview can be read on the English Wikinews website, and this weekend's Constitution Party convention will see if Riekse's hopes for the party nomination will come to fruition.

Toronto FC opened up the Nutrilite Canadian Championship with a 1-0 win against Montreal Impact at Saputo Stadium on Tuesday night. 

Reds defender Marco Velez scored the only goal of the game, 1 in tournament history. Velez jumped to head home a cross from Laurent Robert. The goal came in the 72 minute. 

Montreal played for much of the 2 half with 10 men after defender Stefano Pesoli was sent off for a second yellow card. 

Toronto FC striker &lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Dichio"&gt;Danny Dichio&lt;/a&gt; has been struggling with a groin strain in recent weeks and was forced to leave the game before half time. He was replaced by Jarrod Smith.

Toronto FC now prepare to face &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Galaxy"&gt;Los Angeles Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Soccer"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. at BMO Field. Toronto FC play their next Nutrilite Canadian Championship game on July 1 against Vancouver Whitecaps at BMO Field. The Impact's next game is on Friday against the Portland Timbers at Saputo Stadium.

The Wikimedia Board of Trustees recently announced that it would dramatically restructure the makeup of the board. The Board announced that there would now be three seats elected by the Wikimedia community, two seats elected by the Wikimedia chapters, one 'community founder' seat appointed by the Trustees, and four 'specific expertise' seats, also appointed by the Trustees.
Jan-Bart Vreede, Vice Chair of the Board of Trustees, gave ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ more information about the decision in a short email interview, which was carried out yesterday. Below is the text of the interview:

♡❤♡How long was this decision process in the works?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Why did you chose to have a "community foundation person" position, a position not common among other non profits?♡❤♡

♡❤♡ How/when will the elections be held for the new open seats?♡❤♡

At least one person was killed and nearly a dozen were injured after six &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; militants opened fire during a celebration in an assassination attempt on the life of the president of &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt;.

Karzai was taken away by body guards and was uninjured in the attack which happened in &lt;a href="w%3AKabul%2C%20Afghanistan"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;. Several other government diplomats and ministers were also present during the celebration and were uninjured. &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; ambassadors were also present and uninjured.

"Today, the enemies of Afghanistan, the enemies of Afghanistan's security and progress tried to disrupt the ceremony and cause disorder and terror. Fortunately, Afghanistan's military forces surrounded them quickly and arrested some of the suspects," stated Karzai in a statement on national television less than two hours after the attack.

The people of Afghanistan were celebrating the 16th anniversary of the fall of the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AMujahideen"&gt;Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt; during a parade when the militants opened fire from a nearby building using guns and rocket propelled grenades.

At least three of the militants were killed, and the other three were arrested by police.

At 22:16 GMT yesterday (04:16 today local time), a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz-FG"&gt;Soyuz-FG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; /&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFregat"&gt;Fregat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; carrier rocket was launched from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome%20Site%2031/6"&gt;Site 31/6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, carrying the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGIOVE-B"&gt;GIOVE-B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; experimental &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANavigation%20satellite"&gt;Navigation satellite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The launch was conducted by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStarsem"&gt;Starsem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a Russo-European organisation which commercially markets Soyuz-FG and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%202%20rockets"&gt;Soyuz-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; launches. GIOVE-B was successfully deployed into a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amedium%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;medium Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at 02:01 GMT this morning, after an ascent lasting nearly four hours. 

GIOVE-B will serve as a prototype for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGalileo%20positioning%20system"&gt;Galileo positioning system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It is the second such prototype, GIOVE-A is already in orbit, having been launched in December 2005. GIOVE-B was originally scheduled to launch in April 2006, but was delayed for a number of reasons. The next Galileo launch is scheduled to be the first cluster of operational satellites, which will be launched in 2010. The next Soyuz launch will be a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz-U"&gt;Soyuz-U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in mid-may, with a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProgress%20spacecraft"&gt;Progress spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to resupply the &lt;a href="International%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.

This was the 20 orbital launch of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the 24 Soyuz-FG launch, and the 1,732 flight of a Soyuz rocket of any variant.

<h2>Game summaries</h2>
<h3>Colorado Avalanche @ Detroit Red Wings</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AJohan%20Franzen"&gt;Johan Franzen&lt;/a&gt; had a &lt;a href="w%3AHat%20trick%23Ice%20hockey"&gt;hat trick&lt;/a&gt; as he led the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Red%20Wings"&gt;Detroit Red Wings&lt;/a&gt; to a 5&amp;ndash;1 win over the &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%20Avalanche"&gt;Colorado Avalanche&lt;/a&gt;. Franzen opened the scoring at 4:22 of the first period with a powerplay goal. Franzen then put the Red Wings ahead 2&amp;ndash;0 with another powerplay goal, at 4:04 of the second period. Detroit scored two more goals in the second period; &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Theodore"&gt;Jose Theodore&lt;/a&gt;, the starting goaltender for the Avalanche was replaced by &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Budaj"&gt;Peter Budaj&lt;/a&gt; at 10:11 of the second period, when &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Zetterberg"&gt;Henrik Zetterberg&lt;/a&gt; scored to put the Red Wings up ahead 4&amp;ndash;0. &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Laperriere"&gt;Ian Laperriere&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal for the Avalanche, at 2:38 of the third period. Franzen then completed his hat trick with a shorthanded goal, at 8:47 of the third period. Theodore stopped 16 out of 20 shots before he was replaced by Budaj, who stopped 19 out of 20 shots. At the other end, &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Osgood"&gt;Chris Osgood&lt;/a&gt; the same number of shots as each of the Avalanche goaltenders face, stopping 19 out of 20 shots. Detroit leads the series 2&amp;ndash;0.

<h3>Philadelphia Flyers @ Montreal Canadiens</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Biron"&gt;Martin Biron&lt;/a&gt; stopped 34 out of 36 shots as the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;w:Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt; won, on the road, against the &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%20Canadiens"&gt;Montreal Canadiens&lt;/a&gt;, taking home-ice advantage from Montreal. Philadelphia went ahead 2&amp;ndash;0 early in the game, on the strength of &lt;a href="w%3AR.J.%20Umberger"&gt;R.J. Umberger&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Carter"&gt;Jeff Carter&lt;/a&gt;'s goals, at 5:53 at 8:39 of the first period, respectively. However, before the period would end, &lt;a href="w%3ASaku%20Koivu"&gt;Saku Koivu&lt;/a&gt; put Montreal within one goal of tying the game, scoring at 16:18. &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Briere"&gt;Daniel Briere&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal of the second period, putting Philadelphia up ahead 3&amp;ndash;1. At 1:26 of the third period, Montreal came, again, within one goal of tying the game on the strength of &lt;a href="w%3AAndrei%20Markov"&gt;Andrei Markov&lt;/a&gt;'s goal. However, R.J. Umberger would score his second goal of the game to put Philadelphia up 4&amp;ndash;2, at 17:39 of the third period, and that is how the game would end. Martin Biron made 34 out of 36 saves, while his counterpart &lt;a href="w%3ACarey%20Price"&gt;Carey Price&lt;/a&gt; made 19 out of 23 saves. The series is now tied, 1&amp;ndash;1.

Software giant &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has been attempting to purchase &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; giant &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of leveraging the internet presence of Yahoo! in Microsoft's battle with &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. The original offer for Yahoo! was &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;44 billion; however since this offer Microsoft has seen a revenue drop this last quarter which could greatly affect the software giant's ability to up the price again in hopes Yahoo! would accept.
Revenues at Microsoft were down a total of 6%. This includes a 24% drop in revenue from the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows Operating System&lt;/a&gt; alone. Stock prices of both Microsoft and Yahoo! have decreased during the merger discussions. Microsoft's next move is unknown but there has been talk of potentially going directly to the Yahoo! shareholders with a buyout plan.

It is too early to tell how this will end, but Microsoft has made it known that it will try all available routes; up to and including a &lt;a href="w%3AHostile%20takeover"&gt;hostile takeover&lt;/a&gt;. Recent comments from Microsoft CEO &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Ballmer"&gt;Steve Ballmer&lt;/a&gt; and CFO &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Liddell"&gt;Chris Liddell&lt;/a&gt; have mentioned that not acquiring Yahoo! is also an option. Whatever Microsoft's plan is, the longer this takes, the more competitor &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; will likely use this to their advantage is obtaining both clients and employees, says Juan Carlos Perez of &lt;a href="w%3AIDG"&gt;IDG&lt;/a&gt;.

Both Ferrari drivers were on the podium, with Ferrari's &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; finishing right after his teammate.

&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; couldn't maintain the high pace. Having started from second place after Räikkönen, the car's engine failed midway through the race.

&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; drivers took the third row in qualification, but &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; suffered a full speed crash into a wall of tyres during the race. The driver was evacuated to the hospital and is reported to be 'in stable condition'.

His teammate &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; gained third place after the two Ferraris, having qualified in fifth place.

&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; earned 5 points for &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt; finishing immediately after Hamilton.

The rest of the cars to finish did so more than 30 seconds after Räikkönen.

&lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2040"&gt;Launch Complex 40&lt;/a&gt; (LC-40) at the &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station"&gt;Cape Canaveral Air Force Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMerritt%20Island"&gt;Merritt Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; has been demolished. The &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20Service%20Structure"&gt;Mobile Service Structure&lt;/a&gt; (MSS), which was once used to load payloads onto &lt;a href="w%3ATitan%20III"&gt;Titan III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATitan%20IV"&gt;Titan IV&lt;/a&gt; rockets, was toppled by explosive charges at 13:00 GMT (09:00 local time). The launch tower had already been dismantled.

Complex 40 was first used in 1965, for the maiden flight of the &lt;a href="w%3ATitan%20III"&gt;Titan IIIC&lt;/a&gt; rocket. Following the second Titan III launch, it was modified to serve as a launch pad for the US Air Force's &lt;a href="w%3AManned%20Orbiting%20Laboratory"&gt;Manned Orbiting Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (MOL). In November 1966, a &lt;a href="w%3Aboilerplate%20%28rocketry%29"&gt;boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; MOL space station was launched on a Titan IIIC from the complex, along with a &lt;a href="w%3AGemini%20spacecraft"&gt;Gemini capsule&lt;/a&gt;, and four satellites. Following the cancellation of MOL, it was converted back to a regular Titan launch complex, and was used for 55 launches, of Titan IIIC, 34D, and IV rockets. Two planetary probes, two commercial satellites, a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; military communications satellite, and numerous payloads for the American armed forces were launched from the complex, which ceased operations in April 2005, when the penultimate Titan IV launched the &lt;a href="w%3ALacrosse%20%28satellite%29"&gt;Lacrosse-5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aspy%20satellite"&gt;spy satellite&lt;/a&gt; for America's &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Reconnaissance%20Office"&gt;National Reconnaissance Office&lt;/a&gt;. 

Along with Launch Complex 41, which was demolished in 1999, LC-40 was used for heavy-lift &lt;a href="w%3ATitan%20rocket"&gt;Titan rocket&lt;/a&gt; launches. The &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Observer"&gt;Mars Observer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACassini-Huygens"&gt;Cassini-Huygens&lt;/a&gt; missions to &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASaturn"&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt; respectively were launched from Complex 40. The launch pad is being demolished to make way for a new complex, which will be used by the &lt;a href="w%3ASpaceX"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFalcon%209"&gt;Falcon 9&lt;/a&gt; rocket, currently scheduled to make its maiden flight in 2009. As well as being used for commercial launches, the new LC-40 will be used for cargo resupply missions to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, under a &lt;a href="w%3ACommercial%20Orbital%20Transportation%20Services"&gt;Commercial Orbital Transportation Services&lt;/a&gt; (COTS) contract with &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;. It could eventually be used for manned missions using the &lt;a href="w%3ASpaceX%20Dragon"&gt;SpaceX Dragon&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft. SpaceX currently has a five year lease on the site.

A woman in the tiny farming community of &lt;a href="w%3ASaint-R%C3%A9mi%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Saint-Rémi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href="Montreal%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; visited the local cemetery Saturday and received a rude shock. Graffitied on former &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Eliott%20Trudeau"&gt;Pierre Eliott Trudeau's&lt;/a&gt; family crypt were "&lt;a href="w%3AFront%20de%20lib%C3%A9ration%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec"&gt;FLQ&lt;/a&gt;", the initials of the Front de libération du Québec and the French words for "traitor" and "bastard" in black spray-paint.

“It's very sad,” said Pierre Sauriol, whose organization maintains the graveyard. “He made errors and good decisions like everyone, but he was one of the prime ministers of Canada, and he should rest in peace.”

Trudeau, who served as Canada's prime minister from 1968-79 and again in 1980-84, was a controversial figure in the history of &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;.

During the &lt;a href="w%3AOctober%20crisis"&gt;FLQ crisis&lt;/a&gt; in October 1970, Trudeau invoked the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20Measures%20Act"&gt;War Measures Act&lt;/a&gt; after a British diplomat, &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Cross"&gt;James Cross&lt;/a&gt; and a provincial cabinet minister, &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Laporte"&gt;Pierre Laporte&lt;/a&gt; were kidnapped, leading to arrests of any individuals the police thought to be separatists, and to their detentions without bail. Laporte was later strangled to death by the FLQ.

Trudeau, who died in September 2000, is entombed in the grey-stone mausoleum with his parents and 11 other family members.

Mr. Sauriol said this was the first time vandals have left their mark on the crypt.

Police believe the tomb was vandalized sometime on Friday night or early Saturday morning.

The Trudeau crypt, which stands taller than any monument in the cemetery, was cordened off Saturday using orange police tape tied to tombstones. 

Provincial police are searching the area in the hope of finding any clues. They have also measured and taken photos of the graffiti, which was applied to every wall of the structure. The letters “FLQ” on the front of the crypt covered a pair of names on a plaque posted by the door. As of now, there have been no arrests or suspects.

The crypt is located a few metres from a major road and many residents from the town of 6,000 slowed to see the damage as they passed by in their vehicles.

Trudeau's family could not be reached for comment but the head of a prominent nationalist group gave his opinion on the matter, calling the vandalism “extremely deplorable.”

“It isn't acceptable,” said &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Dorion"&gt;Jean Dorion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ASaint-Jean-Baptiste%20Society"&gt;Societe Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montreal&lt;/a&gt;. “Of course we disagree with the Constitution that has been imposed forcibly on Quebec – this is not acceptable. But it's not a reason to desecrate a burial place.”

Environment Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Baird"&gt;John Baird&lt;/a&gt;, who is responsible for &lt;a href="w%3AParks%20Canada"&gt;Parks Canada&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement that his department would remove the offensive graffiti.

“It is important to protect the historic resting places of former prime ministers, and these places should at all times be given the respect and honour they deserve,” Baird said.

A spectator has been killed and at least 10 people injured after an aircraft struck spectators at an airshow in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. The one-engined propellor-driven aircraft exited the runway after failing to take off and ploughed into a group that had congregated around a snack stand.

The accident occurred at Kindel Air Field, which is located south of &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3AEisenach"&gt;Eisenach&lt;/a&gt;. The aircraft involved was a &lt;a href="w%3AZlin%20Z-37%20Cmelak"&gt;Zlin Z-37 Cmelak&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; built single-seater plane which had been used by authorities in former &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Germany"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href="w%3Acropduster"&gt;cropduster&lt;/a&gt;.

A 45-year-old woman was killed, and the 35-year-old pilot had to be freed from his wrecked aircraft and was badly injured. A 14-year-old girl is hospitalised in a critical condition, according to &lt;a href="w%3ABloomberg%20L.P."&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, although other sources suggest the 14-year-old and a nine-year-old child were amongst those less seriously injured. Some reports suggest 15 people were wounded by the crash, and German TV network &lt;a href="w%3AZDF"&gt;ZDF&lt;/a&gt; suggested the plane struck a children's carousel near the runway's end and not a refreshments stall.

At least 400 homes have been evacuated in &lt;a href="w%3ASierra%20Madre%2C%20California"&gt;Sierra Madre&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; after a wildfire which started on Saturday, began to threaten their homes.

So far only five percent of the 350 acre fire is contained, with over 400 firefighters battling the blaze. Authorities say that it has been over 40 years since some parts of the land have caught fire.

The cause of the fire is not known. Authorities say the investigation into how it started may take up to three days to finish.

So far there have been no injuries and no homes have yet been damaged, but one building storing equipment used by firefighters was burned to the ground. For a short time, at least 100 hikers were trapped in the mountains and a boy scout camp was also threatened by the blaze. Several people celebrating a wedding have also been trapped by the fire but are not injured and authorities say they are in no danger from the blaze. However, there are currently around 1000 people under mandatory evacuations, and the city has been declared in a state of emergency.

It could take at least five days before the fire can be brought under full control.

<h1>Owner and manager of Moroccan factory arrested over 55-fatality fire</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Owner%20and%20manager%20of%20Moroccan%20factory%20arrested%20over%2055-fatality%20fire&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Police have arrested the owner of a mattress factory in Hay Hassini, &lt;a href="w%3ACasablanca"&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; which burned down in a disaster that claimed 55 lives. His son, who was the factory's manager, was also arrested.

Those killed — 35 of whom were women — were trapped inside by locked fire exits, which were barricaded to stop theft during working hours. "The people who died were either asphyxiated or burned," commented a firefighter. 17 were wounded. Moustapha Taouil of the Casablanca civil protection service said the blaze was triggered by an inadequatly maintained electric saw on the ground floor. The initial fire quickly engulfed all four storeys of the building.

The Rosamor factory was clearly operating unsafely, officials said. "It's a building with a ground floor and three upper floors specialising in making furniture, therefore there were highly inflammable products," said Taouil. "We confirmed during our examination that the owners of the premises failed to respect legal requirements for this kind of industry including staff training... the owner in contravention of the law, locked staff inside the plant apparently to prevent theft of raw material. It was this that prevented them getting out. The fire was caused by lack of proper maintenance of certain machines and electrical installations." He said a short circuit on the ground floor, which was filled with power saws, triggered the disaster.

As a result of the investigatons, "The plant's owner, Adil Moufarreh, and his son Abdelali Moufarreh, who was the manager, have been taken into custody after having been questioned by police," said an official.

28-year-old factory employee Fadila Khadija said "There was no emergency exit, the extinguishers were empty and the working conditions were difficult." One source said that windows were also unusable as they were covered with iron bars. 20-year-old survivor Omar Elaaz said "I was working on the first floor as an upholsterer. The smoke came up from the ground floor where the foam rubber, wood and glue are stored. I used a gas bottle to break the wire mesh that protects every window." 31-year-old upholsterer Hakim Hakki told of his own lucky escape and its effect on him from hospital: "I jumped from the third floor with four other colleagues while the women, who didn't dare to follow us, perished in the inferno. God saved me but I'll never forget those who died."

The father of deceased 19-year-old Abdelazziz Darif said his son was paid 250 dirhams (20 euro/31 US dollars) per week and did not have social insurance.

An &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APolar%20Satellite%20Launch%20Vehicle"&gt;Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (PSLV) has successfully launched ten satellites. The 44-metre long rocket lifted off from the second launch pad at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASatish%20Dhawan%20Space%20Centre"&gt;Satish Dhawan Space Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at 03:53:51 GMT (09:24 local time), and reached a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apolar%20orbit"&gt;polar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASun%20synchronous%20orbit"&gt;Sun-synchronous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alow%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;low Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a little over seven minutes later. Following burnout of the fourth stage of the carrier rocket, the payloads were released. The PSLV flew in the CA, or Core Alone, configuration, with no solid rocket boosters around the first stage.

The ten satellites aboard the rocket will be used for several purposes by a variety of organisations. The primary payload, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACartosat-2A"&gt;Cartosat-2A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aremote%20sensing"&gt;remote sensing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; satellite, which will be operated by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Space%20Research%20Organisation"&gt;Indian Space Research Organisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ISRO). &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIMS-1"&gt;IMS-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , also known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATWSAT"&gt;TWSAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , another ISRO remote sensing satellite, was the secondary payload. In addition, eight commercial payloads were flown, as part of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANanosat%20Launch%20Service"&gt;Nanosat Launch Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -4 and 5 programmes. There satellites were &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACUTE-1.7"&gt;Cute 1.7+APD-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASEEDS-2"&gt;SEEDS-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Tokyo"&gt;University of Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanX-2"&gt;CanX-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanX-6"&gt;CanX-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Toronto%20Institute%20for%20Aerospace%20Studies"&gt;University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, Delfi-C3 for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADelft%20University%20of%20Technology"&gt;Delft University of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAAUSAT-II"&gt;AAUSAT-II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Aalborg"&gt;University of Aalborg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACOMPASS-1"&gt;COMPASS-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAachen%20University"&gt;Aachen University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARUBIN-8"&gt;RUBIN-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for German aerospace company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOHB%20System"&gt;OHB System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="w%3AProfessional%20wrestling"&gt;Pro-wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, a sport derived from Greco-Roman freestyle wrestling, is often connected with the idea of sports-entertainment. Popularized by &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; federations (e.g. &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wrestling%20Entertainment"&gt;World Wrestling Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling"&gt;New Japan Pro Wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) the ongoing events and news are often discussed on the Internet. As such, television programs and other mass media focused on pro-wrestling are commonplace in Japan, America, and &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

In &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, fans do not simply watch the TV shows and discuss them via the Internet, but some of them participate in the sport of wrestling through communities from the Internet or colleges. Although a Taiwanese wrestler recently won a world-class pro-wrestling title, due to policies that focused only on promoting key athletic sports like &lt;a href="w%3Abaseball"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Abilliards"&gt;billiards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Abasketball"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Ataekwondo"&gt;taekwondo&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. those with more possibilities to win a gold medal in the &lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20Games"&gt;Asian Games&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Games"&gt;Olympics&lt;/a&gt;), governmental officials lost a great opportunity to promote sports like wrestling, which has many potential participants.

What's the vision of wrestling in Taiwan? How did the communities drive TV spectators and wrestling fans and government officials pay more attention in wrestling? Is wrestling a future key sport in Taiwan? ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Journalist visited the "2008 IWL Spring Festival", organised by a fan community and interviewed "Mr. Orange", well-known commentator of WWE TV shows broadcasted by &lt;a href="w%3AVideoland%20Television%20Network"&gt;VideoLand Max TV&lt;/a&gt; in Taiwan, to prospect the future of wrestling.
<h2>Interview</h2>

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Hello, everyone! In my side is "Mr. Orange", WWE TV show commentator of VideoLand Max TV in Taiwan, I will do a special interview for topics related to wrestling, and he will do an overview of wrestling in Taiwan with his experiences.

Glad to see an unofficial wrestling match in the &lt;a href="w%3Azh%3A%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%9C%B0%E4%B8%8B%E8%A1%97"&gt;Taipei City Mall&lt;/a&gt;. How did you involve in wrestling initially?

♡❤♡Mr. Orange♡❤♡: Since I'm in a childhood, I often watch (wrestling) shows with my neighborhood to a period when going to kindergarten. And then, I progressively understood the meaning of wrestling and finally involved in it.

In what region of a wrestling match did you watch at first?

♡❤♡Orange♡❤♡: Europe and America. Matches in there are often packaged and refined excellently such as theme music, introduction, momentum of wrestlers better then matches in Japan, which just contained traditional rules.

On the other way of wrestling in Taiwan, what are the opportunities, possibilities, and threats?

♡❤♡Orange♡❤♡: It was considered as a bad sport and not well-known in public opinion in Taiwan. As of some unofficial communities like us, we held periodical friendship matches to help the public correct their biased and wrong view of wrestling, especially the quote: "Wrestling played reality not just a fight, scuffle, or violent sport." Because we [the wrestlers] were fully prepared in several professional trainings, we did wrestling without just acting and dishonesty although we player for spectators. For example, as of a famous sport from Korea - taekwondo, it fought without killing the other one but just to did enough with their best. "Since I entered into the ring, I should do my best in a match to respond expectations from spectators rather than its results." That's a theory gained from a stable law of an action movie, its content besides of starting and ending should be rich and not to be hollowed.

In what opportunities did you become a commentator from a wrestling fan?

♡❤♡Orange♡❤♡: Generally, I'm not a notable person, I just use the media as a promotion tool because we [the public] can't look down the strengths and impacts of public opinions and mass media. At that time, due to some coordination on behalf of broadcasting rights of TV programs, and many serious piracy and copyright issues in Taiwan, furthermore, pirates often used discussion boards to promote piracy. Those badly harmed several companies who do an agent of genuine copies. And accidentally, after a TV broadcaster grasped its opportunities on wrestling TV programs, I finally joined their production for commentary and planning of wrestling programs until now.

Undergoing with trendy changes of wrestling?

♡❤♡Orange♡❤♡: I met those opportunities coincidentally because when no one want to do it, and senior elites from media industry may not spare time to do production. I felt luckily on those undergoing experiences.

Before (its) production, what's your opinion on similar programs especially in Chinese-language?

♡❤♡Orange♡❤♡: It's difficult or impossible for a broadcaster to produce their own and significant program because the public opinion have their wrong bias on wrestling. If the bias can be corrected, I think the public will not consider it as just a "fighting" or a "violent" sport, or to say: "What are they doing?" I chose the series programs of World Wrestling Entertainment because of its packages rather than a fistfight match which contained several complex rules like points or fouls, or just results rather than its content. Generally, if a significant program can be promoted, I think several wrong bias of wrestling should be corrected.

Generally OK. In your opinion, which pro-wrestling match do you recommend?

♡❤♡Orange♡❤♡: There were several feature or significant matches in their own years. But I recommended two classic matches like NWA Championship in 1989 - "Ric Flair vs Ricky Steamboat", and a Steel Cage Match in 1981 - "Ric Flair vs Jimmy 'Super Fly' Snuka".

Back to the topic of wrestling in Taiwan, besides of media, which tool will you use to promote it?

♡❤♡Orange♡❤♡: The Internet - another media, a better way differ than mass media. By the way, by holding periodical friendship matches, it will work more effective. And of course, we [the IWL] hope the (friendship) matches can be held not only in Taipei but also in several divisions in Central or Southern Taiwan to correct conceptions on wrestling in a simple but relaxed match style.

If promoted via a portal of "&lt;a href="w%3Acitizen%20journalism"&gt;citizen journalism&lt;/a&gt;"? Briefly, "citizen journalism" is a commentary, introduction, or a coverage with what incidents he or she witnessed or experienced differ than mass media.

♡❤♡Orange♡❤♡: Really, that's a very better way to promote it because when connecting the Internet, the public frequently read topics related to current events like politics, society, and entertainment, focused by mass media and differ than what the common people need to know like some incidents just happened in their peripheral areas.

Finally, do you have any expectation on wrestling in Taiwan.

♡❤♡Orange♡❤♡: We [the wrestlers and wrestling fans] hope the common bias of "violence" can be properly corrected. After all, a pro-wrestling match is always ruled by its own policy, every wrestlers should undergo several strict trainings. As of IWL in Taiwan, we restrict our participants by a strict policy, and don't welcome athletes without any wrestling basis to join our community and fight in a ring because wrestling is like a gamble in consequence. Furthermore, parents should persuade their children not to imitate any wrestling moves at home. Like a submission, if not knowing its principle, a damage will be caused in one's body. Roughly to say, ♡❤DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME♡❤.

OK, many thanks for this interview, "Mr. Orange".

Bayern Munich won the 2007/08 German championship after a 0-0 against Wolfsburg.

A sell-out crowd at the Volkswagen Arena saw the Wolfsburg control the match against Bayern Munich during the 1 half. The 2 half was dull for long spells.
With 6 changes were made from the UEFA Cup Semi Final in St. Petersburg.

At 05:00 GMT this morning, the maiden flight of the &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt;-built &lt;a href="w%3AZenit%20rocket"&gt;Zenit-3SLB&lt;/a&gt; rocket lifted off from Site 45/1 at the &lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. Atop it was the &lt;a href="w%3AAMOS-3"&gt;AMOS-3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acommunications%20satellite"&gt;communications satellite&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i company &lt;a href="w%3ASpacecom"&gt;Spacecom&lt;/a&gt;. The satellite separated from the carrier rocket directly into a &lt;a href="w%3Ageosynchronous%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous orbit&lt;/a&gt;, several hours after launch.

The Zenit-3SLB is a modernised version of the Zenit-3SL, used by &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Launch"&gt;Sea Launch&lt;/a&gt;. New features include an upgraded guidance and control system, first flown on the Zenit-2M in June 2007. Today's flight was also the first conducted by &lt;a href="w%3ALand%20Launch"&gt;Land Launch&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of the international Sea Launch consortium, and the first launch of a three-stage Zenit rocket from Baikonur. The first Land Launch mission was originally scheduled for 2007, but was delayed after another Zenit exploded on its launch pad in late January 2007. A further delay from Thursday morning occurred when the errector/transporter component of the launch pad failed to back away from the rocket.

This was the 22 orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. The next Zenit launch is scheduled for late May, when a Sea Launch Zenit-3SL will place the &lt;a href="w%3AGalaxy%2018"&gt;Galaxy 18&lt;/a&gt; satellite into orbit. Launched a little over an hour after &lt;a href="PSLV%20rocket%20launches%20ten%20satellites"&gt;an Indian PSLV placed ten satellites into orbit&lt;/a&gt;, it also marked the first occurrence for 2008 of two orbital launches on the same day as each other, in GMT.

All-business transatlantic company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEos%20Airlines"&gt;Eos Airlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has filed for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChapter%2011"&gt;Chapter 11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bankruptcy protection. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; based company ran flights between &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Stansted%20Airport"&gt;Stansted Airport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport"&gt;John F. Kennedy International Airport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Eos, named after &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEos"&gt;goddess of the dawn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , flew what will likely be its last service on Sunday. Founded in 2005, the airline had had difficulty in securing investment to keep it going, starting last year. Plans had been aiming for securing funding to keep the service running up until 2009, but this failed and the business has insufficient funds to continue.

Several other airlines have closed worldwide recently over difficult conditions in the industry, including all-business carriers like Eos. Last year the sudden collapse of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMAXjet%20Airways"&gt;MAXjet Airways&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; left passengers stranded on Christmas Eve. The company offered services connecting London with New York, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Eos had been considered by analysts as the most viable of the transatlantic all-business carriers.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; (DOJ) &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20Address"&gt;IP Address&lt;/a&gt; has been blocked on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ after making edits to an article which were considered "vandalism". In two separate instances, the IP address from the DOJ removed information from the Wikipedia article about the organization &lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20for%20Accuracy%20in%20Middle%20East%20Reporting%20in%20America"&gt;Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America&lt;/a&gt; (CAMERA), regarding an attempt by the organization to secretly gain influence on the site. The IP address has been confirmed by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ to be registered and used by the DOJ located in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;

On April 21, &lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Intifada"&gt;Electronic Intifada&lt;/a&gt; published a report based on leaked emails written between CAMERA and ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ contributors who are allegedly planning to gain influence on the online encyclopedia. Information about CAMERA's campaign to influence Wikipedia was first added to the site's article about the organization on April 21 by user 'Bangpound', who cited the Electronic Intifada article. 

According to the edit history on the ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ article CAMERA, the entire subsection relating to this controversy was removed by the IP address 149.101.1.130, which is hosted by 'wdcsun30.usdoj.gov' and is used by the DOJ. The IP address removed information regarding CAMERA's plan to "cooperate with prominent Wikipedia editors to promote a Zionist viewpoint and oppose pro-Arab viewpoints on Wikipedia" at least two separate times, on April 24 and April 25.

The IP address belonging to the DOJ also made edits identified as vandalism to the Wikipedia articles &lt;a href="w%3ATracy%20Jordan"&gt;Tracy Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Ebert"&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20E.%20Akins"&gt;James E. Akins&lt;/a&gt;. After several warnings on the IP address's "talk page", the IP address was blocked for four days for "repeated vandalism." Several hours prior to the DOJ edits, an IP address also from Washington D.C., 71.178.102.65, removed the same information. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ can confirm the IP address is located in Washington D.C. and belongs to &lt;a href="w%3AVerizon"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;.
Wikipedia administrators were kept apprised in an ongoing discussion about the incident at Wikipedia's &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AAdministrators%27%20noticeboard"&gt;Administrators' noticeboard&lt;/a&gt;. "The Justice employee is attempting to scrub any mention of CAMERA's activities to influence Wikipedia (now double-sourced) as seen here in this edit," said Wikipedia editor Lawrence Cohen, in an initial post to the Administrators' noticeboard.

Founded in 1982, CAMERA is a pro-&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; media-monitoring and research non-profit organization based in &lt;a href="Boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. On April 21 the Electronic Intifada, a not-for-profit online publication which covers the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict from a &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; perspective, published an article describing efforts by CAMERA to secretly influence Wikipedia articles. According to the article, Electronic Intifada obtained a series of emails between CAMERA and members of Wikipedia, attempting to game the encyclopedia and influence articles on the site related to Israel.
Electronic Intifada quoted a March 13 email from Gilead Ini, a Senior Research Analyst at CAMERA, who enlisted volunteers to make sure articles about Israel on Wikipedia were "free of bias and error, and include necessary facts and context". In a follow-up email from March 17, Ini emphasized secrecy, telling the email list members not to "forward it to members of the news media", and wrote that "There is no need to advertise the fact that we have these group discussions." The &lt;a href="w%3AMedia%20criticism"&gt;media criticism&lt;/a&gt; organization &lt;a href="w%3AFairness%20and%20Accuracy%20in%20Reporting"&gt;Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting&lt;/a&gt; criticized the CAMERA emails, calling them "particularly insidious" because "stealth and misrepresentation are presented as the keys to success."

Later discussions in the series of emails obtained by Electronic Intifada included advice on how to get members of CAMERA elected as Wikipedia administrators, in order to gain influence. Wikipedia user 'Zeq' posted to the list: "One or more of you who want to take this route should stay away from any Israel realted [sic] articles for one month until they [sic] interact in a positive way with 100 wikipedia [sic] editors who would be used later to vote you as an administrator."

After the IP address belonging to the DOJ was blocked, Wikipedia editors informed the &lt;a href="Wikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s Communications committee about the incident. Both ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ and Wikipedia are projects of the Wikimedia Foundation. In addition to the DOJ IP address, several Wikipedia users determined to be cooperating with the CAMERA campaign to influence Wikipedia had also previously been blocked by Wikipedia administrators.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ requested a statement from the Department of Justice on the edits to Wikipedia, but as of this article's publication had not received a response.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%20Canadiens"&gt;Montreal Canadiens&lt;/a&gt; lost to the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt;, 3&amp;ndash;2, in the only game played in the National Hockey League on April 28, 2008. &lt;a href="w%3AScottie%20Upshall"&gt;Scottie Upshall&lt;/a&gt; opened the scoring in the middle of the second period, scoring an even-strength goal at 7:04 of the period. &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Richard"&gt;Mike Richards&lt;/a&gt; made the score 2&amp;ndash;0 with a shorthanded goal at 15:12 of the same period. Before the period ended, &lt;a href="w%3AR.J.%20Umberger"&gt;R.J. Umberger&lt;/a&gt; made the score 3&amp;ndash;0 at 18:19.

Halak started the third period after Price gave up three goals on 12 shots. Philadelphia now leads the series, 2&amp;ndash;1.

Manchester United are heading to &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; to play in the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final"&gt;UEFA Champions League Final&lt;/a&gt; on May 21 after beating Barcelona 1-0 on Tuesday evening. The aggregate score finished 1-0 after last Wednesday's goalless draw in &lt;a href="w%3ABarcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20football%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; midfielder Paul Scholes scored the only goal of the match in the 14 minute with a swerving strike from 25 meters after collecting a loose ball that resulted from a &lt;a href="w%3AGianluca%20Zambrotta"&gt;Gianluca Zambrotta&lt;/a&gt; clearance error. Scholes and team captain, former &lt;a href="w%3AWales%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; international Ryan Giggs are the last remaining players from the Manchester United side that beat FC Bayern Munich in the &lt;a href="w%3A1999%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final"&gt;1999 UEFA Champions League Final&lt;/a&gt;, played in Barcelona's own Camp Nou stadium.

Manchester United's defensive resiliency continued from last Wednesday's 1 leg and withstood Barcelona's attack as &lt;a href="w%3ALionel%20Messi"&gt;Lionel Messi&lt;/a&gt; and company failed to unsettle United's back line, despite a 4-3-3 formation spearheaded by Eto'o, Messi, and Iniesta's persistent pressure in the attacking third of the pitch. Barcelona managed to put several shots near the home goal, but never really tested Dutch international goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar.

The win for Manchester United guarantees the first all-English final in European Champion League and Champions Club Cup history when they face Chelsea in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium on May 21.

At the Pavilion of Taiwan Automotive Research Consortium during the AutoTronics Taipei 2008, in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20China"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;, the Next Consortium of &lt;a href="w%3AIndustrial%20Technology%20Research%20Institute"&gt;Industrial Technology Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; (ITRI) unveiled a brand-new environmental-concept vehicle named "RoboScooter". It was jointly designed by the Creativity Lab of ITRI, &lt;a href="w%3ASYM%20Motors"&gt;SYM Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AMIT_Media_Lab"&gt;Media Lab&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;. This announcement was approved by industrial, governmental, and academical executives, but not just in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.

The ability for R&amp;D to manufacture the electronic vehicles and bicycles was concerning to several automobile-related industries. There was concern not only from several &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20shows"&gt;trade shows&lt;/a&gt;, but also international competitions related to the design after winning several prizes back in Taiwan to establish the industrial position and brand image of "Made in Taiwan". Since several industries like automobile are transformed to high-value industries, "&lt;a href="w%3Acreativity"&gt;creativity&lt;/a&gt;" progressively became a key element before unveiling any new products.

As of this sector, Wen-jean Hsueh (ITRI Creativity Lab General Director) hoped companies could do proper transformations on its R&amp;D nature from "Made in Taiwan" to "Created in Taiwan" for best practice. This not only echoed "OBM" theory discussed at &lt;a href="Branding%20professionals%20in%20Taiwan%20promoted%20on%20the%20%26quot%3BSmiling%20Curve%26quot%3B%20in%20the%20%26quot%3B2007%20Taiwan%20Brands%27%20Trend%20Forum%26quot%3B"&gt;2007 Taiwan Brands' Trend Forum&lt;/a&gt; but also blended with a key element of production - "creativity".

On the other side of SYM Motors, to solve the transportation problem for &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center%20Nangang%20Exhibition%20Hall"&gt;TWTC Nangang&lt;/a&gt;, SYM Motors Taiwan imported manufacturing technology from Kinglong Bus Co., Ltd. to manufacture several 4th-cycle low floor buses and sell them to Chung-hsing Bus Co., Ltd. and Kwang-huang Bus Co., Ltd. In this launch, the SYM Motors Taiwan hope this vehicle is energy-efficiency, easily-parked, and has creative functions which can improve the transportation habits of individuals.

A &lt;a href="w%3Adolphin"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt; has died after a collision with another dolphin in mid-air during a stunt performance at ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADiscovery%20Cove"&gt;Discovery Cove&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a sister park of &lt;a href="w%3ASeaWorld"&gt;SeaWorld&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first time an incident of this nature has ever occurred since the park opened in 2000.

The dolphin, a 30-year-old female named 'Sharky' collided in mid-air, head on, with her co-performer 'Tyler', a 13-year-old male, during a live show at the park on Saturday April 26. Sharky died a short time later after suffering head injuries. Tyler was not injured, but is still being observed closely.

Both dolphins have successfully completed the stunt over 100 previous times, but this time it is reported that Sharky miscalculated her jump. At least 30 people were watching the show when they collided.

"This is a very unfortunate and very rare incident. While it is not unusual to have two animals performing at the same time, we are reviewing the situation to ensure even such a random incident does not occur again. We never had animals collide before," said a spokeswoman for the park, Becca Bides.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Hofmann"&gt;Albert Hofmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a scientist who discovered and created the drug &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALysergic%20acid%20diethylamide"&gt;Lysergic acid diethylamide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (LSD) in 1938, has died today at the age 102. 

♡❤DRC Net♡❤ reports that Hofmann's died of a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMyocardial%20infarction"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in his house located in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABasel%2C%20Switzerland"&gt;Basel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.

After discovering LSD, he set it aside for five years, until April 16, 1943, when Hofmann decided to take another look at it. While re-synthesizing the LSD, he accidentally consumed a small sample and serendipitously discovered its powerful effects. Three days later, on April 19, Hofmann deliberately consumed 250 micrograms of LSD before his bicycle ride home.

He is now known as the first person to experience a '&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APsychedelic%20experience"&gt;trip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' from taking it. Since then, LSD aficionados around the world unofficially proclaimed April 19, 1943 as ♡❤Bicycle Day♡❤.

The drug was made illegal in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 1966, and many other countries did the same, after heavy users were suffering permanent psychological damage.

Hofmann denounced the illegal use of the drug which became popular in the 1960s, but he was said to be disappointed that further research on theraputic uses was not conducted on it at the time.

Hofmann is also credited with the discovery of &lt;a href="psilocybin"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt;, which is the main hallucinogenic found in &lt;a href="Psilocybin%20mushrooms"&gt;Psilocybin mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;. He also discovered the make-up of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOloliuqui"&gt;Ololiuqui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Hofmann was also on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; committee as well as a member of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Society%20of%20Pharmacognosy"&gt;American Society of Pharmacognosy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and several other organizations.

Hofmann was born on January 11, 1906. He is survived by his brother Walter, 2 daughters, and 2 sons.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sea%20lions%20take%20over%20dock%20at%20Moss%20Landing%2C%20California&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AMoss%20Landing%2C%20California"&gt;Moss Landing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is a small community on the shore of &lt;a href="w%3AMonterey%20Bay"&gt;Monterey Bay&lt;/a&gt;. In April of 2007, the community installed a dock for visitors at a cost of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;800,000. Since then, the new dock has been taken over by hundreds of &lt;a href="w%3Asea%20lion"&gt;sea lion&lt;/a&gt;s.

Harbor officials estimate there are more than 400 of them on the dock. The gangway, which leads to the dock, is closed. A sign reads: "Do not approach. Vicious Sea Lions."

Boaters and kayakers cannot use the new dock. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ observed kayakers trying to paddle as far away as possible from the dock and its new residents.

Quite a few tourists were seen stopping to take pictures of the new Moss Landing attraction. Harbor officials have tried to make the sea lions leave, but the sea lions seem to like it there. They can be seen fighting and playing all around the dock in the harbor.

Sea lions in California are protected under the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AMarine%20Mammal%20Protection%20Act"&gt;Marine Mammal Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;. They are generally found in shallow waters of coastal areas of both with abundant food resources.

Visitors might also find &lt;a href="w%3Asea%20otter"&gt;sea otter&lt;/a&gt;s at Moss Landing, as ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ did. Sea otters are more rare and much harder to find in the wild than sea lions. While the recovery of the sea otter is considered an important success in marine conservation, it remains an &lt;a href="w%3Aendangered%20species"&gt;endangered species&lt;/a&gt;. The otter is also considered to be a &lt;a href="w%3Akeystone%20species"&gt;keystone species&lt;/a&gt;.

Parallels could be drawn between Moss Landing and the docks at &lt;a href="w%3APier%2039"&gt;Pier 39&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, which were famously taken over by sea lions in 1990 and has become a familiar &lt;a href="w%3Atourist%20attraction"&gt;tourist attraction&lt;/a&gt;. It remains to be seen if sea lions become a permanent part of Moss Landing.

Chelsea beat Liverpool in extra time to advance to next month's &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final"&gt;UEFA Champions League Final&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. The aggregate score finished 4-3 in favour of Chelsea.

Liverpool goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Manuel%20Reina"&gt;Jose Reina&lt;/a&gt; punched away &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ballack"&gt;Michael Ballack&lt;/a&gt;'s shot which landed at the feet of Didier Drogba who capitalized by scoring the opening goal of the 2 leg. Fernando Torres equalized in the 2 half after Yossi Benayoun beat the defenders to set up the goal. After Chelsea were denied a goal by the Assistant Referee moments earlier, Referee awarded Chelsea a penalty shot which Frank Lampard converted. Dider Drogba added Chelsea's 3 goal of the 2 leg. Ryan Babbel brought Liverpool within a goal of advancing with 3 minutes of extra time remaining.

The win for Chelsea means that they have made their 1 ever UEFA Champions League final and will be competing in the 1 ever all-English final in UEFA Champions League history.

♡❤Zenit Saint Petersburg win 5–1 on aggregate.♡❤

Russian club &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg"&gt;Zenit Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; booked their place in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007-08%20UEFA%20Cup"&gt;2007-08 UEFA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; with a victory over Germans &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Bayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;, 4-0 on the night and 5-1 on aggregate.

Pavel Pogrebnyak opened the scoring after five minutes, and Konstatin Zyrianov doubled Zenit's lead six minutes before half-time.

Viktor Fayzulin made it three eleven minutes into the second half, and Pavel Pogrebnyak completed the rout with seventeen minutes left.

Despite scoring two goals, Pogrebnyak received a yellow card and, as a result, will miss the final.

Zenit Saint Petersburg will meet &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href="w%3ARangers%20F.C."&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; in the final, which will be held in Manchester, England, on May 14, 2008. Rangers were formerly managed by Zenit's current boss &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Advocaat"&gt;Dick Advocaat&lt;/a&gt;.

0-0 on aggregate. After extra time. Rangers won 4–2 on penalties.

After 210 minutes of goalless football between &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AACF%20Fiorentina"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href="w%3ARangers%20F.C."&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, a penalty shootout decided who would progress to the &lt;a href="w%3A2007-08%20UEFA%20Cup"&gt;2007-08 UEFA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;. In a match that contained thirteen shots on goal, neither team could find the back of the net, and so to penalties it went.

&lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Ferguson"&gt;Barry Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; missed the opening spot-kick, seeing it saved by &lt;a href="w%3ASebastien%20Frey"&gt;Sebastien Frey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AZdravko%20Kuzmanovic"&gt;Zdravko Kuzmanovic&lt;/a&gt; put the home side ahead. &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Whittaker"&gt;Steven Whittaker&lt;/a&gt; succeeded where his captain could not, slotting the ball home. &lt;a href="w%3ARiccardo%20Montolivo"&gt;Riccardo Montolivo&lt;/a&gt; maintained Fiorentina's lead before &lt;a href="w%3ASasa%20Papac"&gt;Sasa Papac&lt;/a&gt; put away Rangers' second. &lt;a href="w%3AFabio%20Liverani"&gt;Fabio Liverani&lt;/a&gt; was next up, and his effort was saved by &lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Alexander"&gt;Neil Alexander&lt;/a&gt;. The shootout was now level, with one miss apiece.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrahim%20Hemdani"&gt;Brahim Hemdani&lt;/a&gt; scored a third for Rangers, and then returned to the centre circle to witness &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Vieri"&gt;Christian Vieri&lt;/a&gt; miss Fiorentina's second successive effort. It was left to Spaniard &lt;a href="w%3ANacho%20Novo"&gt;Nacho Novo&lt;/a&gt; to give Rangers victory, and he put his strike into the back of the net.

Rangers, who were reduced to ten men with ten minutes of extra time remaining after &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Cousin"&gt;Daniel Cousin&lt;/a&gt; was sent off for an apparent headbutt on &lt;a href="w%3AFabio%20Liverani"&gt;Fabio Liverani&lt;/a&gt;, will meet &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg"&gt;Zenit Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; in the final in &lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, on May 14, 2008.

On April 29 &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; launched &lt;a href="w%3AVisual%20Studio%202008"&gt;Visual Studio 2008&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Server%202008"&gt;Windows Server 2008&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;. The event was also an occasion to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Microsoft Research Asia, with the president, Hsiao-wen Hung, who was praised by several media groups, IT executives, and academic units because of his background.

On the same day of the product launch, Hung talked to Colley Huang (Founder and Chairman of &lt;a href="w%3ADigiTimes"&gt;DigiTimes&lt;/a&gt;) about "the past decade overview of IT industry" in an executive panel.

Hung also invited several academic elites and executive panels like Ovid Tseng (Principal of University System of Taiwan), George Chen (Deputy Principal of &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Taiwan%20University"&gt;National Taiwan University&lt;/a&gt;), Davis Tsai (General Manager of Microsoft Taiwan), and Hsi-peng Lu (Director of Student Affairs of &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Taiwan%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology"&gt;National Taiwan University of Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt;).

On the final day of campaigning before the vote in the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20mayoral%20election%2C%202008"&gt;London mayoral election&lt;/a&gt;, incumbent &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Livingstone"&gt;Ken Livingstone&lt;/a&gt; attacked main rival &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Johnson"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt; as "a joke". He warned &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;ers that they were not voting in a "Celebrity Mayor" contest.

Livingstone unveiled a campaign poster in &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Ham"&gt;West Ham&lt;/a&gt; that will also be printed on postcards and sent to one million Londoners. It reads: "Don't vote for a joke. Vote for London."

"It's not an election for the host of ♡❤Have I Got News For You♡❤ or a celebrity mayor. It's about who is best placed to run an £11bn budget every year," Mayor Livingstone said, referring to the &lt;a href="w%3AHave%20I%20Got%20News%20for%20You"&gt;panel game show&lt;/a&gt;, for which Boris Johnson has been a guest host.

"Tomorrow you have a choice between new policies and fresh energy from a new mayor in City Hall or more of the same from a tired, out-of-date administration that is beset by allegations of sleaze," responded Johnson in a &lt;a href="w%3Aelectronic%20mailing%20list"&gt;mass e-mail&lt;/a&gt; to over 500,000 voters. "I am optimistic about London's future and believe we can make London a greater place to live in."

London will be voting for mayor tomorrow, May 1. Ken Livingstone is the candidate for &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;The Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; and Boris Johnson is the candidate for the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;. There are a number of other candidates, but recent &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20mayoral%20election%2C%202008%23Opinion%20Polling"&gt;opinion polls&lt;/a&gt; have shown it to be a two-person race, with some polls predicting a victory for Livingstone and others Johnson.

According to reports, a group of &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt; natives, referring to themselves as the "Hawaiian Kingdom Government" under leader Mahealani Kahau, entered the historic &lt;a href="w%3A%27Iolani%20Palace"&gt;'Iolani Palace&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday to allegedly restore the former self-governing nation, overthrown over a century ago.

At about 5:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, an estimated 70 members of the organization padlocked the eight entrances of the palace, once the home of the Hawaiian monarchy, and peacefully occupied the property for about eight hours. Several dozen employees, volunteers and tourists were prevented from entering. 

The protest ended peacefully by 2 p.m. following negotiations with the state Department of Land and Natural Resources. No arrests were made, though the group vowed to return in the morning. "We will not resist, we won't fight, we won't be aggressive. But we'll be back for sure," Kahau said. "The Hawaiian Kingdom Government is here and it doesn't plan to leave. This is a continuity of the Hawaiian Kingdom of 1892 to today."

The palace was constructed for &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Kalakaua"&gt;King Kalakaua&lt;/a&gt; and later his sister, &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Liliuokalani"&gt;Queen Liliuokalani&lt;/a&gt;. The monarchy ended in 1893 and, in 1959, Hawaii was admitted as the 50th state.

<h1>Wikinews Interview: Experts in IT industry comment about security of WiMAX</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikinews%20Interview%3A%20Experts%20in%20IT%20industry%20comment%20about%20security%20of%20WiMAX&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20technology"&gt;Computers and technology&lt;/a&gt; make our modern lifestyle more convenient, but they also create new risks like &lt;a href="w%3Acomputer%20virus"&gt;computer viruses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Ahacking"&gt;hacking&lt;/a&gt;. Many people want to enjoy the convenience of new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems.

&lt;a href="w%3AWiMAX"&gt;WiMAX&lt;/a&gt; is being promoted in Taiwan by the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20Computer%20Association"&gt;Taipei Computer Association&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AIndustrial%20Technology%20Research%20Institute"&gt;Industrial Technology Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. It is considered by some to be the &lt;a href="w%3Acommunication%20standard"&gt;communication standard&lt;/a&gt; for the next generation of mobile devices.

Information security companies are concerned increasingly by Internet crime, and some of them question the security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its potential to cause security issues.

Some companies have analyzed potential security issues which threaten the success of WiMAX. But what have they found?
Taking the opportunity of two press conferences in Taiwan, ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Journalist briefly interviewed both Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association. With their experience in the IT industry, they agreed to comment on this question.
<h2>Hsiao-wen Hung: Information security isn't built in a day</h2>
Improvements in information technology have certainly brought opportunities, but information security is of particular concern to companies in the security industry. Since this is so, what is the state of information security? Prior to the launch of (&lt;a href="w%3AVisual%20Studio%202008"&gt;Visual Studio 2008&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Server%202008"&gt;Windows Server 2008&lt;/a&gt;)... although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring about growth of mobile users, its future has been questioned by some companies in the information security industry.

♡❤♡Hung♡❤♡: &lt;a href="w%3ASafety"&gt;Safety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aflexibility"&gt;flexibility&lt;/a&gt; are like a &lt;a href="w%3Apaddle"&gt;paddle&lt;/a&gt; with two blades. If you want something to be connectible anywhere, there are security considerations. It's like a house which anyone can enter. If you want to ensure the security of your building, there are some difficult things you need to do. That's why security is really a must-have thing. As for information security, as you mentioned earlier, relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. 

♡❤♡Hung♡❤♡: Even though it's secure to lock everything down, it is inconvenient. Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions have a key role to play in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet. If anyone wants to prevent them, complete planning should be a priority. That's why the information security industry is built with several solutions and long-term experiences, not a simple solution in a day.

<h2>Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries</h2>

What's your opinion on issues raised by IS companies during the "2008 Asia-pacific Information Security Forum"?

♡❤♡Chang♡❤♡: Our member companies will attempt to change the trend. As for our board committee, because (our member) companies mostly manufacture notebook computers, if a common consensus is established among senior executives in the IT industry, I think the objectives of Taipei Computer Association will be more and more clear.

What's your opinion on Hsiao-wen Hung's statement: "When people want to enjoy a new technology, some protection is necessary"?

♡❤♡Chang♡❤♡: It's an undoubted truth. When a new technology was under development, companies mostly looked at its possibilities, rather than hidden factors like information or data security. As the Internet just begins to be a mature infrastructure, the public might not know how critical security issues are. As for WiMAX, which you mentioned, even though it's under development, you cannot imagine what will happen in the future. That's the opportunity for security industry.

Before the unveil of WiMAX, what about the disputes from IT industry?

♡❤♡Chang♡❤♡: In the presence, when you connected in a broadband or wireless network, nobody will consider the existence of information flow whether its flow will be safe or unsafe. Although its past experiences is in theory or actual, those (topics) will be focused by (information security) companies. In my opinion, whether to look on its defense or vision, when a company do attempts on a new record or opportunity pursuit, they often oversees its vision first. That's why companies from information security (like &lt;a href="w%3ATrend%20Micro"&gt;Trend Micro&lt;/a&gt;) will hold on the sector of defense. After all, besides of the future of WiMAX, there are different and vast opportunities for different industries.

<h2>Summary</h2>
"Peer ahead and look behind" is the basis. When doing anything, it need proper analysis to know its results after it's done. As of WiMAX, although it's the future trend of networking technology, but many companies just looked on its advantages rather than its potential threats which information security companies mostly concerned. ♡❤"Prevention is better than cure."♡❤ Even though a technology will bring advantages or disadvantages for different sectors.

New research has indicated that &lt;a href="w%3ABat"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s will 'cry out loud' to detect their prey. The report, which was published at ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APLoS%20ONE"&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, states that "source level varied with species, but all bats emitted intense search call."

The report also states that bats will make calls with a lesser intensity when they are close to the ground. It says that "at close range there was a distinct correlation between distance and source level, such that the closer a bat was to the array and therefore also to the ground, vegetation or buildings behind the array, the less intense were its emitted calls."

The authors of the reports also noted that the bats that fly away from obstructions did not produce the loudest calls. This is despite the fact that they originally predicted otherwise. 

The report also noted other findings that were different from the original predictions. It says that they were surprised that "the most intense source levels did not necessarily provide the longest prey detection ranges."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Demolition%20to%20resume%20at%20New%20York%20skyscraper%20damaged%20by%209/11%20after%20deadly%20fire&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Demolition work is set to resume at the former &lt;a href="w%3ADeutsche%20Bank%20Building"&gt;Deutsche Bank Building&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; after work was halted last August over a fire that killed two firefighters. The city's Department of Buildings lifted an order to cease work imposed at the time as the buiding's owners have installed fire control systems at the condemned 26 storey office block.

The building was seriously damaged in the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; as the south tower of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; collapsed, filling the building with debris, much of it toxic. In subsequent years fragmental remains of hundreds of victims from the disaster were removed from the building and regulators had lengthy debates over how the tower should be demolished.

After the fire, work immediately halted and a grand jury criminal investigation followed. The fire is thought to have been triggered by a cigarette discarded by a worker on the site, which will ultimately home one of five new towers planned for the area devastated by the attacks. Of major importance were polyethylene and plywood decontamination barriers which both fueled the blaze and hindered the movement of firefighters. It is thought they may have blocked escape for the two who were killed by the fire.

The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, who owns the property, says 300 &lt;a href="w%3Aasbestos"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt; removal workers are set to begin shifts of six days per week are set to clear toxic material remaining on 19 floors of the tower. This means the work force has increased by one hundred. Decontamination chambers will now be present across all floors instead of merely the ground floor.

Amongst the new safety measures are fire-proof &lt;a href="w%3Asheetrock"&gt;sheetrock&lt;/a&gt; decontaminaton chambers, improved safety within the actual chambers and two fire-rated interior stairways. The modifications were made by LVI Environmental Services with work commencing in February this year.

The tower at 130 Liberty Street was originally intended to be gone by 2005, but the deadline was expanded to 2008. The fire means the work has been delayed a year with a revised estimated time of completion being 2009.

In March, Wikinews reporter Joseph Ford held an exclusive interview with Kevin Baugh, president of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Molossia"&gt;Republic of Molossia&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Amicronation"&gt;micronation&lt;/a&gt; located near &lt;a href="w%3ADayton"&gt;Dayton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the interest the article gained, both online and off, a follow-up interview was held this week. 

Molossia's capital city, Espera, is situated on little over an acre of land in Western Nevada, within driving distance of &lt;a href="w%3AReno"&gt;Reno&lt;/a&gt;. Another territory, Desert Homestead Province, is located in &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20California"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most of today's micronations, Molossia allows visitors and has its own economy. It also has its own time zone and holidays as well as a few tourist attractions.

When asked about the culture of his country Baugh replied, "Molossian culture is a mix of several sources. Above all, we value the lifestyle of the western U.S., especially as it pertains to living in a wide-open place such as we do. Life here is fairly relaxed and easygoing."

He also said that Molossia and the United States "generally ignore each other" and that there haven't been "any altercations" between the two, despite claiming each other's land. He went on to tell us much more about his tiny nation, which can be read in the interview below.

<h1>Cuba announces shift of farm management to local level</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Cuba%20announces%20shift%20of%20farm%20management%20to%20local%20level&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In an effort to boost its troubled &lt;a href="Agriculture"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; sector, &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; announced a major shift in the management of the country's farms, which are to be placed under the control of over 150 local delegations rather than the national government. The move was announced in ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGranma%20%28newspaper%29"&gt;Granma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, the official newspaper of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Cuba"&gt;Cuban Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

On Thursday, ♡❤Granma♡❤ reported that the management of the farms has moved from the national government's Agriculture Ministry to the municipal level. The decision-making will now be handled by 169 new local delegations. The reform also involves the elimination of 104 departments which have been deemed unnecessary. 

"The municipal agriculture delegations &amp;mdash; an organizational process that has just concluded &amp;mdash; will assume the responsibility for the functioning, development and control ... of agricultural production," ♡❤Granma♡❤ said. The move is intended to "stimulate agricultural production, perfect its sale and increase the availability of food and, in this way, substitute imports."
President &lt;a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Castro"&gt;Raúl Castro&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded his brother &lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel&lt;/a&gt; in February, has made agriculture one of the top priorities for Cuba. At a meeting with Communist Party leaders earlier this week, Raúl called food production "a matter of maximum national security." In past weeks, Raúl has said he wants to promote the decentralizing of food production, which he believes will decrease the country's dependency on foreign imports.

Officials estimate that government mismanagement has resulted in 51 percent of Cuba's arable land becoming underused or uncultivated. Also, Cuba imported $1.7 billion worth of food in 2007, a number that is expected to reach over $2 billion this year.

The announcement came as hundreds of thousands took to the streets in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHavana"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the annual &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMay%20Day"&gt;May Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; parade. Raúl Castro attended the parade, but did not speak, instead choosing to smile and wave from a podium as marchers streamed past. The event lasted only 2 hours, a large departure from previous years. Before Raúl's presidency, Fidel Castro's speeches themselves sometimes lasted close to 2 hours, and the parades often featured singing or skits.

Although Raúl did not speak at the parade, Salvador Valdés Mesa, head of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACuban%20Workers%20Confederation"&gt;Cuban Workers Confederation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , used his speech as an opportunity to promote economic efficiency and productivity. "It is fundamental to concentrate efforts on increasing production and productivity, above all of food," he said.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; recently discussed &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20Aid"&gt;Food Aid&lt;/a&gt; in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. He called for extra funds to be allocated by Congress to support food aid. "I am calling on Congress to provide an additional $770 million to support food aid and development programs. Together, this amounts to nearly $1 billion in new funds to bolster global food security," he said.

His reasoning for asking for the increased funding was that the "funding will keep our [the US's] existing emergency food aid programs robust."

Bush declared that food aid in the past had been successful; he claimed that the US has "been the leader for providing food to those who are going without in the past, and we will continue to be the leader around the world."

On the topic of the delivery of food aid, the President commented, "as America increases its food assistance, it's really important that we transform the way that food aid is delivered. In my State of the Union address this year, I called on Congress to support a proposal to purchase up to nearly 25 percent of food assistance directly from farmers in the &lt;a href="wikt%3Adeveloping%20world"&gt;developing world&lt;/a&gt;. "

Bush then claimed that "&lt;a href="America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; is in the lead" in delivering food aid, and that America will continue to be the lead in delivering Food Aid.

Furthermore, he stated that the US is "also working toward the conclusion of a successful Doha agreement that will reduce and eliminates tariffs and other barriers, as well as market-distorting subsidies for agricultural goods."

As his speech drew to a close, Bush asserted that people is the US "are generous people" and are "compassionate people."

The 2008 Taipei CNC Machine Tools &amp; Manufacturing Technology Show (MT duo) and Taiwan International Robot Exhibition (Robot Taiwan 2008) both began yesterday. These events are both taking place in the build up to Taipei International Machine Tool Show (TIMTOS 2009) at &lt;a href="TWTC%20Nangang"&gt;TWTC Nangang&lt;/a&gt;, which is due to take place next year.

The 2008 MT duo and Robot Taiwan mainly focused on software designed for industry, rather than consumers. This is in contrast to the choice of software displayed in many Japanese Trade Shows, which often displays products designed for consumers.

Robotics is a major industry in Taiwan. As a result the organizer of the event decided to refine "Manufacturing Taipei" and split it into the "Robot &amp; Industrial Automation" of Manufacturing Taipei and "Robot Taiwan".

There was also a "Taiwan International Robotics Forum" and "Seminars on MT duo" at the event. Both were designed to attract executives from IT, manufacturing, and machinery industries to promote the worldwide use of robotics in industry.

After a burning plastic garbage container set off the alarm, one of the building residents put out the fire using a fire extinguisher. Law enforcement are still investigating the incident, and are not yet certain why the tax records were set on fire.

According to local police, members of the condo owners association had signed a warrant on Monday, accusing Shorrosh of criminal mischief for allegedly tampering with the security system of his building. "He had gotten frustrated with the security system, and he took a hammer to it," said Police Lieutenant Jud Beedy.
Lt. Beedy said that if the fire had gotten worse than it was, there could have been injuries or deaths, saying "He endangered a lot of people." According to Lt. Beedy, building security cameras caught Shorrosh on camera entering and exiting the trash room of the building. Police Chief David Carpenter told &lt;a href="w%3AWKRG"&gt;WKRG&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤News 5♡❤, the &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; affiliate in &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, that Shorrosh used an &lt;a href="w%3Aaccelerant"&gt;accelerant&lt;/a&gt; to start the fire, in what police believe was an attempt to burn the building down.

Shorrosh is in custody on a &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;25,000 bond. He has spoken critically to &lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; organizations and radio programs about Islam, and has claimed that Muslims in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; thrice attempted to kill him in 1989.

Shorrosh has appeared opposite Muslims in debates between Islam and Christianity, and is the author of 10 books including ♡❤Islam: a Threat or a Challenge♡❤, and ♡❤Islam Revealed♡❤. In 2006, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government issued a disclaimer denying that the book ♡❤The True Quran♡❤, written by Shorrosh, was a "new American Quran". The U.S. government stated that the book was Shorrosh's attempt to convert Muslims to Christianity.

Shorrosh is a &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt;, and according to his website www.islam-in-focus.com he was born in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ANazareth"&gt;Nazareth&lt;/a&gt;. Nazareth is home to many of &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20citizens%20of%20Israel"&gt;Arab citizens&lt;/a&gt; and is also a Christian pilgrimage center, as a historical location described in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Testament"&gt;New Testament&lt;/a&gt; as the boyhood home of &lt;a href="w%3AJesus"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Johnson"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt; has been declared the winner of London's mayoral election. ♡❤The Daily Telegraph♡❤ called the victory overwhelming, given how close recent opinion polls had been. Results were delayed by record turnout.

Johnson thanked his family and party activists for helping him win what he termed a "marathon election." The mayor-elect also paid tribute to Livingstone by saying the incumbent had the "thanks and admiration of millions of Londoners" for his years of service as mayor.

The people of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s capital city of &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; voted yesterday in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20mayoral%20election%2C%202008"&gt;mayoral elections&lt;/a&gt;.

In the London elections voters chose both their first and second preference for &lt;a href="w%3AMayor%20of%20London"&gt;Mayor of London&lt;/a&gt;. The incumbent mayor is Ken Livingstone.

Many polls were carried out before the election. One of the earliest, carried out by &lt;a href="w%3AYouGov"&gt;YouGov&lt;/a&gt; and the London Policy Institute showed a clear lead for Livingstone. A poll carried out near the end of 2007, however, showed that Livingstone was only one percentage point clear of Boris Johnson. 

More recent polls, including one carried out by YouGov for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEvening%20Standard"&gt;Evening Standard&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ showed a narrow lead for Johnson. Other polls, however, like the one taken for &lt;a href="w%3AUNISON"&gt;UNISON&lt;/a&gt; continued to show a clear lead for Livingstone.

Below are the latest results:

The 28th-annual &lt;a href="w%3ACOMPUTEX%20Taipei"&gt;COMPUTEX Taipei&lt;/a&gt; show, the second largest &lt;a href="w%3Ainformation%20technology"&gt;IT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20fair"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; in the world, is the largest one since they held their first show in 1982 since expanding to &lt;a href="TWTC%20Nangang"&gt;TWTC Nangang&lt;/a&gt;. Not only were vast &lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20communication%20technology"&gt;ICT&lt;/a&gt; products showcased from upper, mid, and lower-stream vertical and horizontal &lt;a href="w%3AOEM"&gt;OEMs&lt;/a&gt;, OBMs, and world-class stellar companies like &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAMD"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AASUS"&gt;ASUS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFoxconn"&gt;Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAcer"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABenQ"&gt;BenQ&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AKingston"&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt;, but also featured products related to green technology. Companies from &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt; will be hosting the biggest international pavilion to catch the buyers' eyes.

The Taipei Computer Association (TCA), one of the show organizers, will hold the 2008 WiMAX Taipei Expo at the Taipei Show Hall 2. It will allow the networking industry to chain the WiMAX Pavilion located in the TWTC Nangang and echo the basic infrastructure construction of WiMAX. 

Organizing the show and promoting the ICT industry are considered major tasks by newly-elected &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMa%20Ying-jeou"&gt;Ying-jeou Ma&lt;/a&gt;. Pavilions like "mega trends", "multimedia", and "green technology" will be re-arranged to host trendy and energy-efficient products launched prior to this show.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;Taiwan External Trade Development Council&lt;/a&gt; (TAITRA), there were several seminars like "e21 Forum", "DRAMeXchange Forum", "Next Generation Networks Taipei", "Taiwan Design Center Forum", "CE Summit", "Green IT Forum" held at the Taipei International Convention Center. TWTC Nangang was organized for buyers and companies to glance the vision of global ICT industry during the show hours. Since Jonney Shih, Chairman of ASUStek, showcased &lt;a href="w%3AEee%20PC"&gt;Eee PC&lt;/a&gt; before its launch during 2007 e21 Forum, seminars were progressively respected by industrial businessmen, especially international buyers.

Not only will there be a senior competition - Best Choice of COMPUTEX, mainly promoted by the TCA, but also the TAITRA will cooperate with &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Forum%20Design"&gt;International Forum Design (iF)&lt;/a&gt; holding the "Design and Innovation Award of COMPUTEX". Its goals aims at discovering innovative and brand-new IT products to elevate the notability of &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;'s innovations.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; torch has returned to Chinese soil. More than 1 million &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; residents and visitors ignored light showers on Friday to greet and cheer the Olympic torch relay. Hong Kong is the first Chinese destination to welcome the Olympic flame after its month-long journey across the world, spanning 19 cities.

It was the Hong Kong's first Olympic torch relay since the &lt;a href="w%3A1964%20Tokyo%20Olympics"&gt;1964 Tokyo Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. The eight-hour torch run included carrying the flame aboard a dragon boat across the &lt;a href="w%3AShing%20Mun%20River"&gt;Shing Mun River&lt;/a&gt;, and on horseback into the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Venue and &lt;a href="w%3ASha%20Tin%20Racecourse"&gt;Sha Tin Racecourse&lt;/a&gt;. Hong Kong, a co-host city of the Beijing Games in August, will stage the equestrian events.

"Today, the Olympic torch relay resumes on Chinese soil after its global journey across five continents. It is a great and solemn honor for Hong Kong, Asia's world city, to be the first in China to welcome back the Olympic flame on behalf of our proud nation," said Hong Kong Chief Executive &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Tsang"&gt;Donald Tsang&lt;/a&gt;.

The torch relay began at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre at Tsim Sha Tsui where 1996 Atlanta Olympic gold medalist for windsurfing, &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Lai-shan"&gt;Lee Lai-shan&lt;/a&gt; received the torch from Chief Executive, Donald Tsang. Lee then handed the Olympic flame to Olympic table tennis silver medalist Li Ching, who passed it to his doubles partner &lt;a href="w%3AKo%20Lai-Chak"&gt;Ko Lai-Chak&lt;/a&gt;. Lee said, "It is one of my big moments and I am feeling the same excitement I did when I won the Olympic gold medal."

Early in the morning, a large number of people gathered on both sides of Nathan Road in preparation for the events. Many of the spectators wore red clothes to match the colour of the Chinese flag.

One hundred and twenty torchbearers carried the torch on a 26-km route. The torch bearers passed landmarks such as the &lt;a href="w%3ATsing%20Ma%20Bridge"&gt;Tsing Ma Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the Avenue of Stars, before it was ferried across &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Harbor"&gt;Victoria Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong%20Island"&gt;Hong Kong Island&lt;/a&gt;.

Asian Games champion cyclist &lt;a href="w%3AWong%20Kam-po"&gt;Wong Kam-po&lt;/a&gt; was the last to the carry the Olympic torch. Wong carried the torch to the Golden Bauhinia Square in &lt;a href="w%3AWan%20Chai"&gt;Wan Chai&lt;/a&gt;, where he lit the cauldron, pulling down the curtain and ending the Hong Kong leg of the torch relay.

In a dominating performance, Big Brown triumphed in the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Kentucky%20Derby"&gt;2008 Kentucky Derby&lt;/a&gt;. Jockey &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Desormeaux"&gt;Kent Desormeaux&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Brown"&gt;Big Brown&lt;/a&gt; a stalking ride, even as he was 4-wide along the backstretch. Once they reached the top of the stretch, Big Brown grabbed the lead and won going away, 4 3/4 lengths away from filly &lt;a href="w%3AEight%20Belles"&gt;Eight Belles&lt;/a&gt;. Desormeaux wins his third Kentucky Derby, while trainer Richard Dutrow savored his victory after having bragged about how well his horse is for the Derby. 
Shortly after the race finished, Eight Belles collapsed on the backstretch, shattering her two front ankles. She was euthanized minutes later. Veterinarian Larry Bramlage conceded that "there was no possible way Eight Belles could be saved... that's an injury that's very painful." The moment was bittersweet for trainer Larry Jones, who sent Eight Belle's stablemate &lt;a href="w%3AProud%20Spell"&gt;Proud Spell&lt;/a&gt; to victory in the &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky%20Oaks"&gt;Kentucky Oaks&lt;/a&gt;.

Sent off 2-1 as the post-time favorite, Big Brown paid $6.80 to win. The $2 exacta (20-5) paid $141.60. The $1 trifecta (20-5-16) paid a healthy $1,722.80 with 13-1 shot Denis of Cork, and the $1 superfecta (20-5-16-2) paid a very respectable $29,368.90 with 37-1 shot Tale of Ekati. 

Big Brown is being pointed to run in the &lt;a href="w%3APreakness%20Stakes"&gt;Preakness Stakes&lt;/a&gt; on May 17. However, few horses from this year's Kentucky Derby are looking to follow, opting instead to run in the &lt;a href="w%3ABelmont%20Stakes"&gt;Belmont Stakes&lt;/a&gt; on June 7.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has announced it is dropping its bid to acquire one of their Internet competitors, &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;, after a three-month courting effort by Microsoft.

Microsoft chief executive officer, &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Ballmer"&gt;Steve Ballmer&lt;/a&gt; notified Yahoo! chief executive officer, chairman and co-founder, &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Yang"&gt;Jerry Yang&lt;/a&gt; via a letter that Microsoft was dropping their bid for the Sunnyvale, California based search engine giant.

In a press release from Microsoft, Ballmer said, “Despite our best efforts, including raising our bid by roughly &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;5 billion, Yahoo! has not moved toward accepting our offer. After careful consideration, we believe the economics demanded by Yahoo! do not make sense for us, and it is in the best interests of Microsoft stockholders, employees and other stakeholders to withdraw our proposal”.

Microsoft withdrew its bid effort after raising their bid from $44.6 billion to $47.5 billion, which works out at $33 per share. However, Yahoo! were waiting for a bid of around $53 billion, which was more than Microsoft were willing to pay.

Microsoft had previously wanted to takeover Yahoo! in-order to compete with Google, the market leader in online advertising. The online advertising market was worth $40 billion in 2007 and will rise to an expected $80 billion in 2010.

Some observers, however, are speculating that the bid withdrawal could just be another tactic in their attempt to acquire Yahoo!. Yahoo shares have dropped since the bid was pulled out.

Three teenagers have been taken from a compound in &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; after it was alleged that minors in the compond, called the &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Our%20Righteousness%20Church"&gt;Lord Our Righteousness Church&lt;/a&gt; were being abused.

A person from the compound said, "Recently representatives from CYFD [Children Youth and Family Department of New Mexico] came to our land and kidnapped three teenagers who are part of our family here." He continued, " I call it an abduction because that is how God views it. There were no moral grounds for them to be taken."

Rescuers in &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; are seeking a plane that disappeared Friday carrying six people, two local pilots and four &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; investors interested in a possible new housing development.

The dual-engined &lt;a href="w%3ACessna%20310"&gt;Cessna 310&lt;/a&gt;, operated by Aero Star, lost contact with &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Traffic%20Control"&gt;Air Traffic Control&lt;/a&gt; (ATC) eight miles (13km) off the coast near &lt;a href="w%3AIlheus"&gt;Ilheus&lt;/a&gt;, where it was intending to land in nine minutes time and was making a visual approach to &lt;a href="w%3AIlh%C3%A9us%20Jorge%20Amado%20Airport"&gt;Ilhéus Jorge Amado Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The flight had originated in &lt;a href="w%3ASalvador"&gt;Salvador&lt;/a&gt; and made last contact at 5:43 p.m. local time (2043 GMT) with Ilheus control tower.

The four passengers have been identified as Sean Woodhall, Ricky Every, Alan Kempson and Nigel Hodges. The planned development they had been considering is a luxury estate planned by Worldwide Destinations, who Sean Woodhall owns. It is based in &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and constructs worldwide luxury property developments.

Ricky Every works for Worldwide Destinations, and Alan Kempson and Nigel Hodges are both directors of UK finance company Diamond Lifestyle Holdings, who had been considering a deal with Worldwide. At least three of the four did not live in the UK.

The search for the aircraft is focusing on a location 20 miles (32km) North of Ilheus, where there are eyewitness reports that a light aircraft was flying extremely low and without lights, leading authorities to believe the aircraft loss power. Investigations are probing some reports of witnessing a plane crash, and there are unconfirmed rumours that wreckage has been found.

Brazil's Coast Guard, three Aero Star helicopters and &lt;a href="w%3ABahia"&gt;Bahia&lt;/a&gt; state police are all participating in the search. The weather was good at the time and the flight crew hadn't reported any issues to ATC.

No one was injured when one or more pipe bombs exploded outside the Edward J. Schwartz Federal Courthouse located in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

The bomb exploded around 1:40 a.m. Sunday morning on May 4, 2008 and was reported by guards patrolling the building. Debris from the blast was found across the street in the &lt;a href="w%3AAT%26amp%3BT"&gt;AT&amp;T&lt;/a&gt; building eight stories above the lobby of the courthouse. Doors were blown out along with several windows, but there was no other damage.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (FBI) and &lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20Firearms%20and%20Explosives"&gt;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives&lt;/a&gt; (ATF) is investigating the incident and evidence has been sent to an FBI laboratory in &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; for analysis.

Video footage from surrounding cameras is being analyzed, but so far there are no suspects and no one has claimed responsibility for the blast. The courthouse did not receive any threats prior to the blast. Authorities swept the areas surrounding the courthouse, but no other explosive devices were found.

The courthouse will remain closed today to repair the damage and for authorities to finish the investigation.

Researchers have found that, in terms of survival, assessing the status of a &lt;a href="w%3AHIV/AIDS"&gt;HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt; patient by clinical examination is almost as reliable as laboratory blood testing during their course of treatment.

Poor access to laboratory tests should therefore not be a barrier to rolling out &lt;a href="w%3Aantiretroviral"&gt;antiretroviral&lt;/a&gt; (ARV) drug programmes for HIV in developing countries, they say.

The findings were published in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lancet"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ recently.

Patients on first-line ARVs in the developed world are monitored regularly for the amount of HIV circulating in their blood. When this falls below a certain level, treatment switches to second-line ARVs.

But because of limited access to laboratory tests, the WHO recommends that people in the developing world are monitored for clinical signs of HIV progression, such as bacterial infection in the mouth and certain types of cancer.

Monitoring of CD4 cell levels — an indicator of the health of a patient's immune system — is also used when laboratory testing is available. Until now, little was known about the effectiveness of this strategy.

The researchers used a computer model to simulate the course of HIV infection and estimate the impact on survival of monitoring by viral load, CD4 count or clinical observation. 

The model was initially developed for wealthy countries, but was adapted for lower-income countries by taking into account factors such as interruptions in drug supply.

It predicts that after five years, 83 per cent of patients monitored by viral load, 82 per cent of patients monitored by CD4 cell count, and 82 per cent of patients monitored by clinical examination alone, would have survived. This decreases to 67, 64 and 64 per cent, respectively, after 20 years.

Andrew Phillips, professor of epidemiology at the UK-based Royal Free &amp; University College Medical School and lead author of the study, says the findings shouldn't dissuade people from relying on viral-load monitoring.

"I certainly wouldn't want to inhibit the roll-out of viral-load monitoring and the development of cheap and robust tests that don't rely heavily on infrastructure or highly skilled laboratory staff," he told SciDev.Net.

But, he says, that shouldn't be done at the cost of getting ARVs to everyone who needs them.

"The issue of whether to use viral-load monitoring or not pales into insignificance when dealing with whether you've actually got everyone who needs ARVs on therapy. Having drugs without viral-load monitoring is a lot better than not having drugs."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Early &lt;a href="w%3ACinco%20de%20Mayo"&gt;Cinco De Mayo&lt;/a&gt; celebrations were interrupted after a suspicious package caused the closure of a busy street in Buffalo, New York's Allentown District. For nearly three hours on Monday May 5, 2008 a busy street, popular with bars and hotels, was shut down while authorities examined the package.

According to Buffalo Police spokesman Mike DeGeorge, workers in the offices on the 500 block of Delaware Avenue witnessed a suspicious person placing a suspicious package inside a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Parcel%20Service"&gt;United Parcel Service&lt;/a&gt; (UPS) drop box at around 4:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;).

"It is my understanding that at about 4:30 this afternoon, a call went out for a suspicious person. Police responded and it appears there may have been a suspicious individual who was acting somewhat suspicious when he threw or tossed a package into a UPS box," DeGeorge stated to reporters.

"The individual had a package under his jacket which tipped off the person as being suspicious. He dropped the package into the [box], and made his way out to Delaware Ave. towards Allen," stated Buffalo Police Lt., K Szyszkowski.

When police arrived on scene, they evacuated the offices at 570 and the New York State Health Department building at 584 Delaware Avenue, while the Erie County Bomb Squad was called in to examine the drop box and the packages. The street between Allen and North was shut down to traffic while police secured the scene. When ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ freelance reporter arrived on scene, at least 20 people were standing outside the buildings, most of whom appeared to be office employees.

At approximately 6:10 p.m., the bomb squad arrived along with a K-9 unit. The commander of the bomb squad, Daniel Walczak entered the area between the buildings where the drop box was at about 7:15. He then opened the box and examined several packages with an X-ray machine, but found nothing to indicate an explosive device was present. After about 15 minutes, Walczak exited the area with the suspect packages.

"It was a regular envelope, a UPS container about 18 inches by a foot and a half. As of right now, I am not going to get into anything about the package weight until we go through a thorough investigation," stated Walczak to reporters. All of the packages will be sent to a laboratory for further analysis. Police would not say what might have been inside the packages.

Police do not have a suspect, but are reviewing security camera footage from the buildings. Szyszkowski states that witnesses say the suspect is a "white male, about 40-years-old [with a] green jacket and black pants."

The street later reopened just before 8:00 p.m..

Allentown is home to two major hotels and over a dozen bars, but is no stranger to suspicious activity. In November of 2007, at least 12 fire bombs were found inside a building at 15 Allen, just a few blocks away from Monday's incident.

After 1,581 consecutive days (just shy of 4 years and 4 months), David Witthoft of &lt;a href="w%3AConnecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; has stopped wearing his #4 &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Favre"&gt;Brett Favre&lt;/a&gt; jersey.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARidgefield%2C%20Connecticut"&gt;Ridgefield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; boy, 12, wore the No. 4 jersey every day after receiving it as a gift for &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;. David's father, Chuck, said Monday that his son's last day wearing the jersey was April 23--his 12th birthday.

Witthoft conceded his son was starting to become more concerned about his appearance after the jersey barely came down to his belt line. In 2007, Witthoft said he "would keep wearing it as long as [he] could get it over [his] head." His mother, Carolyn, had washed the jersey every other day and mended it when needed.

Witthoft first gained national attention three years ago and attended his first &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Bay%20Packers"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; game in December 2007 (a 34-13 Packers victory over the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Lions"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt;). He's also planning to attend the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%208"&gt;September 8&lt;/a&gt; game when the Packers retire Favre's No. 4 against the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Bears"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AMonday%20Night%20Football"&gt;♡❤Monday Night Football♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

Witthoft has considered sending the jersey to the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Bay%20Packers%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Obama%20projected%20winner%20in%20North%20Carolina%20primary%2C%20Clinton%20wins%20Indiana%20by%20narrow%20margin&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; declared &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; the winner in the North Carolina Democratic primary, based on exit-polling data, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has also projected that Obama will win the North Carolina primary and take the majority of its 115 delegates. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also reported Obama winning in North Carolina, and described his current national status as an "almost unassailable lead in pledged delegates".

In North Carolina, Obama has won with 56% of the vote; whereas Clinton has claimed 41% of the vote.

72 delegates were at stake in Indiana, a state which Foon Rhee of ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Boston%20Globe"&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ described as "a must-win" for &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. Voter turnout was high in Indiana, and a judge ordered some of the state's polling locations to remain open past closing time due to long lines of people waiting to vote. 

Counting of the results was also delayed as returns from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALake%20County%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Lake County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a county which is considered a Obama stronghold because of the county's large African-American population and its close proximity to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were waited upon. Around 12:30 the results came through and which brought Obama 17,000 votes closer to Clinton, leading to a 2% margin over Obama. This was in contrast to earlier in the night when the polls first closed and Clinton lead over Obama in the double digits.
Both candidates made speeches, Clinton, speaking in Indianapolis, thanked her supporters and asked them to contribute money, noting "Tonight, I need your help to continue this journey." She also told supporters "Tonight, we have come from behind, we have broken the tie and, thanks to you, it is full speed on to the White House!"

Obama, who spoke to supporters in North Carolina, held a speech which dealt with division within the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;. Obama said that the party would not be "inalterably divided" noting that pundits are saying that "Senator Clinton's supporters will not support me, and that my supporters will not support her."
"I'm here tonight to tell you that I don't believe it. Yes, there have been bruised feelings on both sides. Yes, each side desperately wants their candidate to win. But ultimately, this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain. This election is about you — the American people — and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future."

Obama also mentioned that, "We cannot afford to give John McCain a chance to serve out George Bush's third term. We need change in America and that is why we will be united in November."

187 delegate votes, 115 delegates in North Carolina and the 72 in Indiana, were at stake and there are only five more states that will be voting after this. &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; also gets to cast its votes on June 1, 2008.

The agency which monitors Scientology in Germany is called the &lt;a href="w%3ABundesamt%20f%C3%BCr%20Verfassungsschutz"&gt;Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution&lt;/a&gt; (Germany's domestic intelligence agency), and has had the Church of Scientology under surveillance in Germany since 1997. The February ruling by the North Rhine-Westphalia Higher Administrative Court stated: "There are concrete indications that Scientology's activities are to implement Scientology's program in Germany and to expand more and more Scientology's principles in government, economy and society".

In the statement released Tuesday by the Church of Scientology's branch in Germany, the organization said it "felt it was time to reflect on the whole purpose of this battle of legal material and reach a sensible solution."

The Church of Scientology took German authorities to court in March 2003, seeking to stop further surveillance of their organization. In a November 2004 ruling, a court in &lt;a href="w%3ACologne"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt; upheld the legality of the German government's surveillance of the Church of Scientology. The 2004 ruling was upheld on February 12, 2008, in an appeal to the Higher Administrative Court in Münster.

In December 2007 top security officials in Germany asserted that the aims of Scientology are in conflict with the country's constitution, and requested that authorities investigate whether to ban Scientology in Germany. In January the interior affairs chief of the State of &lt;a href="w%3ASaxony"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (AP) that he thought a ban on Scientology in Germany was unlikely to occur.
In a post Wednesday to the newsgroup &lt;a href="w%3AAlt.religion.scientology"&gt;alt.religion.scientology&lt;/a&gt;, Scientology critic Raymond Hill commented on Scientology's recent actions, asking: "Scared that too much public awareness would be brought on its internal documents?" Hill runs the website "Scientology Critical Directory" at www.xenu-directory.net. 
In a blog post at a website for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Claire Hoffman was critical of Scientology's treatment in Germany, writing: "While I'm well aware of their checkered past, decrying it unconstitutional seems like a threatened position to take by a nation."

German Church of Scientology spokeswoman Sabine Weber told the AP that the organization has added a "declaration on human rights and democracy" to its bylaws, and has designated an individual to run its human rights program in the country.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;United States Department of State&lt;/a&gt; has criticized Germany for its surveillance of Scientology in its annual Human Rights Report.

On Tuesday the (DEA) raided several dorms, homes and apartments in connection with a drug operation that focused on &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20University"&gt;San Diego University&lt;/a&gt; campus. Several &lt;a href="w%3ATheta%20Chi"&gt;Theta Chi&lt;/a&gt; members have been arrested for possession and intent to distribute. 

In a press release the DEA states that a member of Theta Chi sent out a mass text message to his "faithful customers" stating that he and his "associates" would be unable to sell cocaine while they were in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; for a fraternity formal, according to the DEA. The text promoted a cocaine "sale" and listed the reduced prices on bulk quantities. 

"Attn faithful customers both myself and my associates will be in Vegas this coming weekend," the 19-year-old Theta Chi member known only as "Kenny" wrote in the text message. "So stock up, we will be back Sunday night." 

The DEA made over 100 drug purchases through this operation before its May 6th raid.

In response to this incident the Theta Chi National Fraternity ordered an immediate Suspension of the San Diego chapter. 

On May 7, SDSU officials stated that only 33 of those arrested were students, and that any inflated numbers issued originally to the press included students arrested months earlier, in some cases for simple possession.

The leader of a controversial religious group in &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; was arrested Tuesday and is being held by police on multiple charges of sexual contact with minors. Wayne Bent, 66, referred to by his followers as Michael Travesser, was arrested by state police at his compound near &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20County%2C%20New%20Mexico"&gt;Union County, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Bent is the leader of a group called the &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Our%20Righteousness%20Church"&gt;Lord Our Righteousness Church&lt;/a&gt;, which moved to its present location in New Mexico near the &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; border in 2000. His followers refer to the compound and the community as Strong City, and a former member estimates that approximately 50 people live at the compound. 
Department of Public Safety spokesman Peter Olson told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (AP) that Bent was charged with three counts of criminal sexual contact with a minor and three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. &lt;a href="w%3AClayton%2C%20New%20Mexico"&gt;Clayton, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; Police Department Chief Scott Julian confirmed the charges in a statement to &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;. 

Bent's bail was set at &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;500,000 cash by the local magistrate, and his arraignment is set for Thursday in Clayton. According to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Press%20International"&gt;United Press International&lt;/a&gt;, Bent denies that he has had sex with minors but admitted to "lying with naked virgins". Bent is being held at the Clayton-Union County Consolidated Detention Facility pending his arraignment.

State child welfare officials had received reports of inappropriate contact between Bent and children in the group. Last month, New Mexico authorities removed two girls and one boy from the compound. State Children, Youth and Families Department spokeswoman Romaine Serna told the AP that the children were removed from the compound following an April 22 investigation. "We did receive information alleging inappropriate contact with minors on the compound," said Serna in a statement to ABC News. The children were taken into state custody. The affidavit for Bent's arrest warrant alleges that he touched three underage girls in 2006 and 2007. One of the girls was under the age of 12, and all were under age 18. 
Bent was previously a preacher for the &lt;a href="w%3ASeventh-day%20Adventist%20Church"&gt;Seventh-day Adventist Church&lt;/a&gt;. After leaving the church in 1987 with a small group of his followers, he moved them to the current compound in Union County, where he claims to have received a message from &lt;a href="w%3AGod"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; where he was told he is the &lt;a href="w%3AMessiah"&gt;Messiah&lt;/a&gt;: "One day I was in my trailer just relaxing and there was nothing on my mind in particular and then God said to me you are the Messiah". Some of Bent's followers left the group after his proclamation that he was the Messiah, but the wives of two members of the group had sex with him in what they believed was a testament to his divinity. Bent admits that he has also had sex with the wife of his son Jeff. 
Prudence Welch, a former member of the group who left in 2005, was interviewed by &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20O%27Reilly%20%28commentator%29"&gt;Bill O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt; on the program ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20O%27Reilly%20Factor"&gt;The O'Reilly Factor&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on &lt;a href="w%3AFOX%20News"&gt;FOX News&lt;/a&gt;. When O'Reilly asked Welch if Travesser/Bent was doing anything illegal at the compound, Welch responded: "Well, I think that laying naked with underage girls is illegal." She also commented: "The last eight years is when it got the worst, and when I left I realized how manipulative he [Bent] was."

Bent had predicted that the world would end on October 31, 2007. The group was profiled in a &lt;a href="w%3ADocumentary%20film"&gt;documentary film&lt;/a&gt; which aired Wednesday on the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Geographic%20Channel"&gt;National Geographic Channel&lt;/a&gt;, titled ♡❤Inside a Cult♡❤. The film was adapted from the documentary ♡❤End of a World Cult♡❤, which was shown last year on &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt;. All of the minors that had been removed from the compound in April appear in the documentary. The documentary also discusses controversial groups &lt;a href="w%3APeoples%20Temple"&gt;Peoples Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABranch%20Davidians"&gt;Branch Davidians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHeaven%27s%20Gate%20%28religious%20group%29"&gt;Heaven's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and their respective leaders &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Jones"&gt;Jim Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Koresh"&gt;David Koresh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMarshall%20Applewhite"&gt;Marshall Applewhite&lt;/a&gt;.

The price of oil per barrel has risen to a new all time high. During trading in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; the price of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mercantile%20Exchange"&gt;NYMEX&lt;/a&gt; Crude oil futures, per barrel, was at &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollars"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$124.34 (22:07 &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;) setting a new record high. &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Crude"&gt;Brent Crude&lt;/a&gt; oil also hit a new record high of US$122.84, but soon retreated to $121.79.
Several factors, including a weaker U.S. dollar and worries on the world supply, have caused the price of oil to skyrocket in the past week.

Despite worries, &lt;a href="w%3AOPEC"&gt;OPEC&lt;/a&gt; states that supply is currently meeting the current demands and there is currently no shortage of oil.

"There is clearly no shortage of oil in the market. OECD commercial oil stocks remain above the five-year average, with days of forward cover at a comfortable level of more than 53 days. US crude inventories, meanwhile, rose by almost six million barrels last week, which is a further indication that oil supplies are plentiful," stated OPEC in a statement on its website.

<h1>Ex-head of Qantas freight operations in US jailed for price fixing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ex-head%20of%20Qantas%20freight%20operations%20in%20US%20jailed%20for%20price%20fixing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Bruce McCaffrey, who was formerly the vice-president in charge of freight operations in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n flag carrier &lt;a href="w%3AQantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt;, has been sentenced to eight months imprisonment and fined &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;21,000 by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) for his involvement in a major air cargo price fixing cartel.

McCaffrey is one of six past and present employees of the airline who have been charged over the arrangement, which is thought to have run for six years starting in 2000. He is also the first individual to be sentenced regarding the cartel. He, as well as Stephen Cleary, group general manager for freight in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, Harold Pang, general manager for freight sales in &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, Peter Frampton, former group general manager for freight, John Cooper former general manager for freight sales and Desmond Church, a former freight employee, were all charged after being exempt from immunity granted in a &lt;a href="w%3Aplea%20bargain"&gt;plea bargain&lt;/a&gt; by Qantas in which the airline paid a US$61 million fine. 

In Australia price fixing is not actually a criminal offense, so former head of freight Peter Frampton and three other staff members in Australia will not be extradited to face charges. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Competition%20and%20Consumer%20Commission"&gt;Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&lt;/a&gt; is seeking admittances of guilt from airlines whose operations fall under its jurisdiction in exchange for lighter penalties. Qantas is amongst those airlines.

The cartel, which prevented competition in air freight shipments rates, is said to involve almost thirty airlines. As well as Qantas, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Airlines"&gt;Japan Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="British%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20Air"&gt;Korean Air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALufthansa"&gt;Lufthansa&lt;/a&gt; have all had their involvement confirmed. Whistleblower Lufthansa, a &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; airline, was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for exposing the operation. In August, British Airways and Korean Air pled guilty to their involvement and received fines of US$300 million each. Last month Japan Airlines also admitted to their role and paid a US$110 million fine. Amongst the others alleged to be involved are &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Air New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Singapore%20Airlines"&gt;Singapore Airlines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACathay%20Pacific"&gt;Cathay Pacific&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of Australian businesses are involved in a &lt;a href="w%3Aclass%20action%20suit"&gt;class action suit&lt;/a&gt; against these seven airlines for &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;200 million that they believe was unfairly charged to them as a result of criminal activity.

McCarthy, who ran Qantas's Australia-US cargo route for twenty years, entered a plea bargain with the authorities. Under the US &lt;a href="w%3ASherman%20Act"&gt;Sherman Act&lt;/a&gt; he could have faced up to a US$1.06 million fine and up to 10 years imprisonment, but the DoJ says that the maximum fine could actually be double the gain from the offences committed or double the loss of those victimised if either were found to be higher than the normal maximum. According to the case, he was involved with "meetings, conversations and communications in the US and elsewhere to discuss the cargo rates to be charged on certain routes to and from the US".

In light of the news, shares in Qantas fell 3¢ to AU$3.41.

Bayern Munich's win over MSV Duisburg condemned Duisburg to second division football next term.

Bayern Munich took a 3-0 lead after 20 minutes, an Andreas Ottl goal along with quick-fire Lukas Podolski brace ensuring the champions had a comfortable ride through to half time.

However, the match took a sudden and dramatic twist in the ten minutes following the restart as Mihai Tararache and Markus Daun scored to hauled the Duisburg right back into the game, and an upset briefly appeared a possibility. However, Bayern Munich would go onto a comfortable win.

&lt;a href="w%3AGrangemouth%20Refinery"&gt;Grangemouth oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; has seen a fire, which has since been extinguished. The facility was operating at 80% of its 200,000 barrel per day capacity after operations were shut down for a two-day strike last month. 

A spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AIneos"&gt;Ineos&lt;/a&gt;, who operate the site, said that it was expected that the fire would delay the restoration of full operations at the plant. According to a spokesman from the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Scotland%20Fire%20and%20Rescue%20Service"&gt;Central Scotland Fire and Rescue Service&lt;/a&gt; said it is believed that the fire began after oil spilt from the &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrocracker"&gt;hydrocracker&lt;/a&gt; onto hot pipework. The hydrocracker is used to break down thicker &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrocarbon"&gt;hydrocarbon&lt;/a&gt;s into lighter variants, and in this way produces products such as &lt;a href="w%3Adiesel"&gt;diesel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aaviation%20fuel"&gt;aviation fuel&lt;/a&gt;. The fire was on the diesel line.

The plant, which is located on the &lt;a href="w%3AFirth%20of%20Forth"&gt;Firth of Forth&lt;/a&gt;, was previously expected to be running at full capacity by May 18. The fire, which the Ineos spokesman described as a "very small incident", started at 2:10am and was extinguished by 5:00am.

Ineos, who purchased the site from &lt;a href="w%3ABP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, are investigating.

At least 23 people have been killed in late afternoon in broad daylight, with dark (very dark) clouds &lt;a href="tornado"&gt;tornadoes&lt;/a&gt; that ripped through the central &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday May 10 with over 150 reported injured and at least three people are missing. Tornadoes hit towns on the &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; borders which caused significant damage. Several watches and warnings for storms and tornadoes remain today. At 4:11 a.m. (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) on Sunday, nearly the entire states of &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; were encompassed with tornado watches and severe thunderstorm warnings.

In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APicher%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Picher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; where the tornado is reported to have started, 7 were killed, including an infant. The tornado then traveled across state lines to Missouri where 14 were killed near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeneca%2C%20Missouri"&gt;Seneca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and then into &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28US%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; where two people were killed. Officials state the death toll is likely to climb. 

"It’s a bad deal. There are maybe 150 badly damaged homes on south side of town," said Picher's town attorney, Erick Johnson. More than two dozen streets in Picher are described as being wiped out. Oklahoma's governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Henry"&gt;Brad Henry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has ordered the national guard to the area to help in aiding those hit by the storms.

"[Our] thoughts and prayers are with the people of Picher and all of the other Oklahoma communities," said Henry in a statement to the press, who also plans to visit the areas hardest hit on Sunday.

Buildings have been destroyed and people have been reported to be trapped in debris from tornadoes that touched down. Trees were thrown from yards and cars were overturned. Tornadoes were also reported in &lt;a href="Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; and in Oklahoma, one tornado left more than 15 miles of destruction with some places seeing a path over a half mile wide. Rescue efforts are hampered by the darkness, making it difficult for rescuers to find people who are trapped.

"It's hard to do in the dark. They're going over the hard-hit area and turning over everything and looking," said Susie Stonner, a spokeswoman for SEMA.

At last count, 34 tornadoes were reported in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, but reports say that some eyewitness accounts were of the same tornadoes. At 02:48 (UTC) on Sunday morning, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADoppler%20radar"&gt;Doppler radar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; showed very strong storms in Arkansas, &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, Missouri and &lt;a href="Mississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;.

After the final match of the season, &lt;a href="w%3AGalatasaray%20S.K."&gt;Galatasaray&lt;/a&gt; became the champions of &lt;a href="w%3ATurkcell%20Super%20League"&gt;Turkish Super League&lt;/a&gt; with 79 points in 34 games, six points ahead of rivals &lt;a href="Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F%20J.K."&gt;Besiktas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFenerbah%C3%A7e%20S.K."&gt;Fenerbahce&lt;/a&gt;.

The 50th season of the top-flight football league in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; ended Saturday as Galatasaray and Fenerbahce qualify for next season's Champions League, third-place Beşiktaş J.K. and Federation Cup winner &lt;a href="w%3AKayserispor"&gt;Kayserispor&lt;/a&gt; qualify for the &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Cup"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. There was disappointment for &lt;a href="w%3ASivasspor"&gt;Sivasspor&lt;/a&gt;, who came fourth by having same points with Besiktas but less goal average.

Galatasaray trainer &lt;a href="w%3ACevat%20G%C3%BCler"&gt;Cevat Guler&lt;/a&gt; stated that, "There may have been times in recent weeks when the fans didn't think we would be champions... but we are delighted and thank everyone for their support."

The &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;-based club started season with German coach &lt;a href="w%3AKarl-Heinz%20Feldkamp"&gt;Karl-Heinz Feldkamp&lt;/a&gt;, who resigned at the start of April, citing differences with the management. Galatasaray were two points behind Fenerbahçe when Cevat Guler took over in a caretaker role. Also, the team hit by number of injuries, including two key foreign players of this season - &lt;a href="w%3ATobias%20Linderoth"&gt;Linderoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%20%28footballer%29"&gt;Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;. However they accomplished five victories in last five games of season and clinched the 17th title for Galatasaray S.K.

After the match, thousands of Turks of all ages rallied at Istanbul's central Taksim Square to celebrate with fireworks, flags and slogans, singing the club anthems. Similar celebrations took place in big cities like &lt;a href="w%3AAnkara"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A%C4%B0zmir"&gt;İzmir&lt;/a&gt; in the huge outdoor parties, organized on the spot, letting them join their voice with millions of fans around the country celebrating the 17th title of the club.

Friday, May 9, &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Folds"&gt;Ben Folds&lt;/a&gt; played at &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Connecticut%20State%20University"&gt;Western Connecticut State University&lt;/a&gt; (WCSU) in &lt;a href="w%3ADanbury%2C%20Connecticut"&gt;Danbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ was there for the concert.

Billed as the main event for WCSU's annual "West Fest", the concert took place in the Feldman Arena, which is part of the &lt;a href="w%3AO%27Neill%20Center"&gt;O'Neill Center&lt;/a&gt; on the western campus of the university.

The opening act for Folds was Julia Nunes, who by all accounts is on her first tour. Nunes gained attention on &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and got featured on the front page for her quirky, self-recorded performances.

Nunes is a graduate of &lt;a href="w%3AFairport%20High%20School"&gt;Fairport High School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and is now a college &lt;a href="w%3Afreshman"&gt;freshman&lt;/a&gt;. Nunes performed a half-hour set of songs, about half of which were of her own composition and the rest &lt;a href="w%3Acover%20version"&gt;covers&lt;/a&gt; of other artists. During the first half of her set she played the &lt;a href="w%3Aukulele"&gt;ukulele&lt;/a&gt; and thereafter the &lt;a href="w%3Aguitar"&gt;guitar&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite Nunes' well-received set, it was clear that the crowd was there to see Ben Folds perform. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; singer-songwriter and former frontman of the musical group &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Folds%20Five"&gt;Ben Folds Five&lt;/a&gt; is widely acclaimed for his prowess as a &lt;a href="w%3Apiano"&gt;pianist&lt;/a&gt;, songwriter and performer.

Ben Folds performed unaccompanied, aside from "tambourine man", a stage hand who appeared briefly during three songs. Folds told the audience that he had been nervous as this was his first solo performance in "a while."

During the 100 minute concert, Ben Folds played many of his hits, including "&lt;a href="w%3ARockin%27%20the%20Suburbs%20%28song%29"&gt;Rockin' the Suburbs&lt;/a&gt;", "Annie Waits", "&lt;a href="w%3AStill%20Fighting%20It"&gt;Still Fighting It&lt;/a&gt;" and "Zak and Sara".

Folds also played a couple of songs that he said he wrote during a contract dispute with a record company. He wrote the songs because they were "mandatory" in his contract. According to Folds, he asked how many songs he had to write to get out of his contract. They told him, he had to write 4.6 songs to complete his obligation. Thusly, one of the songs was called, "One Down And 3.6 to Go".

Near the end of the set, Ben Folds stood on his piano and directed the crowd as a &lt;a href="w%3Achoir"&gt;choir&lt;/a&gt;. The audience was eager to participate in this experiment, which consisted of humming in different notes, and seemed to enjoy it. Folds seemed quite earnest in his appreciation of the audience's efforts.

After the set ended, the enthusiastic crowd of mostly WCSU students started to call out for Folds to reappear. He duly acquiesced and performed a few more songs before the crowd would go home.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) a &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20Magnitude%20Scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 7.92 &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; has struck eastern &lt;a href="w%3ASichuan%20Province"&gt;Sichuan Province&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. The USGS first reported the quake to be a magnitude 7.8 which hit at 6:28:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;. Officials say that at least 10,000 may have been killed and local reports indicate over 10,000 injured.

At least 107 people, some of them school children, were killed when two schools collapsed. It is reported that 900 students remain trapped in the rubble. Two people were killed after a water tower fell over. According to the USGS, damage is expected to be "very heavy" and that "some reports of damage have been received. Felt widely throughout China." Officials now fear landslides and mudslides.

"The epicenter of today's quake was shallow, which means it released more destructive energy. We have to guard against mudslides and collapsing buildings," said China Seismology Bureau scientist, Zhang Guomin.

The quake's epicenter was located in the Aba prefecture, 90 kilometers (55 miles) west, northwest of Chengdu, Sichuan, China and was recorded at a depth of 10 k.m. (6.2 miles). At least 11,000 people reside in the area, and because of poor communications due to the quake, the total extent of the damage is not known.

Several counties have been hit hard, including Beichuan, in which 80% of the buildings have been reported to have collapsed. Deaths from this area have not been accurately accounted for yet. In another county, already 3,000-5,000 are reported to have died, with a further 10,000 injured.

The quake could be felt as far away as &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. At least 13 large aftershocks with a magnitude ranging from 4.9 to 6.0 have been recorded.

This is the largest earthquake to strike the region in almost 60 years. The &lt;a href="w%3A1976%20Tangshan%20earthquake"&gt;deadliest quake&lt;/a&gt; in China's history was of magnitude 7.8, striking &lt;a href="w%3ATangshan"&gt;Tangshan&lt;/a&gt; in 1976. Approximately 250,000 people were killed.

The investigation into the crash of a &lt;a href="British%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20777"&gt;777&lt;/a&gt; (B777) written off on January 17 after landing short of the runway at &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20International%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow International Airport&lt;/a&gt; has been updated. The crash of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways%20Flight%2038"&gt;Flight 38&lt;/a&gt; injured one passenger seriously and 12 others on board, including four crew members, as well as being the first hull loss of a B777.

The latest word from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Accidents%20Investigation%20Branch"&gt;Air Accidents Investigation Branch&lt;/a&gt; (AAIB) is that both engines had low fuel pressure in their high pressure (HP) fuel inlets, leading to the failure of both engines. Having departed from &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; the aircraft was on final approach for landing at Heathrow when the thrust on the engines first reduced and became unresponsive, then ceased completely. The copilot, who was flying the aircraft at the time, received significant media praise for gliding the aircraft past housing and airport barriers to crash land the airliner onto the grass at the runway threshold, likely saving the 136 passengers and 16 crew from death or further injury as well as preventing potential ground casualties. The landing gear collapsed and the airframe, wings and engines were significantly damaged.

Each HP inlet also exhibited "unusual and fresh cavitation damage to the outlet ports consistent with operation at low inlet pressure", according to the AAIB's latest report on investigatory progress, which also states engine failure was definitely caused by low pressure and that the &lt;a href="w%3Aautothrottle"&gt;autothrottle&lt;/a&gt; had opened up appropriate valves fully in an effort to increase fuel flow, but to no avail. The report indicates the investigation has also considered an area of unusually cold air over &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; which the B777 passed through at 40,000 &lt;a href="w%3Afoot%20%28unit%20of%20measurement%29"&gt;feet&lt;/a&gt; on its journey. Between the &lt;a href="w%3AUral%20mountain%20range"&gt;Ural mountain range&lt;/a&gt; and East &lt;a href="w%3AScandinavia"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt; the air was found to have been as low as -76&lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;°C&lt;/a&gt;. The AAIB has ruled out fuel turning to ice as the fuel temperature never fell below -34°C. This is compared to an average freezing temperature of -47°C for jet fuel and test showing the fuel in the B777's tanks needed cooled to at least -57°C before it froze. Floating ice particles had previously been suggested as a possible causal factor.

However, it has been suggested outside of the investigation that although the fuel did not freeze, it could have become unusually thickened, restricting its flow through the HP inlets, although the temperatures did remain within what are currently considered safe levels. Another possible explanation was that the fuel was contaminated or of inferior quality, but the AAIB has ruled this out. Also disproved are suggestions that the plane suffered a &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20strike"&gt;bird strike&lt;/a&gt; or that it was disrupted by &lt;a href="w%3Aelectromagnetic"&gt;electromagnetic&lt;/a&gt; interference from jamming devices set up to protect a motorcade carrying &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;.

The report says that there was also no evidence to suggest any control systems failed, that the aircraft encountered a &lt;a href="w%3Awake%20vortex"&gt;wake vortex&lt;/a&gt; or that there was core engine icing or other evidence that the engines suffered &lt;a href="w%3Acore%20lock"&gt;core lock&lt;/a&gt;. There was no damage to the fuel systems excluding that caused by the low pressure and no blockages, therefore it is suspected that fuel flow was restricted.

The investigation has also begun analysing previous flights on comparable aircraft in a large sample of flights. Thus far, no parameters present on Flight 38 have been found that differ significantly from anything previously encountered. The purpose is primarily to identify potentially troublesome combinations of unusual operational parameters.

The report concludes by stating that interested parties to the investigation, specifically the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt;, the , the &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Aviation%20Authority"&gt;Civil Aviation Authority&lt;/a&gt; and British Airways are being kept fully informed of the investigation's progress.

Although this shows some progress, according to David Learmount, operations and safety editor at periodical industry magazine ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFlight%20International"&gt;Flight International&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, “This report takes us absolutely nowhere, I think they still have no idea.”

The B777 has never had any other hull losses or any fatal accidents and is considered to have one of the world's safest commercial airliners. According to one spokesman for British Airways “It has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft. At no stage since the accident has the AAIB, Boeing or Rolls Royce advised against the continued operation of the Boeing 777.” 

The engines underwent analysis at manufacturer &lt;a href="w%3ARolls-Royce%20plc"&gt;Rolls-Royce&lt;/a&gt;'s facility in &lt;a href="w%3ADerby"&gt;Derby&lt;/a&gt;, while airframer Boeing is studying the fuel systems in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Rolls Royce's engine test bed was modified to replicate control inputs from aircraft control systems, and Boeing are working at replicating the cold conditions experienced over Eastern &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The investigation is ongoing.

On May 11, President Kevin Baugh of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Molossia"&gt;Republic of Molossia&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Amicronation"&gt;micronation&lt;/a&gt; located near &lt;a href="w%3ADayton%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Dayton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, inaugurated his country's first ever customs station near the border with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, in the capital city of Espera.

It was built after Baugh noticed that the tiny nation had no welcoming spot for its visitors. Though the station is unmanned as of now, there are plans for a customs officer to be stationed there in the near future. A sign asks that foreigners leave their pocket change as an entry fee.

Several items are banned in Molossia, including &lt;a href="w%3Afirearms"&gt;firearms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Atobacco"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aincandescent%20light%20bulb"&gt;incandescent light bulbs&lt;/a&gt;. The customs station was designed to ensure that these are not illegally brought into the country from the United States.

74-year-old &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Agospel"&gt;gospel&lt;/a&gt; singer and writer &lt;a href="w%3ADottie_Rambo"&gt;Joyce 'Dottie' Rambo&lt;/a&gt; died Sunday morning when her tour bus crashed into a highway embankment in southwestern &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;.

The wreck occurred two miles east of &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Vernon%2C%20Missouri"&gt;Mount Vernon&lt;/a&gt;, Missouri, along &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2044"&gt;Interstate 44&lt;/a&gt;. Police say six other people were hospitalized with moderate to severe injuries in &lt;a href="w%3ASpringfield%2C%20Missouri"&gt;Springfield&lt;/a&gt;. Dottie was headed for a &lt;a href="w%3AMother%27s%20Day"&gt;Mother's Day&lt;/a&gt; concert in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Richland%20Hills%2C%20Texas"&gt;North Richland Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, when the accident occurred.

"I know Dottie is in heaven in the arms of God right now, but our earth angel will surely be missed," said &lt;a href="w%3ADolly%20Parton"&gt;Dolly Parton&lt;/a&gt; in a statement. A spokesperson for her recording label confirmed to a &lt;a href="w%3AKnoxville%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Knoxville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; television station that Dottie was asleep at the time of the accident.

Dottie started her career at the age of 12, and has written more than 2,500 songs since. She won a &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20Award"&gt;Grammy Award&lt;/a&gt; in 1968 for her album entitled "The Soul of Me". She was inducted into several halls-of-fame including the &lt;a href="w%3ANashville%20Songwriters%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, and into the &lt;a href="w%3AGospel%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Gospel Music Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; twice, first as a soloist in 1982 and again in 2001 as a member of the Rambos singing group with her daughter and Buck Rambo, former husband. Her newest album is set for release this summer and is entitled "Sheltered".

&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s coalition government will be no more, announced &lt;a href="w%3ANawaz%20Sharif"&gt;Nawaz Sharif&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20Muslim%20League%20%28N%29"&gt;Pakistan Muslim League&lt;/a&gt; (PML-N) and former Prime Minister. The coalition, which was formed between the PML-N and the &lt;a href="Pakistan%20Peoples%20Party"&gt;Pakistan Peoples Party&lt;/a&gt; (PPP), was said to have reached a disagreement over the restoration of judges fired by President &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; in November 2007.

According to party spokesman Sidiqul Farooq, the 9 PML-N ministers in government will hand in their resignation papers to Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AYousaf%20Raza%20Gillani"&gt;Yousaf Raza Gillani&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday afternoon. 

Sharif blamed the PPP for failing to meet deadlines to restore the senior judges fired by Musharraf, which was Sharif's main condition for joining the coalition. The latest deadline for reinstating the judges was set for May 12, as talks between Sharif and PPP leader &lt;a href="w%3AAsif%20Ali%20Zardari"&gt;Asif Ali Zardari&lt;/a&gt; ended in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; without reaching any deal. The government had originally promised to reinstate the judges by April 30. 

Most of the disagreement lies within the question of how much power should be returned to the judges. Sharif has campaigned for a total reinstatement of power, while Zadari favors constitutional amendments that would limit their power.
Information Secretary Ehsan Iqbal, one of the ministers who will be resigning, supported Sharif's campaign for reinstatement. He called the series of events "a defining moment" for Pakistan. "Without the rule of law, without an independent judiciary, the country cannot move ahead democratically or constitutionally," he said.

At a press conference, Sharif said he will contest the by-elections on August 18, which could earn him a seat in Parliament. The Pakistan Peoples Party say they will not put a candidate against him in the elections.

"A day will come when the judges shall be restored," Sharif said. "If we surrender on this issue to the wishes of the military dictator, it will take us generations before we get an independent judiciary." He also said that despite quitting the government, he wishes to continue supporting the PPP-led government on an issue-by-issue basis. "We will not become part of any conspiracy to destabilize the democratic process," he said.

The Pakistan Peoples Party responded in a statement. They called the announcement of resignation "a pause in the process and not a break in the purpose of restoration of judges". They also said they do not intend to fill the vacated ministries, hoping the issue can be solved "amicably and in a spirit of accommodation and mutual trust".

Some analysts fear the judicial dispute will extend further, leaving the government unable to focus on more important issues facing the country. "This is a huge setback for the government," said Shuja Nawaz, a Pakistani security analyst in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;. "This crisis will distract attention from critical issues, and the real losers will be the people of Pakistan."

Two people have died due to a recent car crash in Shepton Mallet, near &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

The incident occurred when a &lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Civic"&gt;Honda Civic&lt;/a&gt; Type R car swerved off the road. Police reports suggest that the car hit a tree, causing the two fatalities.

The incident resulted in the closure of the &lt;a href="w%3AA37%20road"&gt;A37 road&lt;/a&gt;, where the incident occurred, for several hours. It reopened at 01:00 UTC today.

&lt;a href="w%3AAvon%20and%20Somerset"&gt;Avon and Somerset&lt;/a&gt; police appealed for information regarding the crash:

Five men out of six accused of involvement in the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt; have been referred to trial by the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20military%20commission"&gt;Guantanamo military commission&lt;/a&gt;. The war crimes tribunal also dropped charges against &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Qahtani"&gt;Mohammed Qahtani&lt;/a&gt;, who is alleged to have been the '&lt;a href="w%3A20th%20hijacker"&gt;20th hijacker&lt;/a&gt;', although they were dropped "without prejudice" so the &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;n can still be re-charged.

All six men are currently being held in maximum security at the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; naval base at &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Under the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20Commissions%20Act"&gt;Military Commissions Act&lt;/a&gt; those charged must be arraigned within 30 days and have their trial commenced within four months.

The men are accused of plotting the attacks, in which four passenger airliners were hijacked in US airspace. One was flown into each tower of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;, one was flown into &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Pentagon"&gt;the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; and the fourth crashed in a &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; field. Almost 3,000 people were killed. 19 hijackers were involved, with one aircraft having four hijackers compared to five on the others, triggering theories concerning a 20th hijacker. It is alleged that Qahtani missed out on this role because he was unable to get past anti-immigration measures to upon arrival in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, where head hijacker &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Atta"&gt;Mohammed Atta&lt;/a&gt; is said to have been waiting.

Those who are set to go to trial are alleged members of &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, who were found to be responsible for the attacks. They are &lt;a href="w%3AWalid%20bin%20Attash"&gt;Walid bin Attash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARamzi%20Binalshibh"&gt;Ramzi Binalshibh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Abdul%20Aziz%20Ali"&gt;Ali Abdul Aziz Ali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMustafa%20Ahmed%20Hawsawi"&gt;Mustafa Ahmed Hawsawi&lt;/a&gt; and alleged 9/11 mastermind &lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Shaikh%20Mohammed"&gt;Khalid Shaikh Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;.

They have all been charged with conspiracy, murder in violation of the laws of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property, terrorism and material support for terrorism while all but Hawsawi are charged with hijacking aircraft as well.

Some concern has been made over alleged human rights abuses. Officials have said themselves that Qahtani was harshly treated in imprisonment and Khalid was subjected to &lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt;.

Qahtani also withdrew an earlier confession saying it was obtained from him under torture. He submitted a detailed written account describing abuse he alleges against him including beatings, being forced into uncomfortable positions for long periods, threats with dogs, exposure to music at high volume, being subjected to freezing temperatures and being forced to appear naked in front of female personnel.

The arraignments will take place at the high security Guantanamo war crimes tribunal, and will mark the first public appearances of the men since their capture. The trial will mark the first in front of a US war crimes tribunal since &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20Two"&gt;World War Two&lt;/a&gt;, and the first &lt;a href="w%3Acapital%20punishment"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; one at this tribunal as prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for all of the men.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has received a copyright infringement claim from &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt;, widely known as the Mormon Church or LDS Church. The infringement claim is in reference to a &lt;a href="w%3AUniform%20Resource%20Locator"&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; used as a source in a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ article about Mormon Church documents leaked to the website &lt;a href="w%3AWikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt;, titled "&lt;a href="Copy%20of%20handbook%20for%20leaders%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints%20obtained%20by%20Wikinews"&gt;Copy of handbook for leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints obtained by Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;". The URL was originally cited as a link in the sources subsection of the article. The Wikimedia Foundation is a donor-supported &lt;a href="w%3ANon-profit%20organization"&gt;non-profit organization&lt;/a&gt; which runs &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and ♡❤Wikinews♡❤. This is the first time that the Wikimedia Foundation has received a copyright infringement claim regarding an article published by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.

The ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ article, originally published on April 19, described material in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20Handbook%20of%20Instructions"&gt;Church Handbook of Instructions&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The work is a two-volume book of policies and is a guide for leaders of the Mormon Church. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ obtained the ♡❤Church Handbook of Instructions♡❤ from Wikileaks, a &lt;a href="w%3AWhistleblower"&gt;whistleblower&lt;/a&gt; website which publishes anonymous submissions of sensitive documents while preserving the anonymity of its contributors. Wikileaks describes the material as significant because "...the book is strictly confidential among the Mormon (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, aka LDS in short form) bishops and stake presidents and it reveals the procedure of handling confidential matters related to tithing payment, excommunication, baptism and doctrine teaching (indoctrination)." 
The material was released on the Wikileaks website on April 16, and according to the site was first made available on the document sharing website &lt;a href="w%3AScribd"&gt;Scribd&lt;/a&gt;. A message at Scribd now states: "This content was removed at the request of copyright agent B. S. Broadbent of the Intellectual Property Division of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." 

On May 5, the Wikimedia Foundation received a copyright infringement claim from &lt;a href="w%3AIntellectual%20Reserve"&gt;Intellectual Reserve, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, the legal entity that owns the &lt;a href="w%3AIntellectual%20property"&gt;intellectual property&lt;/a&gt; of the Mormon Church. The infringement claim is addressed to &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Adesignated%20agent"&gt;designated agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Wikimedia Foundation, and requests that access to the link to Wikileaks be removed. The link was removed from the article on May 5 by a ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ administrator, and the article remains available without the link. The infringement claim was sent by Berne S. Broadbent, president of Intellectual Reserve, Inc. and director of the Intellectual Property Division of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. According to &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Godwin"&gt;Mike Godwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20counsel"&gt;general counsel&lt;/a&gt; for the Wikimedia Foundation, the Mormon Church has not filed a &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt; (DMCA) notice with the foundation.

In 1999, &lt;a href="w%3AJerald%20and%20Sandra%20Tanner"&gt;Jerald and Sandra Tanner&lt;/a&gt;, prominent critics of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, released material from the ♡❤Church Handbook of Instructions♡❤ to the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; through their organization Utah Lighthouse Ministry, without including the copyright notice of Intellectual Reserve, Inc. or obtaining permission from the church. The website of the Utah Lighthouse Ministry describes as its purpose: "...to document problems with the claims of Mormonism and compare LDS doctrines with Christianity." The Tanners had received a copy of the 1998 edition of ♡❤Church Handbook of Instructions♡❤ from an anonymous sender in October 1999. They published 17 pages of the 160-page handbook on the Utah Lighthouse Ministry website.

The church sent the Tanners a letter threatening a copyright infringement lawsuit if the material was not removed, and the Tanners removed the material from their site the same day, and posted the church's letter to their website. The website still contained links to other locations that had the material, and an article in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20Tribune"&gt;Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ listed addresses of these links. The church sued the Tanners through its company Intellectual Reserve, in the 1999 case ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AIntellectual%20Reserve%20v.%20Utah%20Lighthouse%20Ministry"&gt;Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

The plaintiffs filed their complaint on October 13, 1999, and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20district%20court"&gt;United States district court&lt;/a&gt; issued a preliminary injunction on December 6, 1999 barring posting of the material by the defendants as well as posting links to other websites which contain the material. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and other news publications called the injunction a "&lt;a href="w%3AChilling%20effect"&gt;chilling effect&lt;/a&gt;". In November 2002, the church dropped the lawsuit against Utah Lighthouse Ministry, on condition that the Tanners destroy all copies of the ♡❤Church Handbook of Instructions♡❤, and not include more than 50 words at a time from the handbook in any of their future articles.
Wikileaks has received copyright infringement claims from organizations including the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AReligious%20Technology%20Center"&gt;Religious Technology Center&lt;/a&gt; and the Swiss &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20Julius%20Baer"&gt;Bank Julius Baer&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; government &lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20Shield%20Project"&gt;attempts to censor&lt;/a&gt; every website with the word "wikileaks" in the web page address. Bank Julius Baer sued Wikileaks after sending cease and desist letters in January 2008 which cited the &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20Julius%20Baer%20vs.%20Wikileaks%20lawsuit"&gt;As a result of the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, the bank obtained an injunction preventing the site's &lt;a href="w%3ADomain%20name%20registrar"&gt;domain name registrar&lt;/a&gt; from associating with Wikileaks, but this injunction was lifted in March 2008 and Bank Julius Baer dropped the case.

As of May 13 Wikileaks had not taken down the material on the ♡❤Church Handbook of Instructions♡❤, and a second webpage at the site with a different version of the material was also still available. In a statement to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, a Wikileaks representative commented on the material hosted at the site: "WikiLeaks will not remove the handbooks, which are of substantial interest to current and former Mormons. WikiLeaks will remain a place where people from around the world can safely reveal the truth."

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has decided not to participate in a panel discussion that is to take place at &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clara%20University"&gt;Santa Clara University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. The discussion, which is titled 'The World that Wikipedia Made,' was to be based on the online encyclopedia ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ethics involved in the editing of the website. It is the ninth such meeting in a series on technology, ethics, and law and is taking place today.

In an e-mail to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, Miriam Schulman the communications director for the &lt;a href="w%3AMarkkula%20Center%20for%20Applied%20Ethics"&gt;Markkula Center for Applied Ethics&lt;/a&gt; at Santa Clara University which is to host the discussion, states that &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Godwin"&gt;Mike Godwin&lt;/a&gt;, legal counsel for the Foundation, will not be speaking during the discussion as was originally planned. 

According to Schulman, Godwin canceled his scheduled appearance just one week ago and has decided not to have anyone from the foundation replace him. ♡❤Valleywag♡❤, a gossip website about technology, recently reported that Godwin was not attending due to a "groundswell of criticism of Wikipedia".

"I don't want to speak for Mr. Godwin or Wikimedia, but someone else made an incorrect assumption about this, so let me clarify that in our understanding, the problem was never with the composition of the panel. Mike Godwin, General Counsel of Wikimedia, was scheduled to participate in the panel, 'The World that Wikipedia Made,' on May 15. Last week, Mr. Godwin informed us that he would not participate, and subsequent discussions with Wikimedia Foundation indicated that they would not designate a replacement speaker," stated Schulman to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.

"This is our ninth such panel (in addition to the hundreds of events on other topics our centers run each year), and we feel confident in our ability to set a respectful tone for discourse on controversial topics," added Schulman.

Schulman would not comment on the reason for the Foundation's decision. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ also attempted to contact Godwin, but was directed to Jay Walsh who is the head of communications for the Foundation, but ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has not received a response.

The panel was to include &lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Hewitt"&gt;Carl Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; an electrical and computer science engineer at &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; and Godwin discussing ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ with Pedro Hernández-Ramos, associate director for the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Science%2C%20Technology%2C%20and%20Society"&gt;Center for Science, Technology, and Society&lt;/a&gt; moderating the discussion. The plan was to discuss ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤, and what does and doesn't work for the encyclopedia.

"This panel will explore what works and what doesn't in the Wikipedia editing model from the angles of ethics, expertise, education, and the law," said a statement on the Center's website.

Schulman states that the discussion, which is open to the public, is "still planned" for Thursday May 15 at 6:00 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;pacific time&lt;/a&gt;) at the &lt;a href="w%3ADe%20Saisset%20Museum"&gt;De Saisset Museum&lt;/a&gt; on the university's campus, but it is not yet known if anyone outside the Foundation will be replacing Godwin. The High Tech Law Institute along with the Ethics Center are sponsoring the discussion. Both individuals are still attending the discussion.

"These events are always open to the public, which means everyone is welcome. In this kind of setting, we invite anyone with an interest in the topic," stated Schulman to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.

The Foundation is the parent organization of ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ and other projects such as ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Commons"&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a Wiki dedicated to hosting images that can be used throughout the projects of the Foundation.

<h1>HP to aquire EDS for 13.9B</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=HP%20to%20aquire%20EDS%20for%2013.9B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AHewlett-Packard"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt; (HP), a global technology leader with major businesses operations in computer hardware, software, printing and services announced today that they will acquire &lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Data%20Systems"&gt;Electronic Data Systems&lt;/a&gt; (EDS) for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;13.9 billion in an all cash deal. The ♡❤Wall Street Journal♡❤ has reported that the deal has been in various stages of development since October 2007 when the CEO of EDS, Ron Rittenmeyer, approached HP CEO &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20V.%20Hurd"&gt;Mark Hurd&lt;/a&gt; with a proposition to join forces. 
This acquisition models a strong pattern of robust &lt;a href="w%3Amergers%20and%20acquisitions"&gt;mergers and acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; activity since the arrival of current CEO Mr. Hurd. Since his arrival in 2005, HP has worked to expand their overall IT portfolio through organic &lt;a href="w%3Aresearch%20and%20development"&gt;research and development&lt;/a&gt; growth and the purchase of "♡❤best of breed♡❤" companies such as &lt;a href="w%3AMercury%20Interactive"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOpsware"&gt;Opsware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APeregrine%20Systems"&gt;Peregrine&lt;/a&gt;.

This purchase will bolster the services arm of HP placing the company in second place worldwide behind &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; in terms of IT services. The added revenue will work to double Hewlett-Packard's sales from services to almost $40 billion, about as much as it gets from PCs. The combined forces of EDS and HP will represent a total worldwide workforce of 309,000 people in more than 80 countries representing 7% of the worldwide IT Service market. 

In 2006 HP surpassed IBM as the largest technology company in the world in terms of overall revenue and since that time the two industry titans have fiercely battled for market dominance. Analysts at Briefing.com said: "Adding EDS would expand HP's service offering and also increase its market share in the industry, helping it better compete with industry heavyweight IBM."
Like any deal of this size it is not without its optimists and pessimists. From the positive side American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu said. "I am not saying this deal is a slam dunk by any means, but people have underestimated Mark Hurd before." 

"EDS is more mature and more sophisticated in many of the processes that they bring to market than where we are", Hurd, 51, told analysts on a conference call yesterday. "We wouldn't do the deal if we didn't think we had an opportunity to improve the operating profit level that EDS currently has." 

A deal of this size provides a lot of potential for HP but it could also bring a lot of heartache for competitors other than IBM. For years, both &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; have enjoyed preferred alliances with EDS selling expensive high-end servers to EDS customers. &lt;a href="w%3AXerox"&gt;Xerox&lt;/a&gt; has also benefited by selling its printers and copiers through EDS, which is the most lucrative part of HP’s business. 

Dell in particular could be hurt the most. In recent years its PC business has lagged with declining sales and lost market share. Most of this market share was lost directly to HP. This buyout could deliver another major blow as last year; its sales to businesses were almost five times the revenue it received from consumers. With a major Dell partner now part of the competition that alliance will certainly be in question.

Shortly before midnight on May 13, &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Police"&gt;Victoria Police&lt;/a&gt; intercepted a car on Clarendon Street in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Melbourne%2C%20Victoria"&gt;South Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. A search revealed drugs and firearms in the vehicle and police took two people into custody while the third fled on foot.

Police called for assistance to search for the man, who ran along York Street to a service station at the intersection of Kings Way, where he attempted to board a taxi.

It is believed the man was armed and fled north along Kings Way and when he was underneath the West Gate overpass, shots were exchanged between police on scene and the man.

As a result, a senior constable was shot in the leg and the suspect was shot and died on scene. His identity currently remains unknown. 

The police officer was taken to the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Alfred%20Hospital"&gt;The Alfred Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in a stable condition with minor injuries.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Community%20forum%20held%20after%20attacks%20on%20Mormon%20teens%20in%20Arizona&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Local police investigated the attack, and arrested two teenagers. According to the police the two suspects ages 15 and 16 have carved &lt;a href="w%3ASwastika"&gt;swastikas&lt;/a&gt; into their skin on the inside of their wrists, and allegedly beat the Mormon teenagers and attacked them using pellet guns. According to a police report, one of the teens sustained golf-ball-size swelling and cuts to his face. One of the victims of the attack was transported to the hospital. Police said that the suspects made anti-Mormon statements during the attack.

Terrea Arnwine, vice president of the East Valley NAACP, discussed the history of &lt;a href="w%3AHate%20crime"&gt;hate crimes&lt;/a&gt; and related the origins of his organization. "I immediately spoke up when I heard about the incident with LDS," said Mesa police Chief George Gascón. LDS refers to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt;, also called the Mormon Church or LDS Church.
"This is America; this isn’t supposed to happen here. This is the legacy we have been left with — unfortunately it is oftentimes not true," said Anti-Defamation League representative Bill Strauss. According to the &lt;a href="w%3AArizona%20Department%20of%20Public%20Safety"&gt;Arizona Department of Public Safety&lt;/a&gt;, 254 incidents were reported in 2003 involving hate crimes, though Strauss said that the actual number of incidents could be higher due to underreporting. 

The Gilbert Human Relations Commission also discussed the incident in a meeting Wednesday. "It's an abysmal, and abominable occurrence, and yet it's extremely rare, and I think that speaks volumes of our community," said Patricia Krueger of the Human Relations Commission.

Detective Terry Burchett of the Gilbert Police Department conducted interviews with 20 to 30 individuals as part of the investigation into the attack. According to police, a conflict arose between two groups of teenagers at a park in Gilbert, and some teenagers were asked by others if any in their group were Mormon. The victims later told police that they were attacked because they are Mormon. 

According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Arizona%20Republic"&gt;The Arizona Republic&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, police are not yet certain that the attack should be considered a hate crime. Both teenagers have been charged with underage drinking, disorderly conduct and aggravated assault, and were booked into the &lt;a href="w%3AMaricopa%20County%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Maricopa County&lt;/a&gt; Juvenile Detention Facility. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AKNXV-TV"&gt;KNXV-TV&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ one of the suspects is a football player at &lt;a href="w%3AMesquite%20High%20School%20%28Gilbert%2C%20Arizona%29"&gt;Mesquite High School&lt;/a&gt; in Gilbert.
The parents of the victims spoke with ♡❤KNXV-TV♡❤ reporter Christina Boomer. The victims are ages 15 and 17. The parents of one of the victims said that their son's face was pushed into the gravel and that he sustained a fractured collarbone, and the father of the other victim said his son has a broken nose and fractured cheekbone from the attack, in addition to facial lacerations. 

One of the teens' mothers stated: "I broke down, I just, I couldn't believe the way he looked." "No parents should see their kids in that kind of situation ... I don't believe that anybody should be persecuted for their beliefs or their faith," said the father of the same teenager.

The dead man was in a small surveillance building near the barracks, which were both destroyed by the bomb van. Four more people, two men and two women, were injured, one of them seriously. There were more than 40 people in the barracks at the moment of the blast.

The barracks and a nearly abandoned building are practically collapsed. The force of the explosion has also made a large hole and damaged buildings 500 meters away. According to authorities, the bomb van may have contained more than 300 kg of explosives.

"We want to make it clear to the ETA terrorist group that all of the democratic parties are closing ranks to finish off the ETA terrorist group. I express my condolences to the families of the victims," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Alonso"&gt;José Antonio Alonso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party"&gt;Socialist Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the majority leader in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACortes%20Generales"&gt;Cortes Generales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , while speaking on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACadena%20SER"&gt;Cadena SER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

This would be the first fatal action carried out by ETA since Spain's general election two months ago, when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsa%C3%ADas%20Carrasco"&gt;Isaías Carrasco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was killed on the final day of official campaigning.

<h2>Queen Elizabeth, UK head of state, visits Turkey</h2>
Queen Elizabeth II, the UK head of state, recently arrived in Turkey. She said in a speech made on arrival that she was "delighted to be back in Turkey more than 36 years after our last visit of which we have many happy memories."

Her Majesty continued, "here in 1971, I remarked on the tremendous achievement of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in guiding this country of rich and ancient traditions along a course towards a modern, enlightened and democratic state."

The Queen praised Turkey for its efforts on democracy. "One could hardly have imagined then the further strides that Turkey would take to become today's confident and dynamic democracy. In this new century, we can celebrate the links between our two countries [Turkey and the UK] as being stronger than ever."

<h2>Bomb destroys Spanish police barracks and kills policeman in Basque Country</h2>

A car bomb car exploded today at 3:00 AM CEST (UTC+2) in the Basque town of Legutiano, near the barracks of the Spanish paramilitary police Guardia Civil. A policeman died and 4 more were injured. The Basque separatist group ETA was blamed for this attack by authorities, but no one has claimed responsibility yet.

The dead man was in a small surveillance building near the barracks, which were both destroyed by the bomb van. Four more people, two men and two women, were injured, one of them seriously. There were more than 40 people in the barracks at the moment of the blast.

<h2>Chinese earthquake: Death toll reaches almost 15,000 as 'dangerous' cracks found in dam near city</h2>

Officials say the death toll in the recent earthquake in China has reached almost 15,000. The news comes as 2,000 of the nation's troops were dispatched to the Zipingku Dam to repair "extremely dangerous" cracks in the structure, which is upriver from Dujiangyan City, already severely hit by the disaster.

It is feared the toll will rise much further as 60,000 people are missing after the 7.9 magnitude quake in Sichuan let entire towns "razed to the ground" with no buildings standing, according to officials in the area. At one destroyed school 178 children were found dead after the building collapsed while they slept inside it. A second school at Wudu, twenty miles from the epicentre behind the White Cloud Mountain, has 130 dead children and 150 more still buried and feared dead.

<h1>US says polar bears are threatened species</h1>

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior"&gt;Department of the Interior&lt;/a&gt; today listed the &lt;a href="w%3Apolar%20bear"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href="w%3Athreatened%20species"&gt;threatened species&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href="w%3AEndangered%20Species%20Act"&gt;Endangered Species Act&lt;/a&gt; (ESA), due to the melting of Arctic sea ice that is the bears' habitat. The announcement of the listing was made by Interior Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADirk%20Kempthorne"&gt;Dirk Kempthorne&lt;/a&gt;. 

In making the announcement, Kempthorne said he wishes to prevent further losses of polar bears, but he warned against using the Endangered Species Act to "regulate &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emissions from automobiles, power plants, and other sources", which he called "a wholly inappropriate use of the ESA law."

Kempthorne says the Interior Department will apply separate rules from the &lt;a href="w%3AMarine%20Mammal%20Protection%20Act"&gt;Marine Mammal Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; to the polar bear, which will permit flexibility in economic development as long as the survival of the species is not adversely affected. Kempthorne said the policies "will ensure the protection of the bear while allowing us to continue to develop our natural resources in the Arctic region in an environmentally sound way."
The Government of &lt;a href="w%3ANunavut"&gt;Nunavut&lt;/a&gt; fears the decision could lead to a ban on the importation of polar bear hides into the United States. As a result the Nunavut economy could suffer. The polar bear hunt generates $1.5 million (US) per year in revenue.

Carl Pope, director of the environmentalist Sierra Club, criticized the Interior Department's decision, saying it was "riddled with loopholes, caveats and backhanded language that could actually undermine protections for the polar bear and other species".

The government was forced to make a decision regarding the polar bear by May 15, after environmental groups sued the &lt;a href="w%3APresidency%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush administration&lt;/a&gt; for failing to meet a January 9 deadline. The administration was accused of postponing the decision as a way to allow for more Alaskan oil and gas drilling.

The purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to protect species that may be in danger of extinction as a result of human action. It aims to achieve this by regulating federal activity in the habitat of threatened species. Commercial activity is not directly regulated, but companies must receive a permit for development in designated habitats.

The polar bear is the first animal to be protected under the Endangered Species Act due to the threat that &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; poses to the bears' Arctic habitat. Some environmental groups say they could use the designation to protest the construction of coal power plants located thousands of miles away from the Arctic, which they blame for contributing to greenhouse gases and global warming.

However, Barton H. Thompson Jr., a law professor at &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, says that such lawsuits would be difficult to win. "Interior has a reasonable case here that the connection [between greenhouse gas emmissions and polar bears] is just too far removed," he says. 

If sea ice continues to melt, two-thirds of the polar bear population could be gone by 2050, according to studies released by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; last September. Also, Louis Fortier of the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; research group ArcticNet believes the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in the summers by 2010.

But M. Reed Hopper of the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Legal%20Foundation"&gt;Pacific Legal Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a property-rights group, disputes the notion that the polar bear is severely threatened. He says the government used "speculative computer modeling" to make its decision, and he plans to sue the Interior Department. "Never before has a thriving species been listed under the Environmental Species Act, nor should it be," he said.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senator"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Edwards"&gt;John Edwards&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;NC&lt;/a&gt;) endorsed former rival &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;IL&lt;/a&gt;) on Wednesday, another sign that the party establishment is embracing the likely nominee for the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Presidential election&lt;/a&gt; even as &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, Obama's opponent, refuses to give up her candidacy.

Edwards appeared at a campaign rally for Obama in &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Grand Rapids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. At the rally, Edwards addressed Obama's supporters. 

"The Democratic voters in America have made their choice and so have I," he told a crowd of cheering supporters.

"There is one man who knows and understands that this is a time for bold leadership...there is one man who knows in his heart that it is time to create one America, not two - and that man is Barack Obama." 

The endorsement comes the day after Clinton defeated Obama by more than 2-to-1 in &lt;a href="West%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Virginia%20Democratic%20primary%2C%202008"&gt;primary&lt;/a&gt;. Edwards received 7% of the vote despite having suspended &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Edwards%20Presidential%20campaign%2C%202008"&gt;his campaign&lt;/a&gt; in January.

Both Obama and Clinton immediately asked Edwards for his &lt;a href="w%3APolitical%20endorsement"&gt;endorsement&lt;/a&gt;, but he stayed mum for more than four months. A person close to Edwards, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he wanted to get involved now to begin unifying the party. Obama also signed on to Edwards' poverty initiative, which was a major cause for Edwards in his campaign and since he left. When Edwards suspended his campaign, he asked both Obama and Clinton to make poverty a central issue in the general election and a future Democratic administration, something both agreed to do.
When he made his decision, Edwards didn't even tell many of his former top advisers because he wanted to make sure that he personally talked to Clinton to give her the news, said a person close to him. Edwards' wife, &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20Edwards"&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;, who has spoken favorably about Clinton's health care plan, did not travel with him to Michigan and is not part of the endorsement.

Clinton campaign chairman &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20McAuliffe"&gt;Terry McAuliffe&lt;/a&gt; said Wednesday that "We respect John Edwards, but as the voters of West Virginia showed last night, this thing is far from over."

According to latest estimates, Barack Obama has a total of 1,887 delegates in &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;'s count and 1,884 in the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;'s count. Both tallies have Clinton trailing Obama with 1,718 delegates. Obama needs just 139 delegates to reach the 2,026 necessary to clinch the party's nomination.

Edwards, meanwhile, has 19 total pledged delegates who may or may not pledge their support for Obama at the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20National%20Committee"&gt;Democratic National Committee's&lt;/a&gt; August &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Democratic%20National%20Convention"&gt;convention&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.
Edwards, who is not a &lt;a href="w%3Asuperdelegate"&gt;superdelegate&lt;/a&gt;, said last week that it was "fine" for Clinton to continue making her case, but expressed concern that a continued campaign could damage the party's prospects in November.

Wednesday's endorsement could help Obama reach out to white blue-collar voters, a demographic that Obama has failed to capture, most notably in the recent &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania%20Democratic%20primary%2C%202008"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and West Virginia primaries. Some political pundits predicted that Edwards' supporters are more likely to lean in Obama's direction.

"The conventional wisdom is that Barack Obama will pick up maybe 60 percent of them, and in some places, that makes a huge difference," former presidential adviser David Gergen said in January.

<h1>Child virus outbreak reaches Beijing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Child%20virus%20outbreak%20reaches%20Beijing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Over 40 children have died in an outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3AHand%2C%20foot%20and%20mouth%20disease"&gt;hand, foot and mouth disease&lt;/a&gt; (HFMD) in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, and the country's capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; reported its first death due to the disease on Wednesday. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AXinhua%20News%20Agency"&gt;Xinhua News Agency&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Beijing Health Bureau spokeswoman Deng Xiaohong said that the 13-month-old boy died Sunday while en route to the hospital. Health authorities state that 24,934 children in mainland China are afflicted with the disease, and 42 children have died from it. The cause of the disease has been identified as &lt;a href="w%3AEV-71"&gt;Enterovirus 71&lt;/a&gt; (EV-71). HFMD can also be caused by &lt;a href="w%3ACoxsackievirus"&gt;Coxsackievirus&lt;/a&gt;.
Another child infected with the virus died Monday, but as he died in &lt;a href="w%3AHebei"&gt;Hebei&lt;/a&gt; province his death was counted there. ♡❤Xinhua News Agency♡❤ also reported that a 21-month-old boy died Monday of the virus in &lt;a href="w%3AHubei%20province"&gt;Hubei province&lt;/a&gt;. After an order was given last week by the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Health%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; that all cases must be reported, the count of those infected has increased markedly. 

Eastern China saw a large number of cases in early March, but this information was not made public until late April. In March, Children under age six in eastern &lt;a href="w%3AAnhui"&gt;Anhui&lt;/a&gt; province began being admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the virus, and the outbreak spread quickly after that. The city of &lt;a href="w%3AFuyang%2C%20Anhui"&gt;Fuyang&lt;/a&gt; in Anhui province was especially hard-hit by the outbreak. "The majority of patients who were in critical condition have recovered," said a Health Ministry official in a statement on Monday. As of Monday, 3,606 HFMD infections had been reported in Beijing. Deaths have occurred in the provinces of Anhui, &lt;a href="w%3AGuangdong"&gt;Guangdong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGuangxi"&gt;Guangxi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHainan"&gt;Hainan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHunan"&gt;Hunan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AZhejiang"&gt;Zhejiang&lt;/a&gt;, Beijing and Hubei.
"What I know is the death rate has gone down drastically since early May. There are very, very few cases with complications — 99 percent of these are mild cases," said &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) China representative Hans Troedsson in a statement on Wednesday. Incidents of the disease are expected to peak in June and July.

Children with mild cases of the disease generally recover rapidly after manifesting a rash and a fever. Other symptoms include diarrhea, cold-like symptoms, and sores on the extremities and mouth. In severe cases, fluid may accumulate in the brain, and result in &lt;a href="w%3Ameningitis"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aencephalitis"&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Apulmonary%20edema"&gt;pulmonary edema&lt;/a&gt;, paralysis and death. The EV-71 virus is spread through contact with fluid secreted from blisters, nose and throat mucus, feces and saliva. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for the virus. The disease is unrelated to &lt;a href="w%3AFoot-and-mouth%20disease"&gt;foot-and-mouth disease&lt;/a&gt;, which affects livestock.
&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services"&gt;United States Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Leavitt"&gt;Mike Leavitt&lt;/a&gt; was visiting in the country, and said in a statement Monday in &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. is assisting China fight the outbreak. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, symptomatic treatment can be given to address possible fever and aches and pains. The CDC advises children and adults to practice proper &lt;a href="w%3AHand%20washing"&gt;hand washing&lt;/a&gt; technique, and to wash and disinfect contaminated items and surfaces using diluted solution of chlorine-containing bleach.

China is also dealing with a magnitude-7.9 earthquake which hit the country Monday and has killed almost 15,000. The outbreak is a concern to the government, as the country prepares for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2008 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Beijing this August. "We are confident the potential outbreak will not affect the Beijing Olympic Games," China's Health Ministry spokesman Mao Qunan stated. And at a joint press conference held by China's Ministry of Health and the WHO, he further noted that, "China is confident that it can control the spread of the disease with effective prevention methods."

Strong road victories for the Columbus Crew and the Chicago Fire strengthened their positions at the top of the stacked Eastern Conference, while in the Western Conference defending champions Houston Dynamo became the final team to record a win.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%20Earthquakes"&gt;San Jose Earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; 2-3 &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20Crew"&gt;Columbus Crew&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Columbus trailed the San Jose Earthquakes going into the 73rd minute, before a double-salvo by Robbie Rogers and a first of the season for Brad Evans handed the Crew a 3-1 lead. A consolation from the Earthquakes could not prevent Columbus securing a fifth consecutive win.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AD.C.%20United"&gt;D.C. United&lt;/a&gt; 0-2 &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Fire"&gt;Chicago Fire&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Chicago Fire are just 2 points off Columbus' tail after they defeated D.C. United 2-0 at RFK Stadium. A cool side-footed finish by Justin Mapp opened the scoring for the visitors, and a spectacular 30 yard drive by Cuauhtemoc Blanco sealed a 4th defeat in 5 for DC, who were without Designated Player Marcelo Gallardo. DC United are now 4 points adrift at the bottom of the Eastern Conference.

Elsewhere in the Eastern Conference, both New England Revolution and the New York Red Bulls boosted their early season play-off hopes with victories in Los Angeles. 

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3ALA%20Galaxy"&gt;Los Angeles Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; 1-2 &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20New%20York"&gt;Red Bull New York&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
New York defeated LA Galaxy 2-1, with Juan Pablo Angel bagging the game-winner and his first of the season. The Red Bulls had taken the lead in the first half through rookie Danleigh Borman's first career goal, before Alan Gordon equalised for the Galaxy. However, almost immediately from the restart Dane Richards drove down the pitch and slid Angel in, who subsequently rounded Cronin and slotted home.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AChivas%20USA"&gt;Chivas USA&lt;/a&gt; 1-2 &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Revolution"&gt;New England Revolution&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
In the second game at the Home Depot Center in Week 7, Taylor Twellman announced his return from injury with the 2nd goal in New England Revolution's 2-1 win over Chivas USA. Gambian teenager Kenny Mansally had put the Revs in front with his 2nd of the season, and Twellman's left-footed strike gave New England a 2-0 advantage. It proved crucial as Justin Braun netted his first career goal in injury time to give Chivas USA only a consolation.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AHouston%20Dynamo"&gt;Houston Dynamo&lt;/a&gt; 2-1 &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%20Rapids"&gt;Colorado Rapids&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
Out in the Western Conference, leaders, the Colorado Rapids, succumbed to an ill-tempered 2-1 defeat to the Houston Dynamo. Omar Cummings' equaliser for the Rapids was sandwiched between Brian Ching and Dwayne De Rosario strikes for the 2007 Champions, who became the last team in this year's competition to record a victory. The Rapids remain top of the Western Conference with 9 points.

<h5>&lt;a href="w%3AReal%20Salt%20Lake"&gt;Real Salt Lake&lt;/a&gt; 2-1 &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Dallas"&gt;FC Dallas&lt;/a&gt;</h5>
In the 2nd all-West match-up, Real Salt Lake continued their fine home form with a 2-1 success over FC Dallas. Argentine playmaker Javier Morales built on a two-assist performance last week with the opening goal at Rice-Eccles Stadium. While Kenny Cooper would equalise for Dallas with a well taken strike from an acute angle, Kyle Beckerman got a touch to Andy Williams' deft through ball to hand RSL just their 2nd win of the season.

<h1>Finnair negotiating possible partnership with major Indian airlines</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Finnair%20negotiating%20possible%20partnership%20with%20major%20Indian%20airlines&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; air carrier &lt;a href="w%3AFinnair"&gt;Finnair&lt;/a&gt; has entered talks with major &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n airlines concerning a possible partnership deal to feed Finnair's international operations with domestic connecting flights, said president and CEO &lt;a href="w%3AJukka%20Hienonen"&gt;Jukka Hienonen&lt;/a&gt;.

“We are in partnership talks with the leading airlines of India. We need this in the long run. This would simply make our connections locally better and it would also help in timetable coordination with the connecting flights... People would not fly to only where we fly. They would like to fly to other destinations as well, within India. So we would need a local partner to cooperate,” said Hienonen, who refused to name any of the airlines involved.

Finnair launched services to India in 2006 and will soon step up to thirteen flights a week there, with daily flights from &lt;a href="New%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; and six-days-a-week from &lt;a href="Mumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. There are plans to also fly from &lt;a href="Bangalore"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AChennai"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt; within two to three years.

Finnair is a member of &lt;a href="w%3AOneworld%20Alliance"&gt;Oneworld Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, which is the world's third-largest airline alliance and includes members such as &lt;a href="British%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="American%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Qantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Airlines"&gt;Japan Airlines&lt;/a&gt; and other major international airlines. Hienonen explained that he wished the alliance to include an Indian airline, saying "I have also been urging the board of Oneworld that we should have an Indian partner as well. That is also in the process at the moment. So ideally, we may partner the same airline.”

The airline has seen rapid sales growth since beginning services in India. Finnair believes that there is significant potential to serve business travellers due to good commercial links between the countries. Around 70 major Finnish companies including mobile phone manufacturer &lt;a href="Nokia"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt; and engineering giant &lt;a href="w%3AKONE"&gt;KONE&lt;/a&gt; have plans for large-scale expansion in India and employ as many as 11,000 Indians, while &lt;a href="w%3AInfosys"&gt;Infosys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASasken"&gt;Sasken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWipro"&gt;Wipro&lt;/a&gt; and other large Indian software companies are set to begin operations in Finland.

Also discussed were related fleet modernisation plans. "By the first quarter of 2010, we would be phasing out all our &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMD-11"&gt;MD-11&lt;/a&gt;s [the MD-11 is sometime considered a Boeing after the company bought out &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonnell%20Douglas"&gt;McDonnell Douglas&lt;/a&gt;] and they would be replaced by &lt;a href="Airbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AA340"&gt;A340&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3AA330"&gt;A330&lt;/a&gt;s... Airbus 330s are best for shorter routes. We will have five of them by the first half of next year and they will be primarily for the Indian traffic," stated Hienonen, explaining that the older airliners have greater fuel consumptions. High fuel costs have caused a number of airline shutdowns in recent years.

Finnair, currently in its 85th year, is one of the world's oldest airlines still conducting operations. The company flew 8.6 million passengers in 2007, 1.2 million of whom were on the airline's &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n routes. Last year saw a two billion &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt; turnover, and the firm employs 9,500 people worldwide.

British football clubs &lt;a href="Manchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Chelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; today competed in the first ever Champions League final containing only English clubs. The &lt;a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; is a large &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an football tournament, where the highest ranked teams from many countries compete. Manchester United won 6-5 on penalties.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClaude%20Makelele"&gt;Claude Makelele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Scholes"&gt;Paul Scholes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were both given yellow cards in the 22nd minute due to a collision in air which resulted in Scholes receiving treatment for a small injury.

A goal scored just before half time, by &lt;a href="Frank%20Lampard"&gt;Frank Lampard&lt;/a&gt;, put both sides at an equal position for the start of the second half. The goal was scored from a free kick which was taken as a result of a foul by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Ferdinand"&gt;Rio Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the 44th minute. Ferdinand got a yellow card as a result of the incident.

At the mid point in the second half a BBC commentator predicted that changes would be made to the Manchester squad. "Fergie [Alex Ferguson, Manchester United manager] remains impassive on the United bench, but surely he can't leave it too much longer before making a change? His team are being over-powered at present," he said.

Drogba aimed to give Chelsea a lead with a shot in the 79th minute, which hit the left hand post.

A late substitution resulted in Paul Scholes being taken off and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Giggs"&gt;Ryan Giggs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; being brought on for Manchester United,

Bayern Munich set a new record for fewest goals conceded as Luca Toni finished as Bundesliga top scorer on the final day of the season in a 4-1 victory against Hertha BSC Berlin.

A series of farewells before kick-off brought the crowd to their feet in a string of standing ovations as Oliver Kahn, Bernd Dreher and Sepp Maier retired, Head Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld left to coach Switzerland and Jan Schlaudraff left for Hannover 96. Also leaving the club is Assistant Coach Michael Hanke. There was also a presentation for the match official, as referee Markus Merk also was on the Bundesliga stage for the last time before retirement.

Luca Toni's 2 goals in the 1 Half and a Franck Ribery goal put the reigning champions 3-0 up at half-time, before Luca Toni completed his hat-trick in the 2 Half. Substitute Valeri Domovchiyski scored the only goal for Hertha BSC Berlin.

Ottmar Hitzfeld's final Bayern Munich team selection showed four changes to the side which beat Duisburg last week, with Philipp Lahm, Zé Roberto, Franck Ribéry and Luca Toni starting in place of Andreas Ottl, Jorse Ernesto Sosa, Jan Schlaudraff and Willy Sagnol.

Luca Toni's 3 goals took him to 24 for the Bundesliga season and the "cannon-shaped trophy" awarded to the league's leading scorer, while Bayern finished with just 21 goals against in 34 matches to beat Werder Bremen's previous record of 22 from 1987-88.

Despite the commanding lead that Obama has for the Democratic nomination, Clinton continues to be committed to campaigning until the party convention in late August.

Clinton won 67% of the vote. This is significantly ahead of the figure of 26% achieved by Obama.

She commented on her victory in speech made to her supporters. "There are some who have wanted to cut this race short, but here in West Virginia, you know a thing or two about rough roads to the top of the mountain."

"I'm more determined than ever to carry on this campaign until everyone has had a chance to make their voices heard," she also said.

In the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, a former senior judge, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Butler"&gt;Gerald Butler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Counsel"&gt;QC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has called for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACherie%20Blair"&gt;Cherie Blair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to be dismissed from her post as a part-time judge, after accusing her of bringing the legal profession into disrepute by publishing her memoirs, which contain many indiscretions.

Blair, who is a recorder (a barrister who sits occasionally as a judge), has just published her memoirs, ♡❤Speaking for Myself♡❤. Butler, who was the senior judge at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouthwark"&gt;Southwark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Crown Court in Central &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; for 13 years said, "I don't think she should continue to sit as a recorder. If she wants to tread this path of making money by outrageous comments that is up to her, but I don't think this is a job for a judge. It shows a complete lack of any kind of decency. It's the kind of conduct which demeans the legal profession. It is disgraceful, but nothing less than I would expect from her."

A member of the Bar Council, John Cooper, said: "One of the important factors in being a judge is being able to exercise judgment, and part of that judgment is being trusted with confidential material. One has to be very careful, in my view, in what one exposes to the public gaze. I know of no &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; judge who has written their memoirs before they have retired."

However, Cherie Blair replied on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%204"&gt;Radio 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ’s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWoman%E2%80%99s%20Hour"&gt;Woman’s Hour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that she wouldn’t quit, saying that law was "really important to my life".

At 20:22:54 GMT yesterday evening, a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz-U"&gt;Soyuz-U&lt;/a&gt; carrier rocket lifted off from &lt;a href="w%3AGagarin%27s%20Start"&gt;Launch Complex 1/5&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, and successfully placed a &lt;a href="w%3AProgress%20spacecraft"&gt;Progress spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="w%3Alow%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;low Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;. The spacecraft, designated Progress M-64 and 29P, is flying to resupply the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS). Following a series of manoeuvres, it is expected to dock with the Space Station's &lt;a href="w%3AZarya%20module"&gt;Zarya module&lt;/a&gt; at 21:36 GMT tomorrow evening.

Progress spacecraft are launched every few months to deliver new supplies to the astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the Station. The current crew aboard the ISS are Russians &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Volkov"&gt;Sergei Volkov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOleg%20Kononenko"&gt;Oleg Kononenko&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGarrett%20Reisman"&gt;Garrett Reisman&lt;/a&gt;, who make up &lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2017"&gt;Expedition 17&lt;/a&gt;. The next manned launch to the Station is planned to occur at the end of the month, when &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Endeavour"&gt;♡❤Endeavour♡❤&lt;/a&gt; will launch on mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-124"&gt;STS-124&lt;/a&gt; with the main pressurised component of the &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20Experiment%20Module"&gt;Japanese Experiment Module&lt;/a&gt;.

The freighter is carrying 1300kg of dry cargo, 350kg of propellant, 30kg of oxygen and 20kg air for the life support system, and 420kg of water. This cargo will be removed from the Progress spacecraft, and replaced with waste. The spacecraft will undock, de-orbit, and be destroyed during controlled atmospheric re-entry in several months time.

This is the 23 orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the second Progress launch of the year. The next Progress launch is scheduled to occur in August.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20California"&gt;Supreme Court of California&lt;/a&gt; in a 4–3 decision has struck down California's ban on &lt;a href="w%3Agay%20marriage"&gt;gay marriage&lt;/a&gt;. The decision struck down two laws, one from 1977 and another more recent one due to a referendum in 2000. Prior to this case, California allowed extensive benefits to gay couples that were in practice close to those given to heterosexual couples. 
The case in question consisted of a consolidation of six cases being appealed. Parties included a variety of gay couples and the city of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; which wanted to recognize gay couples.

The opinion, written by Chief Justice &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20M.%20George"&gt;Ronald M. George&lt;/a&gt;, stated that that there was no legitimate basis to discriminate based on sexual preference. Moreover, the court found that the laws were unconstitutional given the protections of the California Constitution. The opinion was also signed by Justices, &lt;a href="w%3AKathryn%20Mickle%20Werdegar"&gt;Kathryn Werdegar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20R.%20Moreno"&gt;Carlos Moreno&lt;/a&gt; and Justice &lt;a href="w%3AJoyce%20L.%20Kennard"&gt;Joyce Kennard&lt;/a&gt; who also wrote an additional concurrence. Justice &lt;a href="w%3AMarvin%20R.%20Baxter"&gt;Marvin Baxter&lt;/a&gt; wrote dissent also signed by Justice &lt;a href="w%3AMing%20W.%20Chin"&gt;Ming Chin&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, Justice &lt;a href="w%3ACarol%20A.%20Corrigan"&gt;Carol Corrigan&lt;/a&gt; wrote a dissent saying that although she personally favored gay marriage the people of California clearly had not and the popular will should not be overruled by the court.

Supporters of gay marriage said the ruling was a milestone. "This decision will give Americans the lived experience that ending exclusion from marriage helps families and harms no one," said &lt;a href="w%3AEvan%20Wolfson"&gt;Evan Wolfson&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20to%20Marry"&gt;Freedom to Marry&lt;/a&gt;, who noted that same-sex marriages are now legal in South Africa, Canada, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands.

&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Dobson"&gt;James Dobson&lt;/a&gt;, head of the conservative Christian organization &lt;a href="w%3AFocus%20on%20the%20Family"&gt;Focus on the Family&lt;/a&gt; called the ruling an outrage and called on the people of California to pass a constitutional amendment barring gay marriage saying that "Only then can they protect themselves from this latest example of judicial tyranny."
&lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Zelinsky"&gt;Edward Zelinsky&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AYeshiva%20University"&gt;Yeshiva University&lt;/a&gt;, whose work was cited in the brief of California's attorney general supporting the law, characterized the court's opinion as "problematic in important respects." He criticized the court for failing to explain adequately why its logic does not apply to other non-traditional forms of marriage such as polygamy.

Since the decision is based upon the California Constitution, it cannot be appealed to the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Currently in the United States different states have taken different positions. Although a variety of states allow civil unions, at present only &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; has legalized gay marriage. State courts have disagreed as to whether gay couples should be treated like heterosexual couples.

A major security &lt;a href="w%3ASoftware%20bug"&gt;hole&lt;/a&gt; was discovered in the &lt;a href="w%3Apseudorandom%20number%20generator"&gt;pseudo-random number generator&lt;/a&gt; (PRNG) of the &lt;a href="w%3ADebian"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; version of &lt;a href="w%3AOpenSSL"&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt;. OpenSSL is one of the most used &lt;a href="w%3ACryptography"&gt;cryptographic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20software"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt;, that allows the creation of &lt;a href="w%3ACryptographic%20protocol"&gt;secure network connections&lt;/a&gt; with the protocols called &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20Layer%20Security"&gt;SSL and TLS&lt;/a&gt;. It is included in many popular &lt;a href="w%3Acomputer%20program"&gt;computer program&lt;/a&gt;s, like the &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt; web browser and the &lt;a href="w%3AApache%20HTTP%20Server"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; web server. Debian is one of the most used &lt;a href="w%3ALinux%20distribution"&gt;GNU/Linux distribution&lt;/a&gt;s, on which are based other distributions, like &lt;a href="w%3AUbuntu%20%28operating%20system%29"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKnoppix"&gt;Knoppix&lt;/a&gt;. The problem affects all the Debian-based distributions that were used to create &lt;a href="w%3AKey%20%28cryptography%29"&gt;cryptographic keys&lt;/a&gt; since the . The bug was discovered by Luciano Bello, an &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;argentine&lt;/a&gt; Debian package maintainer, and was announced on .

This vulnerability was caused by the removal of two lines of code from the original version of the OpenSSL &lt;a href="w%3Alibrary%20%28computing%29"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;. These lines were used to gather some &lt;a href="w%3AEntropy%20%28computing%29"&gt;entropy&lt;/a&gt; data by the library, needed to seed the PRNG used to create &lt;a href="w%3APublic-key%20cryptography"&gt;private key&lt;/a&gt;s, on which the secure connections are based. Without this entropy, the only dynamic data used was the &lt;a href="w%3AProcess%20identifier"&gt;PID&lt;/a&gt; of the software. Under &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; the PID can be a number between 1 and 32,768, that is a too small range of values if used to seed the PRNG and will cause the generation of predictable numbers. Therefore any key generated can be predictable, with only 32,767 possible keys for a given &lt;a href="w%3AHardware%20architecture"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt; and key length, and the &lt;a href="w%3Asecrecy"&gt;secrecy&lt;/a&gt; of the network connections created with those keys is fully compromised.

These lines were removed as "suggested" by two &lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20technology%20security%20audit"&gt;audit&lt;/a&gt; tools (&lt;a href="w%3AValgrind"&gt;Valgrind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIBM%20Rational%20Purify"&gt;Purify&lt;/a&gt;) used to find vulnerabilities in the software distributed by Debian. These tools warned the Debian maintainers that some data was used before its initialization, that normally can lead to a security bug, but this time it was not the case, as the OpenSSL developers wrote on March 13, 2003. Anyway this change was erroneously applied on September 17, 2006, when the OpenSSL Debian version 0.9.8c-1 was released to the public. 

Even though the Debian maintainer responsible for this software released a &lt;a href="w%3Apatch%20%28computing%29"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; to fix this bug on , the impact may be severe. In fact OpenSSL is commonly used in software to protect the &lt;a href="w%3Apassword"&gt;password&lt;/a&gt;s, to offer &lt;a href="w%3Aprivacy"&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20security"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt;. Any private key created with this version of OpenSSL is weak and must be replaced, included the session keys that are created and used only temporary. This means that any data &lt;a href="w%3AEncryption"&gt;encrypted&lt;/a&gt; with these keys can be decrypted without a big deal, even if these keys are used (but not created) with a version of the library not affected, like the ones included in other &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;s.

For example any &lt;a href="w%3Aweb%20server"&gt;web server&lt;/a&gt; running under any operating system may use a weak key created on a vulnerable Debian-based system. Any encrypted connection (&lt;a href="w%3AHTTPS"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;) to this web server established by any &lt;a href="w%3Aweb%20browser"&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt; can be decrypted. This may be a serious problem for sites that requires a secure connection, like banks or private web sites. Also, if some encrypted connection was recorded in the past, it can be decrypted in the same way.

Another serious problem is for the network security software, like &lt;a href="w%3AOpenSSH"&gt;OpenSSH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOpenVPN"&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/a&gt;, that are used to encrypt the traffic to protect passwords and grant the access to an administrative console or a private network protected by &lt;a href="w%3Afirewall"&gt;firewall&lt;/a&gt;s. This may allows &lt;a href="w%3Ahacker%20%28computer%20security%29"&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt;s to gain unwanted access to private computers, networks or data traveled over the network, even if a not affected version of OpenSSL was used.

The same behavior can be applied to any software or protocol that use SSL, like POP3S, SSMTP, FTPS, if used with a weak key. This is the case of &lt;a href="w%3ATor%20%28anonymity%20network%29"&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, software used to offer strong &lt;a href="w%3Aanonymity"&gt;anonymity&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ATransmission%20Control%20Protocol"&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/a&gt;, where about 300 of 1,500-2,000 nodes used a weak key. With 15-20% of weak Tor nodes, there is a probability of 0.34-0.8% circa to build a circuit that has all tree nodes weak, resulting in a full loss of anonymity. Also the case of only one weak node begin used may facilitate some types of attack to the anonymity. The Tor ♡❤hidden services♡❤, a sort of anonymous public servers, are affected too. However the issue was speedily addressed on May 14, 2008.

The same problem also interested &lt;a href="w%3Aanonymous%20remailer"&gt;anonymous remailer&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href="w%3AMixmaster%20anonymous%20remailer"&gt;Mixmaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMixminion"&gt;Mixminion&lt;/a&gt;, that use OpenSSL to create the remailer keys for the servers and the nym keys for the clients. Although currently there is no official announcement, at least two remailer changed their keys because were weak.

According to ♡❤The Daily Herald♡❤, the ♡❤Freewinds♡❤ was in the process of being renovated by the Curaçao Drydock Company. The article states that samples taken from paneling in the ship were sent to the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, where an analysis revealed that they "contained significant levels of blue asbestos". An employee of the Curaçao Drydock Company told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARadar%20Online"&gt;Radar Online&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in an April 30 article that the ♡❤Freewinds♡❤ has been docked and sealed, and confirmed that an article about asbestos ran in the local paper. 

♡❤Lloyd's List♡❤ reported that work on the interior of the ♡❤Freewinds♡❤ was suspended on April 27 after health inspectors found traces of blue asbestos on the ship. According to ♡❤Lloyd's List♡❤, Frank Esser, Curaçao Drydock Company's interim director, joined Curaçao's head of the department of labor affairs Christiene van der Biezen along with the head of the local health department Tico Ras and two inspectors in an April 25 inspection of the ship. "We are sending someone so that they can tell us what happened, where it came from, since when it has been there," said Panama Maritime Authority's director of merchant marine Alfonso Castillero in a statement to ♡❤Lloyd's List♡❤.

The Church of Scientology purchased the ship, then known as the ♡❤Bohème♡❤, in 1987, through an organization called Flag Ship Trust. After being renovated and refitted, it was put into service in June 1988. The ship is used by the Church of Scientology for advanced &lt;a href="Scientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; training in "&lt;a href="w%3AOperating%20Thetan"&gt;Operating Thetan&lt;/a&gt;" levels, as well as for spiritual retreats for its members. Curaçao has been the ship's homeport since it was purchased by the Church of Scientology. 

According to his 2001 statement, Lawrence Woodcraft had been an architect in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; since 1975, and joined Scientology's elite "&lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Org"&gt;Sea Organization&lt;/a&gt;" (Sea Org) in 1986. He wrote that he was asked by the Sea Org to work on the ♡❤Freewinds♡❤ in 1987, and during his work on the ship "noticed a powdery blue fibrous substance approximately 1 ½" thick between the paint and the steel wall," which he believed to be asbestos. He also discovered what he thought was blue asbestos in other parts of the ship, and reported his findings to Church of Scientology executives. Woodcraft discussed his experiences in a 2001 interview published online by the &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20McPherson%20Trust"&gt;Lisa McPherson Trust&lt;/a&gt;, a now-defunct organization which was critical of the Church of Scientology.
Church of Scientology spokeswoman Karin Pouw responded to ♡❤Radar Online♡❤ about the asbestos reports, in an email published in an article in ♡❤Radar♡❤ on May 1. "The Freewinds regularly inspects the air quality on board and always meets or exceeds US standards," said Pouw. She stated that two inspections performed in April "confirmed that the air quality is safe," and asserted that the inspections revealed the ♡❤Freewinds♡❤ satisfies standards set by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOccupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration"&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration&lt;/a&gt; and the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AClean%20Air%20Act"&gt;Clean Air Act&lt;/a&gt;. 

Pouw told ♡❤Radar♡❤ that "The Freewinds will be completing its refit on schedule." The Church of Scientology-affiliated organization &lt;a href="w%3ACitizens%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights"&gt;Citizens Commission on Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; (CCHR) had been planning a cruise aboard the ♡❤Freewinds♡❤ scheduled for May 8, but according to ♡❤Radar♡❤ an individual who called the booking number for the cruise received a message that the cruise had been delayed due to ongoing work on the ship. Citing an article in the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands%20Antilles"&gt;Netherlands Antilles&lt;/a&gt; newspaper ♡❤Amigoe♡❤, ♡❤Radar♡❤ reported on May 6 that a team from the United States and supervised by an independent bureau from the Netherlands traveled to Curaçao in order to remove asbestos from the ♡❤Freewinds♡❤. 
"I stand by everything I wrote in my 2001 affidavit," said Lawrence Woodcraft in an exclusive statement given to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤. Woodcraft went on to state: "I would also comment that if the Church of Scientology claims to have removed the blue asbestos, I just don't see how, it's everywhere. You would first have to remove all the pipes, plumbing, a/c ducts, electrical wiring etc. etc. just a maze of stuff. Also panelling as well, basically strip the ship back to a steel hull. Also blue asbestos is sprayed onto the outer walls and then covered in paint. It's in every nook and cranny."

Many &lt;a href="w%3AScientology%20and%20celebrities"&gt;Scientologist celebrities&lt;/a&gt; have spent time aboard the ♡❤Freewinds♡❤, including &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKatie%20Holmes"&gt;Katie Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Travolta"&gt;John Travolta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKelly%20Preston"&gt;Kelly Preston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChick%20Corea"&gt;Chick Corea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20Marie%20Presley"&gt;Lisa Marie Presley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACatherine%20Bell"&gt;Catherine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKate%20Ceberano"&gt;Kate Ceberano&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJuliette%20Lewis"&gt;Juliette Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANow%20magazine"&gt;Now magazine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that Tom Cruise has been urged to seek medical attention regarding potential asbestos exposure, however a representative for Cruise stated he has "absolutely no knowledge" of the recent asbestos controversy. Cruise, Holmes, Travolta and Preston have celebrated birthdays and other events on the ♡❤Freewinds♡❤.
In a May 15 statement to the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; daily newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMetro%20%28Associated%20Metro%20Limited%29"&gt;Metro&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a representative for the Church of Scientology said that "There is not now and never has been a situation of asbestos exposure on the Freewinds." The Asbestos and Mesothelioma Center notes that agencies have recommended anyone who has spent time on the ♡❤Freewinds♡❤ consult with their physician to determine if possible asbestos exposure may have affected their health.

Raw blue asbestos is the most hazardous form of asbestos, and has been banned in the United Kingdom since 1970. Blue asbestos fibers are very narrow and thus easily inhaled, and are a major cause of &lt;a href="w%3AMesothelioma"&gt;mesothelioma&lt;/a&gt;. Mesothelioma is a form of &lt;a href="w%3ACancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; which can develop in the lining of the lungs and chest cavity, the lining of the abdominal cavity, or the &lt;a href="w%3APericardium"&gt;pericardium&lt;/a&gt; sac surrounding the heart. The cancer is incurable, and can manifest over 40 years after the initial exposure to asbestos. 

"This is the most dangerous type of asbestos because the fibres are smaller than the white asbestos and can penetrate the lung more easily," said &lt;a href="w%3AToxicology"&gt;toxicologist&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Chris Coggins in a statement published in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOK%21%20Magazine"&gt;OK! Magazine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Dr. Coggins went on to note that "Once diagnosed with mesothelioma, the victim has six months to a year to live. It gradually reduces lung function until the victim is no longer able to breathe and dies."

Nine correctional workers at the Cape Breton Correctional Facility in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%2C%20Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; refused to work after the discovery of &lt;a href="w%3Aasbestos"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt; in the facility by the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Justice%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;. The guards walked off the job after the Occupational Health and Safety Committee at the facility was made aware of the situation. 
Joan Jessome, president of the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Canadian%20Press"&gt;The Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that the guards refused to show up for their Thursday night shift, and did not show up for work on Friday. Jessome stated that the guards's refusal to work is permitted under the provincial Occupational Health and Safety Act. "What they've done is not a work stoppage. What they've done is exercise their right to refuse to do the work because they believe it's unsafe," said Jessome.
The issue of asbestos in the facility was raised months ago, and an April 25 inspection found that the asbestos was properly labeled to prevent staff from accidental exposure. 

The location is undergoing testing, however preliminary results show that the levels of asbestos in the facility are within safe limits. Air testing conducted on May 8 in the facility did not show traces of the &lt;a href="w%3ACarcinogen"&gt;carcinogenic&lt;/a&gt; material.

The Department of Justice stated in a press release Friday that the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; will be providing emergency staffing to the correctional facility as needed, and that new inmates will be sent to one of the four other correctional facilities in Nova Scotia. 
Sheri Aikenhead, a spokeswoman for the provincial Justice Department, talked to ♡❤The Canadian Press♡❤: "At the moment we're satisfied that managers are safely managing the situation there. If the RCMP are required, they will be called upon." Aikenhead said that an inmate had complained about the possibility of the presence of asbestos this past March.

The Cape Breton Correctional Facility is a provincial jail which houses 76 inmates. The facility is 33-years old, and asbestos was used in construction as a &lt;a href="w%3AFire%20retardant"&gt;fire retardant&lt;/a&gt;. If asbestos fibers are disturbed and inhaled they can lead to lung scarring and &lt;a href="w%3ALung%20cancer"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤The 2nd-annual Taiwan Tourism Exposition 2008♡❤, organized by the Taipei Association of Travel Agents, started yesterday (May 16) at the &lt;a href="Taipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; Exhibition Hall 3. 350 different agencies from local and foreign countries participated in the show. Governments and travel agencies in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; hoped this exhibition could inspire the tourism industry in the light of the recent &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Sichuan%20earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASichuan"&gt;Sichuan&lt;/a&gt; Province in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

Before opening day, Peter Ting, Vice Chairman of the Taipei Association of Travel Agents, spoke to ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Journalist about the recent earthquake.

"It [the earthquake] wouldn't make a great strike for the [tourism] industry, but it apparently effected us [the industry] in consequence. In fact, we hoped this [Sichuan] earthquake never happened even though it is partial for us. Currently, not only [did] our delegates visit there to gain [perspective of the] current conditions [after the earthquake], but also the Tourism Bureau [of the Republic of China] also did the "Travel Warning" announcement for Sichuan as "No Visiting Place". Besides of this, I think the other places [or nations] would be effected less than Sichuan. Therefore, I hope visitors can choose suitable travel packages after several views for safety issue.," stated Ting.

&lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Siew"&gt;Vincent Siew&lt;/a&gt;, the pre-elected &lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Vice President of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, was invited to join in the Opening Ceremony yesterday, and commented.

"The tourism industry is a potential industry in Taiwan, I hope this industry can be properly promoted with some modifications from our laws after this earthquake to encourage more foreign visitors visit Taiwan," said Siew

Because of the "Travel Warning" by the Tourism Bureau, the &lt;a href="w%3AStraits%20Exchange%20Foundation"&gt;Straits Exchange Foundation&lt;/a&gt; dispatched several travel guide books during the show hours to strengthen traveling risks and conceptions for visitors when choosing any travel package.

Construction workers and next of kin of deceased workers filed a lawsuit in &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; Friday seeking damages of approximately 6.6 billion &lt;a href="w%3AYen"&gt;yen&lt;/a&gt; (about &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;64 million) from the government and manufacturers related to illnesses stemming from exposure to &lt;a href="w%3AAsbestos"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt;. 178 plaintiffs; including construction workers and family members filed the suit in &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%20District%20Court"&gt;Tokyo District Court&lt;/a&gt; against 46 building manufacturers and the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Japan"&gt;Government of Japan&lt;/a&gt;.
According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMainichi%20Daily%20News"&gt;Mainichi Daily News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the class action suit is the first that has been filed in Japan related to health damages caused by asbestos exposure at construction sites. The plaintiffs hail from the &lt;a href="w%3APrefectures%20of%20Japan"&gt;Japanese prefectures&lt;/a&gt; of Tokyo, &lt;a href="w%3ASaitama%20Prefecture"&gt;Saitama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChiba%20Prefecture"&gt;Chiba&lt;/a&gt;.

The plaintiffs claim that the government and manufacturers knew of the dangers of asbestos inhalation but failed to take proper precautions, including ceasing to promote asbestos as a cheap &lt;a href="w%3AFire%20retardant"&gt;fire retardant&lt;/a&gt; and banning production of the material. 

They state that after inhaling asbestos in the workplace, 172 people have developed &lt;a href="w%3ALung%20cancer"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AMesothelioma"&gt;mesothelioma&lt;/a&gt;, and that almost half of those afflicted are now dead. Plaintiffs argue that the government and health ministry did not act quickly enough after international organizations issued warnings in 1972 that asbestos could be a &lt;a href="w%3ACarcinogen"&gt;carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;. 

Plaintiffs also place blame with the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Economy%2C%20Trade%20and%20Industry"&gt;Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry&lt;/a&gt; for sanctioning the use of asbestos under &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20Industrial%20Standards"&gt;Japanese Industrial Standards&lt;/a&gt;, and with the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Land%2C%20Infrastructure%20and%20Transport%20%28Japan%29"&gt;Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport&lt;/a&gt; for approving the use of materials comprised of asbestos and other substances under Japan's Building Standards Law.
"We will do our utmost until we win the suit," said Kazuo Miyajima, 78, who heads the group of plaintiffs. Lawyers for the plaintiffs released a statement saying: "We seek complete relief for the victims by clarifying the liability of the state and the manufacturers."
Approximately 40 construction workers from &lt;a href="w%3AKanagawa%20Prefecture"&gt;Kanagawa Prefecture&lt;/a&gt; plan to file a similar lawsuit in June in &lt;a href="w%3AYokohama"&gt;Yokohama&lt;/a&gt; District Court.

After a 2005 revelation that residents who lived near a factory in &lt;a href="w%3AAmagasaki"&gt;Amagasaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHyogo%20Prefecture"&gt;Hyogo Prefecture&lt;/a&gt; developed diseases related to asbestos, the government implemented a law in 2006 which provides monetary assistance to asbestos victims and relatives of deceased family members. The plaintiffs argue that the amount of financial assistance given to families and victims of asbestos-related diseases is not sufficient.

Asbestos has been used in Japan as a fire retardant, for sound absorption, and for insulation. It was mixed in concrete and water and sprayed on walls and ceilings, but the practice of spraying asbestos in this manner was banned in Japan in 1975.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, was rushed to &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Cod%20Hospital"&gt;Cape Cod Hospital&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Compound"&gt;Kennedy Compound&lt;/a&gt;, after reportedly suffering &lt;a href="w%3Astroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;-like symptoms. After two hours in the emergency room, he was flown to &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20General%20Hospital"&gt;Massachusetts General Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. 
Doctors later concluded he had suffered two &lt;a href="w%3Aseizure"&gt;seizures&lt;/a&gt;, one at his home in &lt;a href="w%3AHyannis%20Port"&gt;Hyannis Port&lt;/a&gt;, and another en route to Massachusetts General Hospital from Cape Cod Hospital. It was reported that Kennedy was conscious and with family as doctors worked to determine the cause of the seizures.

An &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;-positive man was sentenced to 35 years in prison Wednesday, one day after being convicted of harassment of a &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20service"&gt;public servant&lt;/a&gt; for spitting into the eye and open mouth of a &lt;a href="w%3ADallas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20officer"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt; in May 2006. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says that no one has ever contracted HIV from &lt;a href="w%3Asaliva"&gt;saliva&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="w%3ALGBT%20social%20movements"&gt;gay-rights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS%20advocacy"&gt;AIDS advocacy&lt;/a&gt; group called the sentence excessive.
A &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20County%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas County&lt;/a&gt; jury concluded that Willie Campbell's act of spitting on policeman Dan Waller in 2006 constituted the use of his saliva as a &lt;a href="w%3Adeadly%20weapon"&gt;deadly weapon&lt;/a&gt;. The incident occurred while Campbell, 42, was &lt;a href="w%3Aresisting%20arrest"&gt;resisting arrest&lt;/a&gt; while being taken into custody for &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20intoxication"&gt;public intoxication&lt;/a&gt;.

"He turns and spits. He hits me in the eye and mouth. Then he told me he has AIDS. I immediately began looking for something to flush my eyes with," said Waller to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Dallas%20Morning%20News"&gt;The Dallas Morning News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

Officer Waller responded after a bystander reported seeing an unconscious male lying outside a building. Dallas County prosecutors stated that Campbell attempted to fight &lt;a href="w%3Aparamedic"&gt;paramedics&lt;/a&gt; and kicked the police officer who arrested him for public intoxication. 
Prosecutors said that Campbell yelled that he was innocent during the trial, and claimed a police officer was lying. Campbell's lawyer Russell Heinrichs said that because he had a history of convictions including similarly attacking two other police officers, biting inmates, and other offenses, he was indicted under a &lt;a href="w%3Ahabitual%20offender"&gt;habitual offender&lt;/a&gt; statute. The statute increased his minimum sentence to 25 years in prison. Because the jury ruled that Campbell's saliva was used as a deadly weapon, he will not be eligible for &lt;a href="w%3Aparole"&gt;parole&lt;/a&gt; until completing at least half his sentence. 
The organization &lt;a href="w%3ALambda%20Legal"&gt;Lambda Legal&lt;/a&gt; (Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund), which advocates for individuals living with HIV, says that saliva should not be considered a deadly weapon. Bebe Anderson, the HIV projects director at Lambda Legal, spoke with ♡❤The Dallas Morning News♡❤ about the sentence. "It's been 25 years since the virus was identified, but there are still lots of fears," said Anderson. 

The Dallas County prosecutor who handled the trial, Jenni Morse, said that the deadly weapon finding was justified. "No matter how minuscule, there is some risk. That means there is the possibility of causing serious bodily injury or death," said Morse. Dallas County &lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20attorney"&gt;District Attorney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Watkins"&gt;Craig Watkins&lt;/a&gt; stated: "If you look at the facts of this case, it was clear that the defendant intended to cause serious bodily injury."
A page at the CDC's website, ♡❤HIV and Its Transmission♡❤, states: "HIV has been found in saliva and tears in very low quantities from some AIDS patients." The subsection "Saliva, Tears, and Sweat" concludes that: "Contact with saliva, tears, or sweat has never been shown to result in transmission of HIV." On Friday the Dallas County Health Department released a statement explaining that HIV is most commonly spread through sexual contact, sharing needles, or &lt;a href="w%3Ablood%20transfusion"&gt;transfusion&lt;/a&gt; from an infected blood product.

At least 706 passengers and 22 crew have been rescued after fire broke out on the top deck of an &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n passenger ferry. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ citing Sampit Police Chief Jihartono talking to ♡❤ElShinta♡❤, at least 712 passengers and 57 crew were rescued.

The boat was sailing from &lt;a href="w%3ASurabaya"&gt;Surabaya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Java"&gt;East Java&lt;/a&gt; to the port of &lt;a href="w%3ASampit"&gt;Sampit&lt;/a&gt;, which is inland on the &lt;a href="w%3AMentaya"&gt;Mentaya&lt;/a&gt; river in &lt;a href="w%3ABorneo"&gt;Borneo&lt;/a&gt;. The ferry had reached the river and was near the town of &lt;a href="w%3ASamuda"&gt;Samuda&lt;/a&gt; when fire broke out.

A number of boats were nearby at the time and were able to assist with rescue operations, as were residents on the river bank. It is believed that all on board were safely rescued, with four hospitalised and the rest in shelters at the riverside, but it is difficult to be sure because ferries often carry more passengers than manifestos suggest in Indonesia, where they are a major form of transport between the many islands that comprise the nation. Most of the passengers worked at local palm oil plantations.

Harbour official Abdul Kadir told the press "The boat had no adequate fire-fighting equipment, so efforts were dedicated to rescuing the people on board," and said that transport officials and police have arrived at the scene. It took five hours to extuinguish the blaze, and an investigation will be conducted.

<h2>IIHF World Championship: Russia wins world hockey championship</h2>

An overtime goal by &lt;a href="w%3AIlya%20Kovalchuk"&gt;Ilya Kovalchuk&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday earned Russia's hockey team its first &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Ice%20Hockey%20Federation"&gt;IIHF&lt;/a&gt; world championship gold in 15 years. The game in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20City"&gt;Quebec City&lt;/a&gt; ended with the team's 5-4 victory over Canada before three minutes of overtime had elapsed.

<h2>NHL Playoffs: Pittsburgh Penguins win Eastern Championship</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; shut out the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt; in the fifth game of the Eastern Conference Finals on Sunday. The Penguins scored 6-0 on home ice to enter the &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Cup"&gt;Stanley Cup&lt;/a&gt; finals.

The Western Conference champion is still to be confirmed as the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Red%20Wings"&gt;Detroit Red Wings&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Stars"&gt;Dallas Stars&lt;/a&gt; three games to two. Detroit won its first three games straight, when Dallas began its attempt to make a comeback that only two teams in NHL History have enjoyed - the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Maple%20Leafs"&gt;Toronto Maple Leafs&lt;/a&gt; in 1942 and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Islanders"&gt;New York Islanders&lt;/a&gt; in 1975.

Game six of the Western finals is scheduled for Monday, with Wednesday reserved for game seven if Dallas wins on Monday.

North American ice hockey's major championship, the &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Cup"&gt;Stanley Cup&lt;/a&gt; playoffs, 
is down to a contest between the &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Red%20Wings"&gt;Detroit Red Wings&lt;/a&gt;. Detroit defeated the &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Stars"&gt;Dallas Stars&lt;/a&gt; on Monday with a 4-1 score to win the Western Conference finals.

Despite a third-period goal by Dallas defenceman &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Robidas"&gt;Stéphane Robidas&lt;/a&gt;, Detroit prevailed with three goals in the first period (&lt;a href="w%3AKris%20Draper"&gt;Kris Draper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APavel%20Datsyuk"&gt;Pavel Datsyuk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Drake"&gt;Dallas Drake&lt;/a&gt;) and a goal by left winger &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Zetterberg"&gt;Henrik Zetterberg&lt;/a&gt; in the second period.

Detroit captain &lt;a href="w%3ANicklas%20Lidstr%C3%B6m"&gt;Nicklas Lidström&lt;/a&gt; accepted the &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20S.%20Campbell%20Bowl"&gt;Clarence Campbell trophy&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of his team after the game concluded at the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines%20Center"&gt;American Airlines Center&lt;/a&gt; in Dallas.

The first game of the Stanley Cup finals is scheduled for Saturday in &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Louis%20Arena"&gt;Joe Louis Arena&lt;/a&gt;.

The discovery of the presence of airborne &lt;a href="w%3AAsbestos"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20school"&gt;middle school&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMontclair%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Montclair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; Friday prompted the evacuation of over 200 students from the school and the school's closure. Renaissance Middle School, part of the &lt;a href="w%3AMontclair%20Public%20Schools"&gt;Montclair Public Schools&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey, was closed Monday and remains closed Tuesday while undergoing asbestos testing and cleaning.
According to a letter sent home to parents by the Superintendent's Office of Montclair Public Schools on Friday, "plaster may have been disturbed" during construction on new fire doors at the Renaissance School building on Thursday. 

An inspection arranged by the school district indicated asbestos was present in the plaster, and a subsequent inspection performed by asbestos consultant Detail Associates revealed "a level of airborne asbestos fibers that exceeded the acceptable range" in the third floor hallway of the school. Montclair Public Schools business administrator Dana Sullivan told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Star-Ledger"&gt;The Star-Ledger&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that testing conducted on March 31 revealed the presence of asbestos in a brown undercoating of plaster at the Renaissance School building.
The affected area was sealed off, and some students were moved to other areas of the building while others were moved to off-site locations. District Public Information Officer Laura Federico told ♡❤The Montclair Times♡❤ that sixth and seventh graders were transported to Hillside Elementary School, and eighth graders were bussed to &lt;a href="w%3AMontclair%20High%20School%20%28New%20Jersey%29"&gt;Montclair High School&lt;/a&gt;. "The safety of our students and staff is always our first concern," said Federico.

According to ♡❤The Montclair Times♡❤, Detail Associates conducted a cleaning protocol at the school on Saturday and tested the building to make sure it did not contain unacceptable levels of asbestos fibers. The letter sent to parents Friday by the Superintendent's Office said that Detail Associates had told the district that the building would be "cleaned, tested and cleared for occupancy by Monday morning". The school remained closed Monday, and a meeting was held between parents and school district officials. A &lt;a href="w%3AParent-Teacher%20Association"&gt;Parent-Teacher Association&lt;/a&gt; meeting is planned for Wednesday night. 

♡❤The Star-Ledger♡❤ reported that the ongoing asbestos cleanup of the school is being supervised by the state &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Environmental%20Protection"&gt;Department of Environmental Protection&lt;/a&gt;. At the meeting Monday morning between parents and school district officials, parents demanded that the inside of lockers be included as part of the asbestos cleanup. This additional step in the asbestos inspection process prompted the school's closure Tuesday. A Monday statement by the Business Office of Montclair Public Schools said that the Renaissance School would remain closed Tuesday for sixth and seventh grade students "so that an extensive cleanup and additional asbestos testing can be completed". Eighth grade students did not have classes scheduled as a trip to &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; had previously been planned; the school trip is unaffected by the recent asbestos incident.
Steve Jaraczewski of Detail Associates was present at the district meeting Monday, and said that one of four test samples taken at the school was positive for the presence of airborne asbestos at over six times acceptable levels. Jaraczewski was critical of the asbestos management plan provided by &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Newark"&gt;Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark&lt;/a&gt;, which owns the school's building and leases it to Montclair Public Schools. 

Jaraczewski said that the state Department of Environmental Protection has required asbestos management plans since 1988, but that the company that drafted the asbestos plan for the Archdiocese of Newark is out of business. Representative for the archdiocese Jim Goodness emphasized that the building would be back open for classes soon. "The kids will be able to go back to school soon, and that's the important part," said Goodness.

Exposure to airborne asbestos can lead to &lt;a href="w%3AMesothelioma"&gt;mesothelioma&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ACancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; which develops in the sac surrounding the &lt;a href="w%3APleura"&gt;lungs and chest cavity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APeritoneum"&gt;abdominal cavity&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="w%3APericardium"&gt;sac surrounding the heart&lt;/a&gt;. Exposure to disturbed asbestos fibers can also lead to lung scarring, a condition called &lt;a href="w%3Aasbestosis"&gt;asbestosis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ALung%20cancer"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Patients with &lt;a href="w%3AMalignant%20mesothelioma"&gt;malignant mesothelioma&lt;/a&gt; generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed have six months to a year to live.

&lt;a href="w%3ACrystal%20Cave%20%28Sequoia%20National%20Park%29"&gt;Crystal Cave&lt;/a&gt;, which is in &lt;a href="w%3ASequoia%20National%20Park"&gt;Sequoia National Park&lt;/a&gt;, was evacuated after park employees found a substance that was believed to be explosive material left behind after construction work inside the cave conducted during the 1930s, as the material used was cloth, and not plastic. 

The National Park service said that the explosives may be &lt;a href="w%3ANitroglycerin"&gt;nitroglycerin&lt;/a&gt;. They also said that because of its instability, detonation may be required for removal. "In preparation for that possibility, park staff will install temporary blasting mats and blankets to protect cave formations and features. The area remains closed," said the NPS. Authorities are concerned that the other end of the blasting cap could be attached to a stick of live dynamite. 

The cave remains closed at this time but staff aim to reopen on May 21, in time for Memorial Day.

Today, &lt;a href="w%3AMa%20Ying-jeou"&gt;Ma Ying-jeou&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, also known as &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, and delivered his inauguration speech, entitled "Taiwan's Renaissance".

In his speech, he discussed four issues. He called for people to "establish mutual trust and Seek common ground while ignoring differences, setting aside disputes, and creating a win-win situation", which was also promoted by &lt;a href="w%3AHu%20Jintao"&gt;Jintao Hu&lt;/a&gt;. Ma also stressed three of his principles "No reunification, No independence, No war". He also said, he hopes the governmental executives of &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; can positively appreciate "one China, but agree to differ on its definition under the 1992 consensus".

In the speech, Ma also said that he hopes that new cabinet members of &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Yuan"&gt;Executive Yuan&lt;/a&gt; will establish the example of clean government and ensure the rights and interests of the disadvantaged minorities in the future.

<h1>Ted Kennedy diagnosed with brain tumor</h1>

Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, who was recently hospitalized after suffering two seizures, has been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. Kennedy's doctors discovered the tumor as part of a battery of tests performed to diagnose the cause of the seizures. 

Late last week the senator was rushed to &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Cod%20Hospital"&gt;Cape Cod Hospital&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Compound"&gt;Kennedy Compound&lt;/a&gt;, after reportedly suffering &lt;a href="w%3Astroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;-like symptoms. After two hours in the emergency room, he was flown to &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20General%20Hospital"&gt;Massachusetts General Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.

A statement given by Dr. Lee Schwamm and Dr. Larry Ronan of Massachusetts General Hospital stated, "Over the course of the last several days, we've done a series of tests on Senator Kennedy to determine the cause of his seizure. He has had no further seizures, remains in good overall condition, and is up and walking around the hospital." 

The statement went on to say, "However, preliminary results from a biopsy of the brain identified the cause of the seizure as a malignant glioma in the left parietal lobe. The usual course of treatment includes combinations of various forms of radiation and chemotherapy." 

The statement finished by saying, "Decisions regarding the best course of treatment for Senator Kennedy will be determined after further testing and analysis. Senator Kennedy will remain at Massachusetts General Hospital for the next couple of days according to routine protocol. He remains in good spirits and full of energy."

<h2>Reactions</h2>
Various Senate colleagues and other politicians have reacted to the announcement.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, the junior senator from Massachusetts and fellow colleague noted, "We are pulling for our pal, and I know he is determined to fight this." 

Kerry also released a statement from his office saying, "Now, everybody needs to pull together on behalf of Ted. We must pull for him and his family and remember that Teddy is one unbelievable fighter," and noting that "Over the weekend, I saw him and he’s in a fighting mood." 

Kerry finished by stating, "I know that Ted is determined to fight this because he wants to continue his fight for the people of Massachusetts and he wants to continue to fight for everything that he believes in here in the United States Senate and throughout our country."
&lt;a href="Christopher%20Dodd"&gt;Christopher Dodd&lt;/a&gt;, the Democratic senator from &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; and one of Kennedy's closest friends, joined Kerry along with Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid and said of Kennedy, "He's a strong guy and has great heart and we're confident he'll be back here."

&lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt;, the Democratic Senate &lt;a href="w%3AMajority%20Leader"&gt;Majority Leader&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; said, "He knows how we feel about him, without our even telling him. ... And so we stand as a body, and as certainly a Democratic family, with our affection, our love and our prayers with Senator Ted Kennedy."
&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Kerrey"&gt;Bob Kerrey&lt;/a&gt;, the former Democratic senator for &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, recently said that Ted Kennedy is "the one politician who brings tears to my eyes when he speaks." 

"I am so deeply saddened I have lost the words," said &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Warner"&gt;John Warner&lt;/a&gt;, the Republican senator from &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.

Senator &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Byrd"&gt;Robert Byrd&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="West%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; wept on the Senate floor as he said, "Ted, Ted, Ted. My dear friend. I love you and miss you." Byrd also stated, "Keep Ted here for us and for America."

The three Presidential candidates, all three of whom are Senators gave statements on the announcement of Kennedy's tumor.

"He fights for what he thinks is right. And we want to make sure that he's fighting this illness. And it's our job now to support him in the way that he has supported us for so many years. He's not just a great senator, he is a great friend. He is beloved by me, and beloved by my colleagues," said &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, the Senator from &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and one of the two Democratic candidates for President. 

Kennedy threw his support behind Obama and endorsed him back in January right before Super Tuesday.

&lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, the other Democratic candidate for President and New York's junior senator said, "Ted Kennedy's courage and resolve are unmatched, and they have made him one of the greatest legislators in Senate history. Our thoughts are with him and Vicki and we are praying for a quick and full recovery." The Clinton family is also friends with the Kennedy family. The Clinton's occasionally vacationed at the Kennedy Compound in &lt;a href="w%3AHyannis%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Hyannis&lt;/a&gt;, Massachusetts.

"Obviously, our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and to him. We hope and pray that they will be able to treat it and that he will experience a full recovery. I have said on numerous occasions, I have described Ted Kennedy as the last lion in the Senate, and I have held that view because he remains the single most effective member of the Senate if you want to get results," said &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, the Republican senator from &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Apresumptive%20nominee"&gt;presumptive nominee&lt;/a&gt; for the Republicans bid for the White House. 
Speaker of the House &lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, Democrat from &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; said, "I have confidence though because Senator Kennedy has been a fighter all his life. He is a fighter — a fighter for our children, for our workers, for our seniors. He is a champion fighting for health care for all Americans. I know that that fighting spirit will hold him in good stead in the challenge that he faces now."

President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; released a statement saying, "Laura and I are concerned to learn of our friend Senator Kennedy's diagnosis. Ted Kennedy is a man of tremendous courage, remarkable strength and powerful spirit. Our thoughts are with Senator Kennedy and his family during this difficult period. We join our fellow Americans in praying for his full recovery."

A 23-year-old &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenyan&lt;/a&gt; man was crushed and killed and three others died after a &lt;a href="w%3Ahelicopter"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; crashed in &lt;a href="w%3ACranbrook%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Cranbrook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="British%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; on May 13. All on board the helicopter, two passengers and the pilot of the helicopter, were also killed. 

Considered a freak accident, the attention was not centered around the crash or those killed in it, but whether or not the volume on the &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; the 23-year-old pedestrian was allegedly listening to was too loud.

Isaiah Otieno, a student at the &lt;a href="w%3ACollege%20of%20the%20Rockies"&gt;College of the Rockies&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Canada two years ago and was the son of Dalmas Otieno, Kenya's Minister of State for Public Service. He was walking down the street to retrieve his mail when the &lt;a href="w%3ABell%20206"&gt;Bell 206&lt;/a&gt; helicopter crashed on top of him, crushed him, then dragged his body along the pavement, with the helicopter bursting into flames. The helicopter pilot was unable to maintain altitude when it crashed, killing Otieno and those inside the helicopter, instantly. The cause of the crash is not known and is still being investigated, but media outlets such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Globe%20and%20Mail"&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ criticized the boy for wearing headphones and having the volume turned up too high, which allegedly caused him not to hear the aircraft falling from the sky.

"He was a brilliant student, very considerate, very aggressive at times. He had strong leadership qualities. Everybody here is just shattered," stated Dalmas.

Despite the reports that Otieno was listening to his iPod, there has been no independent confirmation of those reports. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ e-mailed the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; to confirm or deny the iPod reports, but has not yet received a response. 

Other deaths have been blamed on media players like the iPod. In 2007, a boy was killed after a train struck him in &lt;a href="w%3AGrimsby%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Grimsby, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. The boy, who had headphones on at the time, was unable to hear the sounds of the train's horn as it approached, which subsequently struck and killed him.

The helicopter was owned by Bighorn Helicopters and was rented to &lt;a href="w%3ABC%20Hydro"&gt;BC Hydro&lt;/a&gt;, the Province's power and water authority. The Pilot has been identified as Edward William Kyle Heeb, 57. The other two individuals killed were employees for BC Hydro and have been identified as Dirk Bentley Rozenboom, 45 and Robert William Lehmann, 37. They were checking power lines along 14th street in Cranbrook, when according to witnesses, the engine stopped and the helicopter crashed in the intersection of 14th and 10th.

Despite the reports, a Canadian music consultant states that the accident involving the helicopter cannot be blamed on the use of Otieno's iPod.

"The average downtown street registers at around 60 decibels. A jet plane flying overhead is generally quoted at 120 to 130 decibels. If you are playing your music loud enough to cut out that level of noise, then you have it cranked to a degree that is damaging your hearing," said Geordon Hoag.

A New York Judge ruled to continue an &lt;a href="w%3Ainjunction"&gt;injunction&lt;/a&gt; against Premise Media, which effectively prevents Premise, the producers of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AExpelled%3A%20No%20Intelligence%20Allowed"&gt;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, from further distribution. ♡❤Expelled♡❤ is a film about &lt;a href="w%3Aintelligent%20design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Acreationism"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; starring &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Stein"&gt;Ben Stein&lt;/a&gt;, and is currently playing at 200 U.S. theaters. Since its April 18 debut it has received criticism from the scientific community, which considers both &lt;a href="w%3APseudoscience"&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;, and film critics. 

The case ♡❤Lennon v Premise Media♡❤ was filed by &lt;a href="w%3AYoko%20Ono"&gt;Yoko Ono&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJulian%20Lennon"&gt;Julian Lennon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Lennon"&gt;Sean Lennon&lt;/a&gt;, and EMI Blackwood Music, Inc. against Premise Media, C&amp;S Production, and Rocky Mountain Pictures in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York"&gt;United States District Court for the Southern District of New York&lt;/a&gt; on April 23, 2008 alleging copyright infringement concerning &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Lennon"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt;'s song "&lt;a href="w%3AImagine%20%28song%29"&gt;Imagine&lt;/a&gt;". Premise is being represented by Anthony Falzone of the &lt;a href="w%3AFair%20Use%20Project"&gt;Fair Use Project&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AEMI"&gt;EMI&lt;/a&gt; filed its own separate lawsuit against Premise in a New York state court alleging that Premise's usage of the song is harming EMI’s ability to license “Imagine,” which has only been licensed in one film (&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Killing%20Fields%20%28film%29"&gt;The Killing Fields&lt;/a&gt;).

In court, Judge Richard Lowe, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, "seemed skeptical" about Falzone's arguments. Lowe asked Falzone why the film's producers did not read the lyrics to the song or flash the lyrics on the screen. Lawyers also pointed out that Premise Media licensed all other music in the film except for Lennon's song. At the end of the hearing Lowe "decided to stay the original TRO pending his ruling, which means that ♡❤Expelled♡❤, currently playing in theaters around the country, cannot be reproduced or otherwise distributed."

The judge promised a quick decision since the film will debut in Canada on June 6 and DVD rights must be finalized by the end of May for October distribution.

At least 170 firefighters in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%2C%20Germany"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; battled a fire on Tuesday at the &lt;a href="w%3ABerliner%20Philharmonie"&gt;Berliner Philharmonie&lt;/a&gt;, the building that is home to the &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%20Philharmonic"&gt;Berlin Philharmonic&lt;/a&gt; orchestra.

The fire broke out around 2:00 p.m. local time, while the orchestra was rehearsing, but all the members of the audience and orchestra made it out of the building without injury. Much of the instruments were also saved before the fire grew out of control.
Firefighters had to take off large portions of the metal roof in order to battle the blaze which took almost five hours to bring under control and burned for almost 12. It is believed that welding on the roof may have caused the fire to start, but an investigation is ongoing. 

Officials have yet to determine the total extent of the damage, but do say that nearly 17,000 square feet of the roof is burned.

The building, designed by &lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Scharoun"&gt;Hans Scharoun&lt;/a&gt;, was built in 1963 to replace the previous concert hall which was destroyed in 1944 during &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The orchestra was first formed by 54 individuals in 1882.

All future concerts that have been scheduled to take place at the Philharmonie are canceled until further notice.

&lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMembers%20of%20Parliament"&gt;Members of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; voted against a bill that would result in the limit for abortions being brought down by four weeks, to 20 weeks. The MP who originally proposed the bill, Nadine Dorrie from the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, commented on the result. "There comes a point when it has to be said this baby has a right to life." The vote to lower the limit to twenty weeks was defeated by 332 votes to 190.

There was also a vote on decreasing the limit to 22 weeks, with it being defeated by 304 votes supporting to 233 opposing.

The proposer of the twenty week limit, a former nurse explained to MPs her reason for supporting the lowering of the limit: 

Recently, a vote for decreasing the limit to 12 weeks also failed to pass through the House of Commons.

Individuals from the group &lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt; were protesting Scientology in the fourth protest in as many months, as part of the anti-Scientology movement &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Chanology"&gt;Project Chanology&lt;/a&gt;. The Project Chanology movement began when the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; attempted to get a leaked Scientology promotional video featuring &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; removed from websites &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt;. 

Members of Anonymous were motivated by the actions of the Church of Scientology, and bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10, March 15, April 12, and most recently May 10. 

At the May 10 protest, the 15-year-old boy was present and held up a placard which stated: "Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult," with a mention at the bottom of the sign to the anti-Scientology website &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Clambake"&gt;Xenu.net&lt;/a&gt;. He attended the protest held outside the Church of Scientology building on &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Victoria%20Street%2C%20London"&gt;Queen Victoria Street&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral"&gt;St Paul's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in London. In a post made by the boy on the anti-Scientology website Enturbulation.org, he stated: "Within five minutes of arriving I was told by a member of the police that I was not allowed to use that word, and that the final decision would be made by the inspector." The website describes itself as "A Source for Information on Dianetics and the Scientology Organization". Using the pseudonym "EpicNoseGuy" at the Enturbulation.org message board, the boy goes on to describe how he was "strongly advised" by police to remove the placard. 

City of London Police cited section five of the &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Order%20Act%201986"&gt;Public Order Act 1986&lt;/a&gt; to the boy, which deals with "&lt;a href="w%3AHarassment%2C%20alarm%20or%20distress"&gt;harassment, alarm or distress&lt;/a&gt;". In response, the boy cited a 1984 judgment given by Mr. Justice Latey in the Family Division of the &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;High Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ACourts%20of%20England%20and%20Wales"&gt;Her Majesty's Courts of Justice of England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;, in which Latey called Scientology a "cult" and said it was "corrupt, sinister and dangerous". In the actual 1984 judgment made by Judge Latey, he stated: "Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious. [...] In my judgement it is corrupt, sinister and dangerous. [...] It is dangerous because it is out to capture people, especially children and impressionable young people, and indoctrinate and brainwash them so that they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from ordinary thought, living and relationships with others." According to the boy's post at Enturbulation.org, the City of London Police told him he had 15 minutes to remove the sign in question. He was given a court summons by the police about a half-hour later, and his sign was removed and taken by the police as evidence.
In videos of the May 10 protest posted to YouTube, City of London Police can be seen telling protesters not to use the word "cult" in their signs. Protesters discussed the issue with police and stated that they had checked with lawyers and verified that criticizing religion was a valid form of protest. The police warned protesters that if they violated police instructions regarding usage of signs "you will be prosecuted". A female police officer read a form statement to the 15-year-old and stated: "I've been asked, if you could remove it [the sign] by 11:30, if not then I'll have to come back and either summons you or arrest you." The boy read Mr. Justice Latey's 1984 judgment to the police, and then said: "I'm not going to take this sign down." He told fellow protesters: "If I don't take the word 'cult' down, here [holding up his sign], I will be either, I think, most likely arrested or [given] a summons. I am going to fight this and not take it down because I believe in freedom of speech, besides which I'm only fifteen."

After the boy was given a summons one of the protesters asked a member of the City of London Police force: "Are we allowed to say Justice Latey says Scientology is a cult?", to which the police officer responded: "I've already had this discussion with people. Direct quotes by individuals, I haven't got a problem with."
"This barmy prosecution makes a mockery of Britain's free speech traditions. After criminalising the use of the word 'cult', perhaps the next step is to ban the words 'war' and 'tax' from peaceful demonstrations?" said &lt;a href="w%3ALiberty%20%28pressure%20group%29"&gt;Liberty&lt;/a&gt; director &lt;a href="w%3AShami%20Chakrabarti"&gt;Shami Chakrabarti&lt;/a&gt; in a statement in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The boy has appealed for help in order to fight the potential charges and possible legal action from the &lt;a href="w%3ACrown%20Prosecution%20Service"&gt;Crown Prosecution Service&lt;/a&gt; (CPS).

Ian Haworth of the United Kingdom-based &lt;a href="w%3ACult%20Information%20Centre"&gt;Cult Information Centre&lt;/a&gt; also commented on the actions of the City of London Police to ♡❤The Guardian♡❤, saying: "This is an extraordinary situation. If it wasn't so serious it would be farcical. The police's job is to protect and serve. Who is being served and who is being protected in this situation? I find it very worrying."

News of the summons issued to the UK minor has received significant attention on the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, hitting the front pages of websites &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADigg"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABoing%20Boing"&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. The story has also been discussed in hundreds of &lt;a href="w%3ABlog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; postings, including sites related to the tech-sector and others related to &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20liberties"&gt;civil liberties&lt;/a&gt;.
In a statement given to publications including ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Register"&gt;The Register&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a representative for the City of London Police explained the rationale for the summons: "City of London police had received complaints about demonstrators using the words 'cult' and 'Scientology kills' during protests against the Church of Scientology on Saturday 10 May. Following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service some demonstrators were warned verbally and in writing that their signs breached section five of the Public Order Act 1986. One demonstrator, a juvenile, continued to display a placard despite police warnings and was reported for an offence under section five. A file on the case will be sent to the CPS." 

"City of London Police upholds the right to demonstrate lawfully, but we have to balance that with the rights of all sections of the community not to be alarmed, distressed or harassed as a result of others' actions," said City of London Chief Superintendent Rob Bastable in a statement given to ♡❤The Register♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Unlike the City of London Police, the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan Police Service&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="w%3Aterritorial%20police%20force"&gt;territorial police force&lt;/a&gt; responsible for &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20London"&gt;Greater London&lt;/a&gt; excluding the &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20London"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt;) has not raised an issue with protesters using the word "cult", according to ♡❤Londonist♡❤.
A spokesman for the CPS told ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ that they did not give City of London Police specific instruction about the boy's protest sign. The spokesman said that the CPS gave the City of London Police "general advice" about the laws governing protests and "religiously aggravated crime", but did not give advice about this specific case. "... if we receive a file we will review it in the normal way according to the code for crown prosecutors," said the CPS spokesman.
The City of London Police has faced controversy in the past for its close association with the Church of Scientology. When the City of London Scientology building opened in 2006, City of London Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley praised Scientology in an appearance as guest speaker at the building's opening ceremony. Ken Stewart, another of the City of London's chief superintendents, has also appeared in a video praising Scientology. According to ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ over 20 officers for the City of London Police have accepted gifts from the Church of Scientology including tickets to film premieres, lunches and concerts at police premises. Janet Kenyon-Laveau, spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology in the UK, told ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ that the relationship between the City of London Police and Scientology was mutually beneficial, and said that Scientologists conducted clean-up campaigns in urban areas affected by drug use problems. A City of London Police spokesman released a statement in November 2006 saying: "We are conducting a review to ensure that all members of staff are aware of the force policy on accepting hospitality and to assess whether clarification or amendment of this policy is necessary."

Each of the Project Chanology international protests against Scientology has had a theme: the February protest called attention to the birthday of &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20McPherson"&gt;Lisa McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, who died under controversial circumstances while under the care of Scientology, the March protest was arranged to take place two days after Scientology founder &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;'s birthday, the April protest highlighted the Church of Scientology's &lt;a href="w%3ADisconnection"&gt;disconnection policy&lt;/a&gt;, and the May protest highlighted the Scientology practice of "&lt;a href="w%3AFair%20Game%20%28Scientology%29"&gt;Fair Game&lt;/a&gt;" and took place one day after the anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADianetics%3A%20The%20Modern%20Science%20of%20Mental%20Health"&gt;Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Another international protest is planned for June 14, and will highlight the Church of Scientology's elite "&lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Org"&gt;Sea Organization&lt;/a&gt;" or "Sea Org".

<h1>Malware from mass SQL injections confirmed by security experts</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Malware%20from%20mass%20SQL%20injections%20confirmed%20by%20security%20experts&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Nearly 20,000 websites have been attacked by unknown malicious computer users using a technique known as an &lt;a href="w%3ASQL%20injection"&gt;SQL injection&lt;/a&gt;. The attackers have inserted code to install &lt;a href="w%3Amalware"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt; onto visitors' computers. The code exploits a newly-discovered weakness in &lt;a href="w%3AAdobe%20Flash%20Player"&gt;Adobe Flash Player&lt;/a&gt;, a very common web-browser plugin. The attacks prompted an investigation by the &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwanese&lt;/a&gt; information security industry into the source of these attacks.

An SQL injection is a common method employed by malicious users to attack and deface websites, arising from website mistakes in checking user input. Attackers take advantage of these weaknesses to inject information of their choosing into the website. For example, in June of 2007, &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; UK found its webpage changed to a picture of the &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; flag, an attack which was carried out using an SQL injection.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ASecurityFocus"&gt;SecurityFocus&lt;/a&gt;, this most recent series of attacks stems from a vulnerability in versions 9.0.115.0 and 9.0.124.0 of Flash Player. It allows attackers to load any code they wish onto a computer running these versions of Flash.

As the vulnerability in Flash is newly discovered, Adobe has not yet released a newer version which fixes the problem. For the time being, computer security experts recommend that internet users with one of the unprotected versions of Flash disable the plug-in on &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; to prevent malicious users from gaining control over their computers.

The most recent version of the Flash Player, version 9.0.124.0, does not appear to be vulnerable to this exploit.

<h1>Nuclear plant sealed off after traces of explosives found on bag</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Nuclear%20plant%20sealed%20off%20after%20traces%20of%20explosives%20found%20on%20bag&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At least two men in &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; were arrested after security officials at the &lt;a href="w%3AOskarshamn%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant"&gt;Oskarshamn Nuclear Power Plant&lt;/a&gt; discovered traces of an explosive material on a plastic bag. ♡❤Oskarshamnsverkets Kraftgrupp OKG♡❤ operates the plant, which is one of three nuclear power plants in Sweden.

Reports say that on the outside of a bag was &lt;a href="w%3AAcetone%20peroxide"&gt;Acetone peroxide&lt;/a&gt;, or TATP, primarily used as a high yield explosive, but is also an &lt;a href="w%3AOrganic%20peroxide"&gt;organic peroxide&lt;/a&gt; used in making chemicals for cleaning.

The unidentified men in their 40's to 50's, who were contractors and welders hired for doing work at the plant, were stopped as they entered the plant. Authorities were called to the scene along with the bomb squad, who sealed off parts of the plant when they detected the explosive material on a bag's handle. Security detected the material in what is described by &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; as a "routine" security check. Police believe it was on one of the man's hands when it rubbed off onto the bag, but no bomb was found after an extensive search. Both men have been charged with attempted sabotage and are still undergoing interrogation. Both face sentences of up to two years in prison.

Plant officials state that the plant has never received a threat "not in the past, not now, and we have no threat for the future," said President of OKG, Lars Thuring. "The only thing that we have found is this trace of explosives in the bag."

TATP is "very unstable, very sensitive to both friction and shocks," said Swedish Defense Research Agency expert, Svante Karlsson. A small amount could cause serious damage to someone handling the material which is described as 'Mother of Satan'. Would-be 'shoe bomber' &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Reid%20%28shoe%20bomber%29"&gt;Richard Reid&lt;/a&gt; used the substance in an attempt to blow up &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20Shoe%20bomb%20plot"&gt;American Airlines flight 63&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. The same substance was also used in the July 2005 bombings in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

The plant's reactors, where the men were scheduled to work, were turned off on May 11 for routine maintenance. The rest of the plant's operations were not interrupted.

&lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; political parties are making their final bids for votes in the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACrewe%20and%20Nantwich%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Crewe and Nantwich&lt;/a&gt; constituency, where a by-election, due to the death of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGwyneth%20Dunwoody"&gt;Gwyneth Dunwoody&lt;/a&gt; MP, is to be held tomorrow.

A &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AYouGov"&gt;YouGov&lt;/a&gt; poll has suggested that the main opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;, are ahead at 45%, the incumbent &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; 18.8% behind on 26.2%. Polls from the newspaper &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AThe%20Independent"&gt;♡❤The Independent♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and Populus and ICM have also put the Conservatives ahead. However the bookmakers &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ALadbrokes"&gt;Ladbrokes&lt;/a&gt; have deemed the Conservatives "unbackable", with odds of just 16/1.

The Labour campaign in Crewe and Nantwich has branded the Conservative candidate &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEdward%20Timpson"&gt;Edward Timpson&lt;/a&gt;, a barrister from the wealthy Timpson family, a "toff", calling their candidate, the late MP's daughter &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ATamsin%20Dunwoody"&gt;Tamsin Dunwoody&lt;/a&gt;, "one of us". Conservative leader &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ADavid%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; called the Labour campaign "class warfare" which is "backward looking", "out of date" and "divisive". The Labour Party has received endorsements from soap opera &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACoronation%20Street"&gt;♡❤Coronation Street&lt;/a&gt;'s♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AElizabeth%20Dawn"&gt;Elizabeth Dawn&lt;/a&gt; (who plays the character &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AVera%20Duckworth"&gt;Vera Duckworth&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; manager &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASir%20Alex%20Ferguson"&gt;Sir Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; (Lib Dem) party have sent party leader &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Clegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt;, party president &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASimon%20Hughes"&gt;Simon Hughes&lt;/a&gt; and deputy leader and the party's shadow chancellor &lt;a href="Vince%20Cable"&gt;Vince Cable&lt;/a&gt; up to Crewe and Nantwich to campaign alongside their candidate &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20Shenton"&gt;Elizabeth Shenton&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Cable told &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANewsnight"&gt;♡❤Newsnight♡❤&lt;/a&gt; that "what's very clear is there is a lot of support draining away from the Labour Party - an enormous amount." Nick Clegg claims that the by-election is a two-horse race between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AUK%20Independence%20Party"&gt;UK Independence Party&lt;/a&gt;'s candidate &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMike%20Nattrass"&gt;Mike Nattrass&lt;/a&gt; has been touring Crewe and Nantwich in a converted London Routemaster campaign bus and handing out leaflets. He said "UKIP has never stood in Crewe and Nantwich before because Gwyneth Dunwoody was Eurosceptic and we agreed with her." Party leader &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANigel%20Farage"&gt;Nigel Farage&lt;/a&gt; has also attended a meeting in the constituency.

Polling stations will open from 07:00 &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABST"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; (06:00 &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) until 22:00 BST (21:00 UTC) on Thursday. The result is expected by Friday afternoon.

<h1>Zenit rocket launches Galaxy 18 satellite</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Zenit%20rocket%20launches%20Galaxy%2018%20satellite&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Launch"&gt;Sea Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AZenit%20rocket"&gt;Zenit-3SL&lt;/a&gt; rocket has been launched from the &lt;a href="w%3AOcean%20Odyssey"&gt;Ocean Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; platform in the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, carrying a &lt;a href="w%3Acommunications%20satellite"&gt;communications satellite&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="w%3Ageosynchronous%20transfer%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous transfer orbit&lt;/a&gt;. Lift-off occurred at 09:43 GMT this morning, and the satellite was deployed into its transfer orbit about an hour later.

The satellite, &lt;a href="w%3AGalaxy%2018"&gt;Galaxy 18&lt;/a&gt;, will be operated by &lt;a href="w%3AIntelsat"&gt;Intelsat&lt;/a&gt; from an orbital slot of 123° West longitude in &lt;a href="w%3Ageosynchronous%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous orbit&lt;/a&gt;. It will provide communications services for Intelsat customers in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The launch of Galaxy 18 was delayed from last year, following the January 2007 explosion of a Zenit rocket on its launch pad. It was originally built for &lt;a href="w%3APanAmSat"&gt;PanAmSat&lt;/a&gt;, which merged with Intelsat in August 2005. It had a launch mass, fully fuelled, of 4700 kilograms, and was built by &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Systems%20Loral"&gt;Space Systems Loral&lt;/a&gt; around an &lt;a href="w%3ALS-1300"&gt;LS-1300&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asatellite%20bus"&gt;satellite bus&lt;/a&gt;. It is expected to remain operational for around 15 years.

This is the 24 orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the 66 launch of the &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukranian&lt;/a&gt;-built Zenit rocket. The next scheduled Zenit launch is currently planned for July, with the &lt;a href="w%3AEchostar%20XI"&gt;Echostar XI&lt;/a&gt; satellite. Another Zenit-3SL will launch Intelsat's next satellite, Galaxy 19, in August.

The 27th Young Designers' Exhibition 2008, recognized by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Council%20of%20Societies%20of%20Industrial%20Design"&gt;International Council of Societies of Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; (ICSID) as the largest show of student creations, recently ended Sunday May 18. It was held at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;. Improvements and expansions were seen with 107 academical and industrial units. Different design competitions participated and showcased their products and also received awards.

It's no doubt that companies related to design and cultural industries want to discover creative talents from academical units in this exhibition. However, most companies still try to showcase different conceptional and applicative products in order to promote Taiwan's designs into the world market. A typical example is Fora Series, a photo-voltaic product series by the Tsann Kuen Trans-nation Group.

Before entering into their careers, students participated in this show and showcased varied styles that differ from the usual industrial businesspeople. To get more opportunities and in order to interact with the design and cultural industries, students also participated in vast competitions and tried to get the top places. Some students also tried to design conceptional products in conjunction with industrial designs, especially in some design competitions.

In summary, not only did the 2008 YODEX, have companies which can discover talents and showcase achievements of industrial design in the exhibition, but students can make their stages to showcase excellences from their creations in several competitions related to YODEX.

Last night saw the first semi final of &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%202008"&gt;this year's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest"&gt;Eurovision Song Contest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABelgrade"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;. The entries from &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Azerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Armenia"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; are through to the final, leaving the representatives from &lt;a href="Montenegro"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Estonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Moldova"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Marino"&gt;San Marino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Andorra"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; failing to qualify for this weekend's final.

The aforementioned countries join host nation &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, automatically through as is last year's winner, and the 'big four' - the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. The other entries will compete in the second semi final tomorrow. Below is a summary of each entry in running order:

<h2>Montenegro</h2>

Montenegro was represented by &lt;a href="w%3AStefan%20Filipovi%C4%87"&gt;Stefan Filipović&lt;/a&gt; with the Montenegrin-language song ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AZauvijek%20Volim%20Te"&gt;Zauvijek Volim Te&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (Never Forget I Love You), which was written by &lt;a href="w%3AGrigor%20Koprov"&gt;Grigor Koprov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOgnen%20Nedelkovski"&gt;Ognen Nedelkovski&lt;/a&gt;. He failed to qualify.

<h2>Estonia</h2>

Comedy act &lt;a href="w%3AKreisiraadio"&gt;Kreisiraadio&lt;/a&gt; (crazy radio) represented Estonia with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALeto%20Svet"&gt;Leto Svet&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. One member of the trio is a former politician, and a second is a current one. The song was the first Estonian entry to be in neither the Estonian or English languages. Instead, the song was mostly in Serbo-Croatian with sections in German and Finnish. They failed to qualify for the final.

<h2>Moldova</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AGeta%20Burlacu"&gt;Geta Burlacu&lt;/a&gt; performed ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Century%20Of%20Love"&gt;A Century Of Love&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ to represent Moldova. The song, written by &lt;a href="w%3AOleg%20Baraliuc"&gt;Oleg Baraliuc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AViorica%20Demici"&gt;Viorica Demici&lt;/a&gt;, failed to qualify.

<h2>San Marino</h2>
San Marino, which is entirely surrounded by &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and has a population of 31,000, debuted at the contest this year. The nation's first representative was &lt;a href="w%3AMiodio"&gt;Miodio&lt;/a&gt; with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AComplice"&gt;Complice&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Described as "a melodic song from our tradition" by Sanmarinese Eurovision delegation head &lt;a href="w%3AAlessandro%20Capicchioni"&gt;Alessandro Capicchioni&lt;/a&gt;, failed to qualify.

<h2>Belgium</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AIshtar"&gt;Ishtar&lt;/a&gt; represented Belgium with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AO%20Julissi"&gt;O Julissi&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The song, composed by band member &lt;a href="w%3AMichel%20Vangheluwe"&gt;Michel Vangheluwe&lt;/a&gt;, bears the unusual distincton of being sung entirely in a language which does not actually exist. Sung by frontwoman &lt;a href="w%3ASoetkin%20Baptist"&gt;Soetkin Baptist&lt;/a&gt; the words "kolosali krokodili" bear a resemblance to English, while the rest are designed to resemble Ukrainian and Serbian. It was hoped this would appeal to those in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union, but the song failed to qualify.

<h2>Israel</h2>

Israel was represented by &lt;a href="w%3ABo%27az%20Ma%27uda"&gt;Bo'az Ma'uda&lt;/a&gt; performing ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Fire%20in%20Your%20Eyes"&gt;The Fire in Your Eyes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. He sang alongside five backing singers whilst wearing a silvery-blue vest. Many members of the live audience could be seen waving Israeli flags. He won a place in the final with his song, which was written by &lt;a href="w%3ADana%20International"&gt;Dana International&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShai%20Kerem"&gt;Shai Kerem&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Azerbaijan</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AElnur%20Huseynov"&gt;Elnur Huseynov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASamir%20Javadzadeh"&gt;Samir Javadzadeh&lt;/a&gt; represented Azerbaijan with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADay%20After%20Day"&gt;Day After Day&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which was written by &lt;a href="w%3AGovhar%20Hasanzadeh"&gt;Govhar Hasanzadeh&lt;/a&gt; and lyrics by &lt;a href="w%3AZahra%20Badalbeyli"&gt;Zahra Badalbeyli&lt;/a&gt;. The performance featured backing performers clad in large 'angel' wings, as was one of the performers. The song has won a place in the final.

<h2>Norway</h2>

Norway was represented by &lt;a href="w%3AMaria%20Haukaas%20Storeng"&gt;Maria Haukaas Storeng&lt;/a&gt; singing ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHold%20On%20Be%20Strong"&gt;Hold On Be Strong&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which was written by &lt;a href="w%3AMira%20Craig"&gt;Mira Craig&lt;/a&gt;. Almost a million Norwegian viewers tuned in to watch the singer win a place in the final. Both her and songwriter Craig expressed delight at being chosen to go through to the final.

<h2>Poland</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AIsis%20Gee"&gt;Isis Gee&lt;/a&gt; represented Poland with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFor%20Life"&gt;For Life&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which she wrote herself. A simple performance was all that was required to secure a place in the final.

<h2>Ireland</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20the%20Turkey"&gt;Dustin the Turkey&lt;/a&gt; represented Ireland with a controversial performance that garnered some boos from the crowd. The comedy puppet sang ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AIrelande%20Douze%20Pointe"&gt;Irelande Douze Pointe&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (Ireland 12 points) which despite the mock-French title is actually in English. A number of Irish news organisations were highly critical of the performance, but the bird told Irish state TV he was "disgusted" by the fact that the song failed to get into the final.

<h2>Andorra</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AGisela%20%28singer%29"&gt;Gisela&lt;/a&gt; represented Andorra with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACasanova%20%28Gisela%20song%29"&gt;Casanova&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, composed by &lt;a href="w%3AJordi%20Cubino"&gt;Jordi Cubino&lt;/a&gt;. She failed to qualify.

<h2>Bosnia and Herzegovina</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AElvir%20Lakovi%C4%87%20Laka"&gt;Elvir Laković Laka&lt;/a&gt; sang ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APoku%C5%A1aj"&gt;Pokušaj&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ to represent Bosnia and Herzegovina. The song was selected to proceed to the final.

<h2>Armenia</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3ASirusho"&gt;Sirusho&lt;/a&gt; was able to earn Armenia a spot in the final with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AQele%2C%20Qele"&gt;Qele&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the lyrics for which she wrote herself while the music was written by H.A. Der-Hovagimian.

<h2>The Netherlands</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AHind%20Laroussi"&gt;Hind Laroussi&lt;/a&gt; represented Holland with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AYour%20Heart%20Belongs%20To%20Me"&gt;Your Heart Belongs To Me&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ but failed to qualify. She later said she found this anoying "especially when you see that a country like Azerbaijan makes it".

<h2>Finland</h2>
Finland was represented by &lt;a href="w%3Aheavy%20metal"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3ATer%C3%A4sbetoni"&gt;Teräsbetoni&lt;/a&gt; with the song ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMiss%C3%A4%20Miehet%20Ratsastaa"&gt;Missä Miehet Ratsastaa&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Finland having earned their only win in 2006 with a similar entrant, &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt;. The song, which was written by the band's frontman Jarkko Ahola, was accompanied by large amounts of pyrotechnics and the band were in their self-described "leather and skin" look. Despite Eurovision fans placing them outside the top ten in an advance poll and 62% of responders in a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHelsingin%20Sanomat"&gt;Helsingin Sanomat&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ poll also doubting the band would qualify, the song earned a place in the final.

<h2>Romania</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3ANico%20Kirita"&gt;Nico&lt;/a&gt; and Vlad Mirita were the Romanian representatives with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APe-o%20Margine%20De%20Lume"&gt;Pe-o Margine De Lume&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The song went through to the final.

<h2>Russia</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3ADima%20Bilan"&gt;Dima Bilan&lt;/a&gt;, who came second in the final in 2006, represented Russia again, this time with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABelieve%20%28Dima%20Bilan%20song%29"&gt;Believe&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. He was joined by champion figure skater &lt;a href="w%3AEvgenii%20Plushenko"&gt;Evgenii Plushenko&lt;/a&gt;, who has never performed at a song contest before. The song qualified for the final.

<h2>Greece</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AKalomira"&gt;Kalomira&lt;/a&gt; was the Greek entrant with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASecret%20Combination"&gt;Secret Combination&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, written by &lt;a href="w%3AKonstantinos%20Pantzis"&gt;Konstantinos Pantzis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APoseidon%20Yannopoulos"&gt;Poseidon Yannopoulos&lt;/a&gt;. She qualified for the final.

<h3>Rail strike begins in France</h3>
Transport workers in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; began a strike on Thursday to protest changes in the state's pension system. Almost 300,000 people took part in marches. Public transport was reported as being hobbled by Associated Press. Union officials say that 700,000 people took part in the work stoppage, which also reduced postal deliveries and even normal programming on state-run radio.

<h1>First supernova seen during explosion breakout</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=First%20supernova%20seen%20during%20explosion%20breakout&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Astronomers have for the first time watched a &lt;a href="w%3ASupernova"&gt;supernova&lt;/a&gt; explosion break out of the surface of the parent star. Previously only the remnants after an explosion have been found. The new object, &lt;a href="w%3ASN%202008D"&gt;SN 2008D&lt;/a&gt;, is in another galaxy.

Alicia Soderberg, a Hubble and Carnegie-Princeton Fellow at &lt;a href="w%3APrinceton%20University"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APrinceton%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Princeton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, explained the significance: "For years we have dreamed of seeing a star just as it was exploding, but actually finding one is a once in a lifetime event... This newly born supernova is going to be the &lt;a href="w%3ARosetta_Stone"&gt;Rosetta Stone&lt;/a&gt; of supernova studies for years to come."

Observations were being made of a different supernova in galaxy NGC 2770 when Soderberg noticed a new X-ray ray source had appeared. A burst of X-rays is produced when the explosion of a supernova reaches the surface of the exploding star. Because the &lt;a href="w%3ASwift%20Gamma-Ray%20Burst%20Mission"&gt;SWIFT&lt;/a&gt; orbiting telescope was being used, which provides images as they are received, there was no delay in getting the images and an alert was sent to other major telescopes.

Other observers who joined the watch were the 3.5-meter telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AChandra%20X-ray%20Observatory"&gt;Chandra X-ray Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AGemini%20Observatory"&gt;Gemini North telescope&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AW.%20M.%20Keck%20Observatory"&gt;Keck I&lt;/a&gt; telescope in Hawaii, the 200-inch and 60-inch telescopes at the &lt;a href="w%3APalomar%20Observatory"&gt;Palomar Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, and the Very Large Array in New Mexico.

The primary task of SWIFT is rapid detection of &lt;a href="w%3AGamma%20ray%20burst"&gt;gamma ray bursts&lt;/a&gt;, and because of their short duration the observatory requires constant monitoring. The observations of galaxy NGC 2770 were being done while the satellite was not busy with its major task.

At &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;135 a barrel, the price of oil today reached a new high. &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; has reported that this recent increase is due to figures showing a large decrease in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; petroleum supply.

However, as of 20:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; prices have fallen nearly two percent since yesterday and are back below $131. Over half of oil executives believe that the price will fall to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;100 a barrel toward the end of the year according to an &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; report.

The U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline also recently increased to a new all-time high, with the price going up 6.9 cents to 379.1 cents per gallon. This was the eighth consecutive week for the US average price to increase.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAir%20France-KLM"&gt;Air France-KLM&lt;/a&gt; recently said that they would be challenged by the rising oil price. &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; has announced thousands of job cuts.
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the U.S. has seen the cost of food rise significantly, an issue which food manufacturers and retail stores blame on the high price of fuel required for transportation. For example, CNN.com reports a 16.7% increase in the cost of hamburger buns, a staple item for many U.S. families.&lt;/p&gt;

Thursday at the Taipei International Convention Center, the winners of the Gold and Silver Awards were announced at the ♡❤2008 16th-annual Taiwan Excellence Awards♡❤, an event created to promote products made in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. They were announced by the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;Taiwan External Trade Development Council&lt;/a&gt; (TAITRA), which also organized the event.

This year, 601 products competed for the eight gold medals and twenty-one silver awards. In the &lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20communication%20technology"&gt;ICT&lt;/a&gt; category, the competition was especially fierce as 388 ICT products were on display from the &lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20technology"&gt;IT&lt;/a&gt; industry. In total, 308 products from 102 companies were entitled as "Taiwan Excellent Products".

Several world-class experts judged the nominated products, in order to select the final twenty-nine based on four critical factors including &lt;a href="w%3AResearch%20and%20development"&gt;R&amp;D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Adesign"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aquality"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Amarketing"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the TAITRA also had categories where people could vote over the Internet or using their mobile phones.

&lt;a href="w%3AAsus"&gt;ASUSTeK&lt;/a&gt; picked up two Gold Awards and six Silver Awards and was the biggest winner in the "Taiwan Excellence Awards". &lt;a href="w%3AASUS%20Eee%20PC"&gt;Eee PC 4G&lt;/a&gt;, with features like mobility, reliability, and connectively, not only won a Gold Award, but was also voted as the "Most Popular Product" as awarded by Internet and mobile users.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Swedish%20men%20suspected%20of%20nuclear%20plant%20sabotage%20released&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Two &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; men that were arrested for being suspected of sabotaging the &lt;a href="w%3AOskarshamn%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant"&gt;Oskarshamn Nuclear Power Plant&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden, have been released from police custody. Both men were arrested on Wednesday after traces of &lt;a href="w%3AAcetone%20peroxide"&gt;Acetone Peroxide&lt;/a&gt;, or TATP, were found on a plastic bag. TATP is also an &lt;a href="w%3Aorganic%20peroxide"&gt;organic peroxide&lt;/a&gt; which is sometimes used in making household cleaning chemicals.

"Both men have been cooperative but they deny any wrongdoing and waived the right to legal counsel. There was no legal ground to hold them any longer," said Swedish police in a statement to the press. The police also noted that an investigation is ongoing.

The unnamed men, in their 40's and 50's, were arrested after security officials at the plant discovered traces of the explosive substance on a plastic bag inside a bag one of the men was carrying. Both men were contractors hired to do welding work in the plant which is owned and operated by ♡❤Oskarshamnsverkets Kraftgrupp OKG♡❤.

Security detected the material on Wednesday during what was described by &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; as a "routine" security check. Authorities were called to the plant along with the bomb squad, who sealed off parts of the plant. Police believe it was on one of the man's hands when it rubbed off onto the bag, but no bomb was found on the premises after an extensive search.

TATP is "very unstable, very sensitive to both friction and shocks," said Swedish Defense Research Agency expert, Svante Karlsson. A small amount could cause serious damage to someone handling the material which is described as 'Mother of Satan'. Would-be 'shoe bomber' &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Reid%20%28shoe%20bomber%29"&gt;Richard Reid&lt;/a&gt; used the substance in an attempt to blow up &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20Shoe%20bomb%20plot"&gt;American Airlines flight 63&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. The same substance was also used in the July 2005 bombings in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AIndiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Skull"&gt;new film&lt;/a&gt; about the fictional character &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AIndiana%20Jones"&gt;Dr. Henry "Indiana" Jones Jr.&lt;/a&gt; played by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AHarrison%20Ford"&gt;Harrison Ford&lt;/a&gt; premiered worldwide on May 22, four days after the opening of the 61 &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ACannes%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

The film is about the fictional mystery surrounding the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3Acrystal%20skull"&gt;crystal skull&lt;/a&gt;s, which do exist in reality, but are considered fakes by some sceptical scientists. "Some of them are quite good, but some of them look like they were produced with a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ABlack%20%26amp%3B%20Decker"&gt;Black &amp; Decker&lt;/a&gt; in someone's garage", Professor &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AIan%20Freestone"&gt;Ian Freestone&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ACardiff%20University"&gt;Cardiff University&lt;/a&gt; said, arguing that the ancient &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AAztec"&gt;Aztecs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AMaya"&gt;Mayans&lt;/a&gt; might not have had instruments with modern tool capabilities for the task.

The film was directed by &lt;a href="Steven%20Spielberg"&gt;Steven Spielberg&lt;/a&gt; and produced by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AGeorge%20Lucas"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ALucasfilm"&gt;Lucasfilm&lt;/a&gt;).

Alongside Ford, the film features stars &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AShia%20LaBeouf"&gt;Shia LaBeouf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ACate%20Blanchett"&gt;Cate Blanchett&lt;/a&gt;. The latter of the two was 'butched up' for the role of the Soviet agent, the main villain in the film.

♡❤Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull♡❤ was rated &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system%23The%20addition%20of%20the%20PG-13%20rating"&gt;PG-13&lt;/a&gt; and runs 2 hours and 3 minutes. The film budget was &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;185 million and it will need to gross US$400 million or more at theatres to make a profit for &lt;a href="w%3AParamount%20Pictures"&gt;Paramount Pictures&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AIndiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade"&gt;previous film&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AIndiana%20Jones%20franchise"&gt;franchise&lt;/a&gt; was released in May of 1989 &amp;mdash; 19 years ago.

Police in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; are investigating after a bomb exploded in an &lt;a href="w%3AExeter"&gt;Exeter&lt;/a&gt; restaurant at about 1250 BST. One person (believed by police to be the bomber) was injured, and a second device was found and made safe nearby. The suspect has been named as 22-year-old Nicky Reilly from Plymouth. He has been arrested and taken to hospital.

The centre of the city was evacuated by police until about 1900 Local Time (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B1"&gt;UTC+1&lt;/a&gt;).

Chief Constable Stephen Otter from &lt;a href="w%3ADevon%20and%20Cornwall%20Police"&gt;Devon and Cornwall Police&lt;/a&gt; commented on the incident. He claimed that "the injured man had one of the explosive devices on him, which partially went off," and that "the other [explosive], in the vicinity of the restaurant, did not go off."

Otter also reported collaboration between police forces. "The &lt;a href="w%3ADevon"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACornwall"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt; force was working with the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; as we do with any explosion where we cannot understand why it happened."

He refused to speculate on whether it was terrorism. "I would not say anything about terrorism at this stage because I do not know." 

The deputy chief constable of the police force said that the suspected bomber had been "preyed upon, radicalised and taken advantage of." Police say that Reilly, who had a history of mental illness, had recently converted to the Islamic faith.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASpirit%20Rover"&gt;Spirit Rover&lt;/a&gt;, one of two &lt;a href="w%3ARover%20%28space%20exploration%29"&gt;planetary rovers&lt;/a&gt; operated by &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; on the planet &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20%28planet%29"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;, has made an important, though unintentional discovery on the red planet, due to a wheel which has been inoperable on the rover making large gouges in the soil of Mars wherever it goes.

Scientists say they can confirm that images from the planet taken in May of 2007 at &lt;a href="w%3AGusev%20Crater"&gt;Gusev Crater&lt;/a&gt;, show that a white substance in the soil that was turned up as the rover moved along its path is &lt;a href="w%3ASilicon%20dioxide"&gt;Silicon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; or silica. Scientists at &lt;a href="w%3ACornell%20University"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIthaca%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Ithaca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; who made the discovery, have determined it to be nearly 90 percent pure. They also say the only way for the substance to be present there is if there was an abundance of water present on the planet sometime in its past. The water would have been superheated and coming up through &lt;a href="w%3AHydrothermal%20vent"&gt;hydrothermal vents&lt;/a&gt; or even hot springs which scientists say would have been similar to ones already present at &lt;a href="w%3AYellowstone%20National%20Park"&gt;Yellowstone National Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Wyoming"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;.

Hydrothermal vents are &lt;a href="w%3Afissure"&gt;fissures&lt;/a&gt; with superheated water and gases venting from the planet's surface. The vents are usually found around highly volcanic areas at the bottoms of seas and oceans. To this day, these vents or evidence of them have only been found on &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;. 

"On Earth, the only way to have this kind of silica enrichment is by hot water reacting with rocks. &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Plate%20%28Mars%29"&gt;Home Plate&lt;/a&gt; came from an explosive volcanic event with water or ice being involved. We saw where rocks were thrown into the air and landed to make small indentations in the soft, wet ash sediment around the vent," said Dr. Steven Ruff of &lt;a href="w%3AArizona%20State%20University"&gt;Arizona State University&lt;/a&gt; (ASU) in &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, one of the authors of the announcement of the findings published in ♡❤Science♡❤.

The finding has lead to more questions about Mars and whether or not it once had life present on it, and if so, where and how much.

"On Earth, hydrothermal deposits teem with life and the associated silica deposits typically contain fossil remains of microbes. What we can say is that this was once a habitable environment where liquid water and the energy needed for life were present," said another author of the report, Dr. Jack Farmer also from ASU.

Ruff also states that much of the area Mars already searched seems to be covered with silica. "It's not just the soil in a trench in one place. It's a broader story of outcrops that extend 50 meters [about 150 feet] away from Home Plate. It's not a small scale, modest phenomenon."

Spirit is the first of two rovers which landed on Mars in January of 2004. The second rover is &lt;a href="w%3AOpportunity%20Rover"&gt;Opportunity&lt;/a&gt; and both are still operating nearly 20 times longer than NASA has expected.

A &lt;a href="w%3Atornado"&gt;tornado&lt;/a&gt; that has caused 28 miles (45 km) of destruction throughout &lt;a href="w%3AWeld%20County%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Weld County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, has killed one and injured 100. The man killed was inside a vehicle that was destroyed in the storm, west of &lt;a href="w%3AGreeley"&gt;Greeley&lt;/a&gt;, which is about 60 miles (97 km) north of &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;.

A state trooper says that multiple car accidents occurred on highways throughout the county. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Route%2085"&gt;U.S. Route 85&lt;/a&gt; was closed after two semi-trailers were flipped over, though the drivers were not injured. Dozens of houses and vehicles were badly damaged by the tornado as it passed through. The town of &lt;a href="w%3AWindsor%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; had hundreds of homes and businesses damaged, including the town hall, in addition to trees down and electricity outages. In response to the disaster, &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Colorado"&gt;Colorado Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Ritter"&gt;Bill Ritter&lt;/a&gt; declared a &lt;a href="w%3Astate%20of%20emergency"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt; and activated the &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%20National%20Guard"&gt;Colorado National Guard&lt;/a&gt; in the badly damaged Weld County.
Severe storms also hit &lt;a href="w%3ALaramie%2C%20Wyoming"&gt;Laramie, Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;, 145 miles northwest of &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, knocking out electricity to 7,300 customers and damaging buildings. One damaged building, the Quadra Dangle Square Dance Club, listed on the &lt;a href="w%3ANational_Register_of_Historic_Places"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;, had its roof and porch ripped off. The Associated Press reports Brian Chapman of the National Weather Service in Cheyenne as saying that "indicators are very strongly in favor of it being a tornado," but no confirmation is possible until the damage is fully assessed. Governor &lt;a href="w%3ADave_Freudenthal"&gt;Dave Freudenthal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AWyoming"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; has also authorized a crew of eight National Guardsman to help clean up the damage. Another twister touched down just east of &lt;a href="w%3ACheyenne%2C%20Wyoming"&gt;Cheyenne, Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;. The local fire department responded to a call after the storm damaged a barn and a house just south of &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2080"&gt;I-80&lt;/a&gt;. 

Rain, hail and snow pelted the entire region, and more storms are predicted for today. The &lt;a href="w%3A%20National%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACheyenne%2C%20Wyoming"&gt;Cheyenne&lt;/a&gt; reports, "Severe thunderstorms are likely again this afternoon into early this evening mainly east of the Laramie Range...with the greatest threat east of Cheyenne across the southern Nebraska panhandle. Locally heavy rainfall is also possible which may cause some localized flooding especially in areas that received heavy rainfall Thursday." Winds are expected to gust above 40mph throughout the day. At 7:40am MST weather conditions were calm and partly cloudly just west of &lt;a href="w%3ALaramie%2C%20Wyoming"&gt;Laramie, Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;

The Vancouver Whitecaps announced the signing of former Toronto FC defender Chris Pozniak. Pozniak was chosen in the expansion draft by the San Jose Earthquakes and was then traded last March to Chivas USA of Major League Soccer. The contract is pending international clearance.

Whitecaps president Bob Lenarduzzi said, "Chris brings a wealth of experience and quality to our back end. The signing of Chris made sense for a number of reasons for both the club and Chris. Chris was looking for a team that would be able to use his services for the next six weeks before allowing him to explore opportunities in Europe. We are currently playing through a busy stretch in our schedule and have sustained some recent injuries. This is a win-win for both club and player."

In 4 games with Chivas USA this season, Pozniak started 3 and recorded 311 minutes.

Pozniak, who was born in Kraków, Poland, and immigrated to Canada with his family in 1990, has been capped by Canada at the U-20, U-23 and senior levels. Pozniak earned his first senior cap in the 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup against Haiti. He has since earned 21 caps, which includes a start in Canada’s 1-0 win over Martinique last January.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Wikipedia"&gt;Russian Language edition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; was recently dubbed "a top &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Community"&gt;Internet community&lt;/a&gt;" of the past year by a professional union of &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Internet"&gt;Russian Internet (Runet)&lt;/a&gt; scene protagonists, the "Ezhe" (ЕЖЕ).

Ezhe ("еже") means "every" in &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Language"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;, a reference to regularly updated websites; Ezhe's mascot is a hedgehog because of its similarity with the word "yozh" ("ёж"). Ezhe.Ru is a non-profit "club" community coordinated via a Russian-speaking mailing list; nowadays it comprises more than 500 members — IT professionals, journalists and so on from all over the world. It was founded in 1997 and maintains some public projects, such as annual "professional award" "ROTOR" (a spelling interpretation for "Russian Online TOP"). It has no payments or figurines and is awarded virtually.

ROTOR is Runet-wise generally regarded as an acknowledgment token for some Russian language Internet project from the so-called "Runet professionals" who populate Ezhe club. Contest is usually covered by Russian online mass media and in blogs. There are approximately 30 nominations honoring different Russian websites, or acts related to Runet, in different planes. Ezhe members vote in 2 tours, and in most contemporary ROTOR-2008 (lasted May 12—22) Russian Wikipedia gained 1st place in "Internet Community of the year" nomination (the year before it took 2nd). It also obtained second place in "Scientific and Educational website of the year" nomination (for the 3rd time). In 2006 and 2007, Russian Wikipedia also mastered "Science and Education" category on the &lt;a href="w%3ARunet%20Prize"&gt;Runet Prize&lt;/a&gt;.

In the meantime Russian Wikipedians recently celebrated Top-10 Wikipedias range introduction: &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Wikipedia"&gt;Swedish Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; was out of 10th place, and Russian was in with over 283 thousand articles on May 19th, 2008. The collective of editors on the project issued a now-habitual &lt;a href="w%3Aru%3A%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%8F%3A%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%81-%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7/%D0%92%20%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B5%21"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; describing the developments of Wikipedia.

Russian editors also immediately started a &lt;a href="w%3Aru%3A%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%8F%3A%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%3A%D0%A8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F/%D0%A8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F"&gt;"Swedish Week"&lt;/a&gt; organized effort within their community to write a bunch of new articles dedicated to &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20culture"&gt;Swedish culture&lt;/a&gt;. Swedes later replied with the &lt;a href="w%3Asv%3AWikipedia%3AProjekt%20Ryssland/Ryska%20veckan"&gt;alike action&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20culture"&gt;Russian culture&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asperm%20bank"&gt;sperm bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asurrogacy"&gt;surrogacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -based Growing Generations is named as a defendant in the New York lawsuit, and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20action%20committee"&gt;political action committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A21st%20Century%20Democrats"&gt;Twenty-First Century Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a defendant in the Washington, D.C. case.
In separate lawsuits filed in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York"&gt;United States District Court for the Southern District of New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , New York, and in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia"&gt;United States District Court for the District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, former employees are suing their employers for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amonetary%20damages"&gt;monetary damages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and claiming religious discrimination after their employers allegedly mandated that they attend courses at Landmark Education.

In the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 3 million federal lawsuit filed in New York, Scott Glasgow is suing his former employer Growing Generations and its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChief%20executive%20officer"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Stuart Miller. Growing Generations maintains sperm banks and also arranges surrogacy for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHomosexuality"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; couples who wish to have children. The company has offices in New York and Los Angeles, and has done business with celebrities including actor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AB.%20D.%20Wong"&gt;B. D. Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20%26amp%3B%20Order%3A%20SVU"&gt;Law &amp; Order: SVU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. 

Glasgow was marketing director of Growing Generations, and claims he was fired in June 2007 after refusing to continue attending Landmark Education seminars. Glasgow is also suing for sexual harassment, and claims Miller came on to him in September 2006. He made approximately $100,000 per year as the company's marketing director, and was the company's only employee based out of New York City. The company's main offices are in Los Angeles.
"I was shocked when I was fired. It took me months to right myself. I want them to stop imposing Landmark on the employees, and I want an apology," said Glasgow in a statement in ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Village%20Voice"&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. Brent Pelton, one of Glasgow's attorneys, stated that: "The Landmark philosophy is deeply ingrained in the culture of the company". Glasgow said that the Landmark Education training courses were "opposite" to his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; beliefs. According to Glasgow he was questioned by Miller in May 2007 after he walked out of a Landmark Education course, and was fired shortly thereafter. "We stand by the allegations contained in the complaint and we look forward to proving them at trial," said Pelton in a statement to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

Ian Wallace, an attorney who represents Growing Generations, claimed that Glasgow wasn't fired but walked away from his position. "Growing Generations and Mr. Miller are very confident that these claims will be dismissed ultimately, and there's no factual basis for them whatsoever," said Wallace in a statement to ♡❤The Village Voice♡❤. Lawyers representing Growing Generations and Stuart Miller declined comment to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Post"&gt;The New York Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, and did not immediately return a message from ♡❤ABC News♡❤.

In Glasgow's complaint, entered into federal court record on April 18, he asserts that Landmark Education constitutes a "religion", and "perceived their philosophy as a form of religion that contradicted his own personal beliefs". He states that when he was promoted to Director of Marketing, he asked Miller if he could stop attending the Landmark sessions but was told that they were mandatory for all of the company's executives and that Landmark is "very much the language of the company." Glasgow said his performance at the company was assessed based on how he was "touching, moving and inspiring" others, a phrase from the Landmark philosophy, as opposed to his business accomplishments at the company. The complaint claims that the actions of Miller and Growing Generations violated Federal, New York State and New York City &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20rights"&gt;civil rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; laws.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. deals with a separate plaintiff and company, but the plaintiff in the suit also claims that religious discrimination took place for allegedly being mandated to attend Landmark Education courses. Kenneth Goldman is suing the United States Democratic political action committee Twenty-First Century Democrats (also 21st Century Democrats) and its former executive director Kelly Young. Goldman was formerly the communications director of 21st Century Democrats. 

According to Goldman's complaint, three employees of 21st Century Democrats were fired after refusing to attend the Landmark Forum course. The complaint asserts that Landmark Education has "religious characteristics and theological implications" which influenced the mission of 21st Century Democrats and the way the organization conducted business. Goldman's complaint states that in addition to himself, a training director and field director were also fired after they made it clear they would not attend the Landmark Forum. 

Goldman says executive director Young infused Landmark Education &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ajargon"&gt;jargon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; terms into staff meetings such as "create possibilities", "create a new context", and "enroll in possibilities". He also claims that Young "urged" staff members to participate in Landmark Education events outside of the workplace, drove employees to and from Landmark functions, and used funds from 21st Century Democrats to pay for employees to attend those functions. Goldman's complaint asserts that he was discriminated against in violation of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act. 
In a statement in ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Times"&gt;The Washington Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, the executive director of 21st Century Democrats, Mark Lotwis, called the lawsuit "frivolous" and said: "we're going to defend our organization's integrity". Landmark Education spokeswoman Deborah Beroset said that the Landmark Forum "is in no way religious in nature and any claim to the contrary is simply absurd," and stated: "While we are not a party to this lawsuit and have no firsthand knowledge of it, we can only assume that we are being used as a legal and political football to further the plaintiff"s own financial interests."

The New York lawsuit was filed April 14, and is still in early filing stages. A conference with the federal court judge in the case has been scheduled for June 17. The Washington, D.C. suit began in November 2007, and entered mediation this past March. As of April 15 the parties in the case were due back to court on July 11 to update the court on the mediation process. 

Landmark Education is descended from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AErhard%20Seminars%20Training"&gt;Erhard Seminars Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , also called "est", which was founded by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWerner%20Erhard"&gt;Werner Erhard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . est began in 1971, and Erhard's company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWerner%20Erhard%20and%20Associates"&gt;Werner Erhard and Associates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; repackaged the course as "The Forum" in 1985. Associates of Erhard bought the license to his "technology" and incorporated Landmark Education in California in 1991.

This is not the first time employees have sued claiming mandatory attendance at "Forum" workshops violated their civil rights. In a lawsuit filed in December 1988 in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Georgia"&gt;United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , eight employees of DeKalb Farmers Market in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADecatur%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Decatur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; sued their employer claiming their religious freedom and civil rights were violated when they were allegedly coerced into attending "Forum" training sessions. "Many of these training programs, particularly at large corporations, claim to be purely psychological, aimed at improving productivity and morale and loyalty. But in fact they are religious," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Denver"&gt;University of Denver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Areligious%20studies"&gt;religious studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; professor Carl Raschke in a statement to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Wall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

The DeKalb Farmers Market employees were represented by lawyers for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Consulting Technologies Inc., an affiliate of Transformational Technologies Inc., was named as a party in the lawsuit. Transformational Technologies was founded by Werner Erhard, and was not named as a party in the suit. The "Forum" course that the employees claimed they were mandated to attend was developed by Werner Erhard and Associates. Employees said that they were fired or pressured to quit after they objected to the Forum courses. 

The workers claimed that the Forum course contradicted with their religious beliefs. The plaintiffs in the suit included adherents of varying religious backgrounds, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHinduism"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "The sessions put people into a hibernating state. They ask for total loyalty. It's like brainwashing," said Dong Shik Kim, one of the plaintiffs in the case. The plaintiffs said they lost their jobs after objecting to a "new age quasi-religious cult" which they said was developed by Werner Erhard.

The DeKalb Farmers Market denied the allegations, and an attorney for the company Edward D. Buckley III told ♡❤The Wall Street Journal♡❤ that employees were encouraged, not coerced, to attend the training sessions. According to ♡❤The Wall Street Journal♡❤, The Forum said it would not sanction workers being coerced to attend its training sessions. 

The parties in the DeKalb Farmers Market religious discrimination case came to a settlement in May 1989, and the case was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrejudice%20%28legal%20procedure%29"&gt;dismissed with prejudice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in June. The terms of the out-of-court settlement were not made public, but the employees' attorney Amy Totenberg told ♡❤The Wall Street Journal♡❤ that the case "has made employers come to grips with the legitimate boundaries of employee training".

According to Title VII of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964"&gt;Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , employers must "reasonably accommodate" their employees' religious beliefs unless this creates "undue hardship". In September 1988, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEqual%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission"&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; issued a policy-guidance notice which stated that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Age"&gt;New Age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; courses should be handled under Title VII of the Act. According to the Commission, employers must provide "reasonable accommodation" if an employee challenges a training course, unless this causes "undue hardship" for the company.

In October 2006, Landmark Education took legal action against &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Archive"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and a website owner in &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in attempts to remove criticism of its products from the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. The company sought a subpoena under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in an attempt to discover the identity of an anonymous critic who uploaded a 2004 &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; documentary of the Landmark Forum to the Internet. "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVoyage%20au%20pays%20des%20nouveaux%20gourous"&gt;Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " (Voyage to the Land of the New Gurus) was produced by ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APi%C3%A8ces%20%C3%A0%20Conviction"&gt;Pièces à Conviction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, a French &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainvestigative%20journalism"&gt;investigative journalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; news program. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; represented the anonymous critic and the Internet Archive, and Landmark withdrew its subpoena in November 2006 in exchange for a promise from the anonymous critic not to repost the video.

Landmark Education itself has come under scrutiny for its controversial labor practices. The company has been investigated by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor"&gt;United States Department of Labor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in separate investigations originating out of California, &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Investigations focused on the heavy reliance of unpaid labor in the company's workforce, which Landmark Education calls "assistants" and deems volunteers. 

An investigation by the U.S. Dept. Labor based out of Colorado found that activities performed by Landmark Education's "assistants" include: "office, clerical, telephone solicitation and enrollment, as well as greeting customers, setting up chairs, handling microphones during the seminars and making coffee. Additionally, a number of volunteers actually teach the courses and provide testimonials during and after the courses." The Colorado investigation's 1996 report found that "No records are kept of any hours worked by any employees." According to a 1998 article in ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMetro%20Silicon%20Valley"&gt;Metro Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤: "In the end the Department of Labor dropped the issue, leaving Landmark trumpeting about its volunteers' choice in the matter." ♡❤Metro Silicon Valley♡❤ reported that Landmark Education at the time employed 451 paid staff, and also utilized the services of 7,500 volunteers.

After an investigation into Landmark Education's labor practices by the U.S. Dept. Labor's offices out of California, the company was deemed to have &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aovertime"&gt;overtime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; violations. According to the Department of Labor's 2004 report on the investigation, back wages of $187,569.01 were found due to 45 employees. An investigation by the U.S. Dept. Labor in Texas which concluded in 2005 stated: "Minimum wage violation found. Volunteers (Assistants) are not paid any wages for hours worked while performing the major duties of the firm. The assistants set up rooms, call registrants, collect fees, keep stats of classroom data/participants, file, they also are answering phones, training and leading seminars." 

The Texas investigation also discovered an overtime violation. Landmark Education agreed to pay back wages for the overtime violation, but did not comply with the overtime violation found by the U.S. Dept. Labor for the "assistants". Landmark Education denied that the "assistants" are employees, though the Department of Labor report concluded: "Interviews reveal that the employees are taking payments, registering clients, billing, training, recruiting, setting up locations, cleaning, and other duties that would have to be performed by staff if the assistants did not perform them."

According to the 2004 investigative report by ♡❤Pièces à Conviction♡❤ in the "Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous" program, Landmark Education was investigated by the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; government in 1995. In the "Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous" program volunteers were filmed through a hidden camera and shown performing duties for Landmark Education in France including manning phones, recruitment and financial work for the company, and one volunteer was shown cleaning a toilet. 

♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Nouvel%20Observateur"&gt;Le Nouvel Observateur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reported that after "Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous" aired in France, labor inspectors investigated Landmark Education's use of unpaid volunteers. According to ♡❤Le Nouvel Observateur♡❤, one month after the labor investigation took place the French branch of the company had disbanded. A former "Introduction Leader" to the Landmark Forum, Lars Bergwik, has recently posted a series of videos to YouTube critical of the company and its practices. Bergwik appeared on a 2004 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainvestigative%20journalism"&gt;investigative journalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; program on &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATV4%20%28Sweden%29"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , ♡❤Kalla Fakta♡❤ (Cold Facts). According to Bergwik, after the ♡❤Kalla Fakta♡❤ program on Landmark Education aired, "Landmark left Sweden".

The &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEdward%20Timpson"&gt;Edward Timpson&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACrewe%20and%20Nantwich%20by-election%2C%202008"&gt;Crewe and Nantwich by-election&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; with a majority of 7,860 votes. This is the party's first by-election victory in 26 years and party leader &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ADavid%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; visited the constituency earlier.

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ATamson%20Dunwoody"&gt;Tamsin Dunwoody&lt;/a&gt; said that the 17.6% swing was a "mid-term blip" and that the people of Crewe and Nantwich will be "watching" Mr. Timpson. However David Cameron proclaimed the result "the end of New Labour" calling the Conservatives' overturning of the 7,000 Labour majority "the start of something different and something bigger".

He criticised the Labour Party's campaign in Crewe and Nantwich, which had described the Conservative candidate as a "toff", as "negative", "xenophobic" and "class war" but said he realises the differences between by-election and general election results. The newly elected Mr. Timpson said in his victory speech that "I am going to stand up for local families, local jobs and, whenever I need to, stand up to the Government on your behalf." 

Miss Dunwoody is confident of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership, telling reporters earlier that "we know the Prime Minister can lead us through this." Labour's deputy leader &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AHarriet%20Harman"&gt;Harriet Harman&lt;/a&gt; also defended Mr. Brown's position, saying that "the overwhelming majority of people in the Labour Party... are fully behind Gordon Brown."

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AChris%20Huhne"&gt;Chris Huhne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; home affairs spokesman, defended his party's third-place result as "really rather robust" and said the people's votes were anti-Labour, not pro-Conservative. The &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AUK%20Independence%20Party"&gt;UK Independence Party&lt;/a&gt; are pleased with the result, claiming that it confirms the party's position as "the fourth political force in the country" and their candidate &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMike%20Nattrass"&gt;Mike Nattrass&lt;/a&gt; said "this has been a stepping stone for the European elections next year."

A new study that was recently carried by the online publication &lt;a href="w%3APLoS%20ONE"&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; describes the finding of &lt;a href="w%3Adinosaur"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt; tracks on the &lt;a href="w%3AArabian%20Peninsula"&gt;Arabian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. The first of the discoveries was of a two-footed &lt;a href="w%3Atridactyl"&gt;tridactyl&lt;/a&gt;. These tracks showed that the animal had taken steps with an average length of just over a metre. The tracks were pointing in the &lt;a href="w%3ASSW"&gt;SSW&lt;/a&gt; direction.
The study noted that "west of the tridactyl trackway, 11 subparallel quadrupedal trackways preserve evidence of large and small quadrupedal animals traveling together in a herd." The study also noted that there may have been additional tracks that were not discovered.

The report described the method of finding the tracks: "Trackways were exposed by clearing away sand, small rocks and debris." The tracks were found in &lt;a href="w%3AMadar"&gt;Madar&lt;/a&gt;, 47 km north of the &lt;a href="Yemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;i capital. 

Mohammed Al-Daheri, a journalist from the area of the discovery, was the first person to discover the existence of these tracks in the area. Anne S. Schulp, Mohammed Al-Wosabi and Nancy J. Stevens were subsequently contacted and asked to carry out the study.

&lt;a href="Borussia%20Dortmund"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt; have hired &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp"&gt;Jürgen Klopp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as their new Head Coach after &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Doll"&gt;Thomas Doll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; resignation after their worst league position in 20 years. Klopp's contract will run until the June 30, 2010. Klopp was the Head Coach for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFSV%20Mainz"&gt;FSV Mainz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; since 2001 before leaving for Dortmund.

"I am delighted to be here. I am honoured", said Klopp. "Now I want to help bring the club back on track." Klopp has high expectations of the club, current players and target signings for the summer transfer window and wants to give the matches of Borussia Dortmund a "recognition factor."

"Although there is no farm in the neighbourhood we suspect that he got the illness after his family bought chickens from a farm," said senior health ministry official Mahmudur Rahman. Rahman is the head of Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology and Disease Control and Research. He asserted that the government had the disease under control, and that physicians and hospitals in the country were adequately prepared. 

Rahman said Thursday that the child had recovered from the disease. "The child was found infected by H5N1 but after treatment he has recovered and is now doing well," said Rahman in a statement to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) confirmed the positive test results on Friday. This case in Bangladesh brings the total number of countries in the world with human infections from the disease up to 15. "When a disease is so widespread in poultry, it is really a matter of time before you get a human case. It shows the need to control the disease in animals if you are going to reduce the chances of transmission to humans," said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl in a statement to ♡❤Reuters♡❤.
The boy had previously been diagnosed with H5N1 in January, but the CDC only confirmed the case this week. In a statement in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, senior government official Saluddin Khan said: "There is no reason to panic. The child contracted the H5N1 bird flu virus in January but we only got confirmation from the CDC on Wednesday it was a human bird flu case." 

Khan commented on preventative measures being taken by the government, saying, "we're destroying the birds and eggs as soon as we have any report of bird flu at any farm in the country."

Bangladesh was first hit by bird flu in February 2007, and after a period of dormancy, was hit again in January 2008. Outbreaks subsided in March when peaking temperatures killed off the virus. Over one million birds were slaughtered during the outbreaks, and at the peak the outbreaks were the cause of a loss 1.5 million jobs in the Bangladesh poultry industry, which is the largest in the world. The Avian influenza has spread through 47 of Bangladesh's 64 &lt;a href="w%3ADistricts%20of%20Bangladesh"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt;.

The H5N1 virus seldom infects humans, but according to WHO there have been 382 human cases globally since 2003, including 241 deaths.

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; leader of the opposition today made a speech to the conference of the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Conservative%20Party"&gt;Scottish Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;. In the speech he addressed the issue of Scottish independence. "I want to be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom - all of it, including Scotland. I absolutely believe we are stronger together, and weaker apart, and I will do anything and everything to keep our two countries as one," he said.

"Whether we like it or not, the ugly stain of separatism is seeping through the Union flag," said Cameron, stating his opinion on the movements for &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20independence"&gt;Scottish independence&lt;/a&gt;. "The simple truth is that the Union between England and Scotland is under attack as never before."

Mr. Cameron also criticised Labour in the speech. "To play games by calling for a referendum right at the moment when people would take any opportunity to give the most unpopular Government in living memory a good kicking, isn’t clever... isn’t good politics …isn’t defending the Union."

He also commented on Britishness is the speech. "The Union is in danger for other reasons too," he claimed. "There is, of course, the question of identity. The number of people who think themselves British – ahead of Scottish or English - is in decline." 

"Britishness is a matter of instinct, not calculation, and the sooner we have a Government that is willing to stand up for, and take pride in, that instinct then the sooner we can fight the forces of separation," continued Cameron, speaking to his supporters.

Cameron also addressed &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20First%20Minister"&gt;Scottish First Minister&lt;/a&gt; and leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20National%20Party"&gt;Scottish National Party&lt;/a&gt;:

Three &lt;a href="w%3AGonets"&gt;Gonets&lt;/a&gt; satellites have been launched by the &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3ARVSN"&gt;Space Forces&lt;/a&gt; atop a &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukranian&lt;/a&gt;-built &lt;a href="w%3ARockot"&gt;Rokot&lt;/a&gt; carrier rocket. Lift-off, from site 133 at the &lt;a href="w%3APlesetsk%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Plesetsk Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; in Northern Russia, occurred at 15:20:09 GMT this afternoon.

The three Gonets satellites will be used to provide store-dump communication services. This is the second launch of modernised Gonets-D1M satellites. They will be operated by Gonets SatCom, an organisation which was previously part of the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Federal%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Russian Federal Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;, but which was privatised in 1996. Whilst Gonets is a civilian system, it has been reported that these satellites will also be used for military applications. Reports have suggested that the satellites have received military designations of Kosmos-2437, 2438 and 2439 under the &lt;a href="w%3ACosmos%20%28satellite%29"&gt;Kosmos&lt;/a&gt; system. Such designations have previously been assigned to, and in some cases later removed from, civilian satellites.

A small technology demonstration satellite, &lt;a href="w%3AYubileiny"&gt;Yubileiny&lt;/a&gt;, was also launched. It was built to celebrate the 50 anniversary of the launch of &lt;a href="w%3ASputnik%201"&gt;Sputnik 1&lt;/a&gt;, and will be operated by &lt;a href="w%3ANPO%20PM"&gt;NPO PM&lt;/a&gt;. It will broadcast audio and visual programmes on amateur radio frequencies, detailing the history of the space programmes of Russia and the Soviet Union, as well as signals imitating those of Sputnik 1.

The Rokot is a small carrier rocket derived from the &lt;a href="w%3AUR-100"&gt;UR-100&lt;/a&gt; missile. Its upper stage, the &lt;a href="w%3ABriz-KM"&gt;Briz-KM&lt;/a&gt;, is a scaled-down version of the &lt;a href="w%3ABriz-M"&gt;Briz-M&lt;/a&gt; upper stage used on &lt;a href="w%3AProton%20rocket"&gt;Proton rocket&lt;/a&gt;s. This is the first launch of a Briz upper stage of either type since the failure of a Briz-M during a March Proton launch, which left the &lt;a href="w%3AAMC-14"&gt;AMC-14&lt;/a&gt; satellite stranded in &lt;a href="w%3AMedium%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;Medium Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the 25 orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008 in spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;, and the 13 launch of a Rokot. The next Rokot launch is scheduled for early-mid September, with the &lt;a href="w%3AGOCE"&gt;GOCE&lt;/a&gt; satellite for the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Tornado kills one and injures 100 in northern Colorado</h2>
A tornado that has caused 28 miles (45 km) of destruction throughout Weld County, Colorado, has killed one and injured 100. The man killed was inside a vehicle that was destroyed in the storm, west of Greeley, which is about 60 miles (97 km) north of Denver.

A state trooper says that multiple car accidents occurred on highways throughout the county. U.S. Route 85 was closed after two semi-trailers were flipped over, though the drivers were not injured. Dozens of houses and vehicles were badly damaged by the tornado as it passed through. The town of Windsor had hundreds of homes and businesses damaged, including the town hall, in addition to trees down and electricity outages. In response to the disaster, Colorado Governor Bill Ritter declared a state of emergency and activated the Colorado National Guard.

<h2>Bomb explodes in Exeter, UK</h2>
Police in the United Kingdom are investigating after a bomb exploded in an Exeter restaurant at about 1250 BST. One person (believed by police to be the bomber) was injured, and a second device was found and made safe nearby. The suspect has been named as 22-year-old Nicky Reilly from Plymouth. He has been arrested and taken to hospital.

The centre of the city was evacuated by police until about 1900 Local Time (UTC+1).

The deputy chief constable of the police force said that the suspected bomber had been "preyed upon, radicalised and taken advantage of." Police say that Reilly recently converted to the Islamic faith.

<h2>Conservatives win Crewe and Nantwich by-election</h2>
The Conservative Party's Edward Timpson has won the Crewe and Nantwich by-election with a majority of 7,860 votes. This is the party's first by-election victory in 26 years and party leader David Cameron visited the constituency earlier.

Labour Party candidate Tamsin Dunwoody said that the 17.6% swing was a "mid-term blip" and that the people of Crewe and Nantwich will be "watching" Mr. Timpson. However David Cameron proclaimed the result "the end of New Labour" calling the Conservatives' overturning of the 7,000 Labour majority "the start of something different and something bigger". Chris Huhne, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, defended his party's third-place result as "really rather robust" and said the people's votes were anti-Labour, not pro-Conservative.

<h2>Bangladesh reports first human case of H5N1 bird flu</h2>
Bangladesh reported its first human case of the H5N1 strain of Avian flu on Thursday. According to a representative of the Bangladesh health ministry, the 16-month old boy initially tested negative for the disease. His virus culture tested positive in tests performed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The boy is from the capital city of Dhaka in the Dhaka District.

The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the positive test results on Friday. This case in Bangladesh brings the total number of countries in the world with human infections from the disease up to 15.

<h1>NOAA says Earth's oceans becoming more acidic</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NOAA%20says%20Earth%27s%20oceans%20becoming%20more%20acidic&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to a study performed by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s (NOAA) &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Marine%20Environmental%20Laboratory"&gt;Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, the level of acid in the world's oceans is rising, decades before scientists expected the levels to rise.

The study was performed on the coastal waters of the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ABaja%20California"&gt;Baja California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="British%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, where tests showed that acid levels in some areas near the edge of the Continental Shelf were high enough to corrode the shells of some sea creatures as well as some corals. Some areas showed excessive levels of acid less than four miles off the northern &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; coastline in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

"What we found ... was truly astonishing. This means ocean acidification may be seriously impacting marine life on the continental shelf right now. The models suggested they wouldn't be corrosive at the surface until sometime during the second half of this century," said Richard A. Feely, an &lt;a href="w%3AOceanography"&gt;oceanographer&lt;/a&gt; from the NOAA.

The natural processes of the seas and oceans constantly clean the &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;'s air, absorbing 1/3 to 1/2 of the &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; generated by humans. As the oceans absorb more of the gas, the water becomes more acidic, reducing the amount of &lt;a href="w%3Acarbonate"&gt;carbonate&lt;/a&gt; which shellfish such as clams and oysters use to form their shells, and increasing the levels of &lt;a href="w%3Acarbonic%20acid"&gt;carbonic acid&lt;/a&gt;. Although levels are high, they are not yet high enough to threaten humans directly.

"Scientists have also seen a reduced ability of marine algae and free-floating plants and animals to produce protective carbonate shells," added Feely.

Feely noted that, according to the study, the oceans and seas have absorbed more than 525 billion tons of carbon dioxide since the &lt;a href="w%3AIndustrial%20Revolution"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; began.

Two men have been fined for their failure to prevent the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Lathen%20maglev%20train%20accident"&gt;2006 Lathen maglev train accident&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, which caused 23 deaths and 11 injuries on September 22, 2006. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AMagnetic%20levitation"&gt;maglev&lt;/a&gt; train involved slammed into a maintenance vehicle at high speed on a test track after what was described as a "chain of &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20error"&gt;human error&lt;/a&gt;" Maglevs float above the rails, kept up and propelled by magnetism. This particular sat 1 &lt;a href="w%3Acentimetre"&gt;cm&lt;/a&gt; above the rails and featured a rail-hugging design that reduced the risk of derailments.

The state court in &lt;a href="w%3AOsnabr%C3%BCck"&gt;Osnabrück&lt;/a&gt; fined then track manager Guenter Steinmetz 24,000 &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; and his successor Joerg Metzner 20,000 euro. Both men were convicted of 23 counts of manslaughter and 11 counts of causing negligent injury. Prosecutors had sought jail sentences but the men were spared this as the court ruled they had not acted with criminal intent. The men intend to appeal.

The men had failed to install automatic brakes that would have stopped the train while there was a maintenance vehicle on the tracks and of not adhering to the "two-people-on-duty" guideline.

The third defendant, traffic superintendent Guenther Mueller, was unable to face trial due to suicide fears. His prosecution will occur at a later date. He is said to be the most important person facing charges, as he cleared the train to proceed when, in fact, the line was blocked.

<h1>New law to help asbestos sufferers in Victoria, Australia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20law%20to%20help%20asbestos%20sufferers%20in%20Victoria%2C%20Australia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

New legislation in &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; will provide for greater compensation for victims suffering from effects of exposure to &lt;a href="w%3AAsbestos"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt;. The legislation is called "Bernie Banton law", after the late campaigner for asbestos-related issues. The law will remove a restriction which prevented asbestos victims from making another claim after being diagnosed with a &lt;a href="w%3ATerminal%20illness"&gt;terminal illness&lt;/a&gt;. Banton contracted &lt;a href="w%3AMesothelioma"&gt;mesothelioma&lt;/a&gt; after working for the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;-based company &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Hardie"&gt;James Hardie&lt;/a&gt;, and died in 2007.
Prior to the Banton law victims of asbestos exposure could seek compensation for &lt;a href="w%3Aasbestosis"&gt;asbestosis&lt;/a&gt;, a disease resulting from exposure which causes &lt;a href="w%3ALung%20scarring"&gt;lung scarring&lt;/a&gt;, but were unable to seek compensation if they were later diagnosed with mesothelioma. 

Mesothelioma is a &lt;a href="w%3ACancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; which develops in the sac surrounding the &lt;a href="w%3APleura"&gt;lungs and chest cavity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APeritoneum"&gt;abdominal cavity&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="w%3APericardium"&gt;sac surrounding the heart&lt;/a&gt;. Patients with &lt;a href="w%3AMalignant%20mesothelioma"&gt;malignant mesothelioma&lt;/a&gt; generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed have six months to a year to live. Asbestos usage has been banned in Victoria, Australia since 2003.
&lt;a href="w%3APremiers%20of%20Victoria"&gt;Victorian Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Brumby"&gt;John Brumby&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the legislation, saying: "Victorian workers deserve fair compensation for illnesses and injuries they have received just by doing their job." Brumby acknowledged that Victoria had lagged behind other states in its asbestos compensation practices. "Allowing an exception to the normal rule that court-awarded compensation is final will allow compensation for the true effects of asbestos exposure," explained Brumby.

Bernie Banton's widow, Karen Banton, stood alongside John Brumby as the legislation was announced, and spoke out in favor of the law. "The uncertainty that these Victorian families have suffered up until this point, the dilemma of whether I claim and whether I wait ... it would be a terrible choice to have to make," she said. She said her late husband would have been honored by the legislation's passage, and was appreciative that his name was associated with the cause of justice in the country. "I'm sure Bernie's looking down from heaven, feeling very honoured and humbled that his name continues to be associated with the fight to correct injustice," she said.
The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and the Victorian Trades Hall Council supported the legislation's passage, as did Martin Kingham of the Asbestos Diseases Society of Victoria. Kingham said that in the past asbestos sufferers were wary about whether or not to make a claim: "They've had to gamble on whether to make a claim now and to cut off any compensation for more serious fatal illness or to, basically, sit it out and wait and see what happens to them and potentially not getting compensated for their original asbestosis." 

"There's a lot of asbestos around, this is a live issue for the community and we strongly welcome this initiative," said Australian Manufacturing Workers Union Victorian secretary Steve Dargavel. Victorian Trades Hall Council secretary Brian Boyd called the legislation "a good and decent thing" but said more action was needed to better protect asbestos victims' families. The additional claims are expected to help approximately 50 people each year. The legislation will be introduced in the State Parliament next year.

Individuals from the group &lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt; have held monthly international protests against the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; since February, as part of the anti-Scientology movement &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Chanology"&gt;Project Chanology&lt;/a&gt;. The Project Chanology movement began when the Church of Scientology attempted to get a leaked Scientology promotional video featuring &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; removed from websites &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt;. 

Members of Anonymous were motivated by the actions of the Church of Scientology, and bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10, March 15, April 12, and most recently May 10. 
City of London Police approached the 15-year-old boy at the May 10 protest and cited section five of the &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Order%20Act%201986"&gt;Public Order Act 1986&lt;/a&gt;, which deals with "&lt;a href="w%3AHarassment%2C%20alarm%20or%20distress"&gt;harassment, alarm or distress&lt;/a&gt;". In response, the boy cited a 1984 judgment given by Mr. Justice Latey in the Family Division of the &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;High Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ACourts%20of%20England%20and%20Wales"&gt;Her Majesty's Courts of Justice of England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;, in which Latey called Scientology a "cult" and said it was "corrupt, sinister and dangerous". In the actual 1984 judgment made by Judge Latey, he stated: "Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious. [...] In my judgement it is corrupt, sinister and dangerous. [...] It is dangerous because it is out to capture people, especially children and impressionable young people, and indoctrinate and brainwash them so that they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from ordinary thought, living and relationships with others." The boy told fellow protesters he was not going to take the sign down, saying: "If I don't take the word 'cult' down, here [holding up his sign], I will be either, I think, most likely arrested or [given] a summons. I am going to fight this and not take it down because I believe in freedom of speech, besides which I'm only fifteen."
When the boy refused to take his sign down, City of London Police removed it, cited him with a court summons and informed him that the matter would be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. The boy was the only protester who did not comply with the police requests to remove signs which referred to Scientology as a "cult". According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a CPS spokesman stated Friday that: "In consultation with the City of London police, we were asked whether the sign, which read 'Scientology is not a religion it is a dangerous cult', was abusive or insulting. Our advice is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness, as opposed to criticism, neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression. No action will be taken against the individual."

"The CPS review of the case includes advice on what action or behaviour at a demonstration might be considered to be threatening, abusive or insulting. The force's policing of future demonstrations will reflect this advice," said a spokeswoman for the City of London Police in a statement in ♡❤The Guardian♡❤. 

The 15-year-old boy's mother called the CPS decision a "victory for free speech", saying: "We're all incredibly proud of him. We advised him to take the placard down when we realised what was happening but he said 'No, it's my opinion and I have a right to express it'."

The incident has generated significant interest on the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20rights"&gt;civil rights&lt;/a&gt; groups and anti-cult groups, and in the press. &lt;a href="w%3AShami%20Chakrabarti"&gt;Shami Chakrabarti&lt;/a&gt;, director of Liberty, and Ian Haworth of the United Kingdom-based &lt;a href="w%3ACult%20Information%20Centre"&gt;Cult Information Centre&lt;/a&gt; were highly critical of the actions of the City of London Police. George Pitcher of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ called the actions of the City of London Police "a mockery of the law". Other publications also criticized the actions of the police, compared the boy to past &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20rights"&gt;civil rights&lt;/a&gt; protesters, and analyzed how the characterization of "cult" applied to Scientology. ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ reported that human rights activists "were outraged" when reports of the actions of the City of London Police at the protest surfaced this week. Marina Hyde wrote in a comment piece in ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ that the City of London Police should spend a little less time "reaching for the collar of free-speaking children". An article in ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ about the boy's court summons hit the front page of the website &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, and an article about the statement by CPS hit the site's front page on Friday. The anti-Scientology website Enturbulation.org devoted its front page to the incident on Saturday.
♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that attorneys for Liberty represented the 15-year-old boy to the CPS. In media statements Friday, Liberty said it would continue its inquiry into the actions of the City of London Police. "The police may have ended their inquiries into this tawdry incident but rest assured that Liberty's inquiry will continue. Democracy is all about clashing ideas and the police should protect peaceful protest, not stifle it," said James Welch, legal director at Liberty. "Reason has prevailed in the case of the anti-Scientology protester", wrote Welch in a comment piece in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Observer"&gt;The Observer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Press%20Association"&gt;The Press Association&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Liberty's inquiry may result in actions taken against the City of London Police.
The City of London Police has faced controversy in the past for its close association with the Church of Scientology. When the City of London Scientology building opened in 2006, City of London Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley praised Scientology in an appearance as guest speaker at the building's opening ceremony. Ken Stewart, another of the City of London's chief superintendents, has also appeared in a video praising Scientology. According to ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ over 20 officers for the City of London Police have accepted gifts from the Church of Scientology including tickets to film premieres, lunches and concerts at police premises. 

Unlike the City of London Police, the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan Police Service&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="w%3Aterritorial%20police%20force"&gt;territorial police force&lt;/a&gt; responsible for &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20London"&gt;Greater London&lt;/a&gt; excluding the &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20London"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt;) has not raised an issue with protesters using placards with similar wording at protests against Scientology, according to ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ and ♡❤Londonist♡❤.

Each of the Project Chanology international protests against Scientology has had a theme: the February protest called attention to the birthday of &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20McPherson"&gt;Lisa McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, who died under controversial circumstances while under the care of Scientology, the March protest was arranged to take place two days after Scientology founder &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;'s birthday, the April protest highlighted the Church of Scientology's &lt;a href="w%3ADisconnection"&gt;disconnection policy&lt;/a&gt;, and the May protest highlighted the Scientology practice of "&lt;a href="w%3AFair%20Game%20%28Scientology%29"&gt;Fair Game&lt;/a&gt;" and took place one day after the anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADianetics%3A%20The%20Modern%20Science%20of%20Mental%20Health"&gt;Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Another international protest is planned for June 14, and will highlight the Church of Scientology's elite "&lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Org"&gt;Sea Organization&lt;/a&gt;" or "Sea Org".

<h1>Court rules against Texas officials in FLDS case</h1>

An &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Courts%20of%20Appeals"&gt;appeals court&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; has ruled that Texas &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20Protective%20Services"&gt;Child Protective Services&lt;/a&gt; should not have taken the children from the &lt;a href="w%3AFundamentalist%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-Day%20Saints"&gt;Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints&lt;/a&gt; (FLDS) compound as they were unable to prove that the children in the compound were at risk of immediate physical harm.

401 allegedly abused children were taken into state custody last month after officials received a call from a distressed 16-year-old girl. The children were found in a 1700-acre compound belonging to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It is now believed that the original phone call was actually a hoax.
Police were monitoring the compound ever since it was bought by the group one year ago. According to Texas law there must have been "a danger to the physical health or safety of the child which was caused by an act or failure to act of the person entitled to possession and for the child to remain in the home is contrary to the welfare of the child". 

In addition to the above there must also be "the urgent need for protection required the immediate removal of the child and reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, were made to eliminate or prevent the child’s removal"

Finally, for state custody to be allowed there must also have been "reasonable efforts have been made to enable the child to return home". A lower court was given 10 days to make a decision on whether the above requirements are met. Although originally the mothers were allowed to stay with the children, they are not required to be separate unless the parents are aged under eighteen or the children are very young. The FLDS said in an open letter to the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Texas"&gt;Governor of Texas&lt;/a&gt; that a "critical crisis" was unfolding due to these recent incidents. 

The Texas courts system released documents on its website regarding the recent decision. It said that: "the only danger to the male children or the female children who had not reached puberty identified by the Department was the Department’s assertion that the pervasive belief system of the FLDS community groomed the males to be perpetrators of sexual abuse later in life and taught the girls to submit to sexual abuse after reaching puberty."

The document also noted that: "There was no evidence that the male children, or the female children who had not reached puberty, were victims of sexual or other physical abuse or in danger of being victims of sexual or other physical abuse." The website reported that: "While there was evidence that twenty females had become pregnant between the ages of thirteen and seventeen, there was no evidence regarding the marital status of these girls when they became pregnant or the circumstances under which they became pregnant other than the general allegation that the girls were living in an FLDS community with a belief system that condoned underage marriage and sex."

The report claimed there were five possible cases of abuse, "There was no evidence that any of the female children other than the five identified as having become pregnant between the ages of fifteen and seventeen were victims or potential victims of sexual or other physical abuse".

In addition to Texas, the group has compounds in &lt;a href="w%3AHildale"&gt;Hildale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMancos"&gt;Mancos&lt;/a&gt; and many other locations. The church has around 10,000 members in total, and was founded in the 1930s. The church split from the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints"&gt;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; due to the fact that it abandoned &lt;a href="w%3Apolygamy"&gt;polygamy&lt;/a&gt;.

The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is led by &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Jeffs"&gt;Warren Jeffs&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; jailed last year for the rape and forced marriage of a 14 year old girl &amp;ndash; is a breakaway branch of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt;, which abandoned the practice of polygamy in 1890.

According to spokesmen for the church, also called the Mormon Church or LDS Church, President Bush will meet with the three-member &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Presidency%20%28LDS%20Church%29"&gt;First Presidency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which includes the new president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20S.%20Monson"&gt;Thomas S. Monson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Monson became the 16th president of the Mormon Church in early February after the death of the previous president, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20B.%20Hinckley"&gt;Gordon B. Hinckley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

This is President Bush's first visit with the new First Presidency leadership since the death of former president Hinckley. Bush last met with the three Mormon Church leaders when he was in Utah for a speech at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Legion"&gt;American Legion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; convention in August 2006. 

According to ♡❤Deseret News♡❤ President Bush will attend a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 70,100-a-couple fundraiser and reception at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADeer%20Valley"&gt;Deer Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; home of &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;, and may potentially stay overnight at Romney's vacation home. Money from the reception will go into a joint fund-raising account called McCain Victory 2008.

"Romney had a very powerful fundraising operation with a lot of donations coming out of this area, and of course now he can leverage that to help McCain," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrigham%20Young%20University"&gt;Brigham Young University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20science"&gt;political science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; professor Quin Monson in a statement in ♡❤The Salt Lake Tribune♡❤.

♡❤The Salt Lake Tribune♡❤ reports that statements from McCain's campaign show he raised $502,650 from Utah donors through the end of April. Romney had raised $5.5 million before dropping out of the Republican primary for the presidential nomination and subsequently endorsed McCain. Romney is the former governor of &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, and headed the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Winter%20Olympic%20Games"&gt;2002 Winter Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Utah.

Vancouver Whitecaps lost their 2 game of the season after losing 2-0 to Seattle Sounders on last night.Seattle effectively took control of the Interstate 5 derby after early goals from Josh Gardner and Sebastien Le Toux.

Whitecaps fans were left in shock after only 7 minutes, as Seattle "blitzed" the home-side with two quick goals in the opening exchanges.

It took just 3 minutes for the Sounders to score the opening goal, as Gardner got on the end of a Le Toux through ball before hitting the shot past a diving Whitecaps goalkeeper Srdjan Djekanovic to give the Seattle the lead.

Seattle extended their lead through the reigning Player of the Year in Le Toux on 7 minutes with a right-footed shot that went past the diving Whitecaps goalkeeper Srdjan Djekanovic.

Whitecaps centre back Omar Jarun underlined the disappointment of his team's start. "The first few minutes were an absolute disaster from us defensively," he told whitecapsfc.com. "We came out flat, and that's disappointing because everything we put into this game in terms of preparation went to waste. It's hard to keep the team's head up after something like that. But tomorrow is another day, and hopefully we can put this defeat out of the way in Portland. Like Seattle, they are another good team, and if do not come out ready to play, it will be another nightmare."

Schmetzer was naturally delighted with the way his side claimed an important away victory in Vancouver. "I think we played well," he said. "When you get a couple of early goals, you are in control of the game. With both goals, we were able to dictate the pace of the game."

The 1 half ended with jeers from the home crowd.

A host of substitutions ensued early in the 2 half, with Arze, Justin Moose, and Jason Jordan all replacing Valente, Donatelli, and Addlery, as Vancouver tried to bring some spark to what had been a below-par Whitecaps performance.

There was also a Whitecaps debut for new signing Chris Pozniak, as he replaced centre back Omar Jarun on the hour mark. "Give credit to Seattle tonight," Pozniak said of the defeat. "They were the better team over the 90 minutes. They are so well organized, and I tried to speed up the play when I came in, but it didn't work. With the game tomorrow night, it might better for us mentally to get another crack at playing and show that we are better than the performance tonight."

As the match entered the five minutes of time added on, a deflected shot from Pozniak was the extent of Vancouver's efforts to pull a goal back before the final whistle, as Seattle ran out comfortable winners in the end.

&lt;a href="Chelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea F.C.&lt;/a&gt; fired Manager Avram Grant today. This comes three days after Chelsea lost to &lt;a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C."&gt;Manchester United F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow. Grant's tenure has been scrutinized ever since he took over for Jose Mourinho last September.

Despite the constant questioning of his appointment as Manager of the first team, he was able to guide Chelsea F.C. in taking Manchester United to the final day of the Premier League title race after going level on points and narrowly missing out on European glory on penalties. The club only lost two Premier League matches during his tenure, but he was criticised by fans who claimed that his teams lacked style.

A statement on the club read: "'Chelsea Football Club can confirm that Avram Grant has had his contract as manager terminated today. This follows meetings over the last two days," "Everybody at Chelsea FC would like to thank Avram for his contribution since taking over as manager last September," and "We will now be concentrating all our efforts on identifying a new manager for Chelsea and there will be no further comment until that appointment is made."

Former Barcelona Head Coach Frank Rijkaard, Inter Milan Head Coach Roberto Mancini and Russia Head Coach Guus Hiddink have all been linked to the position at Chelsea F.C.

Author &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Asprin"&gt;Robert Asprin&lt;/a&gt; died Thursday in his &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; home at the age of 61. Asprin, known for his science fiction and fantasy novels including the &lt;a href="w%3AMythAdventures"&gt;MythAdventures&lt;/a&gt; series, and &lt;a href="w%3AThieves%27%20World"&gt;Thieves World&lt;/a&gt; series of &lt;a href="w%3Ashared%20world"&gt;shared world&lt;/a&gt; anthologies which he created and edited with his then-wife, , was also known by his &lt;a href="w%3ASociety%20for%20Creative%20Anachronism"&gt;The Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (SCA) nickname of "Yang the Nauseating".

Asprin had been scheduled to appear as a keynote guest at the Multiple Alternative Realities Convention (MARCON) in Columbus, Ohio, over the weekend, and his body was discovered by an SCA friend who had come to pick him up to take him to the airport.

He is survived by his mother, sister, son, daughter, and cat, Princess. According to his wishes, a gathering at Fahy's Pub in the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Quarter"&gt;French Quarter&lt;/a&gt; will be held tonight in lieu of a formal memorial service.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; airframer &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; has announced that development of a replacement for their &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737&lt;/a&gt; narrowbody airliner, begun two years ago, has been pushed back several years, Boeing saying that further advancement of technology is required.

Spokeswoman Sandy Angers said that that the team formed to look at the development had been merged into the parent product development team and would cease looking at specific designs. Boeing say airlines demand performance improvements of 15-20% are required if a new airliner is to be commercially viable.

"We've reduced our airplane-design effort and are focusing more on the technology breakthroughs," said Angers. "We need technology breakthroughs in engines, aerodynamics, materials and other systems. You can't simply shrink the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20787"&gt;787&lt;/a&gt; and expect the same benefits for the narrow-body market. We've got difficult challenges."

One important difference is that the plastic composite used for the fuselage of the 787 would not offer as significant a weight saving on a smaller aircraft. The delivery date for the plane is now anticipated to be around 2020, and not 2015 as previously hoped. This coincides with the expected date for &lt;a href="Airbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; to deliver their &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A320"&gt;A320&lt;/a&gt; replacement. Industry analysts predict development of one to trigger development of the other. Boeing had hoped to have their's ready for 2012.

Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Scott Carson said "We're continuing our research effort until we find the right solution. It has to be a 25-year product."

Since its 1967 debut 5,700 737s have been deliverd to date, with orders for 2,200 more, keeping the jet in production until at least 2014. It is Boeing's most popular airliner.

&lt;a href="w%3ASquash"&gt;Squash&lt;/a&gt; is among the seven sports considered for new events in the &lt;a href="2016%20Olympics"&gt;2016 Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. The other nominated sports are &lt;a href="w%3Abaseball"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Agolf"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Akarate"&gt;karate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aroller%20sports"&gt;roller sports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARugby"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASoftball"&gt;softball&lt;/a&gt;. Of these, four were nominated for the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%202012%20Olympics"&gt;London 2012 Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, but none were chosen. 

At the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IOC) session in Singapore 2005, squash won the vote to get into the Olympic program, but did not get the 2/3 majority needed for adoption. The new sports for 2016 are baseball and softball, with baseball having been in the Olympics before as a "test" sport, however it did not succeed and was only on the program for one event before it was removed.

Squash is among the favourites because it already in 2005 proved to be favourite for the IOC members at that time. Since 2005, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Squash%20Federation"&gt;World Squash Federation&lt;/a&gt; (WSF), there has been a lot of work to get squash into the Olympic Games. A marked rise in players across the world has occurred, and approximately 13 new countries have been adopted into the WSF.

However, baseball is also considered among the favourites, because it has been tried before and because it is a major sport in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and growing in the rest of the world. Notably, &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%202016%20Olympic%20bid"&gt;bidding&lt;/a&gt; to host the 2016 Olympics, and therefore a major US sport could be the natural choice. 

The last of the three favourites is golf, because it is by far the most played sport of the candidates. However, it is seen as a disadvantage that the Olympic tournament may not be the top priority for the players, who may feel they would rather concentrate on the US or &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; tours.

<h1>South Africa's largest weekly newspaper wants President Mbeki to resign</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=South%20Africa%27s%20largest%20weekly%20newspaper%20wants%20President%20Mbeki%20to%20resign&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A front page editorial in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s largest weekly newspaper, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sunday%20Times%20%28South%20Africa%29"&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, criticizes President &lt;a href="w%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt;'s "incompetent" handling of the country's ongoing anti-immigrant violence, and urges him to resign from office.

"Either he will not lead or he cannot lead. Whichever is the case, the conclusion is the same: he must go," the editorial reads. "And so we appeal to President Mbeki: Stand down in the interests of your country."

In the past two weeks, mob attacks against foreigners have spread across the capital of &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding cities. The foreigners, many of whom have come from neighboring &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;, are being blamed for South Africa's rising crime rates and job shortages.

Violence has now been reported in seven of South Africa's nine provinces. Police have reported at least 50 deaths as a result of the violence, and ♡❤The Sunday Times♡❤ reports that around 44,000 have been displaced from their homes. An estimated 700 people have been arrested, police say.
On Wednesday, Mbeki deployed the National Defence Force in an effort to quell the violent situation. This was, ♡❤The Sunday Times♡❤ says, "an admission that things were out of control." But the newspaper criticizes Mbeki for proceeding to go about "business as usual", by attending events such as a meeting with business leaders and the restoration of a school.

"Throughout this crisis — arguably the most grave, dark and repulsive moment in the life of our young nation — Mbeki has demonstrated that he no longer has the heart to lead," ♡❤The Sunday Times♡❤ says.

Although Mbeki has spoken out against the violence, he has been criticized for not visiting any of the affected areas or addressing the entire nation about the crisis. Mbeki seeks to remedy this with a nationally televised address scheduled for Sunday night.

Other calls for Mbeki's resignation have come from the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMail%20%26amp%3B%20Guardian"&gt;Mail &amp; Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper and the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Alliance%20%28South%20Africa%29"&gt;Democratic Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, South Africa's main opposition party.

If Mbeki were to resign, he would be temporarily replaced by deputy president &lt;a href="w%3APhumzile%20Mlambo-Ngcuka"&gt;Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka&lt;/a&gt;, until the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20of%20South%20Africa"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; would meet to vote for a new president who would serve the rest of Mbeki's term. 

If Mbeki doesn't resign, ♡❤The Sunday Times♡❤ warns that he could be dismissed with a two-thirds vote of Parliament. In this case, Mbeki's cabinet would also be forced to resign. The office of President would be held by &lt;a href="w%3ABaleka%20Mbete"&gt;Baleka Mbete&lt;/a&gt;, the Speaker of the National Assembly, until a new election was held.

<h1>Boeing 747 cargo plane breaks in two after failed takeoff at Brussels Airport</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Boeing%20747%20cargo%20plane%20breaks%20in%20two%20after%20failed%20takeoff%20at%20Brussels%20Airport&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; cargo plane has broken in two after crashing off the end of the runway at &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels%20Airport"&gt;Brussels Airport&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AZaventem"&gt;Zaventem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Some reports say four of the five crew were slightly injured when the &lt;a href="w%3AKallita%20Air"&gt;Kallita Air&lt;/a&gt; jumbo jet failed to takeoff on a flight to &lt;a href="Bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, but others state no injuries.

Press images show the aircraft, which did not catch fire, broken immediately behind the wings, with the forward section level and the front end of the back section raised in the air. The right hand door has been opened and the emergency evacuation slide deployed by the crew, one of whom is in a state of &lt;a href="w%3AShock%20%28circulatory%29"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt;. The area around the plane's wings was doused with specialist fire retardant foam as the tanks were full of fuel for the journey.

The force of the crash at 1:30 p.m. local time today sent the plane 300 meters beyond the end of the runway. Air operations have continued as normal on the airport's two other runways, but a nearby railway line is closed. Reports of the cargo on board vary, with one news agency reporting 70 tons of diplomatic mail, batteries and a car, while other reports state 76 tons of unspecified cargo.

It is unclear what caused the accident, but the pilot reported hearing a loud noise as the aircraft attempted to takeoff. Weather conditions were clear, and the airport had seen some light rain in earlier this morning.

Kalitta is a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; based carrier founded in 2000 by Conrad Kalitta with three 747s and now owns 18 including the one involved in today's accident.

It became the first time in the 23 year old Briton's career in F1. Last year, he finished in second place after his former teammate &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;. In this race Alonso finished on a distant 10th place in his &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; car. The last British winner at Monaco was &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGraham%20Hill"&gt;Graham Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A1969%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt;. Rain over the weekend causes a wet start to the Sunday race, causing driver mistakes, however no rain fell during the race or qualifying.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt; finished behind Hamilton, after gaining 3 positions since the race start. Strategists at &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; underestimated the weather condition and the pace of their McLaren and BMW rivals, so &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; dropped to the third place starting from the brilliant &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Apole"&gt;pole&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAdrian%20Sutil"&gt;Adrian Sutil&lt;/a&gt; was set to win 4th place until he was hit in the rear by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt;, who lost control of his car while braking at the chicane after the tunnel. Räikkönen himself dropped from 5th to 9th place and Sutil was out of the race. Sutil qualified only 19th only ahead his &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AForce%20India"&gt;Force India&lt;/a&gt; teammate &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt;. Later Sutil was warned by the race stewards that he overtook other cars (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARubens%20Barrichello"&gt;Rubens Barrichello&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKazuki%20Nakajima"&gt;Kazuki Nakajima&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANelson%20Piquet%20Jr."&gt;Nelson Piquet Jr.&lt;/a&gt;) on lap 13 under a waived yellow flags condition, but went unpunished.
Australian driver &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMark%20Webber"&gt;Mark Webber&lt;/a&gt; secured 4th for &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt;-Renault after Sutil and Räikkönen collided. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASebastian%20Vettel"&gt;Sebastian Vettel&lt;/a&gt; scored his first points in 2008 season as the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AScuderia%20Toro%20Rosso"&gt;Toro Rosso&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASTR3"&gt;STR3&lt;/a&gt; car debut. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARubens%20Barrichello"&gt;Rubens Barrichello&lt;/a&gt; made 6th for &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHonda%20Racing%20F1"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;.

This race became the 600th race for &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrank%20Williams"&gt;Frank Williams&lt;/a&gt; as his team's young driver &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKazuki%20Nakajima"&gt;Kaz Nakajima&lt;/a&gt; scored 2 points. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt;, Hamilton's teammate closed top eight with one additional point.

Lewis Hamilton is now leading the Championship with 38 points, 3 ahead of Räikkönen, 4 ahead of Massa and 6 ahead of Kubica. Ferrari team still 16 points ahead of McLaren and 17 points ahead of BMW.

The race finished about 43 seconds after 2 hour limit expired.

&lt;a href="w%3AJ.%20R.%20Simplot"&gt;J. R. Simplot&lt;/a&gt;, french fry "king" &amp; founder of the &lt;a href="w%3ASimplot"&gt;J. R. Simplot Company&lt;/a&gt;, an agricultural supplier specializing in potato products has died today in &lt;a href="w%3ABoise%2C%20Idaho"&gt;Boise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Idaho"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;. He was 99 years old.

He was born John Richard "Jack" Simplot on January 4, 1909 in Dubuque, Iowa, United States. By &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the J. R. Simplot Company had become the largest shipper of fresh potatoes in the nation. By the early 1960s it was the primary supplier of french fries to &lt;a href="McDonald%27s"&gt;McDonald's&lt;/a&gt;; by 2005 it supplied more than half of all french fries for the fast food chain. Simplot also produced fertilizers for agriculture.

In 1961, Simplot financed the &lt;a href="w%3ABrundage%20Mountain%20ski"&gt;Brundage Mountain ski area&lt;/a&gt; area near &lt;a href="w%3AMcCall%2CIdaho"&gt;McCall&lt;/a&gt;, two hours north of Boise. The Simplot Company sold its 50% interest in Brundage in April 2006 to the longtime co-owner, the DeBoer family.

Simplot is survived by his wife, Esther.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%27s%20Phoenix%20spacecraft%20lands%20safely%20on%20Mars&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft has landed safely on &lt;a href="Mars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;, following a ten-month flight. Landing occurred yesterday evening at around 23:38 GMT (20:38 EDT), with confirmation being received by flight controllers around fifteen minutes later at 23:53, the communications delay due to the time taken for light and radio signals to travel from Mars back to Earth.

Phoenix was launched atop a &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20II"&gt;Delta II&lt;/a&gt; rocket last August. It is the first &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Scout"&gt;Mars Scout&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft to be sent to explore Mars. It will search for water and complex molecules at the North Pole of Mars. It is the third spacecraft currently operating on Mars, joining the &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Expedition%20Rover"&gt;Mars Expedition Rover&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href="w%3ASpirit%20rover"&gt;♡❤Spirit♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOpportunity"&gt;♡❤Opportunity♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which are currently operating on the planet's surface. Phoenix is expected to operate on the surface of Mars for 90 Martian days, about 92 Earth days.

Scientists monitoring the landing at the &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; cheered as the news was transmitted by the spacecraft, saying it had landed safely.

According to the live broadcast on NASA TV, a systems check began in final preparation for landing at 22:20 GMT (7:20 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;) which was given the "all green". At 22:22, Phoenix was confirmed to be properly aligned for entry into the Martian atmosphere. At 22:30 Phoenix began to accelerate into the atmosphere, where it will hurtle towards the planet at nearly 11,000 miles an hour. At 22:41 the data stream was successfully sent to Earth, Phoenix successfully separated from its boosters and sent a UHF signal to NASA. At 22:44 its main radio was confirmed to be on.

Scientists monitoring the MRO then confirmed the signal from Phoenix at 22:45. Approximately 3 minutes later Phoenix was confirmed to have entered the Martian atmosphere.
According to predictions before the landing - based on the sequence of events programmed into onboard computers - the cruise stage, which had controlled the spacecraft during its journey from Earth to Mars, separated from the probe which was to enter the atmosphere at 23:24:15 GMT. Entry interface occurred at 23:31:15, and the parachute deployed at 23:34:58. The heat shield was jettisoned at 23:35:13, followed by the rest of the "aeroshell", which had protected the spacecraft during decent, and the parachute, at 23:37:13. Landing itself occurred at 23:38:36 GMT.

During descent, the spacecraft's progress was monitored by the &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter"&gt;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20Mars%20Odyssey"&gt;2001 Mars Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft, already in Areocentric orbit. Mars Odyssey was in contact with Phoenix throughout the descent, including during the phase of the descent where maximum temperatures were reached, when controllers had predicted that data would be lost. The HiRISE camera on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to photograph ♡❤Phoenix♡❤ under its parachute during descent.

Phoenix's goal is to gather environmental information about Mars to search for possible locations for the best signs of microbial life in the soil. It will also research the history of water on Mars. The mission is scheduled to last for at least 92 &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; days, or 90 Martian days.

The spacecraft landed in an area near the North Pole of Mars, unofficially named the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Green%20Valley%20%28Mars%29"&gt;Green Valley&lt;/a&gt;. It is an area about 250 kilometres wide, located in the &lt;a href="w%3AVastitas%20Borealis"&gt;Vastitas Borealis&lt;/a&gt; plains.

Phoenix is carrying a number of instruments to investigate Mars. Some of these were taken from the cancelled &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Surveyor%202001%20Lander"&gt;2001 Mars Surveyor&lt;/a&gt; lander, and some others were derived from instruments flown on the &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Polar%20Lander"&gt;Mars Polar Lander&lt;/a&gt; (MPL) spacecraft. MPL was launched in January 1999, but failed during its descent to the Martian surface. Landing on Mars is considered to be one of the most difficult challenges in space exploration, and one scientist working on today's landing said that "this is not a trip to Grandma's for the weekend". More than half of previous missions to Mars have failed, leading to jokes that exploration of the planet is cursed.

This is the 38 spacecraft to be launched to Mars, and the 19 to arrive successfully, bringing the success rate to exactly 50 percent. It is also the 12 spacecraft to attempt a landing on Mars, and the 7 to successfully accomplish this.

Upon confirmation of landing, a flight controller was heard to exclaim "The Phoenix has landed, welcome to Vastitas Borealis!", whilst others cheered, and congratulated each other on the successful landing.

2008 COMPUTEX Taipei, the largest &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20fair"&gt;trade fair&lt;/a&gt; since its inception in 1982, featured several seminars and forums, expansions on show spaces to &lt;a href="TWTC%20Nangang"&gt;TWTC Nangang&lt;/a&gt;, great transformations for theme pavilions, and WiMAX Taipei Expo, mainly promoted by Taipei Computer Association (TCA). Besides of &lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20communication%20technology"&gt;ICT&lt;/a&gt; industry, "design" progressively became the critical factor for the future of the other industries. To promote innovative "Made In &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;" products, pavilions from "Best Choice of COMPUTEX", "Taiwan Excellence Awards", and newly-set "Design and Innovation (d &amp; i) Award of COMPUTEX", demonstrated the power of Taiwan's designs in 2008 COMPUTEX Taipei.

<h2>Best Choice of COMPUTEX: Arrangements without fair judgments?</h2>
"Best Choice of COMPUTEX", designed to encourage technological innovation in the &lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20communication%20technology"&gt;ICT&lt;/a&gt; industry and help companies expand their export markets, is the 7th-annual holding by TCA since 2002. Different than past years, not only the professional juries will decide the best thirty-nines (including Special Award from Juries, Best Choices of the Year from Overseas and Domestic Enterprises) from nominated 125 products in the second runoffs.

Finally, thirty-eight winning products including three products from Jury's Special Award and one from Best Choice of the Year from Domestic Enterprise, but winner from Best Choice of the Year from Overseas Enterprise wasn't awarded. With this incident, some overseas exhibitors disputed the profession of this class and appealed the organizer to do necessary modifications for different classes next year.

<h2>d &amp; i Award, first-ever award to promote "Design"</h2>
"d &amp; i Award of COMPUTEX", a newly-created award by &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;Taiwan External Trade Development Council&lt;/a&gt; (TAITRA) and &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Forum%20Design"&gt;International Forum Design&lt;/a&gt; (iF) to discover innovative, applicative, and creative products, showcased a significant differences than the "Best Choice of COMPUTEX".

According to TAITRA, professional juries including Christoph Böninger (brains4design GmbH), Duck Hsieh (Duck Image Corporation), James Irvine (James Irvine S.r.l.), Kris Verstockt (Cre8 design studio), and Roger Pin-Si Lin (Nova Design Co., Ltd.), adjudicated the final seventeens (including the final four gold awards) from 139 entries submitted by 67 contestants from 5 countries based on the criteria of "Degree of innovation", "Design quality", "Workmanship", "Choice of materials", "Environmental friendliness", "Functionality", "Ergonomics", "Utility value", "Safety", "Universal design", and "Brand value/Branding".

Besides the Design and Innovation Award, whose rich achievements were established from several international design awards by companies in Taiwan, the Taiwan Design Center, set to promote the design and cultural industries in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, held the "2008 Design Think Forum" entitled "Design for next Billion Customers" to prospect the future of the design industry worldwide.

<h2>"Taiwan Excellence Awards": MIT products shining in the world.</h2>

"Taiwan Excellence Awards", created to promote products made in Taiwan, announced its winners from Gold and Silver Award classes prior to the show on May 22. This year, 388 ICT products participated in this competition and the ICT industry scored a better performance with 6 Golds and 14 Silvers in the final jury. It not only showcased a significant improvement but also symbolized the ICT industry in Taiwan as a stable industrial position in the presence.

Bayer Leverkusen has appointed SpVgg Greuther Fürth Head Coach Bruno Labbadia as the club's new Head Coach. Michael Skibbe was fired last week after failing to qualify for a European competition. Labbadia signed a 2-year contract.

Bruno Labbadia scored 103 goals in 328 Bundesliga games while playing as a forward for Bayern München, Werder Bremen and Hamburger SV.

Labbadia led Greuther Fürth to 6 place in the 2 division in the 2007/08 season.

A fire and string of explosions at a chemical factory in &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; have killed at least 30 people. State news agency says at least 38 more are injured at the facility near &lt;a href="w%3AShazand"&gt;Shazand&lt;/a&gt; in the industrial province of &lt;a href="w%3AMarkazi"&gt;Markazi&lt;/a&gt;.

IRNA reports that a 60,000 litre chemical reservoir exploded to trigger the disaster, which may have been caused by nearby welding work.

23 of the injured people are reported to have sustained burns across 70-100% of their body. It is unclear what was manufactured at the factory, with &lt;a href="w%3ARTE"&gt;RTE&lt;/a&gt; reporting that it was a pharmaceutical plant, and &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt; saying the site was used to produce cosmetics and detergent.

Local officials say the property has been almost completely destroyed, but the fire has been brought under control. The fire had rapidly spread from the building of origin to the rest of the complex, leaving roofs caving in and many vehicles burnt out. Some of the dead are charred beyond recognition.

All seven on board a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AAntonov"&gt;Antonov&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAntonov%20An-12"&gt;An-12&lt;/a&gt; have been killed after the plane crashed near the &lt;a href="w%3ASiberia"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;n city of &lt;a href="w%3AChelyabinsk"&gt;Chelyabinsk&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AMoskovia%20Airlines"&gt;Moskovia Airlines&lt;/a&gt; plane had left the city's airport empty and was destined for &lt;a href="w%3APerm"&gt;Perm&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUral%20Mountains"&gt;Ural Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.

An emergency ministry spokeswoman, Natalya Andryanova, said on state TV "The pilot told ground control that there was smoke in the cockpit and he decided to return to the airport. The plane crashed as he was coming in for landing." The plane is reported to have gone down in forest about a dozen miles from the city at about 6 p.m. According to regional emergency official Vyacheslav Latunkin, the plane hit a power line.

The An-12 is a large, four-engined cargo turboprop that can carry 20 tons and was designed in the 1950s. Large numbers were sold for use in both the military and civilian markets, and around 100 are still in service. &lt;a href="w%3ADmitry%20Medvedev"&gt;Dmitry Medvedev&lt;/a&gt; expressed his condolences and ordered Transport Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIgor%20Levitin"&gt;Igor Levitin&lt;/a&gt; to launch an inquiry. &lt;a href="w%3AInterfax"&gt;Interfax&lt;/a&gt; reports that a criminal investigation has also been launched into possible regulatory breaches.

Local resident Vladimir Zonov said wreckage was spread across 300 metres. He also said the plane crashed into a wheat field and not forest as otherwise reported.

Russian air safety is among the worst in the world, as is that of many former Soviet countries. Industry analysts blame poor pilot training, cost-reduction at the cost of safety and inadequate control by the government.

The &lt;a href="FIFA"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; Executive Committee decided to suspend the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Football%20Association"&gt;Football Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as of May 26, 2008, following government interference. The Iraqi Government dissolved the Iraqi National &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOlympics"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Committee and all national sport federations, including the Iraqi Football Association. The suspension for Iraq is from all tournaments for 12 months.

The FIFA Executive Committee will recommend the suspension to the FIFA Congress, which meets in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Friday, but left the door open for a reprieve if &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reversed its decision by May 29 at 4:00 PM Central European Time.

The suspension puts Iraq's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; qualification in doubt since qualification has already started for the region. Iraq was scheduled to play Australia in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Sunday then again in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; next week and if they miss those matches, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; would be given the points.

&lt;a href="w%3AViacom"&gt;Viacom Inc.&lt;/a&gt; is suing Google over 150,000 videos, for which Viacom owns the copyright, that were allegedly being shown on YouTube. Google has responded by saying that they followed the &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents companies from being prosecuted if they bring down copyrighted content as soon as they are made aware of it. "Viacom’s lawsuit challenges the protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that Congress enacted a decade ago to encourage the development of services like YouTube," said Google. "Congress recognized that such services could not and would not exist if they faced liability for copyright infringement based on materials users uploaded to their services. It chose to immunize these services from copyright liability provided they are properly responsive to notices of alleged infringement from content owners."

"Looking at the online world today, there is no question that Congress made the correct policy choice," Google continued. "Legitimate services like YouTube provide the world with free and authorized access to extraordinary libraries of information that would not be available without the DMCA -- information created by users who have every right to share it."

Google then claimed that "YouTube also fulfills its end of the DMCA bargain, and indeed goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works."

The long awaited browser is said to comply with &lt;a href="w%3AHTML"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACSS"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; standards. These are codes that are used to create the appearance and structure of a web page. Internet Explorer is notorious for not complying with these standards, so this release is expected to be an important release in its history. In beta 1, many websites have failed to display in the "IE8 standards mode," but many bug reports have been submitted to Microsoft regarding this issue, so rendering may improve.

The beta 2 release is expected to improve its standards compliant mode even more as well as adding a more customisable &lt;a href="w%3Agraphical%20user%20interface"&gt;graphical user interface&lt;/a&gt; that is expected to be similar to &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Office%202007"&gt;Microsoft Office 2007&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first version of Internet Explorer that will have this customisable interface.

The final version of Internet Explorer 8 is expected at the end of the year.

At the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Libertarian%20National%20Convention"&gt;2008 Libertarian Party National Convention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADenver"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; former &lt;a href="United%20States%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; Congressman &lt;a href="Bob%20Barr"&gt;Bob Barr&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;GA&lt;/a&gt;) was nominated as the presidential candidate for the &lt;a href="Libertarian%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt;. He served in Congress from 1995&amp;ndash;2003. 

Barr officially entered the race on May 12, two weeks before the convention amidst months of speculation. He won the nomination on the sixth ballot of the convention edging &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Ruwart"&gt;Mary Ruwart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 324&amp;ndash;276. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Allyn%20Root"&gt;Wayne Allyn Root&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was nominated as his running mate after losing on the fifth ballot and throwing his support to Barr. 

Barr's main opposition in the Libertarian race highlighted his vote in &lt;a href="United%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; in favor of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20PATRIOT%20Act"&gt;USA PATRIOT Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2001 following the &lt;a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;. He has since renounced the vote, and has worked to repeal the act. Barr's candidacy was also seen by Libertarian "radicals" as an attempt by conservatives to take over the party.

Following his nomination Barr remarked that he "will not let [the Libertarian Party] down" and that it "will be a historic and positive campaign that will succeed." To detractors who say he will take votes away from Republican candidate &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, Barr stated that "If Senator McCain ... does not succeed in winning the presidency ... it will be because Senator McCain did not present, and his party did not present, a vision, an agenda, a platform and a series of programs that actually resonated positively with the American people." Party spokesman Andrew Davis described the situation among the electorate as "want[ing] and need[ing] another choice" and stating that "that choice is Bob Barr."
Barr's nomination made former Alaskan senator &lt;a href="Mike%20Gravel"&gt;Mike Gravel&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; who recently switched from being a &lt;a href="United%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; candidate to a Libertarian candidate for President back on March 25, 2008 &amp;mdash; announce he is ending his political career.

Gravel said, "I just ended my political career, from 15 years old to now, my political career is over, and it's no big deal. I'm a writer, I'm a lecturer, I'm going to push the issues of freedom and liberty. I'm going to push those issues until the day I die."

A &lt;a href="w%3Akindergarten"&gt;kindergarten&lt;/a&gt; teacher in &lt;a href="w%3APort%20St.%20Lucie%2C%20Florida"&gt;Port St. Lucie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is being reassigned following an incident last week in which her students voted to remove a possibly &lt;a href="w%3Aautism"&gt;autistic&lt;/a&gt; child from the classroom.

According to school officials, Morningside Elementary School teacher Wendy Portillo held a vote in her kindergarten classroom concerning the removal of 5-year-old Alex Barton. The boy's mother, Melissa Barton, says her son is in the process of testing for &lt;a href="w%3AAsperger%27s%20syndrome"&gt;Asperger's syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a form of high-functioning autism which can impair social skills and behavior. She says that Alex has had disciplinary problems stemming from his condition. 

Alex's mother gave her account of the events. She said each of his classmates was allowed to say what they didn't like about him; this included comments such as "disgusting" and "annoying", Barton said. After that, the teacher held a vote in which the class voted out Alex by a margin of 14 to 2. "He was incredibly upset," she said. "The only friend he has ever made in his life was forced to do this." Barton says that after the vote, the teacher asked Alex how he felt, to which he replied, "I feel sad."
Alex then left the classroom and spent the rest of the day in the school nurse's office, his mother says. The nurse reportedly told Barton to talk with the child's teacher, who told the mother what had happened. Barton says her son will not be returning to Morningside Elementary anymore. "I'll never be able to send him to school again without worrying if something is going to happen," she said.

Barton says she is considering whether to file a lawsuit. The state attorney's office decided that no criminal charges would be filed, since the incident did not meet the criteria for emotional child abuse. But the school district is investigating Portillo's actions, says St. Lucie County School District spokeswoman Janice Karst, and it could be up to two weeks before a conclusion is reached.

After being contacted by Barton, the school's resource officer interviewed Portillo about the incident. According to police spokeswoman Michelle Steele, the teacher said Alex had been sent to the office earlier that day, and when he came back to class, Portillo asked the students if they were ready for him to return. She allegedly had told her class that the vote was part of a lesson on tallying.

Portillo, who has taught in St. Lucie County for 12 years, has been reassigned out of the classroom at the district offices for the time being. Alex's mother believes that Portillo has "no business being near children at all" and should be fired, calling her reassignment "just a slap in the face".

The school board has advised Portillo not to speak with the press.

A study by the non-profit organisation &lt;a href="w%3ASave%20the%20Children"&gt;Save the Children&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; claims that a number of aid workers and peacekeepers from organisations such as the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; and Save the Children itself have engaged in &lt;a href="w%3Asexual%20abuse"&gt;sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt; of children in the course of their humanitarian efforts. The study also says that many of these incidents remain unreported, and those involved often go unpunished.

The study was based on field data from &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ivory%20Coast"&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, where they held focus groups followed by in-depth interviews. In 20 of the 38 focus groups, United Nations representatives were the main perpetrators of sexual abuse, possibly due to the larger number of peacekeepers than aid workers, but 23 organisations were identified as being involved across the three countries. 

While 14 and 15 year olds were the most common victims, the study found cases of abuse in children as young as 6. Most offenders were men, and most of the victims were girls. One 14-year-old boy who works in a peacekeeping camp on the Ivory Coast told the study that "[o]ften it will be between eight and 10 men who will share two or three girls".

An "overwhelming" majority of those interviewed said they would never report a case of abuse, and did not know of anyone who had reported a case, despite more than half knowing of incidents of sexual abuse, and many knowing of 10 or more. The study reported that unless this silence was dealt with, any attempts to eliminate the abuse would be "fundamentally flawed".
In response to the study, United Nations Secretary-General &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-Moon"&gt;Ban Ki-Moon&lt;/a&gt; said that the organisation's policy on such abuse was "zero tolerance." The U.N. "will very carefully investigate and whenever there is necessary matters we will take necessary measures from this". Both Save the Children and the U.N. have pointed out that, while it does not reduce the seriousness of the offences, the offenders represent a small proportion of all peacekeepers and aid workers in foreign countries. As the U.N. does not have any prosecutory powers of its own, peacekeepers found to be involved in child sexual abuse are either fired or sent back to their home countries to face prosecution.

&lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Superb%20%28S109%29"&gt;HMS ♡❤Superb♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, a navy submarine from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, crashed into rocks in the northern half of the Red Sea on May 26. The UK &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; (MoD) released a statement saying, "there were no casualties and the submarine remains watertight, is safe on the surface and able to operate under its own power."

The MoD also said that "the submarine's nuclear reactor is completely unaffected, and there is no environmental impact."

&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; has reported that an investigation will be launched to discover the cause of the incident.

According to the MoD, "no other vessel, military or civil, was involved in the incident." The MoD has stated that the process of informing the relatives of the crew is underway.

A &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; state appeals court ruled Tuesday that fifteen &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; citizens can sue over claims of &lt;a href="health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; issues related to &lt;a href="w%3AAsbestos"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt; exposure while working aboard &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Navy"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; ships docked at &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;-Spanish military installations. The defendant, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;-based company &lt;a href="w%3AOwens-Illinois"&gt;Owens Illinois, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, had sought a trial in a Spanish court, an opinion which was shared by the Superior Court that had heard the case earlier. The three-judge panel appellate court overturned the decision of the Superior Court in a 3-0 ruling.
The Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim that they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois. The piping insulation was originally manufactured in &lt;a href="w%3ASayreville%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Sayreville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMiddlesex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Middlesex County&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACamden%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Camden County&lt;/a&gt;, New Jersey. The workers say they suffer from diseases related to asbestos such as &lt;a href="w%3AAsbestosis"&gt;asbestosis&lt;/a&gt;. Owens-Illinois has headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3AToledo%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Toledo, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and is a &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware%20corporation"&gt;Delaware corporation&lt;/a&gt;.

The New Jersey appellate panel ruled that the Superior Court judge did not consider where the plaintiffs wanted their case heard, and also held that the U.S. ships are considered U.S. territory and thus the workers' claimed health issues did not begin on Spanish land. Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships, when docked, are subject to the law of Spain, and so the case should be heard in Spanish courts.
The court's opinion, written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, explained the ruling: "In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on &lt;u&gt;forum non conveniens&lt;/u&gt; grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors." The decision reversed the ruling of the Superior Court and remanded the suit back to that court for trial.
"I find it difficult to understand how an appellate division court can countenance keeping the cases in New Jersey when there is absolutely no relation to New Jersey. There is barely any relationship to the United States of America. They've made their decision," said counsel for Owens-Illinois, John Garde, in a statement in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Star-Ledger"&gt;The Star-Ledger&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. No decision has yet been made on whether the company will appeal the ruling.

Mitchell S. Cohen, attorney for the Spanish workers, said that the Superior Court judge should have considered that the New Jersey court was the only location where the lawsuit could have been tried before dismissing the case. "Spanish law will not allow, under the facts of these cases, to file a claim in Spain," said Cohen to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. Cohen said that Spanish law states that a case cannot be filed in Spain because the alleged injuries occurred on U.S. territory.

This is not the only asbestos-related lawsuit in which Owens-Illinois is cited as a defendant. The company is also a defendant (among other defendants) in asbestos cases filed in &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and other states. In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: "Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were
$40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of
2007." According to the press release, the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008. In its balance sheet for the first quarter of 2008, the company reported &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;835 million in asbestos-related liabilities.
In a May 2 &lt;a href="w%3AEarnings%20call"&gt;earnings call&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AFinancial%20analyst"&gt;financial analysts&lt;/a&gt;, Owens-Illinois &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Financial%20Officer"&gt;Chief Financial Officer&lt;/a&gt; Edward C. White addressed asbestos-related expenses. "Only a small portion of our first quarter asbestos payments related to the company's proactive legal strategy to reduce risk and accelerate asbestos resolution on favorable terms. Nevertheless, this strategy continues and additional expected spending is reflected both on the current liability portion of our balance sheet as well as in our full-year cash flow projection," said White. "We exited the business 50 years ago and have been dealing with the legal issues for almost 30 years. For OI, this remains a limited declining liability, which we will continue to manage in a conscientious and responsible manner."

Asbestosis is a disease resulting from asbestos exposure which causes &lt;a href="w%3ALung%20scarring"&gt;lung scarring&lt;/a&gt; and can lead to &lt;a href="w%3ALung%20cancer"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Exposure to asbestos can also lead to a more serious condition known as &lt;a href="w%3AMesothelioma"&gt;mesothelioma&lt;/a&gt;. Mesothelioma is a &lt;a href="w%3ACancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; which develops in the sac surrounding the &lt;a href="w%3APleura"&gt;lungs and chest cavity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APeritoneum"&gt;abdominal cavity&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="w%3APericardium"&gt;sac surrounding the heart&lt;/a&gt;. Patients with &lt;a href="w%3AMalignant%20mesothelioma"&gt;malignant mesothelioma&lt;/a&gt; generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed typically have six months to a year to live.

According to a NASA status report, the lone toilet on the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS) has broken, leaving the astronauts on board having to use a rigged-up system of bags to collect any liquid waste. 

According to &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, the collection fan motor broke sometime last week after one of the crew used the &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;-made toilet in the space station. The NASA status report quotes the crew as hearing "a loud noise and the fan stopped working". Russian officials have yet to solve the cause of the breakage and fix it. The seven-year old toilet has broken once before but not for a long period of time.

The crew had been temporarily using the toilet in the &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20capsule"&gt;Soyuz capsule&lt;/a&gt;, but this has a very limited capacity. 

NASA officials are now considering flying in replacement parts for the toilet and putting them on &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Space Shuttle Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, which is due to launch on Saturday and scheduled to arrive at the ISS on Monday.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=FLDS%20couple%20reunited%20with%20child%2C%20Texas%20fear%20families%20will%20flee%20justice&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Although the Texas authorities retain legal control over the child, the parents have been given the temporary right to look after their child. Dan Jessop, one of the parents, commented on the development. "It's one step closer to my family being together."

401 allegedly abused children were taken into state custody last month after officials received a call from a distressed 16-year-old girl. The children were found in a 1700-acre compound belonging to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It is now believed that the original phone call was actually a hoax.

The agreement follows an &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Courts%20of%20Appeals"&gt;appeals court&lt;/a&gt;-ruling that Texas &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20Protective%20Services"&gt;Child Protective Services&lt;/a&gt; (CPS) should not have taken the children from the FLDS.

Meanwhile, CPS filed court papers today, saying that the families may choose to flee Texas if they are reunited per the appeals courts ruling. If they did that, they would suddenly be outside the court's jurisdiction, putting them at risk of abuse.

Lawyers for the mothers of the children, filed a counter-motion, stating that the children face "continuing, irreparable harm every day that they are separated from their parents."

Police were monitoring the compound ever since it was bought by the group one year ago. According to Texas law there must have been "a danger to the physical health or safety of the child which was caused by an act or failure to act of the person entitled to possession and for the child to remain in the home is contrary to the welfare of the child". 

In addition to the above there must also be "the urgent need for protection required the immediate removal of the child and reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, were made to eliminate or prevent the child’s removal"
Finally, for state custody to be allowed there must also have been "reasonable efforts have been made to enable the child to return home". A lower court was given 10 days to make a decision on whether the above requirements are met. Although originally the mothers were allowed to stay with the children, they are not required to be separate unless the parents are aged under eighteen or the children are very young. The FLDS said in an open letter the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Texas"&gt;Governor of Texas&lt;/a&gt; that a "critical crisis" was unfolding due to these recent incidents. 

In addition to Texas, the group has compounds in &lt;a href="w%3AHildale%2C%20Mancos"&gt;Hildale&lt;/a&gt; and many other locations. The church has around 10,000 members in total, and was founded in the 1930s. The church split from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints due to the fact that it abandoned polygamy.

The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is led by &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Jeffs"&gt;Warren Jeffs&lt;/a&gt; – jailed last year for the rape and forced marriage of a 14 year old girl – is a breakaway branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which abandoned the practice of polygamy in 1890.

Two &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Bay%20Transportation%20Authority"&gt;Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority&lt;/a&gt; (MBTA) &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Line%20%28MBTA%29"&gt;Green Line&lt;/a&gt; trains have collided in &lt;a href="w%3ANewton%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Newton&lt;/a&gt;. Both trains consisted of two cars, one of which rear-ended the other causing major damage on both trains, multiple injuries and trapped the female operator of one of the two trains, 24 year-old Terrese Edmonds, who subsequently died. An investigation by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; is underway.

The crash happened yesterday around 6 p.m. EDT between the &lt;a href="w%3AWaban%20%28MBTA%20station%29"&gt;Waban&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWoodland%20%28MBTA%20station%29"&gt;Woodland&lt;/a&gt; Green Line stations on the Green Line's D Branch. One train was stopped at a red signal waiting to enter to Woodland when it was struck from behind by the second train. 

According to MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo, "The first one was stopped at a red signal and was ready to proceed to the station when it was struck."

The Green Line, which is the most heavily used light rail line in the United States, is made up of four branches. The D Branch runs along a dedicated right of way and the stations are more spaced out as opposed to the other branches which run on the street. 

This is one of several accidents the MBTA has experienced recently. Exactly two weeks ago, a trolley on the B Branch derailed and caught fire, and Tuesday, a fire broke out between &lt;a href="w%3APark%20Street%20%28MBTA%20station%29"&gt;Park Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADowntown%20Crossing%20%28MBTA%20station%29"&gt;Downtown Crossing&lt;/a&gt; on the MBTA's &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Line%20%28MBTA%29"&gt;Red Line&lt;/a&gt;. The MBTA's Commuter Rail division has also experienced accidents including the death of a 5-year old in &lt;a href="w%3ARevere%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Revere&lt;/a&gt; who was stuck by a commuter train in the middle of a grade crossing this Tuesday and a MBTA commuter train that was rear-ended by a runaway boxcar belonging to &lt;a href="w%3ACSX"&gt;CSX&lt;/a&gt; back in late March. Quick thinking on behalf of the engineer on that train is believed to have averted a larger accident.

During a one-day visit to Warsaw on Tuesday French President &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; announced that his country would lift job restrictions on the citizens of some of the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;'s former communist states. He also promised a deal aimed at bringing &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; closer to the bloc but seemed to play down its chances of membership. 

France was part of a majority of EU states that imposed employment restrictions on citizens of Poland and other countries that joined the European Union in 2004. The limits now in place for workers from the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Estonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Latvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Lithuania"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Slovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; will be lifted on July 1. However, jobs in France will remain restricted for workers from &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, which joined the EU in 2007.

"I am going to announce this during my speech in Parliament," Sarkozy said when asked about media reports on the matter. "Poland is one of the six great countries of Europe. The EU is based on the free movement of people. Poland is also our strategic partner."
Of "old EU" member states, only &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; now maintain the ban. &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Liechtenstein"&gt;Liechtenstein&lt;/a&gt; – non-EU countries that are part of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean_Economic_Area"&gt;European Economic Area&lt;/a&gt; – also restrict access to their job markets for citizens of the countries that joined the union in 2004. Switzerland, which has bilateral agreements with the EU on free movement of people, also restricts employment for those countries. Under EU law, these restrictions must be lifted by 2011.

Sarkozy also told a joint news conference with Polish Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADonald_Tusk"&gt;Donald Tusk&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that Ukraine would be offered closer cooperation with the European Union during a French presidency of the bloc, which starts on July 1, but said Ukrainian President &lt;a href="w%3AViktor_Yushchenko"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt; told him that Ukraine did not want to join the EU outright.

"I've met with the president of Ukraine and his objective is not membership, rather closer cooperation on various levels. I will have opportunities to make such proposals," he said.
