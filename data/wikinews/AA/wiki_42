Former &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20national%20football%20team"&gt;German national coach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann"&gt;Jürgen Klinsmann&lt;/a&gt; has been signed as the new &lt;a href="w%3ABayern%20Munich"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; coach for the 2008/2009 &lt;a href="w%3ABundesliga"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; season. This will mark Klinsmann's first managerial position at club level, succeeding current coach &lt;a href="w%3AOttmar%20Hitzfeld"&gt;Ottmar Hitzfeld&lt;/a&gt;.

Over the past few months Klinsmann was being considered for various coach positions after reforming the German national team and finishing 3rd at the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Football%20World%20cup"&gt;2006 Football World Cup&lt;/a&gt; as coach of the German national team. Previously there had been reports that he was looking at &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20United"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATottenham%20Hotspurs"&gt;Tottenham&lt;/a&gt; and there also was a possibility for him to be &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20McClaren"&gt;Steve McClaren's&lt;/a&gt; successor as the national coach for the English football team.

Klinsmann will be returning to the club where he played from 1995 till 1997 and won a UEFA Cup, a German league championship and a League Cup. Klinsmann's contract will start on July 1, 2008.

The Lakota Freedom Delegation, which in December declared that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALakota%20people"&gt;Lakota people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were withdrawing from their treaties with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and reasserting their sovereignty as an independent state, is acting without the support of the Treaty Council, the traditional government of the Lakota, ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ spoke with Floyd Looks-For-Buffalo Hand, an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOglala%20Lakota"&gt;Oglala Lakota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Treaty Delegate and Elder, also an author and a spiritual leader in the indigenous Lakota religion, and who is also blood uncle to Lakota Freedom Delegation member Canupa Gluha Mani.

The Lakota Freedom Delegation has claimed that, while the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs"&gt;BIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -recognized tribal governments of the Lakota have not supported them, the Lakota Freedom Delegation's authority extends from support by the Treaty Council of the Elders of Lakota as well as from the 1974 International Indian Treaty Council. 

"There was no treaty withdrawal. It was three people."

"&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Means"&gt;Russell Means&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Duane Martin [Canupa Gluha Mani] and that lady [Phyllis Young], they do not speak for the nation. You've got to have consensus" among the eight tribes of the Lakota, he said, which the Lakota Freedom Delegation has not obtained. Mr. Hand stated that he was speaking as a tribal delegate with the consensus of the Oglala Treaty Delegation and his chief, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20Red%20Cloud"&gt;Oliver Red Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Hand furthermore called the treaty withdrawal event a "publicity stunt" and that furthermore the 1974 meeting was not authorization to act on behalf of the Lakota people. While Means, Canupa Gluha Mani, and the rest of the delegation "have free speech" and can do as they wish, he said, the Elders of Lakota "stated that they should remove themselves from treaty territory," that is, the Reservations inhabited by the Lakota. But "they're still living here" (Canupa Gluha Mani has been residing in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAsheville%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Asheville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; since the treaty withdrawal press conference on December 19).

When asked if the above decisions represented the consensus of the whole Treaty Council, Hand stated, "we all do the same because we're all fullbloods. We all speak our own language."

Hand went on to explain, though, that the Treaty Council was planning to reconsider the Lakota's arrangement with the United States government. The Treaty Council of all eight Lakota tribes, which will meet on 28&amp;ndash;30 January 2008, will consider whether to "sit down to negotiate" with the federal government. Members of the Lakota Freedom Delegation are expected to take part in that meeting. European-Americans, Hand said, are "not honoring" the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATreaty%20of%20Fort%20Laramie"&gt;1851 and 1868 treaties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which connected the Lakota to the United States, and noted that the Lakota were the only people to "conquer" the United States during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Wars"&gt;Indian Wars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the 19th century.

The arrangement with the United States, which he called a "contract", "handcuffs us through the federal programs". On their own, Hand said, "if we rely on a sovereign nation as a nation, relating to other nations with our economic development I think we can survive." Hand noted that one possibility under consideration was asserting the right to negotiate independently of the US government with foreign powers in areas such as airport access rights. The Lakota, he said, would charge foreign airlines half what the United States charges to make use of airports on Lakota soil. "We can be well off," he argued.

In another contradiction of the Lakota Freedom Delegation's program, Hand said that the Treaty Delegations "don't want technology on our reservation". One of his concerns was environmentalism. People of European descent are "taking too much out of Mother Earth", he said, making reference to ongoing environmental effects of uranium mining which has long been a contentious issue on the Lakota reservations. The Treaty Delegation's goal, he said, is "preserving the land and animals and letting the water remain free."

However, one of the plans of the Lakota Freedom Delegation is to install renewable energy technology on tribal land, such as solar and wind farms. This follows projects in the past, whereby wind turbines were erected on the Rosebud Reservation. Such projects would lessen dependence on foreign energy sources, as well as coincide with the Lakota's traditional respect for the environment.

Hand also expressed hope for ethnic solidarity among the non-European peoples of the world. "All the people of color in this world will go for unity and understanding and peace" if they overthrow the Europeans and establish their own governments, he said.

One hundred and thirty three people were injured, nineteen of them seriously, when two high-speed ferries travelling between &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Macau"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt; collided in heavy fog on Friday. Ten crew members were also injured but no deaths have been reported.

The two high-speed Boeing 929 - 100 Jetfoil &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrofoil"&gt;hydrofoil&lt;/a&gt; ferries, ♡❤Funchal♡❤ and ♡❤Santa Maria♡❤ operated by Hong Kong-based ShunTak-China Travel Ship Management Limited (under the brand name TurboJet), collided five away from Macau at around 8:30 p.m. local time. The incident has been confirmed by an official of the Maritime Administration of the Macau Special Administrative Region. 

In Shangai, a river ferry carrying twenty two people capsized in thick fog on Friday. Ten people are reported missing. Sixty six people were rescued after another ferry ran aground at &lt;a href="w%3AZhuhai"&gt;Zhuhai&lt;/a&gt; near Macau.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Opposition Party&lt;/a&gt; laid blame for recent interest rate increases at the feet of new federal treasurer &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Swan"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt;. Swan, in turn, criticised the banks, saying they risk being "judged very harshly" if they "try to take advantage of the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20subprime%20mortgage%20financial%20crisis"&gt;sub-prime crisis&lt;/a&gt; by lifting interest rates excessively."

Following the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Australia%20Bank"&gt;National Australia Bank&lt;/a&gt; (NAB) lifting its rates 0.12 percent independently of the &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20Australia"&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Swan consulted with &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Prudential%20Regulation%20Authority"&gt;Australian Prudential Regulation Authority&lt;/a&gt; (APRA), which monitors bank liquidity, and was advised that rises of around 0.1 percent were reasonable.

However, following his moderate response to NAB's rise, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Banking%20Group"&gt;ANZ Bank&lt;/a&gt; announced a 0.2% rise, prompting Swan's warning. Since then other banks, including &lt;a href="w%3AWestpac"&gt;Westpac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABankWest"&gt;BankWest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABendigo%20Bank"&gt;Bendigo Bank&lt;/a&gt;, have announced rises between 0.1 and 0.2 percent, while &lt;a href="w%3ASt.George%20Bank"&gt;St.George Bank&lt;/a&gt; lifted its rates by 0.2 percent.

Former &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government treasurer &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; criticised Swan as inexperienced, saying, "They've taken the opportunity of a new treasurer who is not on top of the job to increase their margins, and he came out and, on behalf of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, he approved it." While opposition treasury spokesman, &lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Turnbull"&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/a&gt; claimed the treasurer was "all over the shop."

HSBC chief economist Dr John Edwards said, "It is all a learning experience for him but it is very difficult to say anything that is less than critical about the banks. The ANZ was the real lesson for Swan because they betrayed his belief, which was probably well informed, the banks would be reasonable and keep any rise to about the level imposed by the NAB."

Schools in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; have been advised not to upgrade to the newest &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; products, &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Vista"&gt;Vista&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%202007"&gt;Office 2007&lt;/a&gt;, according to a report by the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Educational%20Communications%20and%20Technology%20Agency"&gt;British Educational Communications and Technology Agency&lt;/a&gt; (BECTA). Becta said that there were no "appropriate benefit" that would offset the additional cost and possible compatibility issues created by upgrading. 

An agency of the UK &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20for%20Education%20and%20Skills"&gt;department for education and skills&lt;/a&gt;, Becta oversees the procurement of all IT equipment and e-learning solutions for schools. 

One of the main reasons given is also compatibility, especially the new Microsoft document format &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20Open%20XML"&gt;OOXML&lt;/a&gt; (Office Open XML), a competitor to the &lt;a href="w%3AISO"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt; standard &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Document%20Format"&gt;ODF&lt;/a&gt; (Open Document Format). The report says that "Microsoft should provide native support for the ODF file format increasingly used in competitor products and those that are free to use". Schools that do upgrade are advised not to use the OOXML format. Other reasons were that upgrading graphics hardware to support the new &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Aero"&gt;Windows Aero Graphics system&lt;/a&gt; used in Windows Vista, which would cost additional money according to ♡❤PC World♡❤

The report also says that "Schools and colleges should make pupils, teachers and parents aware of the range of free-to-use products (such as office productivity suites) that are available, and how to use them". BECTA is not the first government institution to advise against upgrading to newer Microsoft products, media reports about a similar move by the Department of Transportation in the US were reported last year according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AInformationWeek"&gt;InformationWeek&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APC%20World"&gt;PC World&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the cost of upgrading would be £175 million (US$350 million), with a third of that going to Microsoft.

The Chinese Nationalist Party, also known as &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (KMT, traditional Chinese:中國國民黨), has won today's elections in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; against President &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; (DPP). The DPP had previously ended half a century of Kuomintang rule in 2000 when President Chen was elected and won more seats than any other party in the 2001 election. 

The election can only be described as a landslide win for the KMT, winning more than 70% of all the seats in the 113 seats parliament while the DPP only managed to gain just under 25%. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is reporting 86 seats for the KMT while ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAFP"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is reporting 82 seats.

"I am willing to shoulder all of the responsibility," President Chen was quoted as saying at a press conference. He resigned as the chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party immediately.

The Kuomintang is part of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwanese%20Pan-Blue%20coalition"&gt;Pan-Blue coalition&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20First%20Party%20%28Republic%20of%20China%29"&gt;People First Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20New%20Party"&gt;Chinese New Party&lt;/a&gt;. As a coalition they stand for reunification with China, which the Democratic Progressive Party opposes. The Democratic Progressive Party is a member of the &lt;a href="w%3APan%20green%20coalition"&gt;Pan green coalition&lt;/a&gt; which stands for &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwanese%20independence"&gt;Taiwanese independence&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. Taiwan calls itself the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;; however, it is only recognized by few states and is officially seen as part of the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; by most, though it is generally recognized as a ♡❤de facto♡❤ independent nation.

The &lt;a href="human%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; staged protests around the world yesterday to mark the sixth anniversary of the first arrival of detainees at the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; detention centre at &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. The group is demanding the prison be shut down. Meanwhile, a U.S. &lt;a href="w%3Aappeals%20court"&gt;appeals court&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; has ruled against four &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; men who allege they were tortured during their detention at Guantanamo. 

Amnesty International, the &lt;a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;, and other rights organizations used the anniversary to again call on the &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration to close down the Guantanamo facility. A crowd of about 200 protesters, many dressed in orange jumpsuits similar to the ones worn by Guantanamo prisoners, gathered in the pouring rain in Washington, D.C. yesterday. Around 80 were thought to have been arrested, as protests are forbidden in the area surrounding the courts. &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Cox"&gt;Larry Cox&lt;/a&gt;, the Executive Director of Amnesty International USA said Guantanamo has become a symbol.

"It's become the symbol of everything that's wrong with the U.S. approach to fighting terror and making people safer," said Cox. "It's become a symbol of human rights abuses, it's become the symbol of things which deviate so grossly from the values that this country has always upheld that people are horrified and shocked."

Amnesty also staged protests Friday in the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Paraguay"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. Major events included a gathering outside the American embassy in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, UK and a walking protest through the streets of &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;

President Bush and several senior members of his administration have repeatedly said they would like to close Guantanamo down, but there is the question of how to make sure the terrorist suspects detained there do not return to target the United States if handed back to their countries of origin.

Defence Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt; said last month there has not been much progress in efforts to close the prison down because of legal concerns in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;.

Amnesty's Larry Cox says his organization has worked out an action plan to close it, which has been endorsed by lawmakers from 30 countries.

"There is an easy answer to this, which is to shut down Guantanamo, to put people into U.S. detention centres, to charge them if they're guilty of crimes, they should be charged, and to bring them to trial," said Cox. "And to let other people, either go back, if they can, to their countries or to get asylum in other countries."

Democratic Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Harkin"&gt;Tom Harkin&lt;/a&gt; has introduced legislation that would close the detention centre and restore due process to the detainees, but it is not clear if and when it will come to the floor for debate.

Meanwhile, a U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C. has thrown out a lawsuit filed by four British ex-prisoners who say they were systematically tortured during their two-year detention at Guantanamo Bay. The four plaintiffs are all British nationals and residents, who were released from Guantanamo in 2004.

The &lt;a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; is currently considering another case that involves other prisoners still at Guantanamo Bay and if they have a right to challenge their confinement in U.S. courts.

&lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20Air%20Lines"&gt;Delta Air Lines&lt;/a&gt; may enter merge discussions with one of two other major &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; air carriers - &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Airlines"&gt;Northwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt;.

It is known that Chief Executive Richard Anderson has asked for authorisation to begin talks, and believed executives have held a meeting at which permission was sought to enter discussion with one of the two airlines, but the results are yet to be confirmed.

Ajc.com reported that airline spokesman Kent Landers refused to confirm even the existence of the meeting, saying "Delta has a longstanding policy not to comment on board meeting dates or agendas. Our board is working with management to look at all strategic options to remain a leader in the industry, including potential consolidation transactions. [Delta] won't provide updates on the board's process."

The airline has been in exploratory talks with both Northwest and United since late 2007, and it is believed that the purpose of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; meeting was to select which airline offered Delta the better deal and authorise moving talks on to the next level. If a deal goes ahead and survives regulatory checks and potential opposition from politicians and consumer advocates then a merge with either airline would be the biggest between two US airlines, and would result in the biggest airline in the world.

Rapidly rising costs in the aviation industry are driving airlines towards merges. In particular, the price of jet fuel jumped 58% in 2007, driven by the rapidly increasing price of oil. When Anderson joined Delta in early September, he commented that he was not interested in potential merge deals. However, as prices rise and shares fall for airlines, he publicly changed his stance to being open to Delta-led mergers. Shares in all three companies shot up amid the news of a potential deal, although they have begun falling again, and did not hit last year's highs. Delta has a current market value of around $4.2 billion, less than half the amount &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Airways"&gt;US Airways&lt;/a&gt; offered last year in an attempt to buy Delta, which failed.

Astronomers say that in approximately 20 to 40 million years, a giant cloud of &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrogen"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; gas, known as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASmith%27s%20Cloud"&gt;Smith's Cloud&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, will slam into the &lt;a href="w%3AMilky%20Way"&gt;Milky Way&lt;/a&gt; galaxy, resulting in the formation of countless stars, which could make for the biggest fireworks display in the &lt;a href="w%3ALocal%20Group"&gt;Local Group&lt;/a&gt;. The front edge of the cloud has already begun to hit the galaxy.

"The leading edge of this cloud is already interacting with gas from our Galaxy. This is most likely a gas cloud left over from the formation of the Milky Way or gas stripped from a neighbor galaxy. When it hits, it could set off a tremendous burst of star formation. Many of those stars will be very massive, rushing through their lives quickly and exploding as supernovae. Over a few million years, it'll look like a celestial New Year's celebration, with huge firecrackers going off in that region of the Galaxy," said Felix J. Lockman of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), one of the astronomers who headed a study to research the cloud. The &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin-Whitewater"&gt;University of Wisconsin-Whitewater&lt;/a&gt; also participated in the study.

Astronomers used the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Bank%20Telescope"&gt;Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope&lt;/a&gt; (GBT) to study the cloud, which was first discovered by an astronomer in 1963. The study found that as many as a million new stars, much like our own &lt;a href="w%3ASun"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;, could form from the gas when it does collide with our galaxy. 

Currently it is 8,000 light years away from full impact of our galaxy, and is traveling at over 150 miles a second. It is 2,500 light-years wide and over 11,000 light-years long. Astronomers believe it will strike the Milky Way's disk at a 45-degree angle.

It was earlier believed that the cloud was traveling away from the Milky Way or might have been part of the galaxy itself but, due to the technology at the time, images were not clear enough to see what was really happening. Using the highly sensitive GBT, astronomers have now been able to capture over 40,000 different images of the cloud. The researchers now believe that the cloud is, in fact, moving toward the Milky Way and pushing the gases of the galaxy up onto itself as it progresses.

"If you could see this cloud with your eyes, it would be a very impressive sight in the night sky. From tip to tail it would cover almost as much sky as the Orion constellation. But as far as we know it is made entirely of gas -- no one has found a single star in it," added Lockman.

The bodies of two of the four &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; children allegedly thrown off a bridge by their father have been found. On Saturday, Danny Luong, the youngest of the children at four months old, was discovered by a duck hunter in a marshy area near &lt;a href="w%3ABayou%20la%20Batre%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Bayou la Batre&lt;/a&gt;, about 5 miles west of the 80 foot high &lt;a href="w%3ADauphin%20Island%20Bridge"&gt;Dauphin Island Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. A second child, 3-year-old Ryan Phan, was found near Barton Bay by a search and rescue team today at 10:30 am local time. Barton Bay is about 10 miles northwest of the bridge.

The father, Lam Luong, a 37 year old shrimp fisherman, has been charged with four counts of &lt;a href="w%3Acapital%20murder"&gt;capital murder&lt;/a&gt;. If convicted, he faces either the &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20penalty"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Alife%20imprisonment"&gt;life imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; without &lt;a href="w%3Aparole"&gt;parole&lt;/a&gt;. 

"The inevitable nightmare we have feared has now been confirmed. We believe, certainly now, that the father of these children threw these children off the Dauphin Island bridge," &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20County"&gt;Mobile County&lt;/a&gt; sheriff Sam Cochran said on Saturday.

Luong and his wife, Kieu Ngoc Phan, reported the children missing on Monday. When questioned, Luong claimed responsibility for the act, saying that he threw the children into the river after an argument with his wife. However, he later retracted his confession, instead claiming that two women, one of whom is named "Kim", took the children and drove off in a van.

Kieu Ngoc Phan was informed of the body's discovery on Saturday. "Why didn't he kill me instead of the children? It's too much hurting," Phan said through an interpreter while weeping. She was being comforted by an associate pastor from a &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnamese&lt;/a&gt; church.

According to the family, Luong called from jail and told them he wanted to be "more famous than the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt; hijackers" and that he "wasn't afraid of the &lt;a href="w%3Aelectric%20chair"&gt;electric chair&lt;/a&gt;".

The search continues for the other two children - Hannah Luong, 2, and Lindsey Luong, 1. The search area has been expanded across the state border towards &lt;a href="w%3APascagoula%2C%20Mississippi"&gt;Pascagoula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, as authorities believe the strong currents may have moved the bodies westward. Mobile County Commissioner Steve Nodine reports that the search is costing an estimated $100,000 per day.

Recipients of 2007's &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%20Awards"&gt;Darwin Awards&lt;/a&gt; were announced last week, representing the stories of people who are killed or otherwise rendered sterile after committing an "astounding misapplication of judgement."

One of this year's top winners was "What Goes Up Must Come Down" which received an 8.0 rating and 8929 votes. The tale concerns a couple in &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; who died in hospital after being discovered naked and critically injured on a roadway. Authorities discovered the couple's clothing on a rooftop and concluded that they fell from that location when they engaged "in the act of procreation".

Tied for a top score of 8.0 with 4212 votes was "The Enema Within", an account of a &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; man who absorbed alcohol by means of &lt;a href="w%3Aenema"&gt;enema&lt;/a&gt; because his throat condition made swallowing painful. After consuming 3 litres of &lt;a href="w%3ASherry"&gt;sherry&lt;/a&gt; in this manner, he died overnight from alcohol poisoning after attaining a deadly &lt;a href="w%3ABlood%20alcohol%20content"&gt;blood alcohol level&lt;/a&gt; of 0.47%.

A runner-up story, "Support Group", featured three incidents where scrap metal thieves ended their lives after removing metal supports under heavy objects.

According to the Darwin Awards website, the winners were announced a week later than normal "because Wendy became obsessed with finger loop braiding".

In response to higher than expected mortgage rate increases last week, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n treasurer &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Swan"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt; flagged changes to banking regulations to increase competition between lenders on home mortgages.

Swan announced yesterday he had sought a &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20the%20Treasury%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Treasury&lt;/a&gt; report on the banking sector ahead of talks over the next fortnight on reforms to make it easier for bank customers to move mortgages between lenders by forcing banks to reduce exit fees, to "make the market more competitive". 

"Everybody knows we've been impacted upon by the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20subprime%20mortgage%20financial%20crisis"&gt;U.S. sub-prime mortgage crisis&lt;/a&gt; that has pushed up the cost of money," Swan said. 

"But, as I said last week, some of the increases we saw by the banks were not justified. In my view, they were excessive. I urge people to vote with their feet. If there are obstacles to people voting with their feet, switching their accounts, we'll have a look at those."

The banking industry, however, insists that loan refinancing is not a complicated process currently, according to the head of the Australian Bankers Association (ABA), David Bell. "There is a competitive marketplace for home loans and the Cannex website shows the many products that are available," said Bell. "Regarding the switching of transaction accounts, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Payments%20Clearing%20Association"&gt;Australian Payments Clearing Association&lt;/a&gt; is conducting a community consultation process on this issue. ABA member banks support this process."

<h1>San Diego Chargers upset Indianapolis Colts</h1>
Even without &lt;a href="w%3ALaDainian%20Tomlinson"&gt;LaDainian Tomlinson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APhilip%20Rivers"&gt;Philip Rivers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Chargers"&gt;Chargers&lt;/a&gt; made sure the &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Colts"&gt;Indianapolis Colts&lt;/a&gt; won't repeat as &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; champions.

Now San Diego must make sure it doesn't repeat its last performance at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Patriots"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;.

That will be especially difficult without an injured L.T., who departed in the first half with a bruised left knee, and starting quarterback Rivers, who went out in the third quarter with a damaged right knee in the Chargers' stunning 28-24 victory Sunday.

With &lt;a href="w%3ABilly%20Volek"&gt;Billy Volek&lt;/a&gt; at quarterback and &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Turner"&gt;Michael Turner&lt;/a&gt; as the main runner, San Diego went 78 yards on eight plays, with Volek sneaking in from the 1 with 4:50 remaining for the lead. The Chargers' big-play defense then held on downs at its 7, and stopped Indy again in the final moments to preserve their eighth straight win.

To make it nine in a row and advance to their second Super Bowl -- the other was a loss to San Francisco after the 1994 season -- the Chargers will need all the resourcefulness they showed at Indianapolis. Being undermanned against undefeated New England hardly is an enticing prospect.

Still, with All-Pro cornerback &lt;a href="w%3AAntonio%20Cromartie"&gt;Antonio Cromartie&lt;/a&gt; getting an interception and fumble recovery, and linebackers &lt;a href="w%3AShawne%20Merriman"&gt;Shawne Merriman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShaun%20Phillips"&gt;Shaun Phillips&lt;/a&gt; plaguing &lt;a href="w%3APeyton%20Manning"&gt;Peyton Manning&lt;/a&gt;, the Chargers showed they have the ability to throw off any offense. Maybe even the most prolific attack in NFL history.

The Chargers didn't come close against the Patriots in Week 2, falling 38-14. That was the beginning of a slide to 5-5 for San Diego, but the Chargers (13-5) are rolling now.

It was a gutty showing by Rivers, who threw for three scores -- he banged his right knee on a 56-yard screen pass TD by &lt;a href="w%3ADarren%20Sproles"&gt;Darren Sproles&lt;/a&gt; to end the third quarter. And Turner, who could be a starter elsewhere but usually sits behind league rushing leader Tomlinson, gave the offense the balance it desperately needed in the late stages of the upset, rushing for 71 yards.

The Chargers' opportunistic defense, which led the league in takeaways (48) and turnover margin (plus-24), grabbed two interceptions -- both on tipped balls -- and a fumble. While San Diego couldn't stop Manning's offense from steadily marching downfield most of the game, it could make the key plays that get you closer to the Super Bowl.

Still, if Tomlinson is limited or sidelined, how much chance do the Chargers have against the perfect Patriots? Not to mention perhaps missing Rivers or tight end Antonio Gates, who courageously played much of the day on a dislocated toe.

For the Colts (13-4), it was a bitterly quick elimination from the postseason.

A year ago, they won three playoff games, then beat Chicago in the Super Bowl. They couldn't recapture their touch on offense or defense this time, and a defense that allowed the fewest points during the season wore down against the equally physical Chargers.

Manning did throw for 402 yards, completing 33 of his 48 throws, but both interceptions killed deep scoring threats.

Rivers was 14-of-19 for 264 yards, and Volek went 3-of-4 for 48 yards in his clutch relief role. &lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Jackson"&gt;Vincent Jackson&lt;/a&gt; became Rivers' top target and had seven catches for 93 yards and a score.

Today, &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s spacecraft &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMESSENGER"&gt;MESSENGER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , or the ♡❤♡ME♡❤♡rcury ♡❤♡S♡❤♡urface, ♡❤♡S♡❤♡pace ♡❤♡EN♡❤♡vironment, ♡❤♡GE♡❤♡ochemistry, and ♡❤♡R♡❤♡anging spacecraft, is expected to begin its two day mission at about noon (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20time%20zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), of data collecting and photographing of the planet &lt;a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first spacecraft to visit the planet in 34 years, since &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMariner%2010"&gt;Mariner 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's visit to the planet in 1974.

"This is raw scientific exploration and the suspense is building by the day. What will MESSENGER see? Monday will tell the tale," said Alan Stern, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;.

This encounter will provide a critical gravity assist needed to keep the spacecraft on track for its March 2011 orbit insertion, beginning an unprecedented yearlong study of Mercury. The flyby also will gather essential data for mission planning. It will flyby an impact crater called the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACaloris%20Basin"&gt;Caloris basin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which is almost 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) in diameter. The basin is one of the largest impact craters in our solar system.

"Caloris is huge, about a quarter of the diameter of Mercury, with rings of mountains within it that are up to two miles high. Mariner 10 saw a little less than half of the basin. During this first flyby, we will image the other side," said Louise Prockter, the instrument scientist for the Mercury Dual Imaging System at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AApplied%20Physics%20Laboratory"&gt;Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALaurel%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Laurel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.

It also will study the global magnetic field and improve our knowledge of the gravity field from the Mariner 10 flyby. The long-wavelength components of the gravity field provide key information about the planet's internal structure, particularly the size of Mercury's core. The flyby also will map Mercury's tenuous atmosphere with ultraviolet observations and document the energetic particle and plasma of Mercury's magnetosphere. In addition, the flyby trajectory will enable unique particle and plasma measurements of the magnetic tail that sweeps behind Mercury.

MESSENGER was launched on August 3, 2004 and will travel just under five billion miles in total. It already has flown past Earth once and Venus twice. The spacecraft will use the pull of Mercury's gravity during this month's pass and others in October 2008 and September 2009 to guide it progressively closer to the planet's orbit. Insertion will be accomplished with a fourth Mercury encounter in 2011.

A construction worker died after falling thirty feet from a New York hotel yesterday, police say.

The accident occurred at the &lt;a href="w%3ATrump%20International%20Hotel%20and%20Tower%20%28SoHo%29"&gt;Trump SoHo&lt;/a&gt; construction site in &lt;a href="w%3ASoHo"&gt;SoHo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. Witnesses at the scene reported that a load being lifted by a crane collided with the building, possibly causing scaffolding to collapse.

Police indicated that the dead worker had fallen at least 30 feet. A second worker sustained injuries after falling several storeys into some netting. The injured worker was lowered to street level by crane and transported to hospital as a large number of ambulances and fire engines gathered on the scene. 

The Trump SoHo building is a 46 storey, 400 unit &lt;a href="w%3Acondo-hotel"&gt;hotel condominium&lt;/a&gt;. According to its website, the building is a joint venture between the Trump Organization, the Sapir Organization, and the Bayrock Group LLC. The site is scheduled to open in Spring 2009.

Scientists from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Minnesota"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; have successfully created a beating heart in a lab. The team was led by Dr. Doris Taylor, director of the University's Center for Cardiovascular Repair, used a process called "decellularization" in which the hearts were taken from newborn rats and stripped of their cells. The resulting non-living mass, called an extracellular matrix or ECM, contains no cells and therefore will not be rejected by its new owners. New muscle and endothelial cells are then injected into the ECM and stimulated electrically.

The first micro-contractions occurred within two days of the new cells being injected into the ECMs and visible contractions began to occur within seven to eight days. The rat hearts beat strongly enough to pump fluid out the aorta, although the force at which they beat was only equivalent to 2 percent of a normal adult rat or about 25 percent of a 16 week old human fetus.

The researchers will next be testing the process of pig hearts for which ECMs have already been created. A pig heart is roughly the size of a human heart. The eventual hope of the project is to be able to use the process on human hearts taken from cadavers or pig hearts with human cells injected, though it remains to be seen whether or not the process will work on a heart from a larger animal, such as a pig or human. The team also plans to experiment with the process on other organs such as kidneys, livers and lungs.

&lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Jindal"&gt;Piyush "Bobby" Jindal&lt;/a&gt; was inaugurated on Monday as governor of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. He is the country's first &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20American"&gt;Indian American&lt;/a&gt; elected governor and the first non-&lt;a href="w%3Awhite%20people"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; governor of Louisiana since &lt;a href="w%3AP.%20B.%20S.%20Pinchback"&gt;P. B. S. Pinchback&lt;/a&gt; in 1872. At 36 years old, he is currently the nation's youngest governor as well. Jindal succeeds &lt;a href="w%3AKathleen%20Blanco"&gt;Kathleen Blanco&lt;/a&gt; as the state governor.

The inauguration ceremony was held at the state capitol in &lt;a href="w%3ABaton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;Baton Rouge&lt;/a&gt;. In a speech, Jindal vowed to put an end to political corruption in the state and speed up recovery from the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2005 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;.

"We must win a war on corruption and incompetence in government," said Jindal.

Jindal was serving a second term in the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; when he was elected last October. He previously served as the head of Louisiana's Department of Health and Hospitals, a post to which he was appointed at the age of 24. A year earlier, he had graduated from &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oxford"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href="w%3ARhodes%20scholar"&gt;Rhodes scholar&lt;/a&gt;.

Jindal is the son of &lt;a href="w%3APunjabi%20people"&gt;Punjabi&lt;/a&gt; immigrants who came to Baton Rouge shortly before his birth. As a teenager, he converted from &lt;a href="w%3AHinduism"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ACatholicism"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;. He takes his nickname from the character Bobby on television's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Brady%20Bunch"&gt;The Brady Bunch&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Yesterday at 6:00 UTC at &lt;a href="http%3A//tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php%3F%26amp%3Bparams%3D60_S_78_E_%7C"&gt;60° S 78° E&lt;/a&gt; , a &lt;a href="w%3AWhaling%20in%20Japan"&gt;whaling&lt;/a&gt; ship detained two &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Shepherd"&gt;Sea Shepherd Conservation Society&lt;/a&gt; activists in the Southern Ocean. Japan's &lt;a href="w%3AInstitute%20of%20Cetacean%20Research"&gt;Institute of Cetacean Research&lt;/a&gt; (IRC) deny Sea Shepherd claims that they have been abused. The Japanese government has assured the Australian Government the release of the men.

According to the conservation agency Sea Shepherd, Australian Benjamin Potts, 28, a helicopter assistant, and Briton Giles Lane, an engine room worker, were detained on board a &lt;a href="w%3AYushin%20Maru%20No.%202"&gt;♡❤Yushin Maru♡❤ No. 2&lt;/a&gt; after delivering a letter asking the ship to exit Antarctic waters .

Captain &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Watson"&gt;Paul Watson&lt;/a&gt; of the Sea Shepherd's vessel, &lt;a href="w%3AMV%20Steve%20Irwin"&gt;♡❤Steve Irwin♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, said that the Japanese "tried to throw them overboard, then they tied them to a bulkhead and were beating them". 

He alleged that the men were tied to the radar masts before being brought below deck after which the men were not seen. Sea Shepherd's international director, Jonny Vasic, claimed that they were "basically strapped by the arms with zip-ties and tied with rope around their chests" for 2½ to three hours.

The captain said he was surprised as he expected Japanese whale ships to treated his men more decently.

"We are concerned but I know the Australian and British governments are in touch with the Japanese government."

Sea Shepherd said it has photographic evidence that the whalers were abusing the men.

However, the Japanese ship refuted the allegations.

“Any accusations that we have tied them up or assaulted them are completely untrue,” Director-general of the IRC Minoru Morimoto said in the press release, “It is illegal to board another country’s vessels on the high seas." 

Detaining the activists was the "only way", he said. "You couldn't have them running around the deck not knowing what they're going to do."

He said that the activists were making attempts to entangle the screw and were throwing bottles of &lt;a href="w%3Abutyric%20acid"&gt;butyric acid&lt;/a&gt;, as rancid butter, onto the deck of the vessel before boarding the vessel. Mr Watson has confirmed this and said that they were to act as a stink bomb but their actions were still peaceful.

Hideki Moronuki, the chief of the whaling section of &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Agriculture%2C%20Forestry%20and%20Fisheries%20%28Japan%29"&gt;The Fisheries Agency of Japan&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that "nobody took violent action against the two illegal intruders".

Mr. Moronuki said that they were treated "very, very humanely" and were provided with "a warm, delicious hot meal", "[a] warm, nice bath" and "[a] nice bed with clean white sheets".

Australian foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Smith%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;Stephen Smith&lt;/a&gt; said that the Japanese government promised him the release of the men late yesterday night.

"Late last night I was advised the Japanese had agreed to this and they had instructed the relevant whaling ship to return the men to the Steve Irwin," he told ABC radio.

Mr. Moronuki said the "two illegal intruders" will not be released by the vessel's captain until "Paul Watson has accepted the conditions of the safety of the Japanese vessel". He said he knew nothing of the comments that the Japanese government agreeing to release the men.

Mr. Watson said the Japanese were "[holding] hostages and make demands" and were acting like "a terrorist organisation". A press release said Sea Shepherd "will not negotiate with poachers and demands that the Japanese whalers release Benjamin Potts and Giles Lane as soon as possible".

Mr. Watson said he would not send a &lt;a href="w%3ARigid-hulled%20inflatable%20boat"&gt;zodiac&lt;/a&gt; to collect the men as requested in an email because it "endangers the life of the crew, to put them out in these waters in a small boat, 10 miles out of view".

On Sky TV, IRC spokesman Glenn Inwood said Sea Shepherd were "not answering phone calls or emails at this stage" to take advantage of "fair amount of media coverage" but they were "still making attempts to contact them".

An &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; spokeswoman said that Sea Shepherd made a police report at around 7:00 UTC.

A raucous party thrown at a suburban home in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; which terrorized the neighbourhood during the night of 12-13 January may cost a &lt;a href="w%3ANarre%20Warren"&gt;Narre Warren&lt;/a&gt; youth, aged 16, $20,000 in liabilities for police time and resources, including attacks upon police cars that resulted in smashed windshields. 

The police needed use of the police helicopter, dog squad and police from neighbouring towns to break up the mob of drunken youths, thought to number around 500.

According to reports, a teenage boy variously identified as Corey Delaney extended an invitation over the Internet, using the social networking site &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;. The boy's parents have been on holiday on the &lt;a href="w%3AGold%20Coast"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. They came home early to speak to their son. The parents said the boy was not meant to be at the house, instead staying at a friend's house.

The youth later said "I do feel sorry for everyone in the area. It was really unfair what happened to them and throwing bottles and breaking stuff. I'm sorry that it all happened."

The youth was arrested on January 16, along with a friend, after refusing to be questioned. There are claims circulating that a cover charge of between $1 and $10 (AUD) was collected for entry to the party, which may be investigated.

Victoria State Police Chief Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Nixon"&gt;Christine Nixon&lt;/a&gt; has called for a report into the cost of the police response to the party.

Two teenagers who attended the party, a 16 year old and a 17 year old have subsequently been charged with producing child pornography.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; is calling on the world's major oil-producing countries to increase their output whilst in &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, where Mr. Bush also issued another warning to &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

President Bush is publicly urging &lt;a href="OPEC"&gt;OPEC&lt;/a&gt; to increase oil supply on international markets, and he is doing it while in the world's largest oil producing country.

Speaking to a small group of reporters in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARiyadh"&gt;Riyadh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the president sought to drive home the impact higher oil prices are having in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere. With oil prices recently at $100 a barrel, Mr. Bush said American consumers are feeling the pain. He warned that high energy prices can damage consuming economies.

Earlier in the day, during a session with Saudi entrepreneurs, the president said he is raising the issue in talks with Saudi Arabia's &lt;a href="Abdullah%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;King Abdullah&lt;/a&gt;.

"I talked to the Ambassador, and will again talk to His Majesty tonight about the fact that oil prices are very high, which is tough on our economy, and that I would hope, as OPEC considers different production levels, that they understand that if their - one of their biggest consumers' economy suffers, it will mean less purchases, less oil and gas sold," Mr. Bush said.

When asked about the president's call for increased OPEC production, Saudi Oil minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Naimi"&gt;Ali Naimi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was non-committal.

"We will raise production when the market justifies it. This is our policy," Naimi said.

Another issue the president raised was Iran and during the session with journalists, he once again spoke about the January 6 incident involving Iranian speed boats and American ships in the Gulf. The president said Iran should be careful and there would be serious consequences if the Iranians attacked a U.S. vessel in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainternational%20waters"&gt;international waters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Mr. Bush however told the reporters that he has assured Arab leaders throughout his Mideast tour that he wants to solve the matter diplomatically.

President Bush will have plenty of time to bring up the oil issue and Iran with King Abdullah in the final evening of his stay in the Middle East where he will be an overnight guest at the Saudi leader's country estate near Riyadh, where he raises thoroughbred horses. In 2002 and 2005, then Crown Prince Abdullah paid similar visits to the president's ranch in Texas.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMari%20Alkatiri"&gt;Mari Alkatiri&lt;/a&gt; called for the resignation of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AXanana%20Gusm%C3%A3o"&gt;Xanana Gusmão&lt;/a&gt; following the allegation last week by former police chief &lt;a href="w%3AAlfredo%20Reinado"&gt;Alfredo Reinado&lt;/a&gt; that Gusmao orchestrated the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20East%20Timorese%20crisis"&gt;civil unrest in 2006&lt;/a&gt;.

"I think that it is time for Xanana to resign from his post because he has established a precedent in 2006 based on allegations without fact," said Alkatiri, who lost power during the 2006 rioting.

Alkatiri also called on the East Timorese President, &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Ramos%20Horta"&gt;Dr José Ramos-Horta&lt;/a&gt;, to pressure the Prime Minister to resign. “Ramos-Horta, as foreign minister, was very supportive of Xanana to force me to resign. Now he is president of the republic and he has to do the same," he added, referring to the resignation of Ramos-Horta and several other members of cabinet during the peak of the 2006 crisis.

The conflict, which left over 30 people dead and thousands homeless, followed an Alkatiri government's decision in March that year to lay-off 600 soldiers when they refused to work, approximately one third of the country’s official defence force. The soldiers alleged that Alkatiri gave special treatment to former &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Front%20for%20an%20Independent%20East%20Timor"&gt;Fretilin&lt;/a&gt; commanders.

Alfredo Reinado has been in hiding with supporters since escaping from prison in August 2006, after being arrested on charges of illegal weapons distribution, desertion and attempted murder following the 2006 unrest.

Dr Ramos-Horta rejected calls for the Prime Minister's resignation, saying "I cannot do it because these are allegations by one individual in a very vague manner." He also added, "Never before [has] Mr Alfredo Reinado told me anything about Mr Xanana Gusmao's involvement, with him, or with anyone, in inciting the crisis in 2006."

The militant Islamist group &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; attacked a hotel in &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; last night. Seven people, including a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; citizen and a journalist from the &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; newspaper ♡❤Dagbladet♡❤ were killed.

The terrorists attacked the five-star Serena Hotel with AK-47 assault rifles, suicide vests, and grenades. The likely target was Mr. Gahr Støre and a Norwegian delegation, who evacuated into the cellar. U.S. military forced rushed to the scene, and managed to kill at least one of the attackers. 

Taliban spokesman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZabiullah%20Mujahid"&gt;Zabiullah Mujahid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; claimed responsibility shortly after the attack. Norway has some 500 soldiers deployed to Afghanistan.

White House press secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; described the attackers as "deliberate, patient people who will murder innocents", and said that the attack "underscores the reason we have to stay on the offense against the extremists in places like Kabul but also in other places around the world."

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise%3A%20An%20Unauthorized%20Biography"&gt;Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a biography of actor &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href="w%3Ajournalist"&gt;journalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Morton"&gt;Andrew Morton&lt;/a&gt;, was released in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; yesterday amidst the potential for a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;100 million lawsuit against its publisher, &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Martin%27s%20Press"&gt;St. Martin's Press&lt;/a&gt;. The book will not be published in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; due to strict &lt;a href="w%3Alibel"&gt;libel&lt;/a&gt; laws in those countries. Morton had previously written the biography of &lt;a href="w%3ADiana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales"&gt;Diana, Princess of Wales&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤Diana: Her True Story♡❤. The book has reached number nine on &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;'s list of top sellers.

The book describes Cruise as the No. 2 leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;, blames Scientologists for the breakup of Cruise and actress &lt;a href="w%3ANicole%20Kidman"&gt;Nicole Kidman&lt;/a&gt;, and states that Cruise's latest mission is to recruit &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Beckham"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt; and wife &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Beckham"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; into Scientology. The book also describes how some Scientology followers thought that Cruise's wife &lt;a href="w%3AKatie%20Holmes"&gt;Katie Holmes&lt;/a&gt; was impregnated with frozen sperm from &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Scientology, and Morton compares the situation to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARosemary%27s%20Baby"&gt;Rosemary's Baby&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ "In her more reflective moments, Katie might have felt as if she were in the middle of a real-life version of the horror movie ‘Rosemary’s Baby,’ in which an unsuspecting young woman is impregnated with the devil’s child." 

A 15-page statement released by the Church of Scientology denied Morton's assertions of Cruise's No. 2 standing within the organization. In the statement the Church of Scientology claims that Morton did not respond to requests for an interview "The Church of Scientology requested to be interviewed or be presented with any allegations so we could respond. Morton refused despite our insistence in offering our cooperation." The Church of Scientology also specifically responded to the claims regarding Hubbard's frozen sperm: "Was Katie impregnated by L. Ron Hubbard's frozen sperm? ... As distasteful as it is to have to say it, Mr. Hubbard's sperm was never frozen." 

According to the ♡❤AFP♡❤, "the Church of Scientology is reportedly considering legal action against US publishers St Martin's Press." The Church of Scientology's general counsel, Eliot Abelson, discussed the potential for litigation in an interview with the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMail%20on%20Sunday"&gt;Mail on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ "We are seriously considering legal action and will wait to see the public reaction." Cruise's attorney &lt;a href="w%3ABertram%20Fields"&gt;Bertram Fields&lt;/a&gt; expressed thanks for the strict libel laws in Britain "It's not being published in England. The American publishers criticised the libel laws in Britain because they require an author to tell the truth. Well, thank God for the British libel laws." &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20News%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Daily News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has reported that the Church of Scientology and lawyers for Cruise are planning a US$100 million lawsuit over the book's publication. Rogers &amp; Cowan, the public relations agency that represents Cruise, issued a statement which criticized Morton for not interviewing "one person who has known or worked with Tom" in the past twenty-five years.

The Church of Scientology statement also pointed out that the book is not being published in Australia, Britain and New Zealand due to the countries' strict libel laws. Australia-based companies &lt;a href="w%3AMacmillan%20Publishers"&gt;Pan Macmillan Australia&lt;/a&gt; and retailer &lt;a href="w%3ADymocks%20Booksellers"&gt;Dymocks Booksellers&lt;/a&gt; decided not to stock copies of the book on their shelves, due to fears of potential defamation actions against them. A spokesperson for Pan Macmillan Australia stated that they had not received threats from Cruise's representatives or from Scientologists, but that their attorneys had advised them not to sell the book. Don Grover, chief executive for Dymocks Group stated after legal advice their company had decided to "play it safe" - though neither their lawyers or publishers had read the book itself. A representative of MacMillan stated that the book would not be published in New Zealand, but would make no further comment on the matter. A Dymocks New Zealand representative explained that it was possible that the book could be published by their company in New Zealand, but would have to look into it further "The US has different legislation than New Zealand and Australia. There are some issues with the book having legal questions asked and we would need those tidied up before we stock it."
Morton spent two years doing research for the book, and spoke with individuals who knew Cruise personally, and executives within the Church of Scientology. Morton stated that some of these executives emailed him, confirming the accuracy of material within the book. Morton described the desire for anonymity by some of the sources in the book "Some people, obviously, will not go on the record to talk about Tom Cruise because they’re scared of him."

In an interview on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AToday%20%28NBC%20program%29"&gt;The Today Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ with &lt;a href="w%3AMeredith%20Vieira"&gt;Meredith Vieira&lt;/a&gt;, Morton defended his work and responded to the statement from the Church of Scientology. Morton stated that it was unusual for a church to respond in such a way if Cruise is simply an ordinary member, asking "How many churches support one parishioner — a lowly parishioner — that way?" Morton described the response as an attack "Their policy is always to attack the attacker. Their tactic is to denigrate those who seek to talk about it." He told Vieria that he had attempted to contact the head of the Church of Scientology, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miscavige"&gt;David Miscavige&lt;/a&gt;, but "They refused it. I formally asked for it. I was instructed to ask for it by the publisher’s attorneys, and so what they’re saying is nonsense." 

Morton explained his motivation for writing the book "He's no longer just an actor or producer, but a powerful advocate for a cult that's out to expand, especially in Europe." Morton stated that his interest was piqued after Cruise &lt;a href="w%3AJumping%20the%20couch"&gt;jumped on Oprah's couch&lt;/a&gt; during a May 23, 2005 appearance on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20Show"&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and got into a heated debate with &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Lauer"&gt;Matt Lauer&lt;/a&gt; about his &lt;a href="w%3AScientology%20and%20psychiatry"&gt;beliefs regarding psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; during a June 24, 2005 appearance on ♡❤The Today Show♡❤.

<h1>UFO sightings reported in Texas town</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UFO%20sightings%20reported%20in%20Texas%20town&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Dozens of people in the &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href="w%3AStephenville%2C%20Texas"&gt;Stephenville&lt;/a&gt; have reported seeing strange objects in the night sky last week, which many believe to be a &lt;a href="w%3AUnidentified%20Flying%20Object"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt;. 

The eyewitnesses, who include a pilot, business owners, and the county constable, all claim to have seen a large, silent object with bright, flashing lights flying low and fast over the town. Some have even reported it being chased by fighter jets. People in other towns have given similar reports in past weeks.

"People wonder what in the world it is because this is the &lt;a href="w%3ABible%20Belt"&gt;Bible Belt&lt;/a&gt;, and everyone is afraid it's &lt;a href="w%3AEnd%20time"&gt;the end of times&lt;/a&gt;," said Steve Allen, pilot and owner of a freight company. He describes the object as being a mile long and half a mile wide. "It was positively, absolutely nothing from these parts," Allen asserted.

Lee Roy Gaitlin, constable of &lt;a href="w%3AErath%20County"&gt;Erath County&lt;/a&gt;, says the object had red glowing lights and white flashing lights. "It wasn't an airplane. It wasn't a meteor, because it wouldn't have been bouncing around. It wasn't just one light," said Gaitlin.

Officials from nearby &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; bases — &lt;a href="w%3ADyess%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Dyess Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAbilene%2C%20Texas"&gt;Abilene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASheppard%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Sheppard Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWichita%20Falls%2C%20Texas"&gt;Wichita Falls&lt;/a&gt; — say none of their aircraft were in the area the night of the sightings. However, Major Karl Lewis, a spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3A301st%20Fighter%20Wing"&gt;301st Fighter Wing&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Reserve%20Base%20Naval%20Air%20Station"&gt;Joint Reserve Base Naval Air Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Worth%2C%20Texas"&gt;Fort Worth&lt;/a&gt;, believes the object was an illusion caused by airplane lights.

"I'm 90 percent sure this was an airliner. With the sun's angle, it can play tricks on you." Lewis said. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AMutual%20UFO%20Network"&gt;Mutual UFO Network&lt;/a&gt;, a UFO investigative organization, plans to visit the town next weekend.

So far at least 23 people, all civilians, are reported dead when a bomb exploded on a bus in the town of Buttala in &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly 70 have been injured. Reports say that there were at least 50 people on the bus, many of them school children.

"Twenty-three people were killed and 67 wounded. They are all civilians. The terrorists were desperate in that area and are now targeting civilians," said Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, a spokesman for the country's military. Police also say that someone fire shots at the bus after it exploded.

It is not yet known whether or not the bomb was on the bus, or placed in close proximity of it.

Sun CEO &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20I.%20Schwartz"&gt;Jonathan Schwartz&lt;/a&gt; said in his blog Wednesday that in addition to this acquisition, Sun will provide global support offerings for the popular database platform.

Renfro, who had a history of substance abuse, was found dead yesterday morning in his &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; home by paramedics who had been summoned to the scene. The cause of death has not yet been determined, but officials said an autopsy could be conducted as early as today.

Last week, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANaked%20News"&gt;Naked News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced that it would dramatically increase its international language mandate to news reporting, with three new broadcasts. Already reporting in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20language"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the global organization is launching &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20language"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20language"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20language"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -language programs, for television, the web, and mobile devices.

&lt;a href="Naked%20News%20presents%20a%20new%20style%20of%20news"&gt;Wikinews interviewed one of the English broadcast's anchors&lt;/a&gt; a little while ago, about the program. The broadcasts feature daily news and human interest pieces, presented by an anchor who gradually removes their clothing.

The internationally-focused newscast created a stir upon its launch in 1999, but has since expanded with online viewers in 172 nations. A male version failed shortly after it launched.

Naked News President David Warga commented in a press release that "our intention at Naked News is to be a global media source, much like CNN or BBC World. We are looking forward to expanding into other languages as well, because there is definitely a market demanding our brand of infotainment."

Unlike the foreign stations run by the &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the international broadcasts will not be produced by the company. Branding and practices will be licensed to the other production and distribution companies.

Warga claims that, instead of presenting the naked female form as "fluff-head bimbos", their news organization "encourages society to see women as being smart, powerful, and sophisticated." Despite this, the press release lists hotel rooms as being one of the primary distribution methods; hotels account for a large segment of the pornography industry's broadcast market.

The third &lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; commenced on Wednesday at the &lt;a href="w%3AWACA%20Ground"&gt;WACA&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;. 

India won the toss, and Indian captain &lt;a href="w%3AAnil%20Kumble"&gt;Anil Kumble&lt;/a&gt; elected to bat. India quickly made a half century in nine overs. Shortly after, the first wicket fell with &lt;a href="w%3AVirender%20Sehwag"&gt;Virender Sehwag&lt;/a&gt; caught behind by &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Gilchrist"&gt;Adam Gilchrist&lt;/a&gt; for 29 runs. About half an hour before lunch with three more overs, the next wicket fell when Gilchrist also caught &lt;a href="w%3AWasim%20Jaffer"&gt;Wasim Jaffer&lt;/a&gt;. 

India were 2/74 at lunch, and played well during the afternoon, losing no wickets. &lt;a href="w%3ARahul%20Dravid"&gt;Rahul Dravid&lt;/a&gt; was dropped on 11 runs by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Clarke%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Michael Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, and went on to share a partnership of 139 runs with &lt;a href="w%3ASachin%20Tendulkar"&gt;Sachin Tendulkar&lt;/a&gt; as India reached 2/177 at tea. 

In the last session India put on 120 runs, losing four wickets, including two just before stumps. Brett Lee trapped &lt;a href="w%3Aleg%20before%20wicket"&gt;lbw&lt;/a&gt; Tendulkar (71), while &lt;a href="w%3ASourav%20Ganguly"&gt;Sourav Ganguly&lt;/a&gt; fell for just nine runs soon afterwards. Dravid reached 93 runs before being caught by &lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Ponting"&gt;Ricky Ponting&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AV.%20V.%20S.%20Laxman"&gt;V. V. S. Laxman&lt;/a&gt; was dismissed for 27 runs shortly before the close of play. India finished the day on 6/297.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Lee"&gt;Brett Lee&lt;/a&gt; was the leading wicket taker, tallying 3 wickets.

Australia lead the four match Test series 2-0, after a &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Test%2C%202007-08%20Border-Gavaskar%20Trophy"&gt;controversial second Test&lt;/a&gt; prompting India to threaten to pull out of the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%202007-08"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt;.

Two days before ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise%3A%20An%20Unauthorized%20Biography"&gt;Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a biography of actor &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href="w%3Ajournalist"&gt;journalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Morton"&gt;Andrew Morton&lt;/a&gt;, was released in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, a video showing Cruise promoting &lt;a href="w%3AScientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; was leaked to the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. The promotional video appeared on video-sharing sites including &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARadar%20%28magazine%29"&gt;radar online.com&lt;/a&gt;, and clips from the video were also shown on Wednesday morning talk shows in the United States. 

In the 9-minute video produced by the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;, Cruise is seen discussing his beliefs while the theme from his ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMission%3A%20Impossible%20%28film%29"&gt;Mission: Impossible&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ films plays as background music. Cruise appears wearing a black turtleneck sweater, speaking about his dedication to changing people's lives. The format of the video appears to be an interview with Cruise, and it is edited with questions cut out. Some of Cruise's responses end abruptly.
Throughout the video, Cruise uses &lt;a href="w%3AScientology%20terminology"&gt;Scientology jargon&lt;/a&gt; terms such as "KSW": "For me, it’s all about KSW." The term stands for Keeping Scientology Working, which refers to a 10-point letter written by Scientology founder &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt; in 1965 to ensure the organization's survival. Cruise also discusses "SPs", or &lt;a href="w%3ASuppressive%20Person"&gt;Suppressive Persons&lt;/a&gt;, "PTSPs", a "potential trouble source" influenced by a Suppressive Person, and the need to "confront and shatter suppression".

Cruise makes assertions about programs which use Hubbard's teachings such as &lt;a href="w%3ACriminon"&gt;Criminon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANarconon"&gt;Narconon&lt;/a&gt; "We're the authorities on getting people off drugs. We're the authorities on the mind. We're the authorities on improving conditions. We can rehabilitate criminals. Way to happiness. We can bring peace and unite cultures." Of the manner in which he wishes to spread Scientology's message, he says "You're in the playing field or out of the arena." Cruise also expresses his &lt;a href="w%3AScientology%20and%20psychiatry"&gt;disdain for psychiatrists&lt;/a&gt;, "Crush these guys [psychiatrists]! I've had it! Psychiatry doesn't work. No mercy! None! Go to guns!"

The video concludes with Cruise laughing, and then a voiceover says: "Scientology can be defined by a single question: would you want others to develop the knowledge you have? In answering that question, Tom Cruise has introduced LRH [L. Ron Hubbard] technology to more than 1 billion people on earth. And that is only the first wave he has unleashed. That is why the story of Tom Cruise, Scientologist, has only just begun." 
According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the Church of Scientology stated that the video was shown at a 2004 meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Association%20of%20Scientologists"&gt;International Association of Scientologists&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement, the Church of Scientology said that the video was Cruise's acceptance speech after he had been given the organization's "Freedom Medal", and was shown "before an audience of 5,000 church parishioners and their guests." The statement also called the video that appeared on the Internet a "pirated and edited version." A representative for Cruise confirmed the Church of Scientology statement: "The video is of Mr. Cruise making an acceptance speech to fellow parishioners at a private church event in 2004." &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miscavige"&gt;David Miscavige&lt;/a&gt;, head of the Church of Scientology, had presented Cruise with the "Freedom Medal of Valor" at the 2004 ceremony. Eighty Scientologists have received the "Freedom Medal" since the award's establishment in 1985, but Cruise is the only recipient of the Freedom Medal of Valor. Andrew Morton's ♡❤Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography♡❤ characterizes Cruise as the second most powerful individual within the organization.
The video first appeared on the Internet on Sunday, and disappeared after the footage was linked to from Gawker.com and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Huffington%20Post"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;. Gawker.com posted a copy of the video Tuesday morning, and said that the video had "been passed around privately by reporters and writers investigating Cruise's ties to Scientology." Gawker.com noted that a smaller video clip which had previously been available on YouTube "is no longer available, most likely after the Church of Scientology sent in a copyright infringement notice." Gawker.com has stated that the video will stay up on its site, and has reprinted correspondence with Ava Paquette, an attorney with &lt;a href="w%3AMoxon%20%26amp%3B%20Kobrin"&gt;Moxon &amp; Kobrin&lt;/a&gt;, a law firm representing the Church of Scientology. Nick Denton of Gawker.com commented on the posting of the video "It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it."
&lt;a href="w%3AInvestigative%20journalism"&gt;Investigative journalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Ebner"&gt;Mark Ebner&lt;/a&gt; is helping to post more than two hours of additional footage related to the Cruise video, and called it "the most unintentionally hilarious footage you've ever seen," and characterized it as "better than" when Cruise &lt;a href="w%3AJumping%20the%20couch"&gt;jumped on Oprah's couch&lt;/a&gt; during a May 23, 2005 appearance on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20Show"&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Park"&gt;South Park&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ parody of Cruise in the controversial episode "&lt;a href="w%3ATrapped%20in%20the%20Closet%20%28South%20Park%29"&gt;Trapped in the Closet&lt;/a&gt;". Ebner appeared on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AToday%20%28NBC%20program%29"&gt;The Today Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Wednesday, and discussed the video's appearance on the Internet. In response, the Church of Scientology called Ebner a "fraud". Ebner told the ♡❤New York Daily News♡❤ that "These tapes were made for purposes of recruitment."
Attempts by the Church of Scientology to stop distribution of the video via the Internet "seem to have backfired spectacularly," according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Press%20Association"&gt;The Press Association&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and by Thursday the video was viewable on websites other than Gawker.com, including the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Post"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3AITN"&gt;Independent Television News&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. For websites based in Britain usage of the video is protected under copyright laws, specifically for reporting news and current affairs. Still other reports on the video linked to locations where it could be watched, including a report in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Copies of the video were not available on &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Video"&gt;Google Video&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, but were still available on YouTube.

Attorney Mark Stephens of London-based firm Finers Stephens Innocent commented on the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove the video from the Internet: "The Scientologists, by taking action to enforce their copyrights, have made it a news story. The mistake was not to foresee that a news story has special protection in copyright law in reporting news and current events."

<h1>News briefs:January 17, 2008</h1>
<h2>Wikinews News Brief [Date]</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
[Opening music] This is Wikinews News Brief, summarising the current news on [Day] [Date] [Month] 2008 at [HH]:[MM] hours UTC. I’m Nicholas Turnbull.

<h2>Events of worldwide notability, military action, disasters etc.</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Nearly%20two%20dozen%20people%20killed%20in%20bomb%20blast%20on%20bus%20in%20Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Nearly two dozen people killed in bomb blast on bus in Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
In Butthala, Sri Lanka, a bomb exploded on a civilian bus on Wednesday the 17th, killing at least twenty-three people and wounding a total of seventy. Approximately fifty people were travelling on the bus, the majority of whom are said to be school-children; the additional casualties were caused by those in proximity to the vehicle on detonation of the weapon. According to a spokesman from Sri Lanka's defence ministry, all of the wounded were civilians; the spokesman further added that terrorists are becoming desperate in the area where the attack took place thus changing their focus to attacks on civilian targets. No claim of responsibility has yet been made by any terrorist groups for the bombing, and Sri Lankan police are yet to place blame on any specific party; however, some unnamed sources within Sri Lanka have speculated that the rebel group known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, may have carried it out. This follows shortly after a cease-fire agreement between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government was terminated by Sri Lanka on the grounds that it had become meaningless.

<h3>&lt;a href="Japanese%20detain%20two%20anti-whaling%20activists%2C%20deny%20abuse%20claims"&gt;Japanese detain two anti-whaling activists, deny abuse claims&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Two Sea Shepherd Conservation Society anti-whaling activists were detained in the Southern Ocean on Wednesday the 15th at 0600 hours UTC by a whaling ship belonging to the Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research, a Government-operated organisation that undertakes limited whaling activities ostensibly for the purposes of conducting scientific research. Japan's scientific whaling activities have been under severe criticism by activists such as those from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, who state that such whaling is illegal and is in fact for commercial purposes. The activists, who were on the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's vessel ♡❤Steve Irwin♡❤, appear to have attempted to board the ♡❤Yushin Maru No. 2♡❤, claiming that they were attempting to deliver a letter to the Japanese whalers asking them to leave the Antarctic. They admit, however, to having thrown stink bombs onto her decks. The two men are currently under detention by Japanese authorities, who state that they will release the men only if the activist organisation agrees to conduct no further protests. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society claims that their men were subjected to severe physical abuse at the hands of the Japanese authorities, including being strapped to a mast in extremely cold conditions; a Japanese spokesperson strongly denies these allegations. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has stated that they are not prepared to negotiate with the Japanese authorities and demand unconditional release of their personnel.

<h3>&lt;a href="George%20Bush%20completes%20his%20Middle%20East%20tour"&gt;George Bush completes his Middle East tour&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
United States president George W. Bush completed his tour of the Middle East, in which he sought to encourage Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak demonstrated endorsement for Mr. Bush's claimed cause, saying that he supports Israel's efforts to reach agreement on the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Bush, speaking at a joint apparance in front of reporters at the end of consultations between himself and Mubarak, expressed his optimism that an agreement can be reached through the support of both the Israeli and Palestinian governments towards a two-state solution, and further affirmed his endorsement to the goal that the peace process will be completed by the end of the year. Bush's tour continued amid demonstrations and angry press coverage throughout Egypt, describing this reaction as a vivid display of freedom of speech in Egypt.

<h3>&lt;a href="Taliban%20attacks%20hotel%20in%20Kabul%2C%20seven%20killed"&gt;Taliban attacks hotel in Kabul, seven killed&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

<doc id="96448" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=96448" title="Dam removal proposal for Klamath River">
<h1>Dam removal proposal for Klamath River</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Dam%20removal%20proposal%20for%20Klamath%20River&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A proposal was made to remove four hydroelectric power generating dams across the &lt;a href="w%3AKlamath%20River"&gt;Klamath River&lt;/a&gt; in Southern &lt;a href="w%3AOregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; and Northern &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. Intended to improve the habitat and range of &lt;a href="w%3Asalmon"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, the project requires agreements with the dams’ owner &lt;a href="w%3APacifiCorp"&gt;PacifiCorp&lt;/a&gt; and several federal government agencies. A coalition of Native American tribal leaders, fishermen, farmers, various governmental agencies, and environmental groups developed the proposal after two-years of negotiations. 

The project would cost an estimated $1 billion to complete, and would be the largest project of its kind in U.S. history. The earliest dam removal would begin is 2015.

WaterWatch, Oregon Wild, the &lt;a href="w%3AHupa"&gt;Hoopa Valley Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and some farmers oppose the proposed agreement for a variety of reasons. 

If implemented the removal would allow for 300 more miles of river habitat for spawning salmon. It would also include a new tribal reservation covering 90,000 acres for the Klamath Tribe. Funding has yet to be allocated for the entire project that includes habitat restoration in addition to the removal of the dams. 

Additionally, it has yet to be determined who would pay for the actual demolition of the dams owned by PacifiCorp. Discussions that led to this proposal began in 2004 after PacifiCorp applied to renew its power generating licenses for its dams on the river.

Thursday was the second day of play in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%202007-08%233rd%20Test"&gt;third test&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AWACA%20Ground"&gt;WACA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; resumed their first innings at 6/297. Australia took the remaining four wickets before the lunch break. &lt;a href="w%3AMahendra%20Singh%20Dhoni"&gt;Mahendra Singh Dhoni&lt;/a&gt; (19) and &lt;a href="w%3AIrfan%20Pathan"&gt;Irfan Pathan&lt;/a&gt; (28) both fell &lt;a href="w%3Aleg%20before%20wicket"&gt;lbw&lt;/a&gt; in successive overs. India reached 330 all out with the loss of &lt;a href="w%3AAnil%20Kumble"&gt;Anil Kumble&lt;/a&gt; for one run and &lt;a href="w%3AR.%20P.%20Singh"&gt;R. P. Singh&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href="w%3Aduck%20%28cricket%29"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;.

Australia struggled early on as Irfan Pathan dismissed both Australian openers for less than ten runs each and &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hussey"&gt;Michael Hussey&lt;/a&gt; was caught behind without scoring. At lunch, Australia were 3/22. The next session, Australia played well, despite losing &lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Ponting"&gt;Ricky Ponting&lt;/a&gt; (20) and &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Clarke%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Michael Clarke&lt;/a&gt; (23), coming to the tea break with a score of 5/148. However, in the last session of the day India took five wickets, sending Australia all out with a score of 212 after fifty overs. &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Symonds"&gt;Andrew Symonds&lt;/a&gt; was Australia's top scorer with 66 runs, while &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Gilchrist"&gt;Adam Gilchrist&lt;/a&gt; made 55. &lt;a href="w%3AR.%20P.%20Singh"&gt;R. P. Singh&lt;/a&gt; took four wickets for India.

In reply, India are 1/52 at stumps having lost &lt;a href="w%3AWasim%20Jaffer"&gt;Wasim Jaffer&lt;/a&gt; for 11 runs just before the close of play.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20Airways%20flight%20lands%20short%20of%20runway%20at%20London%20Heathrow%20Airport&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; flight from &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; with 152 people on board has landed short of the runway at &lt;a href="w%3AHeathow%20airport"&gt;Heathow airport&lt;/a&gt; near London. One hundred and thirty six passengers and sixteen crew have been evacuated from the plane and thirteen people are reported to have sustained minor injuries.

Reports suggest that the cause of the incident was a "total loss of power and avionics" in the plane, meaning that the pilot had to glide the plane towards the runway area.

&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways%20Flight%20BA38"&gt;Flight BA038&lt;/a&gt; from Beijing to Heathrow, a twin-engined &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20777"&gt;Boeing 777-236ER&lt;/a&gt;, carried out an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport 12.42 p.m. local time, according to a Heathrow airport statement. 

The incident has delayed the flight carrying UK Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, who is flying to Beijing today on a visit to &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. 
Witnesses said the plane flew low on its approach, touched down on grass short of the runway and came to a halt on its belly at the edge of the runway. Passengers were quickly evacuated by emergency chutes as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The plane's undercarriage broke off during the landing and both wings as well as the starboard engine are badly damaged.

In a press statement, BA said it is "very proud" of the way its staff - three flight crew and thirteen cabin crew - safely evacuated passengers with only six minor injuries resulting. 

The southern runway has been closed for operations and has resulted in all European short haul flights from Terminals 1, 2 and 3 being cancelled. Passengers travelling by Heathrow have been advised to check their flight status before arriving at the airport.

Four male members of the &lt;a href="w%3Apaparazzi"&gt;paparazzi&lt;/a&gt; were arrested and charged on Wednesday with reckless driving in &lt;a href="w%3AMission%20Hills%2C%20California"&gt;Mission Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; after following &lt;a href="w%3ABritney%20Spears"&gt;Britney Spears&lt;/a&gt; back to her mansion. At least four others were also stopped by police, but were not arrested.

According to reports, police witnessed the entire incident saying that a fleet of paparazzi were following Spears at a high rate of speed around 11:20 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;PST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-8"&gt;UTC-8&lt;/a&gt;). They also say they followed her too closely and made unsafe lane changes in order to follow her. Police also say that at least one of cars following Spears, who was driving her car, tried to run her off the road, but she was not able to identify the vehicle or the occupants.

Spears was also stopped by police. They are reported to have verified her identity, and released her. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATMZ.com"&gt;TMZ.com&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that police were checking to see if her license was valid, and was surprised that it was. Spears was not charged with anything and despite the paparazzis' recklessness, Spears did not want the men arrested.

"Britney Spears was part of the group, but was not driving recklessly," said spokeswoman for the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; Police Department, Sara Faden.

&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; resumed their second innings on 1/52 at the beginning of the third day. &lt;a href="w%3AVirender%20Sehwag"&gt;Virender Sehwag&lt;/a&gt; (43) was bowled by &lt;a href="w%3AStuart%20Clark"&gt;Stuart Clark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARahul%20Dravid"&gt;Rahul Dravid&lt;/a&gt; was caught behind off &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Lee"&gt;Brett Lee&lt;/a&gt; in the following over, having scored just three runs. Lee also dismissed &lt;a href="w%3ASachin%20Tendulkar"&gt;Sachin Tendulkar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aleg%20before%20wicket"&gt;lbw&lt;/a&gt; for 13 runs while &lt;a href="w%3ASourav%20Ganguly"&gt;Sourav Ganguly&lt;/a&gt; was caught by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Clarke%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Michael Clarke&lt;/a&gt; at first slip for a &lt;a href="w%3Aduck%20%28cricket%29"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;. India reached 5/158 by the lunch break.

&lt;a href="w%3AIrfan%20Pathan"&gt;Irfan Pathan&lt;/a&gt; scored 46 runs before he was caught by &lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Ponting"&gt;Ricky Ponting&lt;/a&gt;, leaving India on 6/160. However &lt;a href="w%3AV.%20V.%20S.%20Laxman"&gt;V. V. S. Laxman&lt;/a&gt; (79) and &lt;a href="w%3AMahendra%20Singh%20Dhoni"&gt;Mahendra Singh Dhoni&lt;/a&gt; (38) shared a 75-run partnership to bring India to 8/245 at tea. Laxman and &lt;a href="w%3AR.%20P.%20Singh"&gt;R. P. Singh&lt;/a&gt; (30) shared a partnership of 51 runs before India were bowled all out for 294 runs, a lead of 413. Stuart Clark was the pick of the Australian bowlers, taking 4/61.

Australia played fifteen overs of their second innings on the third day, but were reduced to 2/43 after Irfan Pathan removed both opening batsmen. At the close of play Australia were 2/65.

Resuming their final innings on day four, Australia needed a further 348 runs to win. Ricky Ponting was the only batsman to be dismissed in the morning session, scoring 45 runs and sharing 74 with &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hussey"&gt;Michael Hussey&lt;/a&gt;. Hussey went on to make 46 before being dismissed lbw by R. P. Singh. Despite an innings of 81 from Michael Clarke and 50 from &lt;a href="w%3AMitchell%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Mitchell Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, Australia were bowled out for 340 runs, 73 runs short of India's total.

Australia lead the four match Test series 2-1, with the final Test to be played in &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; starting on 24 January.

Information on 650,000 credit card holders held by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; retail stores is reported to be lost. The lost data includes 150,000 social security numbers.

Card holder data from &lt;a href="w%3AJ.%20C.%20Penney"&gt;J.C. Penney&lt;/a&gt; and other major retailing outlets was being stored on a backup computer tape owned by &lt;a href="w%3AGE%20Consumer%20Finance"&gt;GE Consumer Finance&lt;/a&gt; and went missing in October. Theft or foul play is not believed to be involved.

The tape's last known whereabouts was a storage facility operated by &lt;a href="w%3AIron%20Mountain%20Incorporated"&gt;Iron Mountain Incorporated&lt;/a&gt;. There are no records of the tape being signed out, but no one is able to locate it. The location of the facility is not yet known.

None of the accounts have been compromised and GE says that the tape does not contain enough information on one individual to open another card account. GE will offer all of those affected 12 months of free credit monitoring.

Iron Mountain says that only an individual with "special skills" could access any of the data on the tape, but they regret the incident because they have made mistakes in the past.

Dubbed as one of the world's greatest &lt;a href="chess"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; players of all-time, &lt;a href="Bobby%20Fischer"&gt;Bobby Fischer&lt;/a&gt; has died at the age of 64 from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arenal%20failure"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , according to his spokesman Gardar Sverrisson. He died in &lt;a href="Iceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; at a hospital in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReykjav%C3%ADk"&gt;Reykjavík&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Fischer is most known for beating his opponent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Spassky"&gt;Boris Spassky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the then &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1972, to become the first and so far only &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; world champion chess player. He became a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrandmaster%20%28chess%29"&gt;Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in August of 1958 at the young age of 15.

Fischer was also a fugitive of the U.S. after violating the terms of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; sanctions by going to an island of the former country of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYugoslavia"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1992 to play Spassky in a rematch, and won. He was detained in &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; for nine months through 2004 and 2005, accused of trying to leave the country on a revoked U.S. passport. After his detainment he was granted Icelandic citizenship and moved to the country in 2005, instead of being deported to the U.S. by the Japanese government.

"[Fischer was] the pioneer, some would say the founder, of professional chess. [His death is] very sad news," said &lt;a href="Garry%20Kasparov"&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/a&gt;, a former world champion of chess.

Fisher was born on March 9, 1943 in &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; theatrical &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt; have been added to the billing of the upcoming Castle Festival in &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;.

The event will take place at the &lt;a href="w%3ASmederevo%20Fortress"&gt;Smederevo Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASmederevo"&gt;Smederevo&lt;/a&gt; across July 1-5. Over 70 bands will perform at the festival.

Festival organisers released a statement saying “Lordi is very popular in Serbia amongst &lt;a href="w%3Aheavy%20metal"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; bands. They revolutionised &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision"&gt;Eurovision&lt;/a&gt; with their rock song”. This refers to Lordi's victory at the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest, at which their song ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHard%20Rock%20Hallelujah"&gt;Hard Rock Hallelujah&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ scored a record 292 points and gave Finland their first win at the contest.

The bands scheduled span a wide range of rock and metal genres. Amongst the other acts already confirmed to appear are &lt;a href="w%3AJudas%20Priest"&gt;Judas Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHelloween"&gt;Helloween&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASoilwork"&gt;Soilwork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEnsiferum"&gt;Ensiferum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAt%20The%20Gates"&gt;At The Gates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAvantasia"&gt;Avantasia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASodom%20%28band%29"&gt;Sodom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADismember%20%28band%29"&gt;Dismember&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaturnus%20%28band%29"&gt;Saturnus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AManticora"&gt;Manticora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASybreed"&gt;Sybreed&lt;/a&gt;.

In an exclusive report, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that on Wednesday two users, one anonymous and the other only known as , added code on the collaborative encyclopedia ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ for a computer virus known as the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AILOVEYOU"&gt;LoveLetter&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ or ILOVEYOU virus.

The users inserted the &lt;a href="w%3AVBScript"&gt;VBScript&lt;/a&gt; code into various pages including the &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3ASandbox"&gt;Wikipedia Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;, a page used for editorial testing. This was relatively harmless, as the code could not be activated despite causing some antivirus software to issue an alert.

A Wikipedia administrator began blocking the users and reverting their edits. "I went further and deleted the contributions of these editors where I could in the hopes of preventing follow-up attacks, copycat actions, and random editors stumbling into viral traps whilst walking through a page history", said &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AScientizzle"&gt;Scientizzle&lt;/a&gt;, the administrator who found the code and attempted to clean up the additions.

However, a major problem arose when he tried to delete the edits from the sandbox. This involves deleting the entire page and restoring good revisions, but the sandbox has such a "massive revision history" that this caused Wikipedia's servers to overload for half an hour, locking countless users out of editing the encyclopedia.

"My action caused the site to come to a screeching halt for half an hour and filled my [user discussion page] page with '&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AWhacking%20with%20a%20Wet%20Trout"&gt;wikitrout&lt;/a&gt;'," added Scientizzle jokingly.

Developers for &lt;a href="Wikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt; (the parent foundation of Wikipedia and its sister projects) quickly implemented a check on such massive deletions to prevent such an event from occurring again. &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ABrion%20VIBBER"&gt;Brion Vibber&lt;/a&gt;, Wikimedia's Chief Technical Officer, on the deletion of any page with more than 5000 revisions.

"A couple times a year somebody does something like trying to delete the Wikipedia:Sandbox, which reaaalllly bogs down the server due to the large number of revisions. While there are warnings about this, I'm hacking in some limits which will restrict such deletions to keep the system from falling over accidentally," said Vibber on a Wikipedia community discussion page.

Scientizzle was advised that the edits should have been removed via . Oversight is the process of deleting edits from public view, usually reserved for non-public personal information and libel, but also used for selective deletion of revisions on pages with extremely long edit histories. Only a few administrators have access to the process.

"I was advised that oversight was a better option for removing contributions on huge pages and, as such, contacted the oversight mailing list to request the complete deletion of all contributions by these users," added Scientizzle.

The ILOVEYOU virus or worm started in the on May 4, 2000 in e-mails titled 'I Love You'. Over the course of a single working day it spread across the entire globe, traveling to &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and then the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. At least 10% of the world's computers that had Internet access were infected with the virus. The virus overwrote files on computers with copies of itself, including system files and multimedia.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
According to scanner frequencies of the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; fire department, smoke was reported on at least five floors at the northeast side at &lt;a href="w%3AOne%20HSBC%20Center"&gt;One HSBC Center&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Buffalo. The call came in around 10:50 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20time%20Zone"&gt;Eastern Time&lt;/a&gt;) on Friday January 18, not long after the ending of the &lt;a href="NHL"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt; hockey game: the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Sabres"&gt;Sabres&lt;/a&gt; versus the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Thrashers"&gt;Atlanta Thrashers&lt;/a&gt; which was held at &lt;a href="w%3AHSBC%20Arena"&gt;HSBC Arena&lt;/a&gt;, a few blocks away from the tower.

According to firefighters communications the people that were on the 22nd floor made it out of the building safely. Firefighters saw "white smoke of varying intensities, believed to have been electrical" on floors 9 through 13. The source of the smoke was not identified, but the first alarm was on the 13th floor, followed by the 10th then the 9th.

Because of the cold temperatures and wind chills in the 10's, workers at the tower were allowed back into the first floor, which has been cleared by firefighters earlier in the call. 

At 11:41 p.m., firefighters gave the all clear to begin packing up with no conclusion as to where the smoke originated. They used ventilation fans to clear the floors of smoke and then shut them off to see if anymore smoke would reappear, which it did not. Remaining employees and personnel have since been allowed back to work. No damage is reported.

The tower, built in 1970, is the tallest in Buffalo and is home several agencies including the &lt;a href="w%3AConsulate%20General%20of%20Canada%20in%20Buffalo"&gt;Consulate General of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. HSBC currently occupies 75% of the tower which has 40 floors. It stands at 529 feet (161.2 meters) tall.

Matthew Higa, 23, has been arrested in connection with the death of a 23-month-old boy. Higa is alleged to have thrown the child from a pedestrian overpass into oncoming traffic on &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu%2C%20Hawaii"&gt;Honolulu's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%20H-1"&gt;H-1 Freeway&lt;/a&gt;. 

The local coroner's office noted that the child died on impact after falling 30 feet (9 meters) from the overpass. This occurred during Thursday's lunch rush hour in the heart of &lt;a href="w%3ADowntown%20Honolulu"&gt;downtown&lt;/a&gt;. Upon impact, several cars struck the child, which caused traffic to grind to a halt. 

The toddler, Cyrus Nainoa Tupaʻi Belt, was pronounced dead at the scene at 12:07 p.m. (2207 UTC), approximately 27 minutes after being allegedly being ejected from the overpass by Higa. The portion of H-1 was closed for approximately five hours with traffic diverted to side streets. The freeway was reopened in time for the evening commute.

At first the relationship between Higa and the child was unclear, but later reports stated that Higa lived adjacent to him and had babysat him on previous occasions. The boy's mother was out of town at the time of his death, but it was revealed that the child was supposed to be in the custody of his father and not with Higa.

Higa graduated from &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20Theodore%20Roosevelt%20High%20School"&gt;Roosevelt High School&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. In the summer of 2004 Higa was involved in an incident where police reports indicate a three-car race resulted in the death of a friend. Higa has since had a criminal history, with more than a dozen arrests but no convictions, and reports from neighbors of erratic behavior. 

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Queen%27s%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Queen's Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, which houses a psychiatric ward in Honolulu, noted that he was a patient there as recently as December 11, 2007. When arrested, Higa was wearing hospital scrubs, which were not immediately conducive to whether Higa was a patient in Queen's psychiatric wing in the last couple of days. A representative of Queen's declined to comment on whether Higa was admitted in the last week.

<h1>George Bush proposes economic growth package worth up to US$150 billion</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=George%20Bush%20proposes%20economic%20growth%20package%20worth%20up%20to%20US%24150%20billion&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has suggested an economic growth package that could be worth almost 1% of the United States' &lt;a href="w%3AGross%20Domestic%20Product"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt; (the US GDP is appoximately &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;15 trillion). The package is expected to come in the form of tax cuts. 

In a speech which took place yesterday Mr.Bush said that the economy is an area of "real concern," to the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Government"&gt;US government&lt;/a&gt;. He added that the US "economy is still creating jobs, though at a reduced pace."

&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; want the tax refunds to cover payroll taxes paid by lower-income groups and be combined with more unemployment benefits, food stamps and federal aid to states. It warned against bundling proposals to make Bush's first term tax cuts permanent with the stimulus package, and the Bush administration has separated the two in this proposal. 

When announcing the proposal George Bush said that "as Congress considers such a plan, there are certain principles that must guide its deliberations: This growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours -- which means it should be about 1 percent of GDP." He added that "this growth package must be built on broad-based tax relief that will directly affect economic growth -- and not the kind of spending projects that would have little immediate impact on our economy. This growth package must be temporary and take effect right away -- so we can get help to our economy when it needs it most." He also added that he believed the package "must not include any tax increases."
In the speech George Bush also made it clear that he believes the package should be passed through congress quickly. He said that his belief was that by passing the package through congress quickly would "provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy. And it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of our economy."

<h1>YouTube banned in Turkey once again</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=YouTube%20banned%20in%20Turkey%20once%20again&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The popular video website &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; has been blocked in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; once more. Several sources quote complaints against a video that insults &lt;a href="w%3AMustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk"&gt;Atatürk&lt;/a&gt;, founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey, as the reason for the block. On Friday, internet users in Turkey found the website replaced by a notice saying:

A &lt;a href="Court%20issues%20YouTube%20block%20in%20Turkey"&gt;Turkish court issued a similar order&lt;/a&gt; in March last year, after a row between Turkish and Greek users escalated and resulted in insults of &lt;a href="w%3AAtat%C3%BCrk"&gt;Atatürk&lt;/a&gt;, a serious offense in Turkey. Internet service providers such as Türk Telekom (the largest and formerly state-owned ISP) can use the &lt;a href="w%3ADomain%20name%20system"&gt;domain name system&lt;/a&gt; to put the ban into effect.

At the moment, it remains unclear which videos or comments exactly are to blame. Some media sources say that the video compared Atatürk with a monkey. This led some YouTube users to suspect that a video entitled '&lt;a href="http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Df_Sgs9QZahY"&gt;ataturk was a gay and a monkey turkey turkiye turks&lt;/a&gt;' led to the block. This video was added on November 7, 2007, and is a series of images with Atatürk's face on monkeys, homosexuals, obese individuals and several pictures of &lt;a href="w%3ABorat"&gt;Borat&lt;/a&gt;. The uploader of the video, known as gaymal45, has several other videos which mock Prime Minister Erdogan and President Abdullah Gül.

Under article &lt;a href="w%3AArticle%20301%20%28Turkish%20penal%20code%29"&gt;301 of the Turkish penal code&lt;/a&gt;, public denigration of Turkishness, the Republic of Turkey, Atatürk, and other national symbols, is punishable by imprisonment. The article received a lot of attention because it resulted in the prosecution of intellectuals like Literature Nobel Prize Winner &lt;a href="w%3AOrhan%20Pamuk"&gt;Orhan Pamuk&lt;/a&gt; and murdered journalist &lt;a href="Hrant%20Dink"&gt;Hrant Dink&lt;/a&gt;.

It is also unclear how long the ban would last. The ban in March was lifted after 3 days, when YouTube sent evidence to the Turkish prosecutor that the video had been removed.

<h1>Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton win Nevada Caucuses</h1>

Former &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; appeared be the winner Saturday in the &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; Republican Caucuses in the bid to be the next President of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

With 2% of the votes counted, Romney was leading his nearest competitors by more than a 3 to 1 margin, or having 45% of the votes. Romney, a Republican who polls between second and third nationally, appears to have been helped by concerns over the health of the U.S. economy, as well as worries over immigration. This is Romney's third win after winning his home state of Michigan's Republican primary on Tuesday and the Wyoming primary which was overshadowed by other contests

According to entry polls conducted by &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; on Nevada voters, immigration and the economy topped the list of concerns - far exceeding concerns about Iraq and the War on Terror, issues generally thought to be weak spots for the Romney campaign. 38% of those polled believed the economy comes first.

U.S. Representative &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; (R-&lt;a href="Texas"&gt;TX&lt;/a&gt;), a long-shot candidate who once ran on the Libertarian ticket, and U.S. Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; were in a fight for second. Paul has 14% with McCain currently trailing at 13%. Democrats also cast votes Saturday, with results expected later in the afternoon.

The Nevada caucuses were largely overshadowed by the Republican &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Carolina%20Republican%20primary%2C%202008"&gt;South Carolina primary&lt;/a&gt;, which is being held on the same day. This was part of a strange campaign irony, as Nevada will send more delegates to the Republican National Convention in September. South Carolina was stripped of half its delegates after violating party rules by holding a primary contest before Super Tuesday.

New York state Senator &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="w%3ANevada%20Democratic%20caucuses%2C%202008"&gt;Nevada Democratic Caucus&lt;/a&gt; with 52% of the votes needed to win beating her opponent &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; by 8% who had 44% of the votes. Hillary's win was boosted by minority &lt;a href="w%3ALatino"&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Awomen"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; voters. There was some controversy over the fact that some at-large Democratic caucuses would be held in casinos, giving casino workers a chance to vote, the Nevada State Education Association and six individuals filed a lawsuit claiming this was unfair and would give more delegates then other locations and that this violates state law. Due to the fact that some of the Nevada State Education Association's leaders have endorsed Clinton and that the fact the lawsuit was filed two days after the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 endorsed Obama, lead some political commentators to state it was a proxy battle between Obama and Clinton.

There are no survivors, and some sources place the death toll at 11 and others 12. It is thought that two of the deceased were &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; businessmen. Angola is a former colony of Portugal.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABeechcraft"&gt;Beechcraft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABeechcraft%20Super%20King%20Air"&gt;King Air B200&lt;/a&gt; twin-propeller aircraft registered D2-FFK had departed capital city &lt;a href="w%3ALuanda"&gt;Luanda&lt;/a&gt; at 1 a.m. EST on a 450 km (280 mile) domestic flight to Huambo. It belonged to &lt;a href="w%3AAeronautica"&gt;Aeronautica&lt;/a&gt;, the trading name of Gira Globo, an Angolan charter company. The crash occurred at around 0800 local time.

It is reported that prior to the crash the plane had attempted to land at two different local airports. A team from the Angolan Armed Forces based near the scene responded to the accident.

Celso Rosas, head of the national aviation centre, said adverse weather conditions may have played a role in the crash. Rain and fog were reported at the time. A full investigation has been ordered by André Luís Brandão, Angola's transport minister. This is to be headed by his deputy, Hélder Presa.

The Portuguese were identified as Vasco Mendes and Nuno Marques. Early reports suggest that Valentim Amoes, chairman of Gira Globo, is also amongst the dead.

Inadequate maintenance is the main cause of the nation's poor aviation safety record. Last year, &lt;a href="w%3Aflag%20carrier"&gt;flag carrier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATAAG%20Angola"&gt;TAAG Angola&lt;/a&gt; was added to the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;list of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;, and just hours after the news suffered a crash that killed six.

&lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Aircraft"&gt;Adam Aircraft&lt;/a&gt; Industries has laid off 300 members of its 800-strong workforce and suspended operations at their plant in &lt;a href="w%3AOgden%2C%20Utah"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;. The moves come as the result of unexpected financial difficulties.

In addition, Adam is transferring much of its work at &lt;a href="w%3APueblo%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Pueblo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; to its headquarters at &lt;a href="w%3ACentennial"&gt;Centennial&lt;/a&gt;. The only operations that are to continue in Pueblo is machine shop work. In addition to these three locations, Adam had previously been considering the possibility of a plant at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.

Fifty employees were laid off at the Ogden facility, 170 in Pueblo and 80 in Centennial. Ogdon is planned to remain inoperational for six months. Laid off workers may be able to obtain new positions within the company when production resumes.

Adam Aircraft are producing two carbon composite aircraft: the &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20A500"&gt;Adam A500&lt;/a&gt; twin-engine piston aircraft, which is certified and due to enter full production soon, and the &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20A700"&gt;Adam A700&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Avery%20light%20jet"&gt;very light jet&lt;/a&gt;, which is undergoing &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; federal certification processes.

Adam Aircraft spokesperson Shelly Simi said that the company is looking for between &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;75 million and $100 million, and that they are in talks with &lt;a href="w%3ACitibank"&gt;Citibank&lt;/a&gt; to secure these funds.

Adam secured $93 million in August 2006, and $105 million in June 2007. The A500 is valued at $1.2 million and the A700 at $2.5 million. Seventeen A500s have been manufactured, of which seven have been delivered to customers. The backlog of orders totals around $1 billion.

Adam Aircraft President Duncan Koerbel released a statement that said To provide for our future growth, we must be strategic in our focus by managing current cash expenditures to ensure adequate time to secure financing for the long term. We're off to a good start in this effort with assistance from our partner, Citibank, but we need to be able to provide them with sufficient time working with potential investors to secure long term financing."

Current &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20primary"&gt;presidential primary&lt;/a&gt; in his bid to become the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; candidate for &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt;.

With 97 percent of the votes counted, McCain was announced winner with 33 percent of the votes, followed closely by &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt;, who had just three percent less.

"I know it's not easy and we've got a long way to go. There are some tough contests ahead," said McCain.

In his concession speech, Huckabee vowed that his campaign will not falter. "The reason that I want to encourage you tonight is to remind you that politics ... is not an event. It is a process. And the process is far, far from over," Huckabee said.

&lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; representative &lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Hunter"&gt;Duncan Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, who had less than 1% of the vote, has now dropped out of the race.

The South Carolina primaries largely overshadowed the Nevada caucuses, being held the same day. Earlier that day in &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, former Governor &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Lady"&gt;First Lady&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; won the Republican and Democratic party primaries respectively. This was part of a strange campaign irony, as Nevada will send more delegates to the Republican National Convention in September. South Carolina was stripped of half its delegates after violating party rules by holding a primary contest before Super Tuesday.

&lt;a href="w%3Afr%3AAlain%20Jaubert"&gt;Alain Jaubert&lt;/a&gt;, director of the famous art program ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3Afr%3APalettes"&gt;Palettes&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤ by &lt;a href="w%3AARTE"&gt;Association Relative à la Télévision Européenne&lt;/a&gt; (ARTE) was invited by &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Television%20Service"&gt;Taiwan Public Television Service (PTS Taiwan)&lt;/a&gt; and the French Institute in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; to talk about productions on his art program on January 19 in Taipei City. He also talked about some experiences and functionalities on art programs with the Chairman of National Culture and Arts Foundation Mingchuan Huang.

According to PTS Taiwan, Jaubert failed at his first attempt to produce ♡❤"Palettes"♡❤ in 1984, but finally succeeded in 1987 after his proposal was recalled and Jaubery tried another production style to introduce history and background on establishments of notable pictures to &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. This program was finally recognized and encouraged by administration centers from three ancient monuments (&lt;a href="w%3ALouvre"&gt;Louvre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMus%C3%A9e%20d%27Orsay"&gt;Musée d'Orsay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACentre%20Georges%20Pompidou"&gt;Pompidou Centre&lt;/a&gt;). This also echoed Jaubert's words in his speech: "Without support by art comrades and those administrations centers, 'Palettes' would not exist; I wouldn't have become notable in Europe."

Before the Executive Panel, the PTS Taiwan screened highlights from some art programs including ♡❤"Pelettes"♡❤ by ARTE and ♡❤"Avant Guard Liberation"♡❤ by Mingchuan Huang. After the screening, executives talked about specifications on art programs and forecasted the future of directions on art programs world-wide.

<h1>Hackers attack Church of Scientology website</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hackers%20attack%20Church%20of%20Scientology%20website&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The attack was launched on Wednesday by a user labelled "Anonymous", on the website "Insurgency Wiki", a spinoff of &lt;a href="w%3A4chan"&gt;4chan&lt;/a&gt;. The "History" section of the site explains, in a satirical fashion, that the incident was prompted by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring &lt;a href="w%3AScientologist"&gt;Scientologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Though YouTube is complying with the Church of Scientology's requests to take down the video, other sites such as &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt; have stated that they will keep hosting the video. 
Writing in a blog post, Matthew Ingram of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Globe%20and%20Mail"&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ dubbed the ongoing conflict involving the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove the Cruise video from the Internet: "Scientology vs. the Internet, part XVII". He characterized the conflict between the Church of Scientology and anonymous posters of the Cruise video as "another small skirmish in a war that Scientology has been waging for almost 15 years, since the early days of newsgroups such as alt.religion.scientology, which posted internal church documents in 1994. Lawsuits have been filed, mailing lists have been shut down, homes of discussion group participants have been raided and their computers seized -- an all-out war."
One poster admitted to being a part of the effort, writing in a blog post "I have myself, as per instructions, loaded up Gigaloader and started bombarding the Scientology homepage. Theres [♡❤sic♡❤] something in the hilarious anarchy of the net that produces these 'events' every now and again." The poster wrote that "Prompted I think by the Tom Cruise video, a new obsession is taking hold on the internet. An insurgency against The Church of Scientology."

"Someone emailed me earlier today talking about a tool a group’s been using to attack the scientology website. It’s an interesting tool, created to overload/create malformed strings and crash a website’s database," said the post by an unknown author on ♡❤pigmy.♡❤

The Church's website is currently unreachable. Some individuals reported that when they are able to reach the site, all they get is a message stating, ♡❤"The word scientology means search for truth..."♡❤. As of 15:11 GMT the site was accessible again, but only loads at relatively slow speeds, and by the end of the day Saturday the site was not loading at all. 

Posts on the message board for the Scientology-critic site &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Clambake"&gt;Operation Clambake&lt;/a&gt; from Friday theorized that a &lt;a href="w%3ADenial-of-service%20attack"&gt;denial-of-service attack&lt;/a&gt; had occurred, and wrote that as of Friday the Scientology.org site was either not loading at all, or loading very slowly. Critics of Scientology at the Internet newsgroup &lt;a href="w%3Aalt.religion.scientology"&gt;alt.religion.scientology&lt;/a&gt; were critical of the attacks to the Church of Scientology website, with one poster writing "How can people look at both sides if one side is gone?"

Traffic to the Scientology website had already increased 18-fold prior to the attack, following increased attention after the Tom Cruise video appeared on the Internet. At that time, one in three visits to the site came from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and the website increased to number 3 in the company Hitwise UK's Lifestyle-Religion category.

Senior first officer John Coward feared everyone on board &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways%20Flight%2038"&gt;British Airways Flight BA38&lt;/a&gt; was going to die in a "catastrophic crash", the ♡❤Sunday Mirror♡❤ reports. Coward landed the Boeing 777, registration G-YMMM, by putting it down with a "series of thuds as it bounced along the grass" 400 metres short of the runway threshold, and just within Heathrow's perimeter fence at Hatton Cross last Thursday. All on board survived.

Speaking from his family home in France last night he said "As the final approach started I became aware that there was no power. Suddenly there was nothing from any of the engines, and the plane started to glide." This "total loss of power and avionics" occurred at a height of 600ft above Hounslow, two nautical miles from touchdown and within one minute's flying time of the airport. He added: "I didn't think we'd clear the fence at first. As we landed I was bracing myself for an enormous thud. But instead of one thud, there was a series of thuds as it bounced along the grass. Eventually it shuddered to a halt. While I was trying to stop the plane, I struggled to try and keep it in a straight line."

Co-pilot Coward was under the command of Captain Peter Burkill, who said Mr Coward had done a "most remarkable job" in landing the aircraft and praised him and all his crew for showing "the highest standards of skill and professionalism".

All 136 passengers and 16 crew on board escaped - 18 of the passengers needed treatment including one with a broken leg - there were no fatalities. The plane was removed from the end of runway 27L during the afternoon of Sunday 20th January.

Members of the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) have been working on G-YMMM (built in 2001 and one of 43 in the British Airways fleet) continuously since the crash-landing to determine the cause of the failure.

Following four days of prayer and discussions among the 217 electors representing more than 19,000 members worldwide, the &lt;a href="w%3ASociety%20of%20Jesus"&gt;Society of Jesus&lt;/a&gt;, whose members are also known as Jesuits, chose &lt;a href="w%3AAdolfo%20Nicol%C3%A1s"&gt;Adolfo Nicolás&lt;/a&gt; yesterday as their new &lt;a href="w%3ASuperior%20General%20of%20the%20Society%20of%20Jesus"&gt;Superior General&lt;/a&gt;.

Father Nicolás, 71, born in &lt;a href="w%3AVillamuriel%20de%20Cerrato"&gt;Villamuriel de Cerrato&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APalencia%20%28province%29"&gt;Palencia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, is now the thirtieth "black pope", as the Superior General is known for his black priest's vestments, of the largest &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20religious%20order"&gt;religious order&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AVatican%20City"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; reported that &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; was the first to know of the Jesuits' decision and immediately gave his required approval.

The Jesuit congregation in their headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, a block away from the Vatican, followed the unexpected resignation of Father &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hans%20Kolvenbach"&gt;Peter-Hans Kolvenbach&lt;/a&gt;, who requested, with the Pope's approval, that he be removed from his usually life-long position citing his old age (he turns 80 this year) and years of service to the order. 

Father Nicolás joined the order in Spain in 1953, traveled in 1960 to &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, was ordained in March 17, 1967 in &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, became director of the East Asian Pastoral Institute in &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, and later became moderator of the Jesuit Conference of East Asia and Oceania.

In addition to his native &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20language"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, Nicolás can speak &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20language"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20language"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20language"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt;.

The congregation is composed of days of prayer and quiet one-on-one conversations among the delegates. It is forbidden to &lt;a href="w%3ALobbying"&gt;lobby&lt;/a&gt; for the post, and anyone actively seeking to obtain the job is automatically disqualified.

The Standard Chartered Marathon, nicknamed "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Greatest%20Race%20on%20Earth"&gt;The Greatest Race on Earth&lt;/a&gt;", held its third stage in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; today. Because of the scorching hot weather in India, marathon runners had to adapt to the weather to overcome the challenge.

More than 30,000 runners participated in this race, joined by local NGOs and disabled who participated in a special charity short-distance running including 6km dream run, 4.3 km senior, and 2.5km wheel-chair classes. &lt;a href="w%3AGabriela%20Szabo"&gt;Gabriela Szabo&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; Olympic Gold Medalist, named as charity ambassador of the race, was pleased by the participation from experts and NGOs.

An hour into the race, former champion Daniel Rono and Joseph Kimisi took the lead, but then Tariku Jifar from &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; and defending champion John Ekiru Kelai took over Rono and Kimisi. After 40 kilometres, Kelai took a decisive lead and finally retained his champion title in 2 hours 12 minutes 22 seconds.

In the Women's Group, Mulu Seboka from Ethiopia won the champion with 2H30m03s. Local runners Surendra Singh &amp; Kavita Raut won the Men's and Women's Champions in the half-marathon class.

<h3>Suharto shows 'amazing signs of recovery'</h3>

Former &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3ASuharto"&gt;Suharto&lt;/a&gt;, 86, is now moving and speaking softly, doctors say. He was admitted to Pertamina Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; on January 4 after suffering multiple organ failure.

"He is fully conscious, he can follow instructions and answer our questions in a weak voice," Dr. Jusuf Misbach said. "He scratched himself and raised his hands. It's an amazing accomplishment."

Mardjo Soebiandono said that Suharto would be given &lt;a href="w%3Aphysiotherapy"&gt;physiotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, but he also stated that his condition is still considered critical.

According to doctors, Suharto's blood pressure is now stable, his heart and lungs are functioning better, and infections are being treated with &lt;a href="w%3Aantibiotics"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.

Preparations for a state funeral had begun last week when Suharto developed &lt;a href="w%3Apneumnonia"&gt;pneumnonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Asepsis"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;. He was given only a 50:50 chance of survival.

<h3>Zimbabwe, Zambia suffer widespread power outages</h3>
Major &lt;a href="w%3Apower%20outage"&gt;power outages&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Zambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; left many without services such as electricity, water, and mobile phone connections for much of Saturday and Sunday.

The blackout reportedly hit the two nations almost simultaneously on Saturday evening. In Zambia, the power was restored eight hours later, but residents of Zimbabwe had to wait until Sunday afternoon for power.

Officials in &lt;a href="w%3AHarare"&gt;Harare&lt;/a&gt; said the cause of the blackout was a fault that "tripped" the power grid, while some in Zambia blamed "turbine problems" at one of the country's &lt;a href="w%3Ahydroelectricity"&gt;hydroelectric&lt;/a&gt; dams.

40% of Zimbabwe's power is imported from neighboring countries like &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. As the power situation in South Africa has also been worsening, state utility company &lt;a href="w%3AEskom"&gt;Eskom&lt;/a&gt; announced it will stop supplying power to Zimbabwe and other countries in order to meet domestic needs.

He sailed the world's oceans in a &lt;a href="w%3Atrimaran"&gt;trimaran&lt;/a&gt; of his own making. 

The journey began November 23 in the port of &lt;a href="w%3ABrest%2C%20France"&gt;Brest&lt;/a&gt;. Joyon then sailed under the tip of &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and across the &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Hemisphere"&gt;Southern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt; before making his way back to France.

MacArthur was there to greet him when he landed on shore. "I'm really happy for him, proud of him," she said. "He was very fast, he played really well, and he really deserves this record." MacArthur had previously beaten Joyon's record in 2005.

"The speed part, the sailing passion part, that's extraordinary. But what is the strongest of all is having precious moments when you can be in harmony with the planet, with the elements. That is what will stay with me," Joyon said.

A poll of people in twenty-one Western and Muslim countries, surveyed by &lt;a href="w%3AGallup%20poll"&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Economic%20Forum"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that most people believe there are widening divisions between the Islamic and the Western world.

The survey also finds that increased interaction with the Muslim world is perceived as a threat by 60% of many European countries, but not so in &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;. This belief is strongest among respondents from &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the report found that in Muslim and non-Muslim majority nations, there tends to be a wide-spread belief that the "other side" is not committed to improving relations.

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; has today launched an advanced spy satellite, named &lt;a href="w%3ATecSAR"&gt;TecSAR&lt;/a&gt;, into orbit on board &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APolar%20Satellite%20Launch%20Vehicle"&gt;Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;. The PSLV successfully launched from &lt;a href="w%3ASatish%20Dhawan%20Space%20Centre"&gt;Satish Dhawan Space Centre&lt;/a&gt; at 3:45 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AGMT"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt; today, with a successful cast off from the launch rocket at around 4:05 a.m. GMT. &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Aerospace%20Industries"&gt;Israel Aerospace Industries&lt;/a&gt; report that the first signals were received 80 minutes after the launch, present at which were both Israeli and Indian space engineers.

The launch was delayed several times for unclear reasons. At one point, it was rumoured that the launch had been cancelled completely due to pressure from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; Government. Indian and Israeli authorities denied this, however, citing technical problems instead.

The satellite, also referred to as Polaris, is equipped with the latest in spy technology, including &lt;a href="w%3ASynthetic%20aperture%20radar"&gt;Synthetic aperture radar&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to provide details information on ground cover. The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;♡❤BBC♡❤&lt;/a&gt; also reports "enhanced footage technology" - which allows Israel to receive video and images at any time of day or night, and under any weather conditions. Israeli defence officials have said that the satellites main purpose is to track events in Iran, the countries' number one foe. The events that they wish to track include the Iranian nuclear programme, as well as military happenings in Iran and Syria.

The satellite is capable of a maximum resolution of 10 centimetres, of which the first images wil be available in "a few weeks." Development of the satellite has been quoted as "tens of millions of dollars" - and India is benefiting from a major boost in the commercialisation of the countries' 45-year-old space program - which hopes to compete with the US, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; in the satellite launch service field.

&lt;a href="w%3ATomislav%20Nikoli%C4%87"&gt;Tomislav Nikolić&lt;/a&gt; has won the first round of the &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASerbian%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;presidential election&lt;/a&gt; with nearly 40% of the vote, according to election officials. Incumbent &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Tadi%C4%87"&gt;Boris Tadić&lt;/a&gt; came in second with 35% of the votes. The two will face each other in a runoff election on February 3.

Coming in third was &lt;a href="w%3AVelimir%20Ili%C4%87"&gt;Velimir Ilić&lt;/a&gt; with about 7%, followed by &lt;a href="w%3AMilutin%20Mrkonji%C4%87"&gt;Milutin Mrkonjić&lt;/a&gt; with about 6%.

Tadic, a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28Serbia%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, has pro-Western attitudes and supports Serbian membership in the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. Nikolić, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ASerbian%20Radical%20Party"&gt;Serbian Radical Party&lt;/a&gt;, supports closer ties with &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, Serbia's historical ally. Both candidates are against &lt;a href="w%3AKosovo"&gt;Kosovan&lt;/a&gt; independence, which has been a major issue in the election.

"One thing is certain: This will be the tightest election ever in Serbia and the winner won't be known until the last second," said Marko Blagojevic of Belgrade's Centre for Free Elections and Democracy, a vote monitoring group.

There was a record 61% voter turnout in the first round of the election.

Today is &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Luther%20King"&gt;Martin Luther King&lt;/a&gt; day in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. The day has been commemorated by many people including US president George Bush. In a visit to the &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Luther%20King%20Memorial%20Library"&gt;Martin Luther King Memorial Library&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Bush said that he believed "Martin Luther King is a towering figure in the history [of the USA]." Barack Obama also marked the event by delivering a speech from the church which is seen by many to be the place where King became a prominent figure in the politics of the US.

<h3>New York</h3>
An event in New York was organized that involved attempting to get thousand citizens to perform activities that were intended to help the community. Hanako Ikeno, who helped co-ordinate the event said that this event was organized because she believed "that the message of Dr. King was that everyone can be great because everyone can serve."

<h3>George Bush</h3>

President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; attended the Martin Luther King Memorial Library and gave a speech to mark the event. Bush said that "Martin Luther King Day means two things to me. One is the opportunity to renew our deep desire for America to be a land of promise for everybody, a land of justice, and a land of opportunity. It's also an opportunity to serve our fellow citizens."

Later in the speech Bush continued, "Martin Luther King is a towering figure in the history of our country. And it is fitting that we honor his service and his courage and his vision. And today we're witnessing people doing just that by volunteering their time."

<h3>US Democratic party presidential candidates</h3>
Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton and John Edwards took part in a rally to commemorate Martin Luther King day. 

In the event Hilary Clinton asked the crowd to "Let us just take a moment to marvel at the progress we have made together." After saying that she added "But the work is far from finished, &lt;a href="w%3AI%20Have%20a%20Dream"&gt;the dream&lt;/a&gt; is not fulfilled." The use of the word dream was widely interpreted as reference to Martin Luther King.

Obama added to Clinton's speech by saying "It's not always easy to see past our differences, every day our politics fuels and explores these kinds of divisions."

John Edwards said that "All three of us [Democratic presidential candidates] are on the journey with you on the march to justice and equality."

<h3>US Republican party presidential candidates</h3>
Mike Huckabee made a speech from a church that was near the former home of Martin Luther King.

Mitt Romney also discussed Martin Luther King and civil rights. In his speech he stated that he believed "the great civil rights issue of our time, is making sure our inner-city schools are up to the task." He added that he believed inner-city schools fail in "too many ways."

Stock prices dropped sharply in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; Monday, with fears of economic problems in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; causing some of the biggest single-day losses in recent years.

In &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AHang%20Seng%20Index"&gt;Hang Seng index&lt;/a&gt; fell 5.5 percent - its biggest fall since the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks&lt;/a&gt;. Losses of between three and seven percent were recorded in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

While there are many factors linking national economies, analysts blame recent losses on fears of a recession in the United States.

The United States is the main export market for many overseas businesses. Foreign investors also have bought large stakes in U.S. companies.

When American home loan companies began reporting large numbers of defaulting loans in late 2007, the losses spread to other financial institutions, tightening credit markets and sparking worries about Americans' high levels of debt.

Last week, &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; proposed a $145 billion stimulus plan to encourage more consumer spending. But analysts say the measure may not be able to prevent a &lt;a href="w%3Arecession"&gt;recession&lt;/a&gt; - defined as a broad decline in a nation's economy over a period of at least six months.

U.S. markets are closed on Monday for &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr%20day"&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/a&gt; Day, a national holiday, but stock futures trading indicates further losses are expected when markets reopen Tuesday.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
A woman in Buffalo, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is in critical condition tonight at Sisters Of Charity Hospital after she accidentally set herself on fire.

The unnamed elderly woman was receiving &lt;a href="w%3Aoxygen"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; for medical problems in her home and lit a &lt;a href="w%3Acigarette"&gt;cigarette&lt;/a&gt;, and the oxygen coming from her mask facilitated the ignition of her clothing, setting her on fire.

Despite her "severe" burns as described by firefighters on radio communications, she was still able to dial the emergency line in the U.S., &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt;.

In the U.S. only 4% of all residential fires were reportedly caused by smoking materials in 2002. These fires, however, were responsible for 19% of residential fire fatalities and 9% of injuries. The fatality rate due to smoking is nearly four times higher than the overall residential fire rate; injuries are more than twice as likely. Forty percent of all smoking fires start in the bedroom or living room/family room; in 35% of these fires, bedding or upholstered furniture are the items first ignited.

Monsoonal rains in &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have caused massive flooding over two thirds of the state, and led Emergency Services Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Roberts%20%28politician%29"&gt;Neil Roberts&lt;/a&gt; to declare the town of &lt;a href="w%3AEmerald%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt; a disaster zone.

The floods, which first hit the north part of the state a week ago, have since spread as far south as &lt;a href="w%3ACharleville%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Charleville&lt;/a&gt;, where they have been compared to the floods which struck the town in 1990 and 1997, and stand in stark comparison to the &lt;a href="w%3ADrought%20in%20Australia"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt; that has plagued the area since 2003. Authorities believe that temporary floodbanks, erected near the town, will hold back the waters.

More than 2,000 people have evacuated from Emerald, and more than 200 homes are on standby to evacuate. According to Acting Mayor Kerry Hayes, "[t]he shopping centres are basically short of bottled water, bread and milk obviously and a lot of baby necessities", which will be brought in by rail as the town is currently cut off by road.

The Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt;, who visited Charleville, has pledged federal support during the disaster. Damage from the floods is predicted to be as high as &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;$A&lt;/a&gt;1 billion.

According to police in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; actor &lt;a href="w%3AHeath%20Ledger"&gt;Heath Ledger&lt;/a&gt;, 28, has died from a suspected overdose of prescription drugs. He was found by his housekeeper in his &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; apartment.

At about 3:26 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-5"&gt;UTC-5&lt;/a&gt;), the housekeeper was on her way to inform Ledger that his &lt;a href="w%3Amasseuse"&gt;masseuse&lt;/a&gt; had arrived when she discovered his naked body on the bed.

"We are investigating the possibility of an overdose," said a police spokesman. The ♡❤CourierMail♡❤ quotes &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; as saying that Ledger's body was found "surrounded by pills."

Ledger starred in the 2005 movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABrokeback%20Mountain"&gt;Brokeback Mountain&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ where he was nominated for the &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20Globe%20Award"&gt;Golden Globe Award&lt;/a&gt; for Best Actor. He also starred in the 2000 movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Patriot%20%282000%20film%29"&gt;The Patriot&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ with &lt;a href="w%3AMel%20Gibson"&gt;Mel Gibson&lt;/a&gt;.

Ledger is survived by his two-year-old daughter Matilda Rose, by ex-girlfriend &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Williams%20%28actress%29"&gt;Michelle Williams&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Fred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; has officially withdrawn his bid for the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; presidency. This announcement comes after Thompson's third place finish in the &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; Republican primary, in which he received 16% of the vote, trailing &lt;a href="Mike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;.

"Today I have withdrawn my candidacy for president of the United States," Thompson said today. "I hope that my country and my party have benefited from our having made this effort. &lt;a href="w%3AJeri%20Thompson"&gt;Jeri&lt;/a&gt; and I will always be grateful for the encouragement and friendship of so many wonderful people."
He hoped to do well in South Carolina after his disappointing showings in other primaries, including a sixth place finish in &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; and fifth place finishes in &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;.

Thompson's campaign began in September when he announced his candidacy on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Tonight%20Show"&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. However, this was long after the other Republican candidates had already started their campaigns. He had been contemplating a presidential bid since March and formed an exploratory committee in June.

Thompson served as a &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; senator for 8 years, from 1994 to 2002. He is also an actor who played a district attorney on the television series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20and%20Order"&gt;Law and Order&lt;/a&gt;.

The five Republicans left in the race are McCain, Huckabee, &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Rudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;.

The parliament of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; has approved a new &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Iraq"&gt;flag&lt;/a&gt; for the country.

The new design no longer has the three green stars of the old flag, as they represented the ideals of the &lt;a href="w%3ABaath%20party"&gt;Baath party&lt;/a&gt; - "Unity, Freedom, Socialism". &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; was a leading member of the Baath party before his rule was ended in 2003. 

The stars had upset many &lt;a href="w%3AKurdish%20people"&gt;Kurds&lt;/a&gt;, who viewed them as a symbol of the régime that had killed thousands of their people. &lt;a href="w%3AMassoud%20Barzani"&gt;Massoud Barzani&lt;/a&gt;, President of the semi-autonomous &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Regional%20Government"&gt;Kurdistan Regional Government&lt;/a&gt;, banned the flag in his region in 2006.

"The new flag has no signs of Saddam's regime and is a sign that change has been achieved in the country", said Humam Hamoudi, a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Islamic%20Iraqi%20Council"&gt;Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council&lt;/a&gt;.

The parliament voted 110-50 in favor of the change. They stated the new flag is only temporary, and that they will seek another redesign after a year has passed.

Parliament speaker Mahmud Mashhadani said the new flag will be flown from "constitutional and non-constitutional institutions", as well as in Kurdish regions and Iraqi embassies.

Some, like &lt;a href="w%3ASadrist%20Movement"&gt;Sadrist&lt;/a&gt; lawmaker Ahmed al-Masody, opposed the stars' removal. "We would have announced that they don't symbolize the Baath Party, but other principles, like justice", al-Masody said. He refers to a different proposal that would have changed the script's color to yellow and made the stars represent "peace, tolerance and justice".

The flag previously went through changes in 2004, when the &lt;a href="w%3AArabic"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; inscription "Allahu Akbar", meaning "God is great", was changed to a stylized &lt;a href="w%3AKufic"&gt;Kufic&lt;/a&gt; script. The words on the old flag were alleged to be in Saddam Hussein's handwriting.

Several websites relating to the Church of Scientology have been slowed down, brought to a complete halt or seemingly removed from the Internet completely in an attack which seems to be continuous. The scientology.org site was back online briefly on Monday, and is currently loading slowly. 

On Monday, the group released a video titled: "Message to Scientology" on YouTube concerning their intentions to attack the Church of Scientology. A robotic voice on the video begins with "Hello leaders of Scientology. We are Anonymous," and continues by explaining their motivations: "Over the years we have been watching you, your campaigns of misinformation, your suppression of dissent and your litigious nature. All of these things have caught our eye. With the leakage of your latest propaganda video into mainstream circulation the extent of your malign influence over those who have come to trust you as leaders has been made clear to us. Anonymous has therefore decided that your organisation should be destroyed." The message goes on to state that the group intends to "expel Scientology from the Internet". As of Wednesday, the video had been viewed 370,347 times, favorited 2,473 times, and is currently YouTube's top third video of the day.
The "Message to Scientology" video was highlighted as the "YouTube Video of the Week" by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMichigan%20Daily"&gt;The Michigan Daily&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Commenting on the video, the piece states "if this video is any indication, it seems like the assailants mean business". In a blog post on ♡❤&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; website, Jess Zielinski wrote that it was "not a shock that hackers hold a grudge against Scientology," and in a followup post on another ♡❤USA Today♡❤ blog, Angela Gunn wrote that "those of us who remember ... the adventures of Operation Clambake are fascinated to see this kind of thing flare up again". Blogging for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWired%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ magazine, Ryan Singel wrote about the incident in a piece on Wednesay titled "War Breaks Out Between Hackers and Scientology -- There Can Be Only One". Singel wrote that the Project Chanology wiki page "directs Anonymous members to download and use denial of service software, make prank calls, host Scientology documents the Church considers proprietary, and fax endless loops of black pages to the Church's fax machines to waste ink". According to ♡❤Wired♡❤, "The Church of Scientology did not immediately respond to a call for comment".

The viewpoints expressed in the video are echoed on the "Project Chanology" website, an open source of information and direction for those within Anonymous, which talks of tactics such as &lt;a href="w%3Ablack%20fax"&gt;blackfaxing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aprank%20calling"&gt;prank calling&lt;/a&gt; alongside other "real-life" methods of attack. The satirical website Encyclopedia Dramatica also has a similar page devoted to "Project Chanology".
"Anonymous" released a statement on Monday in the form of a press release, "Internet Group Anonymous Declares "War on Scientology": "Anonymous" are fighting the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center". In the statement, the group explained their goal as safeguarding the right to &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt; "A spokesperson said that the group's goals include bringing an end to the financial exploitation of Church members and protecting the right to free speech, a right which they claim was consistently violated by the Church of Scientology in pursuit of its opponents." The press release also claimed that the Church of Scientology misused copyright and trademark law in order to remove criticism from websites including &lt;a href="w%3ADigg"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube. The statement goes on to assert that the attacks from the group "will continue until the Church of Scientology reacts, at which point they will change strategy".

The attack was reportedly motivated by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring &lt;a href="w%3AScientologist"&gt;Scientologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; from YouTube. After the Church of Scientology lodged a copyright infringement complaint with YouTube, the site took down the video. The Tom Cruise video is still available on &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt;, which has stated it will not remove the video "It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it." 
Gawker.com discussed the actions of the "Anonymous" group, in a post on Monday titled "Scientology vs. the Internet: Why Kids On The Internet Are Scientology's Most Powerful Enemy". Gawker.com briefly outlined actions of other anonymous users critical of Scientology, including actions taken in the past by users of YouTube, Digg, and &lt;a href="w%3AYTMND"&gt;YTMND&lt;/a&gt; "This isn't the only group of Internet users unafraid of the intimidating cult; a whole range of sites has turned the Church into a mockery by doing what mainstream celebrity-coverage outlets wouldn't dare."

A poster on the newsgroup &lt;a href="w%3Aalt.religion.scientology"&gt;alt.religion.scientology&lt;/a&gt; (a.r.s.) was critical of the actions by the "Anonymous" group. In a post titled "Open Letter to Anonymous" Jeff Jacobsen, webmaster of lisamcpherson.org, posting as "cultxpt" wrote that "It's understandable that people get upset over the things the Church of Scientology has done online and off", pointing out that the Church of Scientology had "tried to shut down a.r.s.", and "spam our newsgroup to this day". In 1999 "&lt;a href="w%3ASporgery"&gt;sporgery&lt;/a&gt;", a form of nonsensical spam tactic, was used as an attempt to disrupt discussion on the newsgroup. Previously in 1995 &lt;a href="w%3AHelena%20Kobrin"&gt;Helena Kobrin&lt;/a&gt;, an attorney for the Church of Scientology, attempted to remove the a.r.s. group from &lt;a href="w%3AUsenet"&gt;Usenet&lt;/a&gt;. Kobrin sent a &lt;a href="w%3ARmgroup%20message"&gt;rmgroup message&lt;/a&gt; which stated: "We have requested that the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup be removed from all sites". This later led to a declaration of war by the &lt;a href="w%3Ahacker"&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href="w%3ACult%20of%20the%20Dead%20Cow"&gt;Cult of the Dead Cow&lt;/a&gt;, and an increase in popularity of the a.r.s site. This initial conflict came to be known as "&lt;a href="w%3AScientology%20and%20the%20Internet"&gt;Scientology versus the Internet&lt;/a&gt;".

The post from Jacobsen went on to criticize the actions of the "Anonymous" group, stating: "We're supposed to be the good people," and stated that contrary to the Anonymous group's tactics, "Our weapons as critics are reason, evidence, argument, and free speech".
On Tuesday, the founder of &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Clambake"&gt;Operation Clambake&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit organization and website critical of Scientology based in &lt;a href="w%3AStavanger"&gt;Stavanger, Norway&lt;/a&gt;, released a statement about the attacks by "Anonymous". &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Heldal-Lund"&gt;Andreas Heldal-Lund&lt;/a&gt; was critical of the "Anonymous" groups actions, stating: "The author of Operation Clambake does not condone such activity. Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card. They will use it to defend their own counter actions when they try to shatter criticism and crush critics without mercy." Heldal-Lund went on to emphasize the right of all people and organizations to freedom of speech - including the Church of Scientology: "Freedom of speech means we need to allow all to speak - including those we strongly disagree with. I am of the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people. I am still committed to fight for their right to speak their opinion."

Maverick Thomas, a baby, just over a day old is in critical condition at the &lt;a href="w%3AHennepin%20County%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Hennepin County Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;'s burn unit in &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; after his oxygen hood caught fire burning 18% of his body. He was under care by doctors at Mercy Hospital located in &lt;a href="w%3ACoon%20Rapids%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Coon Rapids&lt;/a&gt; when the fire occurred on Tuesday January 22.

Thomas, which is his middle name, had only been born 12 hours prior to the fire, nearly three weeks too early. He was receiving oxygen through a 'open-toped bassinet' when the gas contributed to igniting something inside his incubator, causing it to burst into flames.

Hospital staff, who were present when the incubator ignited, were able to quickly put out the fire, but not before Thomas suffered severe burns ranging from second degree to third degree. Doctors say that his condition is classified as life-threatening, but is expected to survive.

Police and fire officials are investigating the incident and are questioning hospital staff while searching for physical evidence as to what could has caused the fire. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; is also launching an investigation.

Officials have not released the &lt;a href="w%3Afamily%20name"&gt;family name&lt;/a&gt; to protect the privacy of the family.

The strange lights seen by dozens of &lt;a href="w%3AStephenville%2C%20Texas"&gt;Stephenville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; residents on the night of January 8 are now believed to have been &lt;a href="w%3AF-16"&gt;F-16&lt;/a&gt; fighter jets, according to a statement released by the &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Force%20Reserve"&gt;Air Force Reserve&lt;/a&gt;.

The press release states that ten F-16s from the &lt;a href="w%3ANaval%20Air%20Station%20Fort%20Worth%20Joint%20Reserve%20Base"&gt;Joint Reserve Base Naval Air Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Worth%2C%20Texas"&gt;Fort Worth&lt;/a&gt; were on a training mission near Stephenville the night of the sightings. The planes were said to have been in the area from 6:00 to 8:00 pm, which is around the time residents reported seeing the lights.

Officials at the Air Force base initially stated that none of its aircraft were in the area that night, but now say they made a mistake in their reporting.

"In the interest of public awareness, Air Force Reserve Command Public Affairs realized an error was made regarding the reported training activity of military aircraft," the press release says.

Major Karl Lewis, an Air Force Reserve spokesman, says the error resulted from an "internal communications oversight" at the reserve base. He had previously stated that the lights may have been an illusion caused by two commercial planes and the setting sun.

Lewis did not go into further details. "What we do down there falls under operational procedures that cannot be released because of operations security for our mission," he said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMutual%20UFO%20Network"&gt;Mutual UFO Network&lt;/a&gt;, which investigated the town last weekend, isn't quite convinced. Kenneth Cherry, the Texas director of the network, said, "I find it curious that it took them two weeks to 'fess up. I think they're feeling the heat from the publicity."

Steve Hudgeons, also of the Mutual UFO Network, said, "If this is a military exercise then I would like to see them get back over there in another 24 hours and repeat that exercise so that we can see them duplicate it."

The &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20Game%20Show"&gt;2008 Taipei Game Show&lt;/a&gt;, organized by the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), started at &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; today and ends next Monday (January 28). World-class gaming experts, governmental officials, and companies from the digital content industry gathered there for trade opportunities and to experience exchanging in the gaming industry.

Before the opening of the 2008 Taiwan Digital Contents Forum, Minister of Economic Affairs of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; Steve Ruey-long Chen, looked on a bright side of the gaming industry and said to executives and media: "We (the public) witnessed the grown up of gaming industry as digital content industry brought up value of production on retail and arcade games and indirectly brought up the population of gaming people in Taiwan."

Before that comment by Steve Chen, the 2008 Taiwanese Cyber-Gaming Competition was set up by the organizer and Industry Development Bureau of Ministry of Economic Affairs, supervisor of the "Digital Content Development Project in Taiwan". The organizer said he hopes this competition can market MIT (Made in Taiwan) games to the world and directly discover gaming talents and developers.

Not only did officials and executives come, but the TCA, Taipei Orphans Welfare Association, and Taiwan Gaming Industry Association also held special charity biddings to help orphan kids in Taiwan. At this special event, the TCA invited Shih-yuan Chou, Sean Hsing-an Chen, Chih-chung Chen, Wen-ting Tseng, and Hsueh-lin Li as the charity ambassadors.

Even with the weather on the down side in Taipei, nearly 10,000 people visited the show. According to the TCA, the peak number of visitors are expected to be on the weekend after several entertainers and sports-people made their stops at the show earlier.

The name for the newest &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Bond%20%28Character%29"&gt;James Bond&lt;/a&gt; film has been announced today. The 22nd film, previously known only as "Bond 22", will be called "&lt;a href="w%3AQuantum%20of%20Solace"&gt;Quantum of Solace&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;a href="w%3AEON%20Productions"&gt;EON Productions&lt;/a&gt; who are producing the film made the announcement today at &lt;a href="w%3APinewood%20Studios"&gt;Pinewood Studios&lt;/a&gt;, where production for the film has been under way since last year.

The name of the film was inspired by a &lt;a href="w%3AFor%20Your%20Eyes%20Only%20%26quot%3BQuantum%20of%20Solace%26quot%3B"&gt;short story (of the same name)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AFor%20Your%20Eyes%20Only"&gt;For Your Eyes Only&lt;/a&gt; by Bond creator, &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Fleming"&gt;Ian Fleming&lt;/a&gt;.

The film will be the second for star &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Craig"&gt;Daniel Craig&lt;/a&gt;, who first starred in &lt;a href="w%3ACasino%20Royale"&gt;Casino Royale&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, taking over from &lt;a href="w%3APierce%20Brosnan"&gt;Pierce Brosnan&lt;/a&gt;. Producer &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20G.%20Wilson"&gt;Michael G. Wilson&lt;/a&gt; has previously said that the film will continue "literally an hour after" Casino Royale's conclusion.

<h1>Asteroid to fly by Earth</h1>

On January 29, 2008, an asteroid that is between 500 and 2,000 feet in &lt;a href="w%3Adiameter"&gt;diameter&lt;/a&gt; (150 - 600m) will pass within 1.4 lunar distances (334,000 miles or 535,000 km) of &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; according to &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANear-Earth%20object"&gt;Near Earth Object&lt;/a&gt; program (NEO). For a brief time the asteroid will be observable in dark and clear skies with amateur telescopes of 3 inch apertures or larger.

&lt;a href="w%3A2007%20TU24"&gt;Asteroid 2007 TU24&lt;/a&gt;, discovered by the &lt;a href="w%3ACatalina%20Sky%20Survey"&gt;Catalina Sky Survey&lt;/a&gt; on October 11, 2007 is expected to reach a brightness magnitude of 10.3 on Jan. 29-30 before quickly becoming fainter as it moves further from Earth. To compare the asteroid's distance from Earth, the Moon is only 239,228 miles away from the planet.

It is estimated that nearly 7,000 asteroids of this size, both discovered and undiscovered are flying around space within a reasonable distance of Earth. An asteroid this big usually passes Earth about every five years or so. The average interval between actual Earth impacts for an object of this size would be about 37,000 years.

"If it [were to] hit in the ocean, which is more likely because two thirds of the Earth is ocean, it would create a tsunami, which would be devastating for the coastlines that happen to be nearby. It would be a huge local problem and the tsunami would be extraordinary if it hit in the ocean," said NEO manager Don Yeomans.

2007 TU24 will be the closest currently known approach by a potentially hazardous asteroid of this size or larger until 2027. Plans have been made for the &lt;a href="w%3AGoldstone%20Deep%20Space%20Communications%20Complex"&gt;Goldstone planetary radar&lt;/a&gt; to observe this object Jan 23-24 and for the &lt;a href="w%3AArecibo%20Observatory"&gt;Arecibo Observatory&lt;/a&gt; to observe it Jan 27-28 and then Feb 1-4. High resolution radar imaging is expected, which may permit later 3-D shape reconstruction.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Congressman and &lt;a href="2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 presidential candidate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Dennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt; has decided to quit his bid for the presidency and &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; nomination. 

Kucinich noted in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Plain%20Dealer"&gt;Cleveland Plain Dealer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on a interview on Thursday, that the Cleveland local and former mayor of the city was "transitioning out of the Democratic Presidential primary race" to focus on a "new direction." This comes a month after his youngest brother, Perry Kucinich, who had paranoid schizophrenia, was found dead. Kucinich told the Plain-Dealer he would make a longer statement on Friday.

Instead, Kucinich is going to focus on his re-election bid to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; because he is facing four other candidates in the Democratic primary for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOhio%27s%2010th%20congressional%20district"&gt;Ohio's 10th congressional district&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and has received criticism for spending more time on running for President than on the district which he has represented for the past 12 years. 

Kucinich has said he will not endorse another Democrat in the primary. This was his second run for the presidency, his first was the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2004%20United%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;2004 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="US%20Congress"&gt;Congressional&lt;/a&gt; leaders from both political parties have reached agreement on &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;150 billion in tax relief in an effort to help stimulate the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; economy. VOA White House Correspondent Scott Stearns has the story.

The agreement includes provision to give up to US$600 in tax rebates to millions of wage earners and an additional US$300 refund for each child. It allows businesses to immediately write off 50 percent of capital equipment purchases.

President Bush says it is an effective, robust and temporary set of incentives that will boost the economy and create new jobs.

"This package has the right set of policies and is the right size," he said. "The incentives in this package will lead to higher consumer spending and increased business investment this year."
The president says he knows Americans are concerned about their economic future, with the challenges of higher energy prices and a falling housing market slowing growth.

President Bush is urging the &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; to pass the agreement as soon as possible.

"We have an opportunity to come together and take the swift, decisive action our economy urgently needs," he added.

Stock markets around the world dipped sharply early this week amid widespread fears of a U.S. recession and its potential to drag down foreign markets as well.

The stimulus deal was an unusual display of bipartisanship in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; in the House making concessions to get the deal done quickly.

Republicans dropped a provision that would have allowed businesses to reclaim taxes previously paid. Democrats dropped their demands for increases in food stamps and unemployment benefits.
House Speaker Democrat &lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; says she is not totally pleased with the package, but knows it will help stimulate the economy.

"This bipartisan package should be acted upon rapidly and can help alleviate the economic pain felt by millions of Americans," she said.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Boehner"&gt;John Boehner&lt;/a&gt; is the leader of Republicans in the House of Representatives. He says it was not easy for Republicans and Democrats to agree on a plan, but he is confident it is in the best interests of the nation.

"This agreement is a big win for the American people," he said. "It will stimulate our economy in the most direct and effective way possible by putting money in the hands of middle income American families and by giving businesses incentives to create and build new jobs in our country."

Treasury Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Paulson"&gt;Henry Paulson&lt;/a&gt; was the president's lead negotiator with Congress.

"I know the work isn't done yet," he noted. "As the Speaker said, we've got more to do. And I am looking forward to working with the Senate and working with the House to get a package as soon as possible, because, again, speed is of the essence."

Senate Majority Leader Democrat &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; says he wants to get the plan to the president for signature by February 15. But changes in the Senate may slow passage of the package, as Reid says senators may consider restoring provisions to extend unemployment benefits.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMendoza%2C%20Argentina"&gt;Mendoza, Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The Argentinian federal judge Olga Arrabal ordered closure of public rebroadcasting station in &lt;a href="w%3AMendoza"&gt;Mendoza&lt;/a&gt; Province at request of Vila-Manzano Group, a monopolistic media conglomerate. 

The judge ordered the cessation of broadcasts by the local relay transmitter of &lt;a href="w%3ACanal%207%20Argentina"&gt;Canal 7&lt;/a&gt; television station in Mendoza's capital. The inhabitants of this city and Maipú, Luján de Cuyo, Lavalle, San Martín, Palmira, Junín, Santa Rosa, La Paz and Rivadavia Departments lost access to the public television.

The country's Media Secretary, Public Broadcasting System and Channel 7 will appeal the resolution of the Second Federal Court of Mendoza.

"We are going to do everything necessary to defend the right to the information", said Rosario Lufrano, the executive director of Canal 7. In addition, she added that they would go to Mendoza all the times that be necessary, since they had done it with &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Rafael"&gt;San Rafael&lt;/a&gt;, to achieve that all the citizens have free and free access to the unique national channel that has Argentina.

In 2007, Channel 7 had installed new relay in the cities of &lt;a href="w%3AMar%20del%20Plata"&gt;Mar del Plata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABariloche"&gt;Bariloche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANeuqu%C3%A9n"&gt;Neuquén&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Rosa"&gt;Santa Rosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AComodoro%20Rivadavia"&gt;Comodoro Rivadavia&lt;/a&gt;, San Rafael and Mendoza. Nevertheless, in San Rafael and Mendoza they had problems, due to the judicial presentations made by Vila-Manzano Group's companies.

A Commission of Neighbors called for a day of mobilization for the next January 30 in the downtown of Mendoza, to repudiate the measure adopted by the judge.

Morton makes some controversial assertions in the book, including that Cruise is second in command at the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href="w%3AScientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; was the cause of Cruise and &lt;a href="w%3ANicole%20Kidman"&gt;Nicole Kidman&lt;/a&gt;'s separation.

Cruise's attorney, &lt;a href="w%3ABertram%20Fields"&gt;Bertram Fields&lt;/a&gt; released a statement which said that the book was "absolutely loaded with false statements." Cruise has threatened a &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD$&lt;/a&gt;100 million lawsuit against Morton and the book's publisher, St. Martin's Press. The Church of Scientology also responded to Morton's claims in the book. In a 15-page statement, the Church called the book "bigoted" and a "defamatory assault," and said that Cruise "holds no official or unofficial position in the Church hierarchy."

Morton was interviewed by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and responded to some of the statements made by the Church of Scientology. When asked if he had attempted to interview Cruise for the book, Morton said "I asked Tom for an interview and he declined." In response to a statement released by Cruise's publicists that he had not interviewed "one person who has known or worked with Tom" in the past twenty-five years, Morton responded "I interviewed everyone from scriptwriters to producers to actors to actresses to teachers to girlfriends to pupils to Scientologists to people who have audited him." When questioned about his assertion that Cruise is "second in command" of the Church of Scientology, Morton stated "Scientology would be a shadow of what it is today if it had not been for the involvement of Tom Cruise."
Janet Maslin of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ wrote that parts of the book "push the limits of responsible reporting." A review in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Tribune"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was also critical, and Teresa Budasi wrote "If you read Andrew Morton’s unauthorized biography of Tom Cruise with a fan’s curiosity in one hand and a thinking person’s skepticism in the other, you’ll likely end up in the same place you were before you read it: not all that interested." In his review of the book, Dave Shiflett of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Wall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ commented on the litigious nature of the Church of Scientology, writing "Mr. Morton, apparently unfazed by the reputation of the group's notoriously hair-triggered legal department, leaves few stones unhurled."

Shortly before the book's publication, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring Tom Cruise promoting his beliefs appeared on the Internet. After the Church of Scientology sent a legal complaint to the online video-sharing website &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, the video was taken down from that site, but is available on &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt;. A group of Internet users calling themselves "Anonymous" subsequently announced a "War on Scientology" including &lt;a href="w%3ADenial-of-service%20attack"&gt;denial-of-service attacks&lt;/a&gt; against the Church of Scientology's main websites. &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Heldal-Lund"&gt;Andreas Heldal-Lund&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Scientology-critical site and &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3ANon-profit%20organization"&gt;non-profit organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Clambake"&gt;Operation Clambake&lt;/a&gt; released a statement on Tuesday critical of the actions of the "Anonymous" group, saying that the Church of Scientology deserves the right to &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt;.
Actor &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20O%27Connell"&gt;Jerry O'Connell&lt;/a&gt;, who had previously acted alongside Cruise in the 1996 film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Maguire"&gt;Jerry Maguire&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, produced a &lt;a href="w%3Aparody"&gt;parody&lt;/a&gt; of the Cruise video which was released on Wednesday. Other Hollywood acquaintances of Cruise, including comedians &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Sandler"&gt;Adam Sandler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Stiller"&gt;Ben Stiller&lt;/a&gt;, released statements defending Cruise and criticizing those who have mocked him for his beliefs. Sandler stated "To see anyone’s private life invaded and mocked like this is sickening," and Stiller commented "People lose sight of the fact that Tom Cruise is actually a person. I feel for him."

On Wednesday the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ reported that Cruise will be a presenter at the &lt;a href="w%3AScreen%20Actors%20Guild%20Awards"&gt;Screen Actors Guild Awards&lt;/a&gt; ceremony on Sunday.

&lt;a href="w%3ASony%20Computer%20Entertainment"&gt;Sony Computer Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, a world-class gaming company, yesterday announced not only upcoming models from the &lt;a href="w%3APS2"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APSP"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; lines, but also a special project named "Taiwan Digital Content Talent R&amp;D Project," strongly supported by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA). The September launch of this project is expected to bring profits and opportunities to &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;'s digital content industry, especially in gaming.

According to the SCE Taiwan Limited, this project will be mainly supervised by MOEA. SCE will cooperate with academic units in Taiwan. Students and the public interested on the R&amp;D of digital content are welcomed to join trainings from this project. Some famous Japanese gaming developers will give lectures and choose some excellent games at this project to market to the world including &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.

SCE Taiwan, as well as the lecturers, will also provide some debug machines, on which trainees can experiment during the lectures. It is expected that some selected games will be preliminary announced at PlayStation Home and PlayStation Store in Japan.

B2B Trade Area of Taipei Game Show, criticized by trade buyers last year, but accompanied with 2008 Taiwan Digital Content Forum, moved to the second floor at &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; for world-wide participants with a better exchange atmosphere this year.

Not only local OBMs (Softstar Entertainment, Soft-World International Corp., International Games System Corp., ..., etc.) but also companies from &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; showcased different specialists with multiple styles. Especially on South Korea, participated members from G★ Trade Show (Game Show &amp; Trade, All-Round, aka Gstar) showcased gaming industry of South Korea and the G★ upcoming at this November with brochures.

In the 2-days Digital Content Forum, world-class experts not only shared industry experiences, members from Taiwan Gaming Industry Association also discussed and forecasted marketing models for gaming industry. With participations from governmental, industrial, and academical executives world-wide, this forum helps them gained precious experiences of digital content industry from several countries.

According to the Taipei Computer Association, the show and forum organizer, the digital content industry in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; was apparently grown up recent years as Minister of Economic Affairs of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; Steve Ruey-long Chen said at Opening Ceremony yesterday. Without R&amp;Ds from cyber-gaming, and basic conceptions from policies and copyright issues, this (digital content) industry will be fallen down in Taiwan. If this industry wanted to be grown up in sustainability, gaming OBMs in Taiwan should independently produce different and unique games and change market style to market brands and games to the world.

A fire has been confirmed at The &lt;a href="w%3AMonte%20Carlo%20Resort%20and%20Casino"&gt;Monte Carlo Resort and Casino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. 

Reports say the fire, which was reported at about 11:00 a.m. (&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;Pacific Time&lt;/a&gt;) began in the top center of the hotel and quickly spread to the top five floors, burning a large section of the roof and facade. Flames were seen shooting out of the top of the hotel. Also visible was a plume of black smoke which according to witnesses, was visible for many miles.

At least three fire companies responded to the scene and quickly began to extinguish the fire. As of 12:00 p.m., the fire was nearly contained. &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas%20Strip"&gt;The Strip&lt;/a&gt; has been closed off in front of the hotel while firefighters continue to fight the blaze.

All guests have been evacuated from the hotel with no injuries reported. The hotel has 3,002 guest rooms, 211 suites and is 32 stories high.

The cause of the fire is not known and is being investigated.

<h1>'The Regime' hacks 711chan.org in response to 'Anonymous' attack on Scientology; takes web site off line</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27The%20Regime%27%20hacks%20711chan.org%20in%20response%20to%20%27Anonymous%27%20attack%20on%20Scientology%3B%20takes%20web%20site%20off%20line&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At 9:57 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;) the site 711chan.org, was replaced, allegedly by ♡❤The Regime♡❤ by the title ♡❤Church of Scientology♡❤ along with a statement on the home page stating "This website has been deleted due to copyright claims from the Church of Scientology." A search performed using &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, on 711chan has returned the number one result of the apparent hack. All that remains of 711chan.org is an apparent message to the members of the site to "run" and "hide."

"711chan is full of fucking fail for siding with Gaia. I'm out of here, faggots. Enjoy your Gaia," said the message, which currently is only available in a cached version.

At 1:45 a.m. on January 27, the site was replaced with "And now a message from our sponsors. YOU SUCK
711chan will be back online shortly. I love you guys for helping me out. &lt;3 plasma," acknowledging the possibility 711chan was back in control of their site. The site's name has been changed to "Church of 711."

The Regime's first attack went along with a message posted to 711chan's website (quoted below) saying that "This site has not been blessed by The Regime and is deemed lame", believing Anonymous to be self-proclaimed hackers (although this title was primarily used by the media). It also refers to Anonymous' attempt to bring down the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; (named '&lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Chanology"&gt;Operation Chanology&lt;/a&gt;'), saying that "chanology is lame, scientology is lame". It thereafter declared that the message board where Anonymous had been discussing Operation Chanology had been removed. Minutes later, 711chan stopped responding to queries.

The legitimate administrators of 711chan regained control after only three minutes, but it took nearly six hours to restore the site with recent additions missing. However, The Regime took the site down again twelve hours later, claiming to have removed the backups and stating, "all your db are belong to us" (an allusion to the phrase "&lt;a href="w%3Aall%20your%20base%20are%20belong%20to%20us"&gt;all your base are belong to us&lt;/a&gt;").

A new video posted to &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; by someone who claimed to be ♡❤The Regime♡❤ shows a logo and uses a computer animated voice to threaten 711chan.org and their affiliates. ♡❤The Regime♡❤, however, denies making the video saying "we are in no way responsible for making, nor are we tied to that video in any way."

The video declares, "Dear 'Anonymous'. We are The Regime. Your attacks on Scientology have not gone unnoticed." The video's text description states that "Your attacks on Scientology have not gone unnoticed, we have the money, resources and tools to put an end to your SP behaviour and so called hacking activities. You have soiled the good name of LRH and now it is you that have *our* attention." 
The acronyms in the text description are &lt;a href="w%3AScientology%20terminology"&gt;Scientology jargon&lt;/a&gt; "&lt;a href="w%3Asuppressive%20person"&gt;suppressive person&lt;/a&gt;" (a person who criticizes Scientology) and Scientology founder &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;. Both terms were also used recently in a leaked internal Church of Scientology video featuring &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; promoting his beliefs. The video goes on to state that "Anonymous" has been declared "&lt;a href="w%3AFair%20Game%20%28Scientology%29"&gt;Fair Game&lt;/a&gt;" (another Scientology term).

The title of ♡❤The Regime♡❤ video, "Re: Message to Scientology", is a reference to the video "Message to Scientology", which was posted by "Anonymous" to YouTube on Monday. The original "Message to Scientology" video has been viewed over 1,000,000 times since it was posted.

"We have your IP addresses, your documents and secret plans. We own your 711chan, your IRC, and we are taking care of your raid forums. Call off your attacks on our religion immediately, or 4chan YTMND, something awful and your other bases will be brought to ruin. Do not underestimate us. You are out of your league. You have been warned," added the video.

In an exclusive interview with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, the group is only called ♡❤The Regime.♡❤ When asked what their mission was, they stated "we have none."

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ also asked who or what was in charge of their group and they replied, "At one point, this would have been a complicated question as there were many tiers and positions of authority, however now leadership is confined to a single council." They are also not affiliated with any other group and act alone with "no contacts with groups or individuals outside of itself." They also refused to describe their group as a whole. They also stated to "define affiliated" when ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ asked if they were part of the Church of Scientology.

Their motivations are still not clear. When asked what motivates their group to do what they do, they replied, "What motivates any human to do anything? Money, Power, Respect? Choose one," but also state that they will continue their attacks "if necessary."

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ also asked if ♡❤The Regime♡❤ was in any way affiliated with the Church of Scientology, including working for or against their beliefs or being a 'branch of The Church' ♡❤The Regime♡❤ simply replied, "We are not Scientologists, this is all we have to say on the subject."

Sources within the "Anonymous" group have played down the actions of The Regime who - when announced on the IRC channel the group utilizes for communications - were said to be "... a bunch of gloryhunters ridin [sic] on our tails". Another user of the IRC channel, calling himself "Anonz", was quoted as telling other members of the group "... It's funny how they call us scriptbunnies yet use scripts themselves." The general consensus was that "Anonymous is not impressed."

A 16-year-old male from &lt;a href="w%3ANovato"&gt;Novato&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; has been arrested in &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; over allegations he intended to hijack a commercial passenger airliner in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. 

The boy, who was unnamed due to his age, was a passenger on board &lt;a href="w%3ASouthwest%20Airlines"&gt;Southwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt; Flight 284 from &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ANashville"&gt;Nashville&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, with his parents reporting him missing at 11:30 am the same day. Although he remained calm throughout the flight and made no hijacking attempt, authorities report he had handcuffs, duct tape and yarn inside the aircraft cabin with him. Although his arrest was only made public on Friday, it is reported that he was detained immediately on reaching &lt;a href="w%3ANashville%20International%20Airport"&gt;Nashville International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.

George Bolds, a spokesman for the (FBI) said that the items were "suspicious" and that the boy had informed the FBI he had indeed intended to hijack the aircraft. An FBI agent told reporters that he felt the plot was ill-conceived, saying "His plan had a low probability of success."

The FBI also conducted a search of his home on Thursday, finding in his room "a photograph of the inside of a small aircraft, something you'd find in a bookstore."

Subsequent to his arrest he pled guilty on Friday to a "delinquent act," according to local officials. A juvenile court judge ordered him to be returned to California for continued perusal of that charge as well as others set to be made. He is currently in Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center in Nashville.

Authorities believe that the teen was suicidal, but the FBI dismissed earlier reports alleging that he intended to crash the airliner into a &lt;a href="w%3AHannah%20Montana"&gt;Hannah Montana&lt;/a&gt; concert in &lt;a href="w%3ALafayette%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;Lafayette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; will press on with plans to withdraw its troops from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in June this year, although promises were made by the nation's foreign minister that relations with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; will not be affected by the move.

Foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Smith"&gt;Stephen Smith&lt;/a&gt; said that the withdrawal will be conducted in an orderly fashion to minimise inconvenience to &lt;a href="w%3AMultinational%20force%20in%20Iraq"&gt;other nations in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; as part of his first US visit since the election he said "We want to do that in a way which sees minimal disruption, which causes the least inconvenience to our allies there, both the United States and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;."

Australia currently has 550 troops in the country.

On Monday Smith will meet with &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; and others to discuss &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, where Australia also has troops stationed. It is currently the intention for this to remain the case.

Smith said of the effect on relations with the US - which have been strong since &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; - "It's not something which I believe will disturb what to date has been a very good working relationship between the new government and the (U.S.) administration. It's a very strong alliance - an alliance which transcends changes in governments. Administrations come and go, governments come and go, but the alliance is a long-term, enduring fundamental relationship between our two nations."

The confirmation is important as Australia saw a new government elected in November. &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; (Labour) defeated Conservative head and former PM &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;. Howard is a supporter of &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and his government.

Investigators examining the wreck of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways%20Flight%2038"&gt;Flight 38&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20777"&gt;777&lt;/a&gt; that crash landed short of the runway at &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt; in the first hull loss of a 777, are examining the aircraft's fuel system as a possible factor in the crash. No-one was killed as the scheduled flight from &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; lost power during final approach on January 17.

136 passengers and 16 crew were on board when power was lost to the two &lt;a href="w%3ARolls-Royce"&gt;Rolls-Royce&lt;/a&gt; engines about two miles from the runway, at a height of 600 feet. &lt;a href="w%3AAutopilot"&gt;Autopilot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aautothrottle"&gt;autothrottle&lt;/a&gt; were engaged at the time, the latter having just commanded an increase of thrust to the engines when power was lost. Co-pilot John Coward, in control at the time, was subsequently praised for being able to glide the disabled plane to within 1,000 feet of the runway, clearing a number of houses along the way.

Subsequent investigation has revealed that not only did the engines not fail simultaneously, but neither failed completely, contradicting initial belief. A preliminary report by the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AAircraft%20Accident%20Investigation%20Branch"&gt;Aircraft Accident Investigation Branch&lt;/a&gt; (AAIB) stated that after the autothrottle commanded more thrust "The engines both initially responded but after about 3 seconds the thrust of the right engine reduced. Some eight seconds later the thrust reduced on the left engine to a similar level... Both engines continued to produce thrust at an engine speed above flight idle, but less than the commanded thrust." This situation prevailed until impact.
On Wednesday the AAIB stated that they were examining "All possible scenarios that could explain the thrust reduction and continued lack of response of the engines." However, it also went on to specifically mention attention to the jet's fuel system, saying "This work includes a detailed analysis and examination of the complete fuel-flow path from the aircraft tanks to the engine-fuel nozzles." The AAIB also ruled out the plane having completely run out of fuel, stating that there was "adequate fuel" in the tanks when the plane crashed. In addition to the fuel required to get to the target destination or emergency alternative airport - whichever is further - aircraft typically carry between thirty and forty-five minutes worth of extra fuel as a safety margin.

Possible scenarios being examined include fuel contamination, coming either from fuel taken on at Beijing or leakage from an unknown source. In particular, a heavy contaminant at the bottom of the tanks would explain a lack of earlier problems on the flight, as the fuel levels would only have become low in the final stages of the trip. Another possibility is that a central part of the fuel system developed a leak, reducing the amount of fuel available to the engines.

It is known that, according to the AAIB, "the autothrottle and engine-control commands were performing as expected prior to, and after, the reduction in thrust," suggesting that all software in the aircraft was functioning correctly and rendering a software failure unlikely, although this possibility also remains under investigation.

The last time Bush visited Africa was in 2003.

The White House said that during this visit, George Bush will review progress made in efforts in which &lt;a href="Washington%20DC"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; offers assistance to enhance economic development and the fight against &lt;a href="AIDS"&gt;HIV AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="malaria"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; and other treatable diseases.

Gunmen have killed 11 people in the village of Lusignan on the coast of &lt;a href="Guyana"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt;, in what is said to be the country's worst mass shooting in 30 years.

The unidentified gunmen reportedly kicked down the doors of five houses and fired shots inside. The dead include five children, four men, and two women. Three people were wounded by the gunshots and taken to a hospital for treatment.

Following the shooting were angry demonstrations in the nearby town of Monrepos. Around 300 people in the village blocked two major highways and burned tires, oil drums, and refrigerators in their display of outrage.

"Government can't protect us!" they shouted. "We want more police!"

President &lt;a href="w%3ABharrat%20Jagdeo"&gt;Bharrat Jagdeo&lt;/a&gt; denounced the attacks, saying, "[This] could not have been done by human beings but rather by animals."

Police suspect that a criminal gang led by &lt;a href="w%3ARondell%20Rawlins"&gt;Rondell Rawlins&lt;/a&gt; may have been behind the attacks. He accused the government of kidnapping his pregnant 18-year-old girlfriend and has threatened to carry out attacks until she is recovered.

Rawlins, a former soldier, is blamed for the 2006 murder of Agriculture Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASatyadeow%20Sawh"&gt;Satyadeow Sawh&lt;/a&gt;.

Hours earlier, armed men attacked Guyana's police headquarters, injuring two policemen.

&lt;a href="w%3AHavant%20and%20Waterlooville%20F.C."&gt;Havant and Waterlooville F.C.&lt;/a&gt; were today beaten 5 -2 by &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Cup"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; 4th round game at &lt;a href="w%3AAnfield"&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt;.

Havant, who are 122 places and 5 leagues below Liverpool, scored the first goal in 8 minutes, a header by &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Pacquette"&gt;Richard Pacquette&lt;/a&gt;. Liverpool's Leiva Lucas then brought the teams back to one goal each, with a 25 yard attempt going in the top right corner beating goal keeper Kevin Scriven.

Havant then replied 6 minutes later, with a attempt by Alfie Potter being deflected into the goal. However the lead was again only held for a short time, until &lt;a href="w%3AYossi%20Benayoun"&gt;Yossi Benayoun&lt;/a&gt; once again brought the teams level again. Liverpool then closed out their opposition scoring three more goals to bring the end result to 5 - 2.

6,000 Havant and Waterlooville fans travelled the 250 miles to Liverpool and remained in the stadium after the game to applaud their team, most of whom have other jobs. The team were also applauded by Liverpool fans and players, after the game.

It is thought that the game has made Havant and Waterlooville around £400,000 in sales and advertising. However the £350 million deal between Liverpool's &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; owners highlights the difference between the two clubs.

&lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; primary, with 55 percent of the vote.

&lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; came in second with 27 percent of the vote, while &lt;a href="John%20Edwards"&gt;John Edwards&lt;/a&gt; was third with 18 percent.

"Tonight, the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of Iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of South Carolina," Obama told his supporters. 

"In nine short days, nearly half the nation will have the chance to join us in saying that we are tired of business-as-usual in Washington, we are hungry for change, and we are ready to believe again," he said, referring to &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Tuesday"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, which will be on February 5. 24 states will be holding primaries or caucuses on that day.

Clinton reportedly called Obama to congratulate him on his victory.

"I have called Senator Obama to congratulate him and wish him well," she stated.

A CNN exit poll showed Obama with 81 percent of the &lt;a href="w%3Ablack%20people"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; vote, in a primary where 55 percent of voters were black. The exit poll also showed Obama with 24 percent of the white vote, while Edwards and Clinton received 39 percent and 36 percent of this demographic, respectively.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; has announced in a press conference earlier this week that it will open the &lt;a href="w%3A2008-09%20NHL%20season"&gt;2008-09 NHL season&lt;/a&gt; with two series' in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. On October 4 and October 5, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Rangers"&gt;New York Rangers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%20Bay%20Lightning"&gt;Tampa Bay Lightning&lt;/a&gt; will play in &lt;a href="w%3APrague"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ASazka%20Arena"&gt;Sazka Arena&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Senators"&gt;Ottawa Senators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; will play in &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm%20Globe%20Arena"&gt;Stockholm Globe Arena&lt;/a&gt;.

Each of the four teams will also play exhibition games in Europe.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Disabled%20U.S.%20spy%20satellite%20to%20fall%20to%20Earth&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An unresponsive &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Areconnaissance%20satellite"&gt;reconnaissance satellite&lt;/a&gt; is in an uncontrolled, decaying orbit and will re-enter &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;'s atmosphere in late February or early March.

According to Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20National%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.S. National Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, "Appropriate government agencies are monitoring the situation."

The satellite is out-of-control, and therefore there is no possibility to guide it to re-entry over an ocean or unpopulated area. On the one hand, since most of the earth's surface is water or unpopulated, death or property loss due to any falling fragments, which may result from the satellite entering the atmosphere, is statistically unlikely. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out entirely. According to General Gene Renuart, of the United States Air Force, there is a chance that the satellite may re-enter over North America. After entering the atmosphere, some debris could possibly fall on land.

"Numerous satellites over the years have come out of orbit and fallen harmlessly. We are looking at potential options to mitigate any possible damage this satellite may cause," said Johndroe.

Concerns have also been raised that some materials used in the satellite's construction could be hazardous if they reach the ground. The satellite contains quantities of toxic &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrazine"&gt;hydrazine&lt;/a&gt; fuel, which is used for maneuvering, although this is likely to burn up on re-entry. Some of the optics aboard the satellite may contain &lt;a href="w%3Aberyllium"&gt;beryllium&lt;/a&gt;, which is also toxic.

As the satellite was part of a classified U.S. military program, no other details, including its name, have been made public. The satellite is publicly identified by the codenames ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20193"&gt;USA-193&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤NRO L-21♡❤. It was launched in December 2006, by a &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20II"&gt;Delta II&lt;/a&gt; rocket from &lt;a href="w%3AVandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Vandenberg Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;. Ground controllers lost contact with the satellite shortly after it reached orbit. Amateur observers had been tracking USA-193 for some time, and believed that its orbit was decaying.

During the fourth day of the &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20Game%20Show"&gt;2008 Taipei Game Show&lt;/a&gt;, held at the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;, visitors voted for their favourite participating companies and games at the "Popular Game Voting" competition.

According to the organizer Taipei Computer Association (TCA), this is the first-ever vote. It has two main categories, quality of the game itself and quality of the presentation at the convention. In the game section there were four categories: leisure game, PC console game, online RPG, and upcoming games. Balancing the vote, booth setup and stage activity were included. If a company won an award in this category, its notoriety is expected to rise and the company could see a great deal of opportunities to market games or its brand to the world.

Aside from the presentation class, winners from the game class were decided by votes from on-site, local gaming magazines, and the official website.

In the end, Microsoft Taiwan won all of the categories of the popular presentation class. In the game voting class, International Games Systems Inc. (IGS) won both popular leisure and upcoming game categories. Soft-World and Softstar Corp. respectively won popular online RPG and PC console game categories.

&lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Schreckengost"&gt;Viktor Schreckengost&lt;/a&gt;, the father of industrial design and creator of the Jazz Bowl, an iconic piece of Jazz Age art designed for &lt;a href="w%3AEleanor%20Roosevelt"&gt;Eleanor Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; during his association with &lt;a href="w%3ACowan%20Pottery"&gt;Cowan Pottery&lt;/a&gt; died yesterday. He was 101.

Schreckengost was born on June 26, 1906 in &lt;a href="w%3ASebring%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Sebring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Schreckengost's peers included the far more famous designers &lt;a href="w%3ARaymond%20Loewy"&gt;Raymond Loewy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%20Bel%20Geddes"&gt;Norman Bel Geddes&lt;/a&gt;. 

In 2000, the &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Museum%20of%20Art"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt; curated the first ever retrospective of Schreckengost's work. Stunning in scope, the exhibition included sculpture, pottery, dinnerware, drawings, and paintings.

Launch, from area 200/39 at the &lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; took place on schedule, and the satellite was successfully placed into an intermediate transfer orbit. Operations to place the satellite into its final &lt;a href="w%3AGeosynchronous%20orbit"&gt;Geosynchronous orbit&lt;/a&gt;, through further burns of the Briz-M upper stage, should have been completed, however no official announcement has yet been made.

This is the third &lt;a href="w%3Aorbit"&gt;orbit&lt;/a&gt;al launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the first to be conducted by Russia.

The satellite will provide &lt;a href="w%3AC-band"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AL-band"&gt;L&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aku-band"&gt;Ku-band&lt;/a&gt; communication services. It has a mass of 2600kg, and an expected orbital lifetime of 12 years. It was constructed by &lt;a href="w%3ANPO%20PM"&gt;NPO PM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThales%20Alenia%20Space"&gt;Thales Alenia Space&lt;/a&gt;, and will be operated by the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Space%20Communication%20Company"&gt;Russian Space Communication Company&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARoskosmos"&gt;RKA&lt;/a&gt;. It will be placed in a geosynchronous orbit, about 36,000 kilometres above the Earth, at a longitude of 95.5°E. It will replace the AM-11 satellite, which malfunctioned in 2006.

In an ongoing custody battle, the &lt;a href="w%3AOregon%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Oregon Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; decided a 12-year-old boy should have a say in whether he should or should not be circumcised as part of a conversion to &lt;a href="w%3AJudaism"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt;. The child of Lia and James Boldt was raised in the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Orthodox%20Church"&gt;Russian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;, but his father James, who has primary custody, converted to Judaism in 2004. The couple divorced in 1999.

After conversion, James began discussing the religion with his son and informed the ex-wife of his intentions for the son to convert as well. The mother objected to the conversion and &lt;a href="w%3Acircumcision"&gt;circumcision&lt;/a&gt; as invasive and possibly dangerous. The father argued that his &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; rights to the free exercise of religion allowed him to choose what religion his child was raised in.

The Oregon Supreme Court in a decision authored by Chief Justice &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20De%20Muniz"&gt;Paul De Muniz&lt;/a&gt; reversed the decision of the &lt;a href="w%3AOregon%20Court%20of%20Appeals"&gt;Oregon Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; and returned the case to the trial level court. The trial court in &lt;a href="w%3AJackson%20County%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Jackson County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, was to determine if the 12-year-old boy agrees with being circumcised or if he disagrees with the procedure, and take that into account with their ruling. The state supreme court had received four &lt;a href="w%3AAmicus%20curiae"&gt;amicus briefs&lt;/a&gt; from national Jewish groups supporting the father’s position.

The First Presidency of the church was dissolved and his two counselors, Presidents &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20S.%20Monson"&gt;Thomas S. Monson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20B.%20Eyring"&gt;Henry B. Eyring&lt;/a&gt;, will now take the places of first and 11th respectively in the 14 member &lt;a href="w%3AQuorum%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29"&gt;quorum&lt;/a&gt;. In the days after President Hinckley's funeral, quorum members will sustain a new church president. The quorum's senior &lt;a href="w%3AApostle%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29"&gt;apostle&lt;/a&gt; and president, President Monson, will likely succeed President Hinckley.

The head of the Orthodox &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Greece"&gt;Church of Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AArchbishop%20Christodoulos"&gt;Archbishop Christodoulos&lt;/a&gt;, died of cancer on Monday in his home in &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 69.

A strong defender of the role of the church in Greece, Christodoulos died at his home in north Athens, a few months after plans for a liver transplant in &lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; were cancelled.

The Greek Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AKostas%20Karamanlis"&gt;Kostas Karamanlis&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement that "Archbishop Christodoulos was an enlightened church leader whose work brought the church closer to society, closer to modern problems and to young people" while opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Papandreou"&gt;George Papandreou&lt;/a&gt; praised the late Archbishop and his personality. 

Flags in all state buildings flew at half-mast as well as on the &lt;a href="w%3AAcropolis"&gt;Acropolis&lt;/a&gt; and across the country as bells tolled. Condolences poured in as crowds of black-clad mourners gathered at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens where his funeral will be held on Thursday. The government announced an official four-day mourning and Archbishop's funeral will take place under the status of head of the state honours. 

Born in 1939 in the town of &lt;a href="w%3AXanthi"&gt;Xanthi&lt;/a&gt;, northern Greece, Christodoulos Paraskevaides was for many years Metropolitan of Demetrias in &lt;a href="w%3AVolos"&gt;Volos&lt;/a&gt;, until 1998 when he became Archbishop of Athens and all Greece. A controversial personality himself, Christodoulos worked to mend ties with the Vatican and he also grudgingly agreed to a landmark visit by &lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; to Greece in 2001 that marked a turning point in relations between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches following the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Schism"&gt;Great Schism&lt;/a&gt; of 1054 that split &lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>711chan.org administrator calls for an end to attacks on Scientology</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=711chan.org%20administrator%20calls%20for%20an%20end%20to%20attacks%20on%20Scientology&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In an exclusive interview with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, an administrator of ♡❤711chan♡❤ states that they will "probably stay away from the CoS [Church of Scientology]."

"We're probably just going to stay away from the CoS raid. It was poorly managed. We could've brought down a lot more if we weren't just a bunch of unorganized brats," said 'Plasma', an administrator on ♡❤711chan.org♡❤.
"Many people from 711chan still want to raid, but the administration is sick of it," added Plasma who also stated that "Partyvan &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Relay%20Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; actually has decided to remove the raid."

Much of the reason stems from the fact that the attack on the Church was meant to stay within ♡❤711chan♡❤ and that users were to stay "anonymous." An e-mail was leaked on the internet when the attack began exposing the script used to attack the Church's website.

"This is not what the raid originally started as. Partyvan declares this as a threat to the network, and Anonymous alike. We have been under constant botnet attacks, 711chan hacked, and tons of drama over this. You guys did a very poor job of staying Anonymous. It's obvious that a lot of you broke rules 1, and 2," said a statement on ♡❤711chan's♡❤ website.

The rules they refer to, according to Plasma, mean the "Rules of the Internet" and are:

Both key rules were broken by users, according to Plasma.

The attack on Scientology was launched on Wednesday January 16 by a group labelled "Anonymous", on the website "Insurgency Wiki", a spinoff of &lt;a href="w%3A4chan"&gt;4chan&lt;/a&gt; which is also affiliated with ♡❤711chan♡❤. The "History" section of the site explains, in a satirical fashion, that the incident was prompted by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring &lt;a href="w%3AScientologist"&gt;Scientologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Though YouTube complied with the Church of Scientology's requests to take down the video, other sites such as &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt; stated that they will keep hosting the video.

One poster admitted to being a part of the effort, writing in a blog post "I have myself, as per instructions, loaded up Gigaloader and started bombarding the Scientology homepage. Theres [♡❤sic♡❤] something in the hilarious anarchy of the net that produces these 'events' every now and again." The poster wrote that "Prompted I think by the Tom Cruise video, a new obsession is taking hold on the internet. An insurgency against The Church of Scientology."

Not long after their attack, a previously unknown group called ♡❤The Regime♡❤ used keylogging to gain an administrator password to 711chan.org.

"I was actually away from home when I noticed my personal dedi was compromised (my bash_history file had lots of strange entries), so I informed Partyvan IRC staff (the CoS raid room as well as 711chan's IRC room are there) and minutes later, 711chan's machine was also compromised. I arrived home around an hour later, and immediately restored the contents of the 711 machine back to a previous state. I also got the passwords reset on my dedi and that was back in order. I went to bed shortly after that," said Plasma in regards to ♡❤The Regime's♡❤ attack on ♡❤711chan♡❤.

"The next morning I wake up to hundreds of &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt; windows and emails telling me both servers have been compromised again, and our backups for 711 have been removed. The software we use to run 711chan's machine got bugged up somehow and make it difficult for me to fix things, which is why the site didn't respond at all for most of the day. At the time of writing this I still haven't got the backups reloaded onto the machine," added Plasma.

Plasma states that ♡❤711chan.org♡❤ will be off line at least until the end of January, possibly longer, but the site is not expected to change.

"I shut down our server to prevent any more damage. Right now, our plan is to lay low and get stuff started up on a more secure machine. We'll be back up by the end of the month, hopefully. 711chan will probably be staying the same it is, however," said Plasma.

But they didn't go down without a fight adds Plasma.

"As who the "Regime" is? I took a look at one of the things they planted on my machine, which lead me to #!!regime on GameSurge IRC. `immortal' and about 30 drones were in that channel. Members of the g00ns community (allies of 711, also linked to Partyvan IRC) found out they had dox (documents such as phone numbers, addresses, SSN numbers, names, that sort of thing) on `immortal' and his wife. I actually have these details and attempted to call him, but it went unanswered," said Plasma.

The information that ♡❤711chan.org♡❤ obtained was later posted on the website operated by ♡❤The Regime♡❤. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has attempted to contact ♡❤The Regime♡❤ a second time regarding the incident, and they have only replied with "your articles are bullshit."

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secret%20Service"&gt;Secret Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has evacuated the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Wing"&gt;West Wing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; after finding a suspicious package. Reports say the package was found on the grounds of the White House just outside the West Wing.

One person has been arrested after the Secret Service says he made a "verbal threat against the President" of the U.S. &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; through the fence near the West Wing. He also left the package on the White House grounds.

"We had an individual arrested for making a threat against the president on the fence line. He left behind a suspicious package," said a spokesman for the Secret Service, Malcolm Wiley. No name has been released, and it is not known what he will be charged with. Reports say the man was somewhere in his 40's. He was bald and wore a brown leather jacket.

Officials for the bomb squad are investigating the package, but say that nothing inside it was harmful.

The area was briefly closed to any members of the public.

&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; held talks with &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; in London on Tuesday, reassuring his host that Pakistan will hold a fair election next month and is ready to continue a sustained fight against terrorism and extremism. 
The visit has been widely called President Musharraf's "charm offensive." The Pakistani leader has held talks in &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Economic%20Forum"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; in Davos, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; and now in London in an effort which has been seen as an attempt to shore up European support for his government.

His message throughout has been much the same - namely that Pakistan has been successful in fighting Islamic extremists, that his government can sustain that effort, that it has a political strategy to wean local Pakistanis away from extremist ideology and that it is committed to democracy.
Speaking at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Gordon Brown, President Musharraf rejected the notion that his government has failed in its efforts.

"We have not failed. We are going along fighting al Qaida, fighting militant Taleban and fighting Talebanization flowing outside," he said. "And also fighting extremism in some segments of our society in Pakistan."

"The question that needs to be asked is how come if General Musharraf is our best bet to fight terrorism, how come terrorism is increasing by leaps and bounds. Last year was the bloodiest year for Pakistan, culminating in the assassination of [opposition leader] &lt;a href="w%3ABenazir%20Bhutto"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;," said Khan. 

President Musharraf's government has come under increasing criticism at home and abroad, and world leaders have repeatedly urged him to move ahead with democratization.

President Musharraf said he reassured Prime Minister Brown about the upcoming vote.

"I did inform the Prime Minister [of] our strong desire to go forward with the elections and to ensure that elections will be fair, free and transparent," said Mr. Musharraf.

The elections are scheduled for February 18 and opposition politician &lt;a href="w%3AImran%20Khan"&gt;Imran Khan&lt;/a&gt; says they will be vital. He said it is also important that western powers support the process.

"In my opinion the only way forward for Britain and the United States is to back not people, not individuals, not political parties, but the democratic process. They should back free and fair elections in Pakistan. It is the only way out of this quagmire," he said.

Khan was among hundreds of anti-Musharraf protesters outside Prime Minister Brown's offices at Number 10 Downing Street.

In the year 2000, &lt;a href="w%3ADries%20Buytaert"&gt;Dries Buytaert&lt;/a&gt; created &lt;a href="w%3ADrupal"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="FLOSS"&gt;freely licensed and open source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AContent%20management%20system"&gt;tool to manage websites&lt;/a&gt;, as a bulletin board for his college dorm. Since Dries released the software and a community of thousands of volunteer developers have added and improved modules, Drupal has grown immensely popular. Drupal won the overall Open CMS Award in 2007, and some speakers in Drupal's spacious developer's room at &lt;a href="w%3AFOSDEM"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; 2008 were dreaming aloud of its world domination.

Buytaert (now 29) just finished his doctoral thesis and has founded the start-up Acquia. The new company wants to become Drupal's best friend, with the help of an all-star team and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;7 million collected from venture capitalists. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ reporter sat down with Dries in &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; to discuss these recent exciting developments.

<h1>UK allows corporations to award high school credits</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20allows%20corporations%20to%20award%20high%20school%20credits&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The government of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has given corporations like fast food chain &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonald%27s"&gt;McDonald's&lt;/a&gt; the right to award high school qualifications to employees who complete a company training program. 

Two other businesses, railway firm &lt;a href="w%3ANetwork%20Rail"&gt;Network Rail&lt;/a&gt; and regional airline &lt;a href="w%3AFlybe"&gt;Flybe&lt;/a&gt;, were also approved. The decision was made by the &lt;a href="w%3AQualifications%20and%20Curriculum%20Authority"&gt;Qualifications and Curriculum Authority&lt;/a&gt;, which oversees the national curriculum.

McDonald's said it will offer a "basic shift manager" course, which will train staff in marketing, customer service, and other areas of restaurant management. Completion of this course will be the equivalent of passing the &lt;a href="w%3AGCSE"&gt;GCSE&lt;/a&gt;, the standard exam taken at age 16, or the &lt;a href="w%3AAdvanced%20Level"&gt;Advanced Level&lt;/a&gt;, taken at age 18.

Network Rail plans to offer a course in rail engineering, while Flybe is developing a course involving aircraft engineering and cabin crew training. Passing Flybe's course could result a university level degree.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; supports the plan. "It is going to be a tough course, but once you have got a qualification in management you can probably go anywhere," Brown said. He emphasized the importance of higher education, saying, "Every young person needs a skill and to think about going to college, doing an apprenticeship or university."

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Denham%20%28UK%20politician%29"&gt;John Denham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Innovation%2C%20Universities%20and%20Skills"&gt;Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills&lt;/a&gt;, called the decision "an important step towards ending the old divisions between company training schemes and national qualifications" and said it will "benefit employees, employers and the country as a whole."

However, some people are unsure of the plan's effectiveness. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20and%20College%20Union"&gt;University and College Union&lt;/a&gt;, said, "We are unsure whether those institutions would be clamoring to accept people with &lt;a href="w%3AMcWord"&gt;McQualifications&lt;/a&gt;," using a derogatory term for the program.

<h1>&quot;Anonymous&quot; plans to protest Church of Scientology on February 10</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%26quot%3BAnonymous%26quot%3B%20plans%20to%20protest%20Church%20of%20Scientology%20on%20February%2010&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Anonymous is taking action against the Church of Scientology in response to what it sees as suppression of &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. The group was first motivated after the Church of Scientology issued a copyright infringement claim to YouTube regarding a promotional video of Scientologist &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; speaking about his beliefs and using Scientology &lt;a href="w%3AJargon"&gt;jargon&lt;/a&gt;. The Church of Scientology also issued a legal complaint to the website &lt;a href="w%3AGawker"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt; which is also hosting the video, but Gawker has stated it will not take the video down because it is newsworthy.

Anonymous set up a movement called "&lt;a href="Project%20Chanology"&gt;Project Chanology&lt;/a&gt;" to coordinate their efforts, and took down several Church of Scientology websites through &lt;a href="w%3ADenial-of-service%20attack"&gt;denial-of-service attack&lt;/a&gt;s. Members of Anonymous have also participated in prank calls to Church of Scientology centers, as well as protests or "raids" outside Scientology buildings, and have posted some of their exploits to YouTube. 
In the "Call to Action" video, Anonymous denies that they are composed solely of "super hackers", stating "Anonymous is a collective of individuals united by an awareness that someone must do the right thing, that someone must bring light to the darkness, that someone must open the eyes of a public that has slumbered for far too long." The video goes on to state "We want you to be aware of the very real dangers of Scientology," citing what they term "gross human rights violations". 

Specific controversial events in Scientology history are cited in the video, including &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Freakout"&gt;Operation Freakout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APaulette%20Cooper"&gt;Paulette Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Snow%20White"&gt;Operation Snow White&lt;/a&gt;. Operation Freakout was the name of a Church of Scientology operation whose goal was to "get P.C. [Paulette Cooper] incarcerated in a mental institution or jail or at least to hit her so hard that she drops her attacks." Paulette Cooper had written a book critical of Scientology called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Scandal%20of%20Scientology"&gt;The Scandal of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Operation Snow White was the name of a Church of Scientology operation where members of the Church's secretive &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Special%20Affairs"&gt;Guardian's Office&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government agencies in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; including the &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;I.R.S.&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href="F.B.I."&gt;F.B.I.&lt;/a&gt;'s investigation into Operation Snow White led them to discover the planning of actions taken against Paulette Cooper.

The video concludes by inviting the viewer to "take up the banner of free speech" and protest with Anonymous world wide. In an email to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNET%20News"&gt;CNET News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Anonymous stated that cities where unknown activities are planned on February 10 include &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Montreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Houston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.

On Friday, two spokespersons for the Church of Scientology commented on the recent actions of Anonymous. A spokesman told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANews.com.au"&gt;News.com.au&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ "These types of people have got some wrong information about us," and Church spokeswoman Yvette Shank told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Media"&gt;Sun Media&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that she regarded members of Anonymous as a "pathetic" group of "computer geeks". On Monday, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARadar%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Radar&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that the Church of Scientology has asked the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Attorney%20General"&gt;U.S. Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;'s office in Los Angeles, the F.B.I., and the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Police%20Department"&gt;LAPD&lt;/a&gt; to start a criminal investigation of possible criminal activity related to the Internet attacks. A source told ♡❤Radar♡❤ that the Church of Scientology is arguing that the Internet attacks are a form of "illegal interference with business." ♡❤Radar♡❤ also reports that the Church of Scientology is emphasizing its status as a religious organization in the United States, in order to assert that the Internet attacks can be classed as hate crimes.
On Saturday, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Bunker"&gt;Mark Bunker&lt;/a&gt; of the website XenuTV.com posted a video to YouTube criticizing the illegal actions of Anonymous and suggested legal methods for them to retaliate against the Church of Scientology, including peaceful protesting, writing letters to their government representatives, and persuading the United States government to take away the Church of Scientology's tax exempt status. In the video, Bunker states "I'm mainly concerned because you shouldn't be doing things that are illegal, you just shouldn't. It's not morally right, and it's not right when Scientology does it, it's not right when we do it." Bunker's video post has been viewed over 156,000 times. On Sunday, Bunker posted a follow-up video to YouTube where he gives advice to Anonymous on how to peacefully picket. He also provides viewers with resources and weblinks to more information on how to hold a peaceful protest. He concludes this video by imitating &lt;a href="w%3AObi-Wan%20Kenobi"&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AJedi%20mind%20trick"&gt;Jedi mind trick&lt;/a&gt; technique and voice from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, stating "And if I may, as Obi-Wan, tell you: ♡❤You will do nothing illegal♡❤ ".

Jared Foster, a transfer quarterback with the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Mississippi"&gt;University of Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; (Ole Miss) &lt;a href="w%3AOle%20Miss%20Rebels%20football"&gt;Rebels football team&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested yesterday in &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%2C%20Mississippi"&gt;Oxford, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; and charged with selling &lt;a href="w%3ASteroids"&gt;steroids&lt;/a&gt;.

Rebels head coach &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%20Nutt"&gt;Houston Nutt&lt;/a&gt; said that Foster will not be allowed to remain with the team.

Foster was arrested for alcohol possession by a minor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor in 2006 while a star player for Madison Central High School in &lt;a href="w%3AMadison%2C%20Mississippi"&gt;Madison, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;. Prosecutors agreed then not to try the case on the conditions that Foster help police in a steroid investigation and stay out of trouble.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Man%20Group"&gt;Blue Man Group&lt;/a&gt; issued a press release Friday morning refuting a man's claims that they forced a tube down his throat as part of a show.

Earlier this week, audience participant James Srodon filed a court claim in Cook County Circuit Court that members of performance trio forced a dirty tube down his throat against his will while he was part of a skit called "Esophagus Video."

The description of the incident is not true, says the musical performance group.

"We are shocked and surprised to learn of the allegations made in reference to one of our comedic pieces, 'Esophagus Video,'" the group said.

Srodon claims that he was unexpectedly approached and had a tubular camera forced down his throat during an October 2006 performance at Chicago's Briar Street Theatre. He claims he had his head was forced back and one of the Blue Men forced the tube in him. The joke is to show footage from the inside of the audience member.

The Blue Man Group says that nothing actually goes down anyone's throat.

" 'Esophagus Video' is simply an illusion," the group wrote in its press release. "A camera is held in an actor's hands, the actor's hands are placed near an audience member's mouth (not on or in). The live-feed video screen then switches to a pre-recorded medical video, resulting in the hilarious and absurd illusion that the audience is peering down an individual's esophagus. Because the camera never enters the mouth, the execution of this illusion could not possibly put anyone at risk of injury."

The group added the skit and skits like it have been performed for the past 15 years by them without complaint.

The Californian is suing on the basis that the alleged tube was unsafely dirty and that his experience being cornered gave him post-traumatic stress and nightmares.

Srodon also claims he lost fillings and dental work because of the tube. The suit is reported to be seeking damages of more than $500,000, however the group reported that they have not been served papers as of Friday morning.

The Blue Man Group has a lot of audience participation as part of their show and is a Las Vegas fixture. The music and comedy group came to public consciousness around 2000.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has delivered his eighth and final &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20the%20Union%20Address"&gt;State of the Union Address&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ACongress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; people. In the speech he urged the American public to support his &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; policies and called on other politicians to take action to boost the U.S. economy.

Since &lt;a href="w%3A2008"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;presidential election&lt;/a&gt; year and he has already served the &lt;a href="w%3ATwenty-fourth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Constitutional maximum&lt;/a&gt; of two four year terms, he may not run again. Since State of the Union addresses are traditionally only given yearly in January, he will likely not give another one.

Rather than focus on the past, Bush talked at length about the issues that will shape his legacy - starting with the war in Iraq and his decision to send in an additional 30,000 U.S. troops.

"Some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt," he said. "&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated."

About half the speech dealt with foreign policy, with a heavy focus on the Middle East. President Bush talked about his hopes for an &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i-&lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; peace deal, and issued a challenge to the government of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

"Come clean about your &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear"&gt;nuclear&lt;/a&gt; intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, and cease your support for terror abroad," he said. "But above all, know this: America will confront those who threaten our troops, we will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the &lt;a href="w%3APersian%20Gulf"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt;."
Bush also spoke of his determination to protect the American economy. He acknowledged many Americans worry the slowdown in economic growth could evolve into a full-blown &lt;a href="w%3Arecession"&gt;recession&lt;/a&gt;, and he sought to calm their fears.

"In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth," he said. "But in the short run, we can all see that growth is slowing."

The president called on &lt;a href="w%3ACongress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; to pass the economic stimulus package the administration worked out with Democratic and Republican leaders in the House. And he urged lawmakers to re-authorize a program that enables the government to secretly monitor communications between Americans and terror suspects abroad without a prior court warrant.

On these and other matters, Bush said everyone should put politics aside.

"In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them," he said. "And let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and compete for results at the same time."

Two of the Democrats running for their party's presidential nomination — Senators &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; — were in the chamber for the president's speech.

The official Democratic response to the address was delivered by Kansas Governor &lt;a href="w%3AKathleen%20Sebelius"&gt;Kathleen Sebelius&lt;/a&gt;.

"Tonight's address begins the final year of this presidency, with new leaders on the horizon and uncertainty throughout our land," she said. "Conditions we face, at home and abroad, are results of choices made and challenges unmet."

&lt;a href="Mauritania"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt;n refugees stuck in &lt;a href="Senegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt; for nearly two decades after fleeing ethnic clashes in their home country have begun returning to Mauritania under a -sponsored program. But many do not want to return.

There were goodbye ceremonies and welcoming ceremonies attended by officials on both sides of the &lt;a href="w%3ASenegal%20River"&gt;Senegal River&lt;/a&gt; as more than 100 former refugees were ferried on motorized &lt;a href="w%3Apirogue"&gt;pirogues&lt;/a&gt;. 

A spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, Alphonse Munyaneza, explained international funding will help pay for resettlement.

"Each refugee returning back to Mauritania will receive a piece of land equivalent to 140 square meters for establishing a house. &lt;a href="w%3AUNHCR"&gt;UNHCR&lt;/a&gt; and the government of Mauritania will provide construction material so that they can build a house," explained Munyaneza. "We will provide three months of food ration. We will provide a tent also."
Mauritanian refugee children broke out in song and laughter when officials arrived at their camps close to the border to get the process going. 

There are more than 20,000 Mauritanian refugees in Senegal. Officials say the return program will extend over 18 months.

One of those happy to go is Haddy Sy. She says she left Mauritania after she was beaten up. This took place during a wave of ethnic violence that began in &lt;a href="w%3AMoors"&gt;Arab Moor&lt;/a&gt;-dominated Mauritania in 1989 and escalated into &lt;a href="w%3AMauritania-Senegal%20Border%20War"&gt;border clashes&lt;/a&gt;, forcing tens of thousands of black, mostly ethnic &lt;a href="w%3AFula%20people"&gt;Fula&lt;/a&gt;, Mauritanians into exile.

In the late 1990s, more than 30,000 refugees returned by their own means and some U.N. assistance. 
Sy says she is leaving behind many good things in Senegal, including a peaceful setting, but that she is still happy to return to her home country.

Since taking office last year, the government of the elected, post-coup President &lt;a href="w%3ASidi%20Ould%20Cheikh%20Abdallahi"&gt;Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi&lt;/a&gt; has been making efforts to bring home the refugees, including several thousand more in &lt;a href="Mali"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt;. 

But many in Senegal do not want to return home, like Yaraah Sow, who lives in the Dagana refugee camp about 400 kilometers northwest of &lt;a href="w%3ADakar"&gt;Dakar&lt;/a&gt;.

He says he is still very bitter about what happened nearly 20 years ago. He said his father, who was a civil servant, was attacked by a mob and died of internal bleeding at the gates of a hospital after doctors refused to treat him. 
Sow accuses the military of seizing all his family's property. He says that two of his younger brothers died on the trip to Senegal. He says his children are now going to school and that they are better off in Senegal.

One of the refugee leaders, Mohamed Ali Sow, who left when he was 10, says he is studying at a university in Senegal to become a lawyer to defend the rights of chased out Mauritanians. 

He says the return program has been rushed, because he says people who had their property seized, houses burned, and jobs taken away, should have guarantees these will be restored. He says until then, he does not think it is wise to go back.

Two people, a nine year old boy and a 23-year-old woman from &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, have died from the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; virus marking the country's 100th death from the disease. Both died on Sunday, January 27.

"The woman died yesterday, but we just received the results that she's positive with bird flu. The total number of deaths is now 100 out of 124 positive cases," said National Bird Flu Center spokesman, Joko Suyono.

Nearly half of all humans that died from H5N1, have been from Indonesia. Nearly half of those infected in the country received the virus from poultry that was contaminated with the virus.

So far, 223 people from 13 different nations around the world have died from H5N1.

In the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, grass fires spread across 2,000 acres of land, destroying at least two dozen structures in the process. The fires were fueled by gusty winds of up to 60 miles per hour.

No injuries or deaths have been reported. Residential areas in &lt;a href="w%3ATarrant%20County"&gt;Tarrant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWise%20County"&gt;Wise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParker%20County"&gt;Parker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANolan%20County"&gt;Nolan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABurnet%20County"&gt;Burnet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACallahan%20County"&gt;Callahan&lt;/a&gt; counties were evacuated as firefighters struggled to put out the flames. Fires were also reported in &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20County%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADenton%20County"&gt;Denton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACollin%20County"&gt;Collin&lt;/a&gt; counties. Many of these fires have now been contained, officials say.

In response to the fires, Texas governor &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Perry"&gt;Rick Perry&lt;/a&gt; activated the state's Emergency Operations Center at the highest level. In addition, 152 counties instituted burn bans.

Military aircraft were sent to the area to help douse the fires. According to officials, two &lt;a href="w%3ACH-47%20Chinook"&gt;CH-47 Chinook&lt;/a&gt; helicopters are on standby in &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Prairie%2C%20Texas"&gt;Grand Prairie&lt;/a&gt;, waiting for the winds to slow down before taking to the skies with buckets of water. Six &lt;a href="w%3AUH60%20Blackhawk"&gt;UH60 Blackhawk&lt;/a&gt; helicopters are on standby in &lt;a href="w%3AAustin%2C%20Texas"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%2C%20Texas"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; as well.

Sharolyn Holder, a North Texas resident, said, "My house is sitting back there with fire all around it. My son's house has already burned some. It's just so stressful."

Craig Civale of &lt;a href="w%3AWFAA-TV"&gt;WFAA-TV&lt;/a&gt; said that a lack of water contributed to the spread of the fires. "We've seen areas where fire trucks simply ran out of water, tanker trucks ran out of water, and had to stop battling the blazes at these homes; and pretty much watch them burn down until more water came to the area," he said.

Officials in Tarrant County believe that a fire in &lt;a href="w%3ABenbrook%2C%20Texas"&gt;Benbrook&lt;/a&gt; may have been started by a cigarette thrown onto an interstate highway.

Parts of &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Route%20377"&gt;U.S. Route 377&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2035"&gt;Interstate 35&lt;/a&gt; were closed due to the fires.

The heavy winds had other adverse effects for Texas residents. Around 75,000 homes in the area were reported to be without power in the afternoon due to the wind knocking down several power lines.

Some flights at &lt;a href="w%3ADallas-Fort%20Worth%20International%20Airport"&gt;Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport&lt;/a&gt; were delayed more than half an hour or cancelled after the wind forced officials to limit use of the runways.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlonzo%20Spellman"&gt;Alonzo Spellman&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; player, was arrested Tuesday in Tulsa, Oklahoma after a twenty minute car chase with police. Officers used "spike sticks" that flattened three tires on Spellman's car, but he refused to get out until officers fired pepper-spray pellets into the vehicle.

Spellman was hospitalized and had to attend psychiatric evaluations after being involved in a police standoff at the home of his publicist in 1998. In 2003 he was sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to interfering with the crew of a Delta Air Lines flight from Cincinnati to Philadelphia.

Spellman, a six-foot, 300 pound first round draft pick out of Ohio State made his NFL debut in 1992 with the Chicago Bears. He was also a team member of the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys, recording 43 sacks in 123 games. Spellman agreed to a contract with the Las Vegas Gladiators of the Arena Football League (AFL) in October of 2005.

<h3>♡❤♡&lt;a href="Former%20Indonesian%20President%20Suharto%20dies%20at%2086"&gt;Suharto, former Indonesian President, 86&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ASuharto"&gt;Suharto&lt;/a&gt;, second president of &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, has died today in a &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; hospital at the age of 86. The cause of death was announced as multiple-organ failure. He had been in the hospital since January 4, when he was admitted with failing kidneys, heart and lungs.

A week of national mourning was declared by President &lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt;. In a televised address, the current president described Suharto as "one of Indonesia's best sons and national leaders who has done very great service to his beloved nation" and called for all Indonesians to pay their respects.

The president is to oversee a state funeral after Suharto's body is taken to his family mausoleum in &lt;a href="w%3ASurakarta"&gt;Surakarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Java"&gt;Central Java&lt;/a&gt; by a fleet of seven &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; planes.

Suharto was born Raden Suharto on June 8, 1921 in Kemusu Argamulja, Java, Indonesia. He was president of Indonesia from 1967 - 1998.

Suharto is survived by two sons and one daughter. His eldest daughter, Tutut, said, "My father passed away peacefully. May God bless him and forgive all of his mistakes."

The &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Paul%20Winter%20Carnival"&gt;Saint Paul Winter Carnival&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Saint Paul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; suffered a brief thaw on Monday, with Monday's 41°F afternoon temperature plummeting below zero twenty four hours later. On Sunday, judging of both ice and snow sculptures had taken place. By Monday afternoon, temperatures above freezing had greatly damaged the outdoor sculptures. In Rice Park, fallen ice from sculptures mixed with chunks left from the previous day's carving. Snow sculptures at the State Fairgrounds were also significantly damaged.
The brief warmth made for comfortable skating on the ♡❤Wells Fargo Winterskate♡❤ rink next to &lt;a href="w%3ALandmark%20Center%20%28St.%20Paul%29"&gt;Landmark Center&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Saint Paul. A block away the ♡❤Hot Dish Tent♡❤ was offering popular high-starch fare.

The Winter Carnival started in 1886, after the city's Chamber of Commerce took offense at a New York reporter's comparison of the city to Siberia. The annual event celebrates the cold weather while drawing people to outdoor and indoor activities.

In a deal announced Tuesday, the &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Twins"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; have traded pitcher &lt;a href="w%3AJohan%20Santana"&gt;Johan Santana&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mets"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt;. The trade is yet to be finalized, pending a physical examination and agreement on a contract extension, but an agreement is expected to be made before 5:00 &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; Friday.

In exchange for the three-time &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game"&gt;all-star&lt;/a&gt; and two-time &lt;a href="w%3ACy%20Young%20award"&gt;Cy Young award winner&lt;/a&gt;, the Twins would receive outfielder &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20G%C3%B3mez"&gt;Carlos Gómez&lt;/a&gt;, and three right-handed pitchers, &lt;a href="w%3APhilip%20Humber"&gt;Philip Humber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADeolis%20Guerra"&gt;Deolis Guerra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Mulvey"&gt;Kevin Mulvey&lt;/a&gt;.

Santana is reportedly looking for a 6 to 7 year deal worth around &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;150 million, and has been on the trading block for some months now. This trade comes just days after the Twins signed multi-year contracts to two of their other stars, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Cuddyer"&gt;Michael Cuddyer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Morneau"&gt;Justin Morneau&lt;/a&gt;. Cuddyer signed a three-year, $24 million deal, and Morneau was given $80 million over six years.

Santana has a 93-44 in his 6 season career with the Twins, recording over 235 strikeouts per season the past 3 seasons. He is one of 14 players to have won the Cy Young more than once, in 2004 and 2006, and he was a MLB All-Star in 2005, 2006, and 2007.

Former United States Senator &lt;a href="John%20Edwards"&gt;John Edwards&lt;/a&gt; announced today that he is quitting the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. Edwards made this announcement during a speech in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, that was scheduled for 1:00 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-5"&gt;UTC-5&lt;/a&gt;) today.

This decision comes after Edwards lost his home state of South Carolina to &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;.

"Today, I am suspending my campaign for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency," Edwards said.

"Now, I've spoken to both Senator Clinton and Senator Obama. They have both pledged to me and more importantly through me to America, that they will make ending poverty central to their campaign for the presidency," he continued.

United States Senator &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; (R-AZ) has won the State of &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;'s Republican Party primary election, edging out former Massachusetts Governor &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; by five percent (36 versus 31%). With this win, Sen. McCain is now clearly the frontrunner going into next week's Super-Tuesday primaries.

One time &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;GOP&lt;/a&gt; front-runner Former &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;a href="Rudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;, who placed a lagging third in Florida, the state he based his campaign on, dropped out of the race Wednesday, largely because he had no previous primary wins and dwindling support.

The mayor endorsed McCain, a long time friend. McCain was quoted saying: "I want to thank my dear friend, my dear friend Rudy Giuliani, who invested his heart and soul in this primary and who conducted himself with all the qualities of the exceptional American leader he truly is".

Democratic Senator and former First Lady &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, also from New York, won the Democratic primary in Florida; however, due to Democratic Party policy, the state has been stripped of its delegates.

<h1>Getting the exclusive lowdown on The Lowdown</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Getting%20the%20exclusive%20lowdown%20on%20The%20Lowdown&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The Lowdown is a service that allows young people to talk about how they're feeling while facilitating the new ways of communication easily adopted by those aged 13-24 years, the demographic of The Lowdown. Young people can talk with the team via email and mobile phone texting, and they also have the opportunity to talk with other similar like-minded people through the on site Internet forum. Ms Bagnall said that research undertaken proved that text and email were the most "effective" ways of communicating with youth. "We also consulted and pre-tested with young people."

Texting is the preferred method for communication.

Ms Bagnall said they were unsure how much the service - which started December 6, 2007 - would cost annually, but expected it to be near the half-million dollar mark due to the recent nature of the site and on going development.

They do not receive any free services from Internet providers and mobile phone companies. However this isn't a worry for them because, as Ms Bagnall says, it is a "public service, not a commercial one so it is not trying to run at a profit."

The Lowdown is always able to be reached. A trained health professional is available between midday and midnight each day, including Christmas Day. Ms Bagnall said, "They work shifts and have their holidays at other times."

There are six staff members at The Lowdown. However, Ms Bagnall says, "The Ministry is aware of gaps [...] in the number of health professionals available to young people. The Lowdown is one of many attempts to improve access to services to young people in need."

Not only do they have health professionals on staff, but they also have support from celebrities. Local New Zealand celebrities accompany the exploration of the site giving helpful advice; sharing their own personal experiences and stories on depression; and home grown music provided free of charge. "The musicians were extremely generous with their time and music. They were very supportive of the purpose of the website and didn't get paid for their contributions, but their music is being promoted through the site."

An average of 320 visitors per day have visited the depression-focused help site between January 1 and January 23, 2008. Ms Bagnall said that most of those accessing the service are in the targeted market. "The service has been running for only a few weeks so we don't have accurate figures yet and we don't know the ages of site visitors unless they access the help services."

New Zealand has high suicide statistics for both youth and older people. Each year there are 500 suicides, of which young people account for 100. Compared to other &lt;a href="w%3AOECD"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt; countries, males between 15 and 24 years of age have the second highest suicide rate behind &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. New Zealand is placed third behind Finland and &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; for females of the same age group. Age-standardised rates for males are fourth highest in the OECD, the fifth highest for females.

The &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20Game%20Show"&gt;2008 Taipei Game Show&lt;/a&gt;, organized by the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), ended on Monday, and was different from shows of past years. This could be seen in the gaming population, industry, and exhibition arrangements.

<h2>Gaming population progressively maturing</h2>

To encourage the participation of the public, not only participants (exhibitors), but also the organizers held lots of on-site events including the "Taiwan Local Game Championship", "Gaming Adventure Area", and several stage events during the show.

With many gaming experts and visitors participating in the several events, the gaming population has progressively matured. Especially in the "Popular Game &amp; Company Voting" category, the public apparently viewed the gaming industry on the bright side as the OBMs (game production companies) produced many "excellence" products and marketed them around the world.

<h2>Excellence from participants</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href="w%3ASony%20Computer%20Entertainment"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, another platform battle</h3>

Since Sony Computer Entertainment Taiwan Limited (SCE Taiwan) was established in December 2007, SCE Taiwan has participated in the 2007 Taipei IT Month to rearrange their styles from marketing and cross-industry cooperations. They finally decided to participate in the 2008 Taipei Game Show and to battle with Microsoft Taiwan by challenging different premiums and plans.

Sony rival, Microsoft Taiwan, sought to gain popularity and notability at this show. Microsoft preliminary moved their new game launch from the 3C store to the TWTC again, since 2007. Also, they invited their spokespeople "&lt;a href="w%3AMayday%20%28Taiwanese%20band%29"&gt;Mayday&lt;/a&gt;" to get more visitors to visit the show. They won all of the categories of the popular presentation class.

After a battle between the two main world-class companies, Microsoft &amp; Sony not only showed different cultures from exhibition arrangements and product presentations but successfully marketed their indicative products in consuming and high-definition markets.

<h3>OBMs in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Some local OBMs like Softstar Entertainment, International Games Systems (IGS), GameFlier Station, UserJoy Technology, and others showed their versatility by participating, not only in the (&lt;a href="w%3AB2B"&gt;B2B&lt;/a&gt;) trade area for international buyers but also the consumer (&lt;a href="w%3AB2C"&gt;B2C&lt;/a&gt;) area for local visitors.

Those participants not only tried to get important orders from buyers but also invited many notable entertainers and sportsmen to the B2C area to strengthen the notability of released games. It helped launch the return of the gaming population, arrangements in the B2B area, and the most important - virtuous competition from the "Popular Game and Company Voting" category.

<h2>Not just a show</h2>
Since the "Charity Bidding Pavilion" was created in the past year and recommended by local NGOs and disadvantaged organizations, the TCA planned to cooperate with the Taipei Orphans Welfare Association, and the Taiwan Gaming Industry Association (TGIA) to help orphan kids this year again.

As of TCA's information in 2007, corporate participants of the TGIA have "adopted" several orphans and accompanied them to grow up in healthy conditions before the show. The companies and organizers were successful in turning the public image of the Taipei Game Show from "a simple consumer show" to "a mixed show with welfare and charity" this year.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrechin%20City%20F.C."&gt;Brechin City&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Afootball%20%28soccer%29"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team, was today ejected from the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Cup"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; following two separate disputes over two cup-tied players.

&lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%20Academical%20F.C."&gt;Hamilton Academical&lt;/a&gt; filed a complaint about the incident to the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Football%20Association"&gt;Scottish Football Association&lt;/a&gt; (SFA) and they decided to stage a replay of the match. However upon hearing of the second player, the SFA decided to remove Brechin from the competition and fine them &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;10,000. Hamilton will go through to play &lt;a href="w%3AAberdeen%20F.C."&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt; in the now delayed Sixth Round at &lt;a href="w%3APittodrie"&gt;Pittodrie&lt;/a&gt;.

Brechin secretary Angus Fairlie said: "It's certainly a big blow. It was an oversight but a very expensive mistake. We thought we would have a big pay day against Aberdeen but still have to pay win bonuses."

The replay match was won by Brechin 2-1 in extra time, after a 0-0 draw in the first encounter.

<h1>Schwarzenegger endorses McCain for U.S. Presidency</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Schwarzenegger%20endorses%20McCain%20for%20U.S.%20Presidency&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; announced his support for &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;'s presidential bid Thursday morning. 

Schwarzenegger called McCain "a great American hero and an extraordinary leader" and praised him for his ability to cross party lines. "I think Senator McCain has proven over and over again that he is reaching across the aisle to get things done," Schwarzenegger said.

Also present was former &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;, who recently dropped out of the race and pledged to support McCain.

"This is a man who is moving us into our future," Giuliani said. "He understands how to do it and also understands how to keep us safe in a time of peril."

Schwarzenegger said he also admires Giuliani and only decided to endorse McCain after Giuliani had dropped out.

"It's all Rudy's fault. Both of them are friends of mine and this is why I really didn't want to endorse anybody," Schwarzenegger said.

The announcement came at a solar panel factory. McCain used this as an opportunity to discuss his views on &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas%20emissions"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aenvironmental%20technology"&gt;environmental technology&lt;/a&gt;, which have come under criticism from others in the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;.

"We don't have to have increased costs to Americans," McCain said. "In fact, with the development of green technologies, we can have reduced costs to the American consumer with the development of new technologies."

California is one of the 24 states whose primary will be held on February 5, also known as &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Tuesday%20%282008%29"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly 15% of the delegates needed to receive the Republican nomination will come from California. Democrats &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; were also campaigning in the state on Thursday.

&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Laith%20al-Libi"&gt;Abu Laith al-Libi&lt;/a&gt;, an al-Qaeda leader in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, was reported killed on &lt;a href="w%3AIslamism"&gt;Islamist&lt;/a&gt; website Ekhlaas.org, saying: "[Libi] was martyred with a group of his brothers in the land of Muslim Pakistan...Though we are sad for his loss, he left a legacy that will inflame the enemy nation and religion." It is speculated that he was hit by a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; missile, which is now identified as being fired from a &lt;a href="w%3APredator%20drone"&gt;Predator drone&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Waziristan"&gt;North Waziristan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, and a dozen more militants were also reported dead.

"The missile appeared to have been fired by a drone," said a Pakistani intelligence official.

♡❤The News♡❤ reports the attack was aimed at al-Libi, as well as Obaidah al-Masri.

"But it's not bin Laden and Zawahri. They do have an ability to regenerate and replace these guys," said a Western intelligence official. Al-Libi is said to have been the third highest ranking member of al-Qaeda.

The Government of Pakistan said they did not know about his death. The details of the death have not yet been fully released.

Authorities had to evacuate at least one building in &lt;a href="w%3ATustin%2C%20California"&gt;Tustin&lt;/a&gt; and shut down a street in &lt;a href="w%3AGlendale%2C%20California"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt; while they examined the substance. Envelopes were also sent to &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Fernando%20Valley"&gt;San Fernando Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Monica%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Monica&lt;/a&gt; locations.

"Initial field testing by LAPD indicates the powder is harmless. However, further testing will be conducted. We will also work to assess what threat, if any, was associated with the mailings and determine whether any federal statutes were violated," said Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;.

The envelopes, which we were sent through the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Postal%20Service"&gt;United States Postal Service&lt;/a&gt;, targeted 10 different Churches throughout southern California. Some also contained threats.

The Church has not issued a statement regarding the incidents and no one has yet claimed responsibility for sending the envelopes. 

This comes just before a scheduled protest which an &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; group called 'Anonymous' has organized, set to take place on February 10 at Church locations across the globe. 

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, authorities stated that there was no evidence connecting the mailings to the Internet group.

On a &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Chanology"&gt;Project Chanology&lt;/a&gt; website, 'Anonymous' made a statement about the senders of the powder under the heading 'To the Public and Anybody Investigating the Anthrax Hoax': "They may not even be Anonymous (they might even have been a plant by the "Church" of Scientology as black propaganda); we do not know, and by the nature of our organization, cannot know."

The town of &lt;a href="w%3ABrattleboro%2C%20Vermont"&gt;Brattleboro&lt;/a&gt; known for its controversial effort in 2007 to impeach President Bush, has once again gained national attention. A petition was signed by 5% of voters from the town, or 436 signatures to charge the President and Vice President of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; with war crimes.

Residents of the town will vote on town meeting day to decide whether to pursue charges of &lt;a href="w%3A%20war%20crimes"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt; against both President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;.

The petition read as follows:

"♡❤Shall the Selectboard instruct the Town Attorney to draft indictments against President Bush and Vice President Cheney for crimes against our Constitution, and publish said indictments for consideration by other authorities and shall it be the law of the Town of Brattleboro that the Brattleboro Police, pursuant to the above-mentioned indictments, arrest and detain George Bush and Richard Cheney in Brattleboro if they are not duly impeached, and prosecute or extradite them to other authorities that may reasonably contend to prosecute them?♡❤"
Officials in Brattelboro have stated that this is merely a symbolic vote, as the town and its law enforcement officers lack the power to arrest the President.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; software giant &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has launched an unsolicited bid to buy Internet search giant &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;44 billion or approximately US$31 per share.

The deal, which is half in cash and half in stock, if accepted by Yahoo!'s shareholders, could create a major competitor to &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, the search giant which currently dominates the Internet search market.

Many &lt;a href="w%3AMusic%20video%20game"&gt;rhythm gamers&lt;/a&gt; are anticipating the release of ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3ATaiko%20no%20Tatsujin"&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin&lt;/a&gt; 11: Asian Version"♡❤, the &lt;a href="w%3ANamco%20Bandai%20Games"&gt;Namco Bandai Games Inc. (NBGI)&lt;/a&gt; beta version of which was recently showcased at the &lt;a href="2008%20Taipei%20Game%20Show"&gt;2008 Taipei Game Show&lt;/a&gt;.

In fact, several managers from amusement stores in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; frequently imported large quantities of arcade games, including rhythm games. Eventually, some slot machine developers modified codes from several game consoles like the &lt;a href="w%3AWii"&gt;Wii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%202"&gt;PlayStation 2 (PS2)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASega%20Saturn"&gt;Sega Saturn&lt;/a&gt; to fulfill needs for &lt;a href="w%3AVideo%20arcade"&gt;amusement arcades&lt;/a&gt;, but they risked hardware failure and &lt;a href="w%3Acopyright%20infringement"&gt;copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt;.

But before those modifications happened in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, many rhythm games just used songs from other arcade machines due to copyright issues from enrolled songs.

The upcoming game will benefit &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20Mandarin"&gt;Mandarin-language&lt;/a&gt; gamers after its release, but it may hide some secrets behind the development of ♡❤"Taiko no Tatsujin 11: Asian Version"♡❤. ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter recently interviewed the producer of ♡❤"Taiko no Tatsujin"♡❤ Tatsuhisa Yabushita to talk about some of the background of this upcoming game and its series.

<h2>Interview</h2>
&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rico Shen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; It became a hot topic after the NBGI decided to showcase the ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3ATaiko%20no%20Tatsujin"&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin&lt;/a&gt; 11: Asian Version"♡❤ at the 2008 Taipei Game Show, and it's different from past series' because the NBGI acquired several Mandarin-language songs from the Cross-Strait area (Taiwan, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;) especially. When you choose them, what factors go into the decision?

♡❤♡Tatsuhisa Yabushita♡❤♡: We [the NBGI] enrolled those various songs based on their own performances and rankings from Cross-Strait countries. But we'll still keep several songs from &lt;a href="w%3ANamco"&gt;Namco&lt;/a&gt; original, Japanese-pop, and classical music in this upcoming game.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I believe that a developer should be aware of international copyright coordination before choosing a song for a game, not only in rhythm games, but also games of other types. For instance, I know that some controversy erupted in Taiwan after some covers of Japanese songs were recorded in other languages without agreements from the original singers and composers. Before the release of this upcoming game, have you coordinated with record companies about the copyright issues?

♡❤♡Yabushita♡❤♡: Everyone should respect copyrights, as you said. I guarantee that every song from the ♡❤"Taiko no Tatsujin"♡❤ series in console and arcade versions is licensed through coordination with those companies.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Some gamers may be confused because the console version of the ♡❤"Taiko no Tatsujin"♡❤ series is only available for PS2. After the release of the ♡❤"Taiko no Tatsujin 11: Asian Version"♡❤, will the NBGI release different versions in different countries similar to the way ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3ATaiko%20Drum%20Master"&gt;Taiko Drum Master&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤ was released with special designs for &lt;a href="America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;n and &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an gamers?

♡❤♡Yabushita♡❤♡: Currently, we'll focus our developments on the arcade version and temporarily not to consider different releases for different countries. This is because we will evaluate opinions from amusement stores and gamers after its release.

<h2>Summary</h2>
The ♡❤"Taiko no Tatsujin"♡❤ series became a hot topic after amusement stores imported several arcade machines in Taiwan. The release of the ♡❤"Taiko no Tatsujin 11: Asian Version"♡❤ aims to please countries speaking the Mandarin language.

Service to millions of Internet users in the Middle East and Asia has been disrupted, following damage to undersea cables. 

The cables, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20East%20Asia-Middle%20East-Western%20Europe%204"&gt;SEA-ME-WE 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFiber-Optic%20Link%20Around%20the%20Globe"&gt;FLAG&lt;/a&gt;, which provide communications services for various countries&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; including India, Pakistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; are believed to have been damaged by a ship attempting to moor off Egypt on Wednesday, January 30, 2008. 

One day later, on February 1, the &lt;a href="w%3AFALCON%20%28cable%20system%29"&gt;FALCON&lt;/a&gt; cable was also reported cut 56 km off Dubai. Repair ships have been sent to both breaks, with capacity to India expected to reach 80% of its usual speed by Friday, February 2.

According to the telecommunications provider Qtel, a fourth cable linking Qatar to the United Arab Emirates was damaged on Sunday, February 3.

A total of five cables being operated by two submarine cable operators have been damaged with a fault in each.

<h1>News briefs:February 01, 2008</h1>
<h2>Wikinews News Brief [Date]</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
[Opening music] This is Wikinews News Brief, summarising the current news on [Day] [Date] [Month] 2008 at [HH]:[MM] hours UTC. I’m Nicholas Turnbull.

<h2>Events of worldwide notability, military action, disasters etc.</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Violence%20takes%20place%20in%20Chad%20capital%20N%27djamena%20as%20military%20and%20rebels%20clash"&gt;Violence takes place in Chad capital N'djamena as military and rebels clash&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
In the African nation of Chad, violent clashes have been reported between the military and rebel groups. Attacks have also been carried out on the United Nations Refugee Agency and personnel of other aid organisations, causing the UN High Commission for Refugees to evacuate the majority of their staff from the town of Guereda in eastern Chad, as reported in a press release from the UN. Rebel forces continue to advance towards N'djamena [pr: nnchameena] the capital of Chad. The country's military chief has said that the battle has ended with the rebels being destroyed entirely, whilst rebel leader Timan Edrimi [pr: tee-mon eh-dreamy] has made an opposing claim that the Chadian army attacked their forces but were driven back from outside the town of Massaguet [pr:massage-wey] by the rebels' counterattack. According to ♡❤Agence France-Presse♡❤, the European Union force has suspended all flights to Chad, although it was made clear that this was only a temporary delay. The commander of the European Union forces in Chad stated that he did not feel that there was a danger presented by the rebels to European forces. Military action between the rebels and the Chadian military continues.

<h3>&lt;a href="High%20level%20al-Qaeda%20leader%20reported%20dead"&gt;High level al-Qaeda leader reported dead&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
According to an Islamist website, high level leader of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan Abu Laith al-Libi has been killed. Speculations were made that he had been hit by a US missile, which has now been identified as a Predator drone, in the North Waziristan region of Pakistan. Twelve further al-Qaeda militants have also been reported dead in the attack. Pakistani newspaper ♡❤The News♡❤ reported that the attack was aimed at the leader as well as Obadiah al-Masri. An unnamed Western intelligence official expressed a view that the individuals killed by the missile were not high enough in al-Qaeda's hierarchy, and were thus replaceable. However, al-Libi was said to be the third highest-ranking official in al-Qaeda. The Government of Pakistan claims to be unaware of his death, and official information is yet to be released.

<h3>&lt;a href="International%20manhunt%20for%20alleged%20kidney%20harvester"&gt;International manhunt for alleged kidney harvester&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
An international manhunt has begun for a man referred to in the Indian press under the nickname "Dr. Horror", whose true identity is unknown, following suspicions that he is behind a ring that has been harvesting human kidneys involuntarily for the purposes of sale to wealthy clients both in India and abroad. On January the 24th, Indian police raided a clinic in Gurgaon, a satellite city of Delhi, where they found evidence that impoverished labourers were having kidneys removed, sometimes coerced at gunpoint. This is in violation of a law passed by the Parliament of India that made it illegal to donate organs except to close relatives, in an effort to curb the massive black market in transplanted organs. The accused is thought to have most recently used the pseudonym Amit Kumar; the Indo-Asian News Service has identified him as Santosh Rameshwar Raut, a former prominent nephrologist. A day labourer named Mohammed Salim reported to local television station NDTV that he had been approached by a stranger with an offer for a job and, on his acceptance, was taken to a room with gunmen who injected him with an anaesthetic; on regaining consciousness, Salim was told that his kidney had been removed. Gurgaon's police commissioner suspects approximately 400 to 500 kidney transplants have been done by these doctors over the last nine years. Two British citizens have been apprehended by Indian police but have not yet been charged. The investigation continues.

On Friday, the &lt;a href="w%3AMemphis%20Grizzlies"&gt;Memphis Grizzlies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Basketball%20Association"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; agreed to send forward-center &lt;a href="w%3APau%20Gasol"&gt;Pau Gasol&lt;/a&gt; and their 2010 second-round draft pick to the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Lakers"&gt;Los Angeles Lakers&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for center &lt;a href="w%3AKwame%20Brown"&gt;Kwame Brown&lt;/a&gt;, rookie point guard &lt;a href="w%3AJavaris%20Crittenton"&gt;Javaris Crittenton&lt;/a&gt;, and two first-round draft picks in 2008 and 2010.

Also sent to Memphis were Pau's brother &lt;a href="w%3AMarc%20Gasol"&gt;Marc Gasol&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAaron%20McKie"&gt;Aaron McKie&lt;/a&gt;, who was signed by the Lakers the same day.

Lakers General Manger Mitch Kupchak said, "Pau is a proven player of All-Star caliber in this league who can score and rebound and he's still a young player. We feel this move strengthens our team in the short term as well as the long term."

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Commercial%20Appeal"&gt;The Commercial Appeal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a &lt;a href="w%3AMemphis%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, also reports that Grizzlies forward &lt;a href="w%3AStromile%20Swift"&gt;Stromile Swift&lt;/a&gt; will be traded to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Nets"&gt;New Jersey Nets&lt;/a&gt; for center &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Collins"&gt;Jason Collins&lt;/a&gt; in a deal expected to be finalized on Monday.

Gasol is averaging 18.9 points and 8.8 rebounds per game this season, while Brown has a season average 5.7 points and 5.7 rebounds per game.The move officially ended the former number one over all pick's dubious stay in Los Angeles. In his two plus years with the Lakers, Brown never was able to play consistent enough to please the front office. The ability of Los Angeles to acquire Gasol for Brown, Crittenton and two future first round draft picks has some around the league scratching their heads. "How can the Lakers get Pau Freakin' Gasol and not give up one of their nine best players," fumed NY Post column contributor William Mcknight.

Unbalanced trade or not, the Lakers now will head into the second half of the season as one of the strongest teams in the elite team heavy Western Conference.

At least 151 passengers and an unknown number of crew on board a &lt;a href="w%3ALloyd%20Aereo%20Boliviano"&gt;Lloyd Aereo Boliviano&lt;/a&gt; (LAB) &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20727"&gt;727-200&lt;/a&gt; have escaped after the aircraft crash landed in swampland in &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;.

Local airline LAB had been operating the chartered passenger flight from &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Paz"&gt;La Paz&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ACobija"&gt;Cobija&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of &lt;a href="w%3ATAM%20-%20Transporte%20Aereo%20Militar"&gt;Transporte Aereo Militar&lt;/a&gt; (TAM) when poor weather conditions caused the jet to be diverted. LAB has recently been handling excess passengers for TAM as an unusually severe rainy season has washed away many roads across the nation.

A flight engineer said that during the flight the engines failed due to a mechanical problem. The plane came down in a swampy forest clearing approximately 2 miles (3.3km) from a runway at the new destination of &lt;a href="w%3ATrinidad"&gt;Trinidad&lt;/a&gt;, 370 miles from the intended destination. Several passengers were injured in the accident, and all on board were taken to hospitals for checks. One pilot received a clavicle fracture.

The plane was severely damaged, with the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporting that photographs of the scene showed at least one wing of the aircraft to have separated from the fuselage.

Survivors confirmed this. Paolo Bravo, a Bolivian senator on board the plane, said to local radio network Erbol "We noticed the engines went out, and there was this calm... Then they told us, 'Crash positions! crash positions!' and it was just another two or three seconds before we hit... The plane fell, the wings broke off, but the fuselage was OK."

Experts from the Auxiliary Aerial Navigation Service and an airport commented that it is possible that the soft mus in the area absorbed some of the impact forces, allowing the plane to be salvaged and returned to service. LAB's operations chief Gustavo Viscarra made a statement saying "The crew members did not suffer any problem and there is no blood... The airplane has minimum damages, there is no structural damage, there was not any fire nor smoke. It was a forced landing planned by the pilot and it was not caused by our enterprise's negligence nor lack of maintenance of our airplanes."

Passenger numbers are unclear, with LAB reporting 151 and some media sources saying 155.

An investigation has been launched. It has been established that an undisclosed technical problem prevented the plane from departing for an hour.

Legal and financial difficulties have seen LAB suspend operations for almost a year, but the carrier has recently begun a limited return to charter services.

&lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; radio station &lt;a href="w%3ARTL%20%28French%20radio%29"&gt;RTL&lt;/a&gt; announced today that President &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; has married his &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; girlfriend &lt;a href="w%3ACarla%20Bruni"&gt;Carla Bruni&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89lys%C3%A9e%20Palace"&gt;Élysée Palace&lt;/a&gt;. They quote "several witnesses" of the alleged ceremony, which the local mayor of the &lt;a href="w%3AVIIIe%20arrondissement"&gt;8th arrondissement of Paris&lt;/a&gt;, François Lebel, presided. The President's office and his spokesman have refused to comment.

According to radio station &lt;a href="w%3AEurope%201"&gt;Europe 1&lt;/a&gt;, mayor Lebel admitted he wed the couple, saying that "the bride was in white, she looked gorgeous. The groom didn't look bad either." The radio stations say that Nicolas Bazire and Mathilde Agostinelli were the best men and maid of honour. Lebel told &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France%20Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt; that some 20 guests were present, close relatives and a couple of friends.

If confirmed, Sarkozy would be the first French President of the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Fifth%20Republic"&gt;French Fifth Republic&lt;/a&gt; to marry during his office, after already becoming the first one to divorce.

On January 10, the French newspaper L'Est Republicain already reported that they may have married, and several false reports continued thereafter. Responding to questions about a possible marriage, Sarkozy said in early January that his relationship with Ms. Bruni was "serious", but that "the media will not set the date. It is highly likely that you will hear of it only when it has taken place."

The couple's first public appearance was at Disneyland Paris, and they remained in the centre of media attention during recent visits to Egypt and Jordan.

A month after the President's divorce, the couple met in November at a sing-along to cheer up the lonely President. Bruni, 40, is a former model who started a career as a singer. She was previously linked to &lt;a href="w%3AMick%20Jagger"&gt;Mick Jagger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Clapton"&gt;Eric Clapton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. She has a grown-up son from a previous relationship, while Sarkozy, 53, has three sons from his two previous marriages.

<h1>NASA to beam Beatles song into deep space</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%20to%20beam%20Beatles%20song%20into%20deep%20space&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
On February 4, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; will digitally transmit the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Beatles"&gt;Beatles&lt;/a&gt; song ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAcross%20the%20Universe"&gt;Across the Universe&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in the direction of the star &lt;a href="w%3APolaris"&gt;Polaris&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as the North Star.

This will mark the first time music has been sent into deep space. The song will be transmitted from the DSS-63 radio antenna at the &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid%20Deep%20Space%20Communication%20Complex"&gt;Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARobledo%20de%20Chavela"&gt;Robledo de Chavela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; at 12:00 am &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;.

The broadcast celebrates the 40th anniversary of the song's recording, the 45th anniversary of NASA's &lt;a href="w%3ADeep%20Space%20Network"&gt;Deep Space Network&lt;/a&gt;, and the 50th anniversary of NASA itself.

Polaris is approximately 431 &lt;a href="w%3Alight%20year"&gt;light year&lt;/a&gt;s away from Earth, meaning it will take 431 years for the song to reach the star traveling at the &lt;a href="w%3Aspeed%20of%20light"&gt;speed of light&lt;/a&gt;.

NASA's press release includes statements from Beatle &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20McCartney"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt;, who tells NASA to "send [his] love to the aliens", and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Lennon"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt;'s wife &lt;a href="w%3AYoko%20Ono"&gt;Yoko Ono&lt;/a&gt;, who sees the event as "the beginning of the new age in which we will communicate with billions of planets across the universe."

The idea was hatched by &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Lewis"&gt;Martin Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;-based humorist and Beatles historian.

"It never had the highest profile and is a bit of a forgotten classic," Lewis said of the song. "But it has universal appeal. It transcends ages, borders, language and other barriers."

NASA invites astronomy fans and Beatles fans alike to play the song simultaneously as it is being transmitted into space.

This year, Phil did see his shadow when pulled out of his burrow on Gobblers' Knob, which according to &lt;a href="w%3AGroundhog%20day"&gt;an essentially German superstition&lt;/a&gt;, means the area should brace for more winter weather.

This year, visitors came from as far as &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; to see the annual event, which may be linked to a European festival of &lt;a href="w%3ACandlemas"&gt;Candlemas&lt;/a&gt;. The crowd of nearly 30,000 people was one of the largest in the event's history.

In &lt;a href="w%3AWiarton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Wiarton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWiarton%20Willie"&gt;Wiarton Willie&lt;/a&gt;, however, predicted an early spring for Canadians in the province. Just a day ago a heavy snowstorm blaze struck Ontario and Quebec. "Dignitaries, me lads and ladies, get your shorts and T-shirts too, Wiarton Willie's annual task is through. Now the town crier proudly rings, Willie predicts it's an early spring," said town crier Bruce Krugerwhile while ringing his bell. &lt;a href="Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AShubenacadie%20Sam"&gt;Shubenacadie Sam&lt;/a&gt; also predicted an early spring. It is said up to ten thousand people attend the event in Ontario annually.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has held a memorial ceremony to mark the fifth anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster"&gt;disaster&lt;/a&gt;. All seven astronauts were killed when their spacecraft broke up on re-entry over &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; on February 1, 2003, 16 minutes prior to scheduled landing time at &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Columbia♡❤ had been damaged by a chunk of loose foam during takeoff 16 days earlier.

NASA officials, astronauts, schoolchildren and family members attended the ceremony, which was held just miles from ♡❤Columbia♡❤♡s intended landing site. Approximately 200 people attended the event, held at the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Mirror%20Memorial"&gt;Space Mirror Memorial&lt;/a&gt; to all 24 astronauts killed in space disasters. Each was presented with a rose, which was placed in front of a granite memorial bearing the names of the 24.

Evelyn Husband-Thompson, widow of commander Rick, who has remarried just three weeks ago, said "This morning, I couldn't stop thinking about Rick and Willie and Kalpana and Dave and Mike and Laurel and Ilan. All of our families went through so much that day. We so miss them, and we will never forget them."

44 teenagers from &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; were amongst those present, there in respect to astronaut &lt;a href="w%3AIlan%20Ramon"&gt;Ilan Ramon&lt;/a&gt;. Some came from the same school Ramon had attended. 15-year-old Roman Rashchupkin said "He's Israeli, so it's important. He learned in our school."

&lt;a href="w%3AG.%20Madhavan%20Nair"&gt;G. Madhavan Nair&lt;/a&gt; represented &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; at the memorial, remembering Indian astronaut &lt;a href="w%3AKalpana%20Chawla"&gt;Kalpana Chawla&lt;/a&gt;. Nair is chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Space%20Research%20Organisation"&gt;Indian Space Research Organisation&lt;/a&gt;.

Former shuttle commander &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Readdy"&gt;Bill Readdy&lt;/a&gt; commented that, despite a large number of memorials, including one on &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;, "... much more importantly than any physical monument, they're memorialized right here in our hearts," Going on to name them individually, then saying "We'll always miss your easy laughter and your smiling faces. God willing, five years from now, they'll have even more to be proud of us about as we take even longer strides ... back to the moon and onward toward Mars. May God bless the crew of Columbia."

NASA boss &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Griffin"&gt;Michael Griffin&lt;/a&gt; was amongst several people who commented on the dangerous nature of spaceflight. He proceeded to read a letter from &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; praising the astronauts, which was then presented to Husband-Thompson. "Space exploration is a dream deeply rooted in humanity, and the seven brave astronauts of Columbia sacrificed their lives so the rest of mankind could realize that dream," said Bush's letter. "They assumed great risk so they could understand what lies beyond the heavens. We are grateful for their service and they will be always be cherished."

Griffin also noted the importance of learning from mistakes, adding "Americans don't quit and we won't quit. We'll never quit," and that "not quitting has high costs."

It wasn't the only such anniversary around this time. The 41st anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3AApollo%201"&gt;Apollo 1&lt;/a&gt; fire was on Sunday, and Monday saw the 22nd anniversary of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Challenger"&gt;Challenger&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster"&gt;disaster&lt;/a&gt;.

With less than 72 hours to go until the &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Tuesday"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; primary election event, Republican and Democratic candidates are campaigning all across the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; this weekend in hopes of gaining votes.

Democratic Senator &lt;a href="w%3AHilary%20Clinton"&gt;Hilary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; is spending Saturday in the state of &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, while rival Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; is making stops in &lt;a href="w%3AIdaho"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMissouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; today. However, the Clinton Campaign is also present in &lt;a href="w%3AArkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; today where former President, &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, is talking about educational reforms. 

On the Republican side, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; is in the South trying to win support of fellow Evangelicals for his campaign. 

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href="w%3ANashville"&gt;Nashville&lt;/a&gt; today before he heads to opponent &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;'s home state of &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow.

Also on the election front, on Friday Senators McCain and Obama won the endorsements of the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most read newspapers in the US. Obama also received the endorsements of the liberal political action committee at &lt;a href="w%3AMoveOn.org"&gt;MoveOn.org&lt;/a&gt; and California's Service Employees International Union, which represents 650,000 people. 

Most of the candidates are raising funds for TV advertising this weekend, including Senator McCain whose ads will air in 20 states this weekend. The Campaign Media Analysis Group estimates that spending on political ads alone could reach an unprecedented $20 million.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Keyes"&gt;Alan Keyes&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Republican candidates who has not received media attention over the past few months, shifted his campaign efforts to &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where he is this weekend. His campaign is notable because it is made up of largely grassroots efforts.

Super Tuesday is in fact the biggest day of the primary elections for both Republican and Democratic candidates, with elections in 24 states.

&lt;a href="w%3AEarl%20Butz"&gt;Earl Butz&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government official who served as &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;Secretary of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; under Presidents &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Nixon"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Ford"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; has died today. He was 98.

Butz was born Earl Lauer Butz on July 3, 1909 in &lt;a href="w%3AAlbion%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Albion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;.

In 1948, Butz became vice president of the American Agricultural Economics Association, and three years later was named to the same post at the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers. In 1954, he was appointed Assistant Secretary of Agriculture by President &lt;a href="w%3ADwight%20D.%20Eisenhower"&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt;. 

In 1971, President &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Nixon"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; appointed Butz as Secretary of Agriculture, a position in which he continued to serve after Nixon resigned as the result of the &lt;a href="w%3AWatergate%20scandal"&gt;Watergate scandal&lt;/a&gt; in 1974.

In 1981, Butz pleaded guilty to federal &lt;a href="w%3Atax%20evasion"&gt;tax evasion&lt;/a&gt; charges, for having underreported income he had earned in 1978. On June 19 he was sentenced to five years in prison; however, all but 30 days of the term were suspended. He was also fined $10,000 and ordered to pay $61,183 in civil penalties.

Two weeks ago, on February 1, it was the second day of the national environmental &lt;a href="w%3AFocus%20the%20Nation"&gt;Focus the Nation&lt;/a&gt; teach-in. One of these events, which took place at the same time at other educational institutions across the country, took place in the city of &lt;a href="w%3ALynn%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Lynn&lt;/a&gt; at the campus of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Shore%20Community%20College"&gt;North Shore Community College&lt;/a&gt;.

Wikinews accredited reporter was there in attendance along with Congressman &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Tierney"&gt;John F. Tierney&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%27s%206th%20congressional%20district"&gt;Massachusetts's 6th congressional district&lt;/a&gt; and Lynn's &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20State%20Senate"&gt;State Senator&lt;/a&gt; Thomas McGee. One of Lynn's two representatives, Robert Fennell, also attended; the other representative Steven Walsh sent an aide. The representatives for the nearby cities of &lt;a href="w%3ASalem%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Salem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABeverly%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Beverly&lt;/a&gt;, John Keenan and Mary Grant along with various local area mayors and city councilors also attended the event.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kerry"&gt;John F. Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, the senator for Massachusetts was supposed to attend but could not due to voting on the economic stimulus package in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;. However, Senator Kerry did record a video statement &lt;a href="w%3ADVD"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; for the event in which he addressed the gathered crowd. North Shore's president, Wayne M. Burton, hosted the event.

Senator McGee started things off by talking about the need to recreate the North Shore Technical High School to include a focus on environmental jobs and the need to improve the Essex Agricultural and Technical High School which is deteriorating, but is known for it's agricultural teaching which would help to save the dwindling farming areas north of Boston. 

McGee urged people that should get more involved with their local farming &lt;a href="w%3Aco-op"&gt;co-ops&lt;/a&gt; and that farmland needs to be recognized and redeveloped. He noted that obesity in young people is a problem and that schools are developing partnerships with local farms to provide more healthy meals and to show students whats going on at their local farm.

Representative Keenan commended the college for holding this dialogue and &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; along with his movie, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAn%20Inconvenient%20Truth"&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Keenan noted the need for Salem's coal-fired power station for the need to switch to clean coal.

Walsh aide's brought up the fact he is committed to ending paper waste at the Massachusetts State House.
The city council president from &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, Roseann Bongiovanni, who is also the associate executive director of the local community organization, the Chelsea Collaborative, asked the various reasons for the crowd in why they became concerned about global warming. The audience noted the melting of ice sheets, air quality, &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; and Al Gore.

Bongiovanni then noted that Chelsea and neighboring &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Boston"&gt;East Boston&lt;/a&gt; have no green space or waterfront due the industrialization of both areas, noting that 100% of the jet fuel for planes at Logan Airport, 70% to 80% of heating oil and that the trucks delivering the oil are spewing diesel. She also noted the large salt pile in Chelsea used for the deicing of highways in the Commonwealth and said that it is located there "illegally."

She further noted the company, Energy Management Inc., behind the controversial &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Wind"&gt;Cape Wind&lt;/a&gt; project, proposed building a diesel power plant across the street from a Chelsea elementary school and that air quality in Chelsea is bad. She closed her dialogue by noting that "Global warming does not recognize boundaries."

Mary Grant said she was interested in hearing ideas and noted the redeveloping of Beverly's high school to include more solar panels and a new wind turbine and that the school would be powered by 50% of it.

One person asked the need to lower the level of bureaucracy in government as she was "running around
city government" in order to have a bee farm in her backyard. 

Robert Fenell, the owner of Lynn's Capitol Diner who is notable for keeping chickens at the establishment located in downtown Lynn just two blocks away from the college noted that people should start going organic and going back to nature, that people should switch to more energy efficient lighting and grow gardens in their backyard.

After Fennell spoke it was time for questions and answers, and questions were given by various audiences members including Mannion himself, who asked about the &lt;a href="w%3AMBTA"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Line%20%28MBTA%29"&gt;Blue Line&lt;/a&gt; and rapid transit and others asking various questions such wither or not to include a green curriculum in state education or asking for the politicians to talk more on some of their positions.

After questions and answers finished, the video statement from John Kerry began to play. Kerry noted that there are still skeptics of global warming and climate change in Congress who "test the science" despite the efforts and research of Al Gore and the United Nations and noting that "the White House is the last place for change." 

He then went on to say that the world needed a new international treaty on climate change and noted that America is horrendous when it comes to energy efficiency. Kerry also noted that the Bush administration resisted the change and the points of the climate conference in Bail; "Luckily, time is almost up," added Kerry. 

Kerry went on to mention the need for massive new research on new energy and capturing carbon and noted he was working with Alaska's senator, Ted Stevens on pushing for sequestering plants. 

Kerry continued the theme of environmental conservation and change by topping off his statement by reminding the crowd of first Earth Day and how it lead to the creation of the &lt;a href="w%3AClean%20Air%20Act"&gt;Clean Air Act&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AClean%20Water%20Act"&gt;Clean Water Act&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEndangered%20Species%20Act"&gt;Endangered Species Act&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; and it noted it happened because of people's actions.

Tierney finished off the speech by noting the need for high risk energy research in the style of DARPA so we can better compete against the "Chinas and Japans." He also called for more &lt;a href="w%3Agreen-collar"&gt;green-collar&lt;/a&gt; jobs and noted his work on last year's Green Jobs Act.

Five women are reported dead after a shooting at a strip mall in suburban &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, and police are searching for the perpetrator, who they say fled the scene. According to police, the shooting may have been part of a botched robbery.

The shooting took place at a &lt;a href="w%3ALane%20Bryant"&gt;Lane Bryant&lt;/a&gt; clothing store in &lt;a href="w%3ATinley%20Park%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Tinley Park&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb of Chicago. Tinley Park police Sgt. T.J. Grady says a 911 call reported the shooting at 10:44 a.m. When police arrived, they found all five victims lying in a back room of the store.

Other stores in the strip mall, including a &lt;a href="w%3ATarget"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, were temporarily locked down as police officers — armed with pistols and rifles — searched for the gunman.
"Every store was immediately canvassed and a search by air too has given us every indication that the offender has left the scene," Grady said.

Selena Kujawa, who was inside the Target with her 5-year old son when police entered, said, "I was so scared I couldn't think."

Grady did not identify the names of the victims, as their families are still in the process of being notified. However, the victims have now been identified as ranging between ages 22 and 37, and at least one is believed to be a store employee. 

He described the shooter as an &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican-American"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; man, about 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighing between 230 and 260 pounds. He was reportedly wearing a black coat, a knit cap, and dark jeans. Grady believes the shooter is no longer in the immediate area. 

Tinley Park police chief Mike O'Connell said that more information would be made available Sunday afternoon, when forensic exams have been completed. 

"This is a very serious and sensitive investigation," O'Connell said.

Illinois senator and Chicago resident &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; released the following statement addressing the shootings: "I was deeply saddened to learn about the shooting in Tinley Park, and my heart goes out to the victims' families. This kind of violence is unacceptable — not just in a shopping center where we're supposed to feel safe, but wherever it occurs. And as the facts become clear, I hope the authorities find and prosecute whoever is responsible for this tragedy."

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Giants"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Patriots"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt; 17-14 to win &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl%20XLII"&gt;Super Bowl XLII&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Phoenix%20Stadium"&gt;University of Phoenix Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGlendale%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, Sunday night. A touchdown by the New York Giants in the last seconds of the very tight game disrupted the New England Patriots' quest for a perfect, undefeated season.

The Patriots attained the lead early in the second quarter, and regained it with 2:42 left in the 4th quarter, losing it only when the game-winning touchdown was scored by &lt;a href="w%3APlaxico%20Burress"&gt;Plaxico Burress&lt;/a&gt; with 35 seconds left to play.

"The drive at the end there were so many clutch plays by so many guys. It is an unbelievable game and an unbelievable feeling," said Giants quarterback &lt;a href="w%3AEli%20Manning"&gt;Eli Manning&lt;/a&gt;.

The first quarter started off with a 16 play drive by the Giants which took up nearly 10 minutes and ended in a field goal. Three seconds into the second quarter, the Patriots answered back with a 1 yard run from &lt;a href="w%3ALaurence%20Maroney"&gt;Laurence Maroney&lt;/a&gt; after a pass interference call.

The third quarter of the game was scoreless. With 11:05 remaining in the fourth quarter, Eli Manning threw a five yard pass to &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Tyree"&gt;David Tyree&lt;/a&gt;, making the score 10-7. The Patriots then made the score 14-10 on a seven yard pass from &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Brady"&gt;Tom Brady&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ARandy%20Moss"&gt;Randy Moss&lt;/a&gt;.

The next drive for the Giants proved to be the winning one, with Tyree catching a pass that led the team to the Patriots' 24 yard line; Plaxico Burress' following touchdown reception was enough to regain the lead and win the game. 

Eli Manning was named the &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award"&gt;Super Bowl Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt; and was awarded the Pete Rozell Trophy.

"This is the greatest feeling in professional sports. For us to come out and win a world championship tonight -- nobody gave us a shot," said Plaxico Burress.

Some &lt;a href="w%3AInfluenza"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; viruses in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; have shown increased levels of &lt;a href="w%3ADrug%20resistance"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AAntiviral%20drug"&gt;antiviral drug&lt;/a&gt; Tamiflu (&lt;a href="w%3Aoseltamivir"&gt;oseltamivir&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) said on Friday. Similar trends have been reported earlier in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

Tamiflu is currently the recommended treatment for humans infected with bird flu, and governments worldwide have been stockpiling the drug in case of a flu pandemic.

The drug resistance appears to be limited to the &lt;a href="w%3AH1N1"&gt;H1N1&lt;/a&gt; variant which causes seasonal flu, while &lt;a href="w%3AH3N2"&gt;H3N2&lt;/a&gt; or influenza B strains and the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain that causes bird flu did not show increased resistance. 
While previous studies showed resistance levels below 1%, samples tested by the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; now showed around 5% resistance, and in a Canadian survey of 81 samples, 8 showed resistance. The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Centre%20for%20Disease%20Prevention%20and%20Control"&gt;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control&lt;/a&gt; found 19 cases of resistance among 148 samples from last November. Among 16 samples from &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, 12 showed resistance. In a wider study of 437 H1N1 isolates from 19 countries, the European agency found 59 resistant samples from 9 countries.

Resistance has not been shown to increase in &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. In Japan, Tamiflu is widely prescribed for seasonal flu. The WHO is now contacting national authorities to get more data on flu resistance.

These viruses have acquired a mutation that makes them resistant, and the WHO statement said that a resistant strain has probably emerged spontaneously. The statement added that these mutations would most likely render Tamiflu ineffective for the prevention or treatment of flu caused by resistant H1N1 viruses.

The WHO also stated that this phenomenon does not influence the effectiveness of flu immunizations. Resistant strains have shown no evidence of causing more severe disease or being more easily transmissible.

At least 30 people have been killed by twin earthquakes in &lt;a href="Rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;.

Deputy Rwandan Police Chief Mary Gahonzire spoke to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in &lt;a href="w%3AKigali"&gt;Kigali&lt;/a&gt;, saying of a magnitude 5.0 to 6.0 quake that struck there "The death toll [in Rwanda] has now increased to 25 from the earthquake. Two hundred have serious injuries," while Bernard Watunakanza, acting governor of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Kivu"&gt;South Kivu&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABukavu"&gt;Bukavu&lt;/a&gt; region, said "Up to now, there are five dead and 149 seriously injured." This makes the total current death toll 30 and injury count 350.

Radio Rwanda reports that ten of the Rwandan fatalities occurred together when a church collapsed onto them, killing them instantly. AFP reports the Rwandan ambulance service cannot cope with the casualties and public buses have been drafted in to help.

The quake could also be felt in nearby &lt;a href="Burundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt;, but there are no reports of damage or injuries there.

A court in &lt;a href="Paraguay"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; has completed its trial over the worst fire disaster the country has ever seen. The &lt;a href="w%3AParaguay%20supermarket%20fire"&gt;Ycuá Bolaños supermarket fire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAsunci%C3%B3n"&gt;Asunción&lt;/a&gt; left 374 dead, 450 others injured and nine missing, presumed dead.

Store owner Juan Pio Paiva, 64, received 12 years imprisonment whilst his son Daniel Paiva, 40, was given 10 years. A security guard, Daniel Areco, was given a five-year sentence while three business associates of the Paivas were cleared of any criminal activity.

2,000 people were in the store when fire broke out on August 1, 2004, including many families with young children. Fire doors were shut to prevent looting, worsening the situation.

The investigation found that flames broke out in a badly built chimney because of inadequately maintained equipment. A lack of fire escapes, fire detection system and fire suppression system all contributed to the disaster. Most of the deaths were caused by asphyxiation due to the smoke. The nine missing bodies are believed to have been completely destroyed by the extreme temperature.

Paiva senior was convicted on the basis that as the owner and chief administrator of the business, including the building, he was responsible for overall safety. His son was responsible for the food court area, the site where the blaze started. The security guard was convicted for blocking the exits, although he was acting on senior orders. The three other businessmen were acquitted as they were not involved in the administration of the store.

The Paivas were both convicted of manslaughter and exposing people to danger within the workplace. Areco was found guilty of negligence.

The three judge tribunal was headed by German Torres. It replaced an earlier trial in 2006, when the court announced that it was 2-1 in favour of more lenient sentences, but got no further as friends and relatives stormed the courtroom and rioted in the streets outside. The court had been going to hand out five-year sentences to the Paivas.

A peaceful protest was also held at yesterday's verdict, with demonstrators shouting "Assassins! Assassins!" and "This kind of justice is injustice!" Ten women who lost relatives fainted in the heat and were hospitalised. The protestors were pressing for those involved to receive the maximum possible sentence of 25 years. One, Lys Torres, vowed to use the appeals courts to press for tougher sentences. "Its an outrage. They're responsible for the death of 400 people and they've been given ridiculous sentences," said Lys, who is a spokeswoman for the relatives and survivors group. "This shows that in this country, people with money can kill with impunity," Bersabe Meza, who lost her husband in the fire, said.

Chief prosecuter Edgar Sanchez, who had also requested maximum sentences, said "My conscience is clear. I've done my job."Meanwhile, relatives laid out a white plastic chair in the streets for each of those killed, adorned with signs bearing such notices as "If there is no justice, the people will rise up."

The ruined store remains standing, graffitied and adorned in tribute to those who died.

<h1>Church of Scientology: '&quot;Anonymous' will be stopped&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Church%20of%20Scientology%3A%20%27%26quot%3BAnonymous%27%20will%20be%20stopped%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

"Activities of Anonymous have been reported to the Authorities and actions are being taken. Their activities are illegal and we do not approve of them. At the same time, our main work is to improve the environment, make people more able and spiritually aware. ... yes, we are taking action," said Laetitia.

'Anonymous' first came to public attention when the group launched &lt;a href="w%3ADenial-of-service%20attack"&gt;denial-of-service attacks&lt;/a&gt; against the Church's website, following the Church's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring &lt;a href="w%3AScientologist"&gt;Scientologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Although YouTube is complying with the requests to remove the video, other sites such as &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt; have stated that they will continue hosting the video. 

Fielding expert opinions on the Church's response, Wikinews turned to &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Heldal-Lund"&gt;Andreas Heldal-Lund&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Clambake"&gt;Operation Clambake&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ project, as well as a former Scientologist who wished to remain anonymous.

"I believe strongly in freedom of speech and, living in the best country in the world, I came to the conclusion that I had to help protest this cult. To me CoS [Church of Scientology] was then, and still is, a fascistic organization and a real threat to our democratic principles," said &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Heldal-Lund"&gt;Andreas Heldal-Lund&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of ♡❤Operation Clambake♡❤.

"The strategy was to disarm the cult; if they took down something I linked to, I had made preparations to link to another copy or host it myself. The more they resisted it the more attention we got, the more the information was spread and the more people got involved. It felt like a cat and mouse game for many years. What for me started as a weekend stunt grew far beyond my initial scope and Operation Clambake became the site most critics linked and referred to," added Heldal-Lund.

Heldal-Lund states that the effort of the Church to remove criticism of its organization from the web is failing.

"The cult 'Orgs' are 'dead'. Recruiting in most western countries where they once experienced a healthy organic growth is very hard. All their most secret documents are spread beyond recall and easily available for anybody interested. More people than we ever dreamed now know about Scientology and at least that it 'smells fishy'. All the information we once fought day and night to protect is now easily available for free and on the top of Google. The cult has even given up threatening us," added Heldal-Lund who also said that there are "no major lawsuits ongoing or pending" against ♡❤Operation Clambake♡❤.

"We are taking action, Anonymous will be handled and stopped, but not to the detriment of us stopping all community outreach activities. We've had people throw attacks at us in the past as they do not agree with the betterment of people. History is strewn with such people who start wars, wreak havoc etc. and they never continue to exist in the long run as their purpose is one of destruction. That's a statistical and historical fact," stated Laetitia.

Laetitia had earlier stated that ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ was not allowed to use the quotes that they provided saying they, "have a problem with [♡❤Wikinews♡❤] quoting this. You are writing on a help website and it isn't the right source for the "Scientology opinion," but later acknowledged that the inquiries were of a press nature stating, "you have made it clear [that you are a journalist] and I appreciate you being upfront on the matter."

An expert evaluation on the e-mails by a former Church member and expert on the religion reveals that Laetitia may have slipped, providing information that she may not have been authorized to provide.

"The person you were speaking to was from the 'Planetary Dissemination Org' (PDO), a unit within the Sea Org responsible for promoting Scientology to new recruits which is responsible for Scientology’s websites. Most probably, the person that you were talking to did not have permission to talk to the press, which is why the person got edgy when publication was talked about. Judging by the way she responded, I am of the opinion that she felt that ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ was 'PTS' [Potential Trouble Source] as a result of being connected to whoever Scientology believes 'Anonymous' is, thus was attempting to handle Wikinews’ suppressive tendencies that they believe would occur as a result. It is also interesting to note that she followed a Scientology training document entitled 'BTB 10 DEC 1969 REPORTER TRs'," said the expert who wishes to remain totally anonymous.

"'Then using different questions, the PRO [Public Relations Officer] gives 'no answers'. The trick is to appear to answer the question by giving generalized statements in simple terms so that the reporter doesn't realize his question hasn't been answered'. Aside from being an obvious filibuster, it also shows she has been trained to deal with reporters," added the expert who also said that the question the Church asked ♡❤Wikinews♡❤: 'Are you part of Anonymous or are you pro-Scientology', "I find this particularly interesting as an example of Scientological for-or-against logic. In other words, if you aren't pro-Scientology, the writer reasoned, you must be a member of Anonymous because you wouldn't be writing to her."

As the war between the Internet and Scientology rages on, the owner of ♡❤711chan.org♡❤ says that he is prepared to "re-enter the CoS scene", and respond to ♡❤The Regime♡❤, a hacker group which attempted to shut down ♡❤711chan♡❤ using keylogging to gain an administrator password to ♡❤711chan♡❤. Prior to the site coming back online this morning, Plasma, the owner and operator of ♡❤711chan.org♡❤, had this to say; 

"The g00ns, one of our allies, are working on getting "The Regime" and told us to get right back into the CoS scene -- which means as soon as 711chan is back online, we will be re-entering raid mode." Also, despite earlier claims and suspicions that ♡❤The Regime♡❤ might have been hired by or be part of the Church of Scientology, Plasma told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that ♡❤The Regime♡❤ "are not part of the Church. g00ns [organization] have a long history with 'immortal', and what 'immortal' is trying to do is get at g00ns by using 711chan. It's nothing against us."

The website came back online this morning, and already over 18,000 posts have been made on its functioning imageboards. The owners have, via a message posted on the homepage of the site, promised to restore the other boards in the coming weeks dependent on which boards the users would like to see revived. One Anonymous user of the site had this to say about the revival, "711 is patched up and ready to take it's place among the Legion."

Worldwide protests have been scheduled by 'Anonymous' to take place against the Church on February 10, 2008. There are expected to be at least 217 protests taking place on the 10th at Church headquarters around the globe.

In a poll conducted by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ on 816 internet news readers, 80% (660) said that The Internet will win the war against Scientology. 7% (63) said that the Church would win. 8% (66) said neither side will win and 3% (27) didn't care.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ held an exclusive interview with &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Allyn%20Root"&gt;Wayne Allyn Root&lt;/a&gt;, one of the candidates for the &lt;a href="w%3ALibertarian%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Libertarian Party&lt;/a&gt; nomination for the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.

Root is the founder and chairman of Winning Edge International Inc., a &lt;a href="w%3Ahandicapping"&gt;sports handicapping&lt;/a&gt; company based in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, he is an author and a television producer, as well as an on-screen personality both as host and guest on several talk shows.

Root, a long-time &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;, declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party on May 4, 2007.

He says he is concerned about the qualities of many who run for president, and fears that they do not know the needs of American citizens. He also says that they cater to big businesses instead of small ones.

He has goals of limiting the federal government and believes that the US went into &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; for wrong reasons. A strong supporter of the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terror"&gt;War on Terror&lt;/a&gt;, he feels that it was mishandled. He has conservative values and came from a blue collar family in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated from &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; with fellow presidential hopeful &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; in 1983.

Root believes that America is in trouble and hopes to change that if elected.

<h1>Tadić re-elected President of Serbia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tadi%C4%87%20re-elected%20President%20of%20Serbia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Incumbent &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Tadi%C4%87"&gt;Boris Tadić&lt;/a&gt; has narrowly defeated nationalist candidate &lt;a href="w%3ATomislav%20Nikoli%C4%87"&gt;Tomislav Nikolić&lt;/a&gt; in the second and final round of &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASerbian%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.

Tadić received 50.5% of the vote and Nikolić garnered about 47.9% according to CeSID, a vote monitoring organization. The voter turnout was projected to be 67.7%, the country's highest turnout since the &lt;a href="w%3ASerbian%20presidential%20election%2C%202000"&gt;2000 election&lt;/a&gt;.

The second round of the election was a runoff that occurred nearly two weeks after the first round on January 21. None of the candidated secured a high enough vote total to be declared President. Nikolić won the first round with about 40% of the vote, while Tadić came in second with 35%.

"Serbia has shown its great democratic potential," Tadić said in a victory speech.

At his party headquarters, Nikolić conceded defeat in the race. "Tadic won, my congratulations," Nikolić said, adding, "We will be a strong opposition both to the authorities and the president." 

Tadić is the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28Serbia%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;. He holds pro-Western attitudes and supports Serbian membership into the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;.

Nikolić, leader of the nationalist &lt;a href="w%3ASerbian%20Radical%20Party"&gt;Serbian Radical Party&lt;/a&gt;, supported closer ties with &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, Serbia's historical ally.

Both candidates were opposed to independence for &lt;a href="Kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;, although the province is expected to declare independence within the month.

A military tribunal at the &lt;a href="w%3AGitmo"&gt;Guantanamo Bay detention camp&lt;/a&gt; is hearing arguments today over the legality of trying Canadian &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Khadr"&gt;Omar Khadr&lt;/a&gt; for alleged &lt;a href="w%3Awar%20crimes"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt;, given his status as a minor at the time of the incident.

Khadr is charged with the murder of Sgt. &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Speer"&gt;Christopher Speer&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and spying. The charges stem from a 2002 incident in which the 15-year old allegedly threw a grenade at U.S. troops after they directed an air-strike at the Afghan compound he was sharing with &lt;a href="w%3AMujahideen"&gt;Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt; insurgents.

A number of groups, including &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;, have sent &lt;a href="http%3A//hrw.org/english/docs/2008/02/01/usint17956.htm"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20Defence"&gt;Secretary of Defence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt; alleging that the military tribunal is "not equipped to meet juvenile justice standards" and that Khadr should either be tried before a civilian court or repatriated to Canada.

&lt;a href="w%3AJennifer%20Daskal"&gt;Jennifer Daskal&lt;/a&gt;, senior counter-terrorism counsel at Human Rights Watch explained that the United States "should not make matters worse by prosecuting him before an unfair military tribunal."

Khadr's lawyer &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Edney"&gt;Dennis Edney&lt;/a&gt; challenged the attempts to label the 21-year old as a war criminal asking "...Why is he not being treated as a child soldier?" Lt Cdr &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20C.%20Kuebler"&gt;Bill Kuebler&lt;/a&gt;, the American military commissions counsel in the case, agreed that the charges should be dismissed since the tribunal lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute minors.

Canadian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; however, has said that his country will not intervene in the case to seek extradition of Khadr, re-affirming Canada's status as the only Western country who has not demanded the release or extradition of their citizens held in Guantanamo.
Claiming to have been abused, threatened with rape and forced into painful positions since his arrival in Guantanamo in 2002 , Omar Khadr has been the subject of two psychiatric assessments that claimed he suffered from mental disorder as a result of his imprisonment, and was at risk of suicide.

Khadr was previously charged by the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20military%20commission"&gt;Guantanamo military commission&lt;/a&gt; in November 2005, before the judicial body was ruled "unlawful" by the Supreme Court. Last June, a military judge dismissed a second series of charges against Khadr because his 2004 &lt;a href="w%3ACombatant%20Status%20Review%20Tribunal"&gt;Combatant Status Review Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; had classified as an "enemy combatant" rather than an "illegal enemy combatant", meaning that he did not qualify under the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20Commissions%20Act%20of%202006"&gt;Military Commissions Act&lt;/a&gt;. Three months later, however, the Court of Military Commission Review ruled that the Commission would be allowed to make its own determination of the legality of a combatant.

<h2>Wikinews News Brief February 04, 2008</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
[Opening music] This is Wikinews News Brief, summarising the current news on the 4th of February 2008 at 03:31 hours UTC. I’m Nicholas Turnbull.

<h2>Events of worldwide notability, military action, disasters etc.</h2>

<h3>&lt;a href="Tribunal%20considers%20role%20of%20Canadian%20minor%20in%20alleged%20war%20crimes"&gt;Tribunal considers role of Canadian minor in alleged war crimes&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
A military tribunal at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp heard arguments today over the legality of trying 21-year-old Canadian citizen Omar Khadr for alleged war crimes despite his status as a minor at the time of the incident. Khadr is charged with the murder of Sgt. Christopher Speer, in addition to attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and espionage. The charges stem from a 2002 incident in which the 15-year old allegedly threw a grenade at U.S. troops after they directed an air-strike at the Afghan compound he was sharing with Mujahideen insurgents. Khadr's lawyer Dennis Edney has challenged the attempts to label him as a war criminal, arguing that he be treated instead as a child soldier. The legal counsel of the American Military Commission has agreed with the assessment that the charges be dismissed, on the grounds that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction to prosecute minors. The case continues. 

<h3>&lt;a href="Tadi%C4%87%20re-elected%20President%20of%20Serbia"&gt;Tadić re-elected President of Serbia&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
In Serbia, the current president and Democratic Party leader Boris Tadić has won a further term of presidency in the second and final round of the country's presidential election. Opposing candidate and leader of the Serbian Radical Party Tomislav Nikolić was defeated by a narrow margin, receiving 2.6% fewer votes than Tadić, who holds pro-Western attitudes and is in support of Serbia joining the European Union. Nikolić, leader of the nationalist Serbian Radical Party, supported closer ties with Russia, Serbia's historical ally. Independence of Kosovo is supported by both candidates, the province being expected to declare independence by the beginning of March.

<h3>&lt;a href="Egypt%20seals%20border%20with%20Gaza%20after%2011%20days"&gt;Egypt seals border with Gaza after 11 days&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Egypt closed its border with the Gaza Strip yesterday, ending 11 days of unrestricted movement of Palestinians to and from Egypt. Barbed wire and metal barricades have been used to seal the remaining gaps in the existing barricade across the border. Egyptian citizens in Gaza are being allowed to return back to Egypt, and Palestians on the Egyptian side of the border are being permitted to return to Gaza; the Egyptian government is, howeer, allowing no new crossings. On the Palestinian side of the border, militants affiliated with Palestinian Islamist militant organisation Hamas have been turning people back, telling them that the border is closed; despite reports of altercations with Gazans who still wanted to cross into Egypt, most reports have described the situation as fairly calm.

<h3>&lt;a href="Sentences%20handed%20down%20over%20Paraguay%27s%20worst%20fire"&gt;Sentences handed down over Paraguay's worst fire&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
In Paraguay, a court has completed its trial over the worst fire disaster that has affected the country, the Ycuá Bolaños supermarket fire in Asuncion. The fire, which broke out on the 1st of August in 2004, left 374 dead and 450 others injured, with nine missing and presumed dead. Approximately 2,000 people were inside the supermarket when the fire broke out, including many families with young children; fire doors were shut to prevent looting, worsening the situation by trapping customers inside. The investigation has shown that the blaze started in a badly-built chimney because of inadequately maintained equipment; a lack of fire escapes, fire detection systems and fire suppression systems all contributed to the death toll. Most of the deaths occurred due to asphyxiation from the smoke. Store owner Juan Pio Paiva, aged 64, was sentenced to twelve years' imprisonment, whilst his son Daniel Paiva, aged 40, was given a ten-year sentence, both convicted of manslaughter and exposing people to danger within the workplace. This retrial followed protests by friends and relatives of the deceased after a court had previously been in favour of more lenient five-year sentences. 

<h3>&lt;a href="At%20least%2030%20killed%20by%20earthquakes%20in%20Rwanda%20and%20Congo"&gt;At least 30 killed by earthquakes in Rwanda and Congo&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
At least 30 people have been killed by two earthquakes in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The magnitude of the earthquakes was thought to be between 5.0 to 6.0 on the Richter scale. The Deputy Police Chief of Rwanda, Mary Gahonzire, told Reuters that the death toll has increased to 25 in the earthquake; in Congo, Bernard Watunakanza, acting governor of the Bukavu region, has stated that five people were killed and 149 were seriously injured. This brings the total death toll to 30, and a total of 350 injuries. The earthquake could be felt in nearby Burundi, but no reports of damage or injuries there have been issued.

<h3>&lt;a href="Drug-resistant%20flu%20rising%2C%20says%20WHO"&gt;Drug-resistant flu rising, says WHO&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
Some influenza viruses in the United States and Canada have shown increased levels of resistance to the antiviral drug Tamiflu, the World Health Organization reported on Friday. Similar trends were reported earlier in Europe. Tamiflu is currently the recommended treatment for humans infected with influenza, including the H5N1 strain, commonly referred to as "bird 'flu". Governments worldwide have been stockpiling the drug in case of a 'flu pandemic. The drug resistance appears to be limited to the H1N1 variant which causes seasonal flu, while H3N2 or influenza B strains and the H5N1 strain that causes bird flu did not show increased resistance. Interestingly, resistance to the medication has not been observed in Japan or Hong Kong, despite Tamiflu being widely prescribed for seasonal 'flu in Japan.

<h2>Non-disastrous local events with notable impact and dead celebrities</h2>
In the ongoing battle between the Church of Scientology and the nebulous Internet group known only as "Anonymous", a representative of the Church of Scientology has responded to inquiries by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ reporter Brian McNeil over the recent attacks on the Church of Scientology's web sites in e-mail correspondence. The representative, signing the messages as "Laetitia", ignored the specific questions put by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ over the damage inflicted on the Church and what action the Church intends to undertake, replying only in general terms. The representative stated that the Church of Scientology has reported the activities of "Anonymous" to the authorities, adding that the Church considers their activities to be illegal and that Anonymous "will be handled and stopped", although specific information on what this action entails was not forthcoming in the correspondence. Andreas Heldal-Lund, the creator of Operation Clambake, a website that seeks to expose Scientology, considers that Scientology's efforts to have criticisms against it and confidential information removed from the Internet are failing. An anonymous expert on the Scientology religion who is a former member of the Church told Wikinews that Laetita may have slipped by providing information that she had not been authorised to provide, and that the lack of concrete answers given in response to the questions are part of Scientology's codified techniques for dealing with news reporters.

<h2>Business, commerce and academia</h2>

<h2>Arts and culture</h2>

In fashion, the first two days of the New York Fashion Week have debuted fashions that are similar to those in past years. Many designers have shown off their newest creations, including a return of turtleneck sweaters and miniskirts. The ubiquitous fashion staple of the miniskirt has been incorporated into designs that are even shorter than in the past; and if the first two days of the Fashion Week are any indication, another year of miniskirts being in vogue is forthcoming, partnered with tights which were widely expected to go out of fashion for 2008. Major labels Nicole Miller, Lacoste, BCBG and Baby Phat showed off their styles in the first two-days of the week-long event. Talk of the beginnings of an economic recession in the United States has sparked fears in the fashion industry, in which a lackluster fashion scene an make or break both established brands and up-and-coming new designers. The New York Fashion Wek runs until Friday.

<h1>100 turn out in Orlando, Florida for &quot;Anonymous&quot; protest against Church of Scientology</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=100%20turn%20out%20in%20Orlando%2C%20Florida%20for%20%26quot%3BAnonymous%26quot%3B%20protest%20against%20Church%20of%20Scientology&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The group "Anonymous" formed a movement called &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Chanology"&gt;Project Chanology&lt;/a&gt; in response to what it views as suppression of &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; by the Church of Scientology. The group was initially motivated by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring Scientologist &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; from the Internet. The Church of Scientology issued legal complaints to &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt;; YouTube took the video down, but Gawker has refused to do so.

Project Chanology participants successfully took down several Scientology websites in mid-January utilizing &lt;a href="w%3ADenial-of-service%20attack"&gt;denial-of-service&lt;/a&gt; attacks. The group has organized a series of &lt;a href="w%3ANonviolence"&gt;nonviolent&lt;/a&gt; protests to take place outside Church of Scientology centers worldwide on February 10, 2008. There are expected to be at least 217 protests taking place on the 10th outside Church of Scientology buildings around the globe, including &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Montreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Houston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.
Protestors at the Orlando, Florida rally held signs with messages including "Knowledge is Free Scientology Isn't", "Who Is &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20McPherson"&gt;Lisa McPherson&lt;/a&gt;?", "www.xenu.net", and "Honk if you hate Scientology." An unnamed organizer of the rally told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOrlando%20Sentinel"&gt;Orlando Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that the group is protesting "a gross violation of the right to see free church material," referring to the Tom Cruise video the Church of Scientology attempted to suppress. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWKMG-TV"&gt;WKMG-TV&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, protestors claim the Church of Scientology is a "dangerous cult" and said the organization is responsible for crimes and deaths. 

Dr. Lee Sheldon of the Church of Scientology of Orlando released a statement regarding the protests: "While we recognize the right to legal protest, when such protest escalates to spreading lies and hate speech, it is a concern for everyone. We look forward to continuing to provide service to the city of Orlando and Central Florida." 

According to a post from a protestor to the online newsgroup &lt;a href="w%3Aalt.religion.scientology"&gt;alt.religion.scientology&lt;/a&gt;, Scientologists complained to the police during the protest that the event should be shut down for advocating "hate speech", but the ♡❤Orlando Sentinel♡❤ reported that police monitored the event and made no arrests.
&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Bunker"&gt;Mark Bunker&lt;/a&gt; of XenuTV.com had previously criticized Project Chanology for the denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites, but in a YouTube video post on Sunday, Bunker spoke positively of Saturday's nonviolent protest in Florida. "I saw a video today from Orlando and there were a hundred and fifty people out on Saturday to protest and it looked like a lot of fun. Got a lot of car honks and everything looked peaceful and I want to say nice job and I hope everything goes as smoothly on February 10th. I have to say a hundred and fifty people in Orlando that's pretty impressive. Can't wait to see what happens at other cities around the country and around the world actually."

&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; airline &lt;a href="w%3ARyanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt; took a 12% slump in this morning’s trade, further intensifying concern about poor market conditions amid recessionary fears. Today, Ryanair announced a 27% drop in pre-tax profits in its third quarter net profits. Further falls are predicted for the company in its next fiscal year. 

"With oil prices at $90 a barrel and fear of recession in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and many other &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; economies, the current outlook for the coming fiscal year is poor. While it is impossible to accurately forecast full year fuel prices and yields this far in advance, there is now a significant chance that profits may decline next year," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary cautioned.

Ryanair said that it is not hedged against oil price increases for the next fiscal year. 

However, Ryanair is not the only airline to suffer from the economic downturn. &lt;a href="w%3AAer%20Lingus"&gt;Aer Lingus&lt;/a&gt; shares are down 3% to €2.30. &lt;a href="w%3AEasyjet"&gt;Easyjet&lt;/a&gt; has declined 11%. However shrewd, Mr. O’Leary has plans to spend up to 200 million purchasing back shares in the company, which equates to 3% of the company share capital.

The &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20national%20football%20team"&gt;national football team&lt;/a&gt; has defeated the &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFinnish%20national%20football%20team"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; in a friendly football match in &lt;a href="w%3APaphos"&gt;Paphos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;.

The match was held as part of a four-nation, five-day tournament in front of 600 people, mostly supporters of Poland. The latter side was largely experimental as coach &lt;a href="w%3ALeo%20Beenhakker"&gt;Leo Beenhakker&lt;/a&gt; is using the tournament, in which Poland will play two matches, to test new players. “This was a fine test,” he commented after the match.

The only goal was scored by &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Kokoszka"&gt;Adam Kokoszka&lt;/a&gt; after 43 minutes. In the 65th minute Kokoszka got another shot clear of Finland goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AHenri%20Sillanpaa"&gt;Henri Sillanpaa&lt;/a&gt; but it was cleared.

As well as Finland and Poland the tournament features &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Finland are the only country of these not to be going to &lt;a href="w%3AEuro%202008"&gt;Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt;; Poland and the Czech Republic have qualified, and Greece is the current champion.

&lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has said on its blog that it finds &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;’s attempt to buy &lt;a href="Yahoo%20"&gt;Yahoo &lt;/a&gt; "troubling," and that Google believes "this [the purchase of Yahoo] is about more than simply a financial transaction, one company taking over another."

"The hostile bid by Microsoft to Yahoo is worrying," said David Drummond, the chief legal officer for Google. He continued by saying the takeover is "about preserving the underlying principles of the Internet: openness and innovation."

Press agency Europa Press said that Eric E. Schmidt and Jerry Yang know that the "possibility of launching a counter is not possible for Google."

Yahoo said that their executives are examining the offer from Microsoft, a process that they said may take some time. 

The Google blog cited Microsoft’s alleged "inappropriate and illegal influence over the PC," as the reasons for their concerns. They continued by saying that “Microsoft has frequently sought to establish proprietary monopolies."

<h1>LDS church names Monson their new president</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=LDS%20church%20names%20Monson%20their%20new%20president&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Monson, at 80 years old, succeeds &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20B.%20Hinckley"&gt;Gordon B. Hinckley&lt;/a&gt;, who died January 27 and was buried on Saturday.

"Hinckley's passing has affected all of us," Monson said at the press conference held at the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20Office%20Building"&gt;Church Office Building&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;. "We shall miss him, yet he has left us with a wonderful legacy." 

Monson says he intends to continue Hinckley's legacy, and that he expects "no abrupt changes from the courses [the church] [has] been pursuing."

Monson named &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20B.%20Eyring"&gt;Henry B. Eyring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADieter%20F.%20Uchtdorf"&gt;Dieter F. Uchtdorf&lt;/a&gt; the First and Second Counselors, respectively, of the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Presidency"&gt;First Presidency&lt;/a&gt;, which is the highest governing body of the church.

"I learned quickly in the church that we're not representing a nation or country or ethnic group," said Uchtdorf, a native &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;. "We are ... representing the Church of Jesus Christ."

The LDS church follows a pattern of succession in choosing a new president. When the president dies, the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Quorum%20of%20the%20Twelve%20Apostles"&gt;President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles&lt;/a&gt; is handed the position. &lt;a href="w%3ABoyd%20K.%20Packer"&gt;Boyd K. Packer&lt;/a&gt; will now serve as President of the Quorum, after years of serving as the Quorum's acting president.

Monson simultaneously served as both First Counselor and President of the Quorum under Hinckney's administration due to his seniority. He also served as Second Counselor under the previous two presidents of the church. He was first called to be an apostle in 1963 at the age of 36.

For the first time in &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;'s history, the &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Department%20of%20Transportation"&gt;Texas Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; (TxDOT) is conducting an online vote to help decide which &lt;a href="w%3AVehicle%20registration%20plate"&gt;license plate&lt;/a&gt; design the state will use beginning in early 2009.

The week-long vote is being held at &lt;a href="http%3A//apps.dot.state.tx.us/services/vehicle_titles_and_registration/vote_plate.htm"&gt;dot.state.tx.us&lt;/a&gt;. It started Monday at noon and will end on February 11 at the same time. Anyone can vote for one of five license plate designs, including the current design.

The designs are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Traditional Texas &amp;mdash; This simple design features blue highlights at the top and bottom and a gold star.
BULLET::::- Lone Star Texas &amp;mdash; This design uses a mountainous landscape under a bright, cloudy sky as its background. In the top left corner is a white star amid a splash of red and blue.
BULLET::::- Natural Texas &amp;mdash; The background is a field filled with &lt;a href="w%3Awildflowers"&gt;wildflowers&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- New Texas &amp;mdash; This red, white and blue design features a skyline composed of landmarks from major Texas cities including &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%2C%20Texas"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;. A large gold star is faintly visible in the background.
BULLET::::- My Texas &amp;mdash; This is the current license plate that was introduced in 2000. It features silhouettes of a desert landscape with an &lt;a href="w%3Aoil%20derrick"&gt;oil derrick&lt;/a&gt; and a man on horseback, as well as a starry night sky with a &lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20shuttle"&gt;space shuttle&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
All of the designs incorporate the state's name, an outline of the state, and the state's nickname, "The Lone Star State". TxDOT says they took legibility and reflectivity into account when making the designs, in order to promote safety and law enforcement.

The decision to allow a public vote was made because the state was running out of six-character combinations to assign to drivers. The new license plates will have seven characters, regardless of the public's decision.

"By the end of this year, we will be out of license plate combinations for the three letters and three numbers that we currently put on the general-issue plate," said Rebecca Davio, director of Vehicle Titles and Registration. "Because we need to change the plate, we thought it was the perfect time to invite Texans to participate in a design selection."

According to TxDOT, it took 33 years to exhaust the number of six-character combinations, and using current population growth figures, they project it will take 35 years to run out of seven-character combinations.

The Texas Transportation Commission must give final approval of the design. TxDOT says the commission is "enthusiastic" about giving the public an opportunity to vote for the new design. 

TxDOT considered allowing the public to submit designs, but ultimately decided that it would use a "substantial amount of state-worker time" and wouldn't be a "prudent use of taxpayer money".

At the time of this writing, an unofficial vote count showed the "Lone Star Texas" design in first place with over 22,000 votes. "Natural Texas" was second with over 14,000, followed by "Traditional Texas", "New Texas", and the current design "My Texas".

Thousands of people in more than 160 cities around the world marched today in protest of the actions of the &lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (FARC). The protests were convoked via the popular social networking website &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; under the name "One million voices against the FARC" (&lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20language"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;: ♡❤Un millón de voces contra las FARC♡❤).

The majority of the protesters gathered in &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;n departments, such as &lt;a href="w%3ABogot%C3%A1"&gt;Bogotá&lt;/a&gt;, and in the cities of &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMaracaibo"&gt;Maracaibo&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. 

The protests kicked off with &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, and were followed by &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.

The protests were organized by a movement called "I am Colombia" (Spanish: ♡❤Colombia Soy Yo♡❤), under the motto "No more kidnappings, no more lies, no more deaths, no more FARC."

The FARC is a &lt;a href="w%3AMarxism-Leninism"&gt;Marxist-Leninist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGuerrilla%20warfare"&gt;guerrilla&lt;/a&gt; organization, considered a terrorist group by more than 30 countries around the world, and has more than 8,000 members occupying almost 20% of Colombia's territory. It claims to represent the rural poor in a struggle against Colombia's wealthier classes and opposes United States influence over the country.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Orlando%20Sentinel"&gt;The Orlando Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ published a scathing editorial rebuke of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. Congresswoman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGinny%20Brown-Waite"&gt;Ginny Brown-Waite&lt;/a&gt; in its Monday edition. The editorial specifically addressed comments made by the lawmaker last week that &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Ricans&lt;/a&gt; are "foreign citizens" and therefore should not receive tax rebate checks from the United States government.

In a press release sent out last Tuesday, Rep. Brown-Waite (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Florida"&gt;FL&lt;/a&gt;) said, "...The bill sends hundreds of millions of dollars to people who do not pay federal income taxes, including residents of Puerto Rico and territories like Guam. I do not believe American taxpayer funds should be sent to foreign citizens who do not pay taxes. Americans want an economic stimulus for &lt;a href="w%3ADunnellon%2C%20Florida"&gt;Dunnellon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrooksville%2C%20Florida"&gt;Brooksville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AClermont%2C%20Florida"&gt;Clermont&lt;/a&gt;, not for &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico"&gt;San Juan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AHag%C3%A5t%C3%B1a%2C%20Guam"&gt;Hagåtña&lt;/a&gt;. As the legislation moves forward, it must be changed to ensure that only federal taxpaying American citizens receive rebate checks."

Rep. Brown-Waite represents the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%27s%205th%20congressional%20district"&gt;fifth congressional district of Florida&lt;/a&gt;, which covers much of the &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%20Bay"&gt;Tampa Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan areas, which are home to sizable numbers of Puerto Ricans. Puerto Rico is a commonwealth, or an unincorporated organized territory, of the United States. While Puerto Rico natives do not pay federal income tax if they are non-Federal employees, they do pay toward Social Security, Medicare and other salaried taxes. Puerto Ricans have been citizens of the United States since the passing of the &lt;a href="w%3AJones-Shafroth%20Act"&gt;Jones-Shafroth Act&lt;/a&gt; in 1917. Also mentioned in Rep. Brown-Waite's statement are residents of Guam, who do pay taxes but the revenues stay on the island, located in the western Pacific. Guamanians have been American citizens since 1950.

&lt;a href="w%3AEduardo%20Bhatia"&gt;Eduardo Bhatia&lt;/a&gt;, the Washington, D.C.-based representative for the Governor of Puerto Rico, wrote a letter to Rep. Brown-Waite condemning her remarks. "Your comments...published in the Orlando Sentinel complaining that Puerto Ricans are 'foreign citizens' and should not benefit from the federal economic stimulus plan were not only wrong but also highly insensitive," Bhatia wrote, continuing on to hypothesize that her remarks "stemmed from sheer ignorance about Puerto Rico." After making that remark, Bhatia went on to chastise Rep. Brown-Waite's press release further, citing that there are over two million Puerto Ricans living in New York and Florida, the state Rep. Brown-Waite is from and the state she represents in Congress, respectively.

&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Aponte"&gt;José Aponte&lt;/a&gt;, the Speaker of the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Puerto%20Rico"&gt;House of Representatives of Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, also condemned Brown-Waite and her remarks, asking for a full apology to Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans living in the United States. "Congresswoman Brown-Waite's statement is infuriating and contradictory as it pertains to four million of her fellow American citizens that live in our island...the distorted perception she has of Puerto Ricans is incredible given that she is part of a state with a large population of Hispanics of which close to a million are Puerto Ricans."

The Puerto Rican community in Central Florida, which numbers 220,000 in the Orlando area alone, were livid after hearing of Brown-Waite's remarks. "She is an ignoramus," said Emilio Pérez, president of the Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce of Central Florida. "I think we should make an example of her. Puerto Ricans should unite to support whoever is running against her in the next election." Zulma Vélez Estrada, a Puerto Rican activist in Kissimmee, called for protests in an open letter she wrote to the Puerto Rican community. "Are we going to consent to this nonsense or are we going to stand for our dignity and demonstrate our place in history, and in this community?"

However, it was ♡❤The Orlando Sentinel♡❤ that had a sizable say in Monday's edition, dedicating their second editorial column in the past five days to Rep. Brown-Waite and her remarks. "It's bad enough that an elected official serving in Washington should be so clueless, but Mrs. Brown-Waite then became defiant when she was called out on her historical hiccup," the editorial stated, which represents the majority opinion of the editorial board at Central Florida's largest newspaper. The ♡❤Sentinel♡❤ goes on to claim that her press representative remarked that her comments were "fine as is." "No, it isn't," the editorial read. "It's embarrassing that a U.S. congresswoman can't get her facts straight on who's a U.S. citizen."

It still remains to be seen what avenue Rep. Brown-Waite will take next, if any, to repair the rift her remarks caused with many of her constituents.

&lt;a href="w%3AAffleck%27s%20Palace"&gt;Afflecks Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the "iconic, alternative shopping centre" in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Quarter"&gt;Northern Quarter&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, was saved from closure this week after long-running rumours that the market may have to "kick out its traders" due to a dispute between the management of the Afflecks Palace brand and the leaseowner for the building, Bruntwood. 

Rumours suggesting that Bruntwood were looking to redevelop the building started early in 2007, when it became apparent that the property developer was not actively seeking to renew the twenty-five year lease that the management of Afflecks Palace had with them concerning the building. These initial fears were added to by news that Bruntwood was looking to redevelop other buildings it owned in the Northern Quarter area, specifically the parking complex opposite Afflecks, with an eye towards taking advantage of the "property boom" in Manchester at the time. There were also fears that if Afflecks did remain open, "rents would rise".

These initial fears were eventually propagated closer to the end of the year when a letter from the management of Afflecks Palace told individual stall holders that "... management have received no formal response from Bruntwood to a tenancy request notice served in October [2007]", going on to add that "We can only assume therefore that they do not intend to offer us a new lease".

Following the release of this letter, public support for Afflecks Palace was quickly made obvious when a 5,000 signature petition was submitted demanding the centre remain open for business. This seemed to prompt talks between Bruntwood and the Afflecks Palace management and, eventually, lead to this week's news that the market was - indeed - to remain open. The result of the talks was that Bruntwood "bought out" the Afflecks Palace brand. 

A spokesperson speaking on behalf of Bruntwood also added that: "Never in our 30 year history have we bought one of our customer's businesses, but Afflecks is a Manchester icon that we wanted to protect. We aren't however expert in managing markets, so will look for a suitable long term owner. In the meantime, the most important aspect is that we have arrived at a solution with Afflecks management that protects an independent retail environment and provides the existing stallholders with security."

Traders from the market celebrated the news by holding a party yesterday.

A diverse group of approximately 25 people gathered at the Johnson County Library on Monday to participate in reference librarian Scott Vieira’s class, ♡❤Wikiwhatia? Wikipedia♡❤. 

Scott opened the session by sharing a disparaging quote from Robert McHenry (former editor-in-chief of &lt;a href="w%3AEncylopedia%20Britannica"&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/a&gt;) comparing &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; to a public restroom. He then shared a quote from Andrew Keen, author of The Cult of the Amateur, in which he stated Wikipedia is the blind leading the blind. Scott shared Wikipedia usage data from a 2007 Pew Internet study showing 36% of adults have consulted Wikipedia and that that Wikipedia receives 10,000-30,000 searches per second. Scott also pointed out that Wikipedia now has over two million articles in English alone (over nine million articles in 250 languages). So there is a discrepancy here, lots of critics and lots of use.

Scott then shared some historical information in order to provide a context for understanding Wikipedia. This included some important names and dates in the history of encyclopedias… including &lt;a href="w%3APliny%20the%20Elder"&gt;Pliny the Elder&lt;/a&gt; (23-79 C.E.) who published 37 Volumes of Natural History, and &lt;a href="w%3AJoachim%20Sterck%20van%20Ringelbergh"&gt;Joachim Sterck van Ringelbergh&lt;/a&gt; (c. 1499-1556) who first used the term encyclopedia, and then &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20le%20Rond%20d%27Alembert"&gt;d’Alembert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADenis%20Diderot"&gt;Diderot&lt;/a&gt; who published 17 volumes of their &lt;a href="w%3AEncyclop%C3%A9die"&gt;French Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt; from 1751-1765. Encyclopedia Britannica was first published in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in serial format 1768-1771.

<h4>Why history matters -- copyright and piracy, censorship, authority, organization, and content are all issues that are relevant.</h4>

Scott also discussed more recent history, sharing a photo of &lt;a href="w%3AWard%20Cunningham"&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; –who is credited with being the inventor of wiki software. Wikipedia was founded on Jan 15, 2001 by &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Sanger"&gt;Larry Sanger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;. Sanger left Wikipedia in 2002 and founded Citizendium in 2007 a complementary project which now has 4500 articles.

After the historical perspective, the class moved into using Wikipedia. Everyone in the audience had used Wikipedia. The class explored the content of Wikipedia, realising there is a whole lot going on. Scott demonstrated that the article about "frogs" for example, is semi-protected. The "history of science" article was examined, including the history of changes. Discussion covered how people contribute, who contributes and edits. The group also talked about Wikipedia bots, which aid in routine tasks in a semi-automated or automated fashion. 

A discussion about teachers, school media specialists and students regarding their use of Wikipedia ensued. Some teachers and school media specialists are negative about Wikipedia, but Scott's hope is that they will use it to start a discussion about the need to evaluate and critically think about information (even when it's from more traditionally reviewed and edited sources).

An unanswered question from an audience member was, "What was the first Wikipedia article?"

Discussion topics from Scott to audience were as follows: 
<ul>
BULLET::::- Do you think Wikipedia is less accurate than published resources and how important is that accuracy to you?
BULLET::::- How do we determine authority on a subject? How important is it that an article be written by an expert? How is Wikipedia changing our idea of what an authority is?
BULLET::::- Currency – the ability to publish immediately – what are the advantages and what are the disadvantages?
BULLET::::- What do we think about the content selection in Wikipedia?
BULLET::::- Should Wikipedia be used by librarians?
BULLET::::- What do you think about the future of Wikipedia?

</ul>

The opening performance of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20National%20Opera%20House%20%28Oslo%29"&gt;new Opera House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is postponed due to security concerns. The late delivery of a critical stage control system means that the opera "Around the World in 80 Days", composed by Gisle Kverndokk, has to be rescheduled for next season.

Opera chief Bjørn Simensen announced the postponement on Monday, describing it as "dramatic." The performance that will replace "Around the World in 80 Days" is not yet announced. 

The opening gala performance of the new Opera House on April 12th will proceed as planned.

&lt;a href="w%3AProgress%20spacecraft"&gt;Progress spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; M-63, serial number 363, also designated Progress 28P, has been launched by the &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Federal%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Federal Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; on a mission to resupply the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. Liftoff, atop a &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz-U"&gt;Soyuz-U&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acarrier%20rocket"&gt;carrier rocket&lt;/a&gt; occurred at 13:02 GMT, from Area 1/5 at the &lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;.

The spacecraft will dock with the space station on Thursday, a few hours ahead of the scheduled launch of &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;Space Shuttle ♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20module"&gt;Columbus module&lt;/a&gt;, a new laboratory which will enhance the outpost's research capabilities.

The ♡❤Progress♡❤ spacecraft is used to deliver supplies and experiments to the station. Typically four or five are launched each year, with the two most recently launched remaining on station, the oldest being undocked and &lt;a href="w%3Ade-orbit"&gt;de-orbit&lt;/a&gt;ed shortly before the arrival of a new one. However in this case, owing to the imminent Space Shuttle launch, there is currently no Progress spacecraft at the ISS, following the undocking of Progress M-62 yesterday.

♡❤Progress♡❤ spacecraft, which are loose analogues of the &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20spacecraft"&gt;Soyuz spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;, have been used as resupply craft in space station programmes since &lt;a href="w%3ASalyut%206"&gt;Salyut 6&lt;/a&gt;. Progress M-63 is the 28th Progress spacecraft to fly as part of the ISS programme.

This is the fourth orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the second for Russia.

<h3>Chinese Olympic committee says internet censorship may be reduced for the Olympic Games</h3>

The Organizing Committee of the Beijing Olympic Games has stated that the amount of internet censorship in China may be reduced in China for the 2008 Olympic Games , which are due to take place in Beijing. They say that this is to allow foreign journalists access to most pages on the internet. According to Wang Hui, the director of Public Relations for the committee, says that the possibility of reducing censorship is being looked into.

China has 210 million users on the network, and has said it will overtake the United States as the country with the highest number of users, despite the blocking of thousands of sites, including Wikinews and other Wikimedia projects, by the Chinese government.

"&lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Tuesday"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;", today, is a critical day in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; presidential campaign when more than 20 states hold party nominating contests. The latest polls contain good news for Democrat &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and Republican &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;. 
Senator &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; will do battle in 22 Democratic contests around the country, including states with large numbers of delegates like &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;.

The latest national public opinion polls show Obama gaining on Clinton and the race nearly even, but Clinton continues to hold narrow leads over Obama in most of the larger states voting on Tuesday.

Both candidates are relying on a last minute barrage of television ads and quick campaign visits to key states to urge their supporters to vote Tuesday.

Obama cast himself as the agent of change at a rally in &lt;a href="w%3ADelaware"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;. "I can offer a clear and clean break from the failed policies of &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;," he said. "I will not have to explain my votes in the past."

Clinton urged voters to consider her experience during a campaign stop in Missouri. "My opponent has not had to go through that kind of baptism by fire," she said. "Let us not kid ourselves here. This is going to be open season once again, and we need to nominate somebody with the experience and fortitude and know-how to take whatever they send our way and send it right back."

More than 1,600 Democratic delegates are at stake Tuesday, 2,025 delegates are required to win the Democratic nomination. In the Republican race, 21 states are holding nominating contests Tuesday.

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; is looking to build on the momentum generated by his wins in the two most recent primaries in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.

McCain campaigned Monday in &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and sought to appeal to both Republicans and independent voters. "As President of the United States, I will preserve my proud, conservative Republican credentials, but I will reach across the aisle to the Democrats and work together for the good of this country," he said. "That is what you want us to do, is work for the good of this country."

McCain is trying to fend off a challenge from former Massachusetts governor &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;. Romney contends McCain is not conservative enough to be the Republican Party's presidential nominee. "There is that old saying that if there is a race between a Republican acting like a Democrat and a Democrat, the Democrat always wins," he said.

Former Arkansas governor &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; hopes to do well in some of the southern primaries, while &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; Congressman &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; is looking for a strong showing in &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;.

More than 1,000 Republican delegates are at stake on Tuesday. A total of 1,191 delegates are required to win the Republican nomination. Most political experts predict that the Democratic contest will go on well after the Super Tuesday results.

The Democrats use a method of proportional representation to award delegates from the primaries and caucuses, while Republicans generally follow the rule of winner-takes-all.

"The number of [Democratic] delegates is large, but they are going to be split in a certain way, so that we will have to go on," said &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Fortier"&gt;John Fortier&lt;/a&gt;, who monitors the election campaign at the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Enterprise%20Institute"&gt;American Enterprise Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Washington and was a guest on &lt;a href="w%3AVOA"&gt;VOA&lt;/a&gt;'s Encounter program. "But it could be that we could have a clear frontrunner, and I think that is more likely on the Republican side these days. John McCain, I think, has the ability or the prospect of really establishing himself as the clear frontrunner on Super Tuesday."

Looking ahead to the next major contests on the campaign calendar, &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; vote on February 12 while &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; hold primaries March 4.

Television producer and owner of the anti-&lt;a href="w%3AScientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; website www.xenutv.com (XenuTV), &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Bunker"&gt;Mark Bunker&lt;/a&gt;, also known as ♡❤Wise Beard Man♡❤, chatted online with ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ for nearly three hours. More than 120 people followed the interview live (many from &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Chanology"&gt;Project Chanology&lt;/a&gt;), which makes this exclusive ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ interview our most attended &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Relay%20Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; interview to date.

Bunker started XenuTV in 1999 and began to make videos that he provided for the &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20McPherson%20Trust"&gt;Lisa McPherson Trust&lt;/a&gt;. Bunker has been a critic of the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; since 1997.

In 2006, he won a &lt;a href="w%3AEmmy%20Award%23Regional_Emmys"&gt;Regional Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt; after he and &lt;a href="w%3AKUSI-TV"&gt;KUSI-TV&lt;/a&gt; news reporter Lena Lewis produced a documentary news video on the issues with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; border with &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>The Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Why don't you start by telling us about yourself and what you do.

♡❤♡Tell us about your history with criticism of Scientology?

♡❤♡Such as?

♡❤♡Has the Church ever been convicted of any crimes?

♡❤♡How would you describe yourself in the context of religions, churches, and belief systems, and what you are seeking to accomplish?

♡❤♡There are other religions that practice things that are just as bad as Scientology. For example the Catholic Church, Scientology and Islam dislike/sin homosexuals. Why protest Scientology? The Catholic Church, in terms of atrocities, has likely committed more? Even Muslim extremism... Is Scientology really worth more to protest than those religions or any other?

♡❤♡That was protest the crime and cover-up? Similar to your work?

♡❤♡Other than your experiences with ex-members of Scientology, do you have any special qualification that would make you an expert on so-called "cults", i.e. do you have a degree in sociology, anthropology, psychiatry, psychology, theology, or any similar related subject area?

♡❤♡Would that include the fields of tax law, i.e. do you have a degree in accounting, finance, law, or any similar related subject area?

♡❤♡Scientology, as many members have claimed, has saved their lives. Do you think, comparing the circumstances, the good things Scientology has done, outweighs the supposed bad things it has done?

♡❤♡What will it take to get Congressional Hearings to review the Church of Scientology? Specifically, their tax-exempt status.

♡❤♡What, if any, changes or improvements have been made in Church policy and structure since Hubbard died, and more recently too, that might have already addressed, at least partially, issues such as Snow White, &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20McPherson"&gt;Lisa McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, disconnection, unrealistic promises of Scientology benefits, etc? On what do you base your answer to this question?

♡❤♡I assume you mean "Lisa Clause"?

♡❤♡How do you think most Church members feel about your protests? What would you say to those who would criticize your protests as misguided or the information you post and expose as untrue?

♡❤♡We have a somewhat difficult question to put next...Is R2-45 Auditing a joke within Scientology, or is it actually real?

♡❤♡Do they actually run camps associated with that?

♡❤♡What is the next step we should take in raising the general public's awareness of the atrocities of the "Church" of Scientology. Also, besides www.xenutv.com, what are some other, reputable, citable sources of information on these abuses?

♡❤♡Why does Scientology accuse people of crimes when they are asked questions?

♡❤♡Why do you think Scientology dangerous? From a European (French) point of view there are many strange organizations in the United States (Nazi party, many religious groups). Why is Scientology your fight?

♡❤♡And that's part of the reasons you support 'Anonymous' and — apart from DDoS — their actions?

♡❤♡I've seen your response to their protest on YouTube. You almost seemed proud that a younger generation had "taken up the torch".

♡❤♡What happened to Bob Minton? He is alleged to be in favor of Scientology now. Did they give him an 'incentive' to stop his protests of the Church? In a video of yours, posted on YouTube (Scientology: Clearwater Trip - Day 3 - Pt 2), Minton says that the Church attempted to "pay him money" several times. Did they finally succeed? Or was he blackmailed into shutting up?

♡❤♡How many members of Scientology do you estimate are within the organization?

♡❤♡What is your opinion on &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Zone%20%28Scientology%29"&gt;Free Zone Scientologists&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡What do you think Anonymous should do if Scientologists plant fake anons in a protest and act like idiots to show anons up?

♡❤♡Are you going to upload the old XenuTV movies (RealVideo) to Google Video or something similar?

<h3>Questions from IRC users</h3>

♡❤♡As you know now, the Anonymous Protests was extremely huge, but we are planning a second round the 15th of March. And I — a 12-year-old WILL attend, is that a good sign that so young a person wants to be involved, or is it a bad sign?

♡❤♡Can you put any of this in a historical context? Have you studied the history of Scientology in relation to its "parent" organizations (cults praying on the elite) in the 18th - 20th centuries ? (Many of L. Ron Hubbard's ideas were taken directly from OTO which he was a member of in his early life for example).

♡❤♡By sheer virtue of numbers, we have become very hard to harass, to the point of the personal risk to ourselves being almost negligible. There have been others before us with far more courage who have spoken up against far greater odds. What do you think the effect of our actions have been on these "pioneers"? (yourself included) Do you personally feel that we anons have revitalized the more "serious" efforts of those in the past who have come out with full names - and have probably gotten into problems over this? And do you believe it serves to ease the process for those Scientologists who were already considering leaving?

♡❤♡I was just wondering if you were aware of the many other abuses of other religions such as The Watchtower organization of Jehovah's Witnesses.. They do things strikingly similar to Scientology with regards to killing and abusing members and disconnection policies - now, I'm in no way in favor of the management of Scientology but it does look a little blind to me when these other so-called religions get off scot-free. Have you heard of any such allegations before? My concern is that while a step forward is good against one religion, there are others out there just biding by without no real exposure essentially letting them get away with their abuses. I was also wondering if you knew if The Profit would ever be released for viewing?

♡❤♡What do you say to those people that say that Anonymous and the similar groups are religious bigots?

♡❤♡Isn't it strange that some countries are recognizing Scientology as an official religion while other countries pursue the Church? What would you say to lawmakers in the former country? Perhaps a short three things you need to know about the Church?

♡❤♡What do you think of the fact that Anonymous' motivations are not a moral outrage and are in fact based on the desire to destroy something and get laughs, aka lulz? What about the fact that Anonymous regularly uses illegal activity for its purposes (though we have suspended most in this raid) and is often risque and perverted in nature? 

♡❤♡How do you feel about the several nicknames given to you, like ♡❤Wise Beard Man♡❤ (WBM), and the several slogans accompanying it? And, by the way, what music do you like?

♡❤♡There was a bomb (hoax?) threat video on YouTube by an "elite anonymous" as he himself called himself. What would be the implications of such an attack? Could this be another plant by Scientology, and could they actually go through with it?

♡❤♡So you would urge Anonymous to report any such threats to the authorities?

♡❤♡Anything you would like to add Mr. Bunker?

<h1>David S. Touretzky discusses Scientology, Anonymous and Tom Cruise</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=David%20S.%20Touretzky%20discusses%20Scientology%2C%20Anonymous%20and%20Tom%20Cruise&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Touretzky, a research professor in artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience at &lt;a href="w%3ACarnegie%20Mellon%20University"&gt;Carnegie Mellon University&lt;/a&gt;, has been a prominent critic of the Church of Scientology since mid-1995, and has been protesting against Scientology vociferously since then; he has also run websites that publish material that Scientology wishes to keep suppressed from the public eye, such as extracts from Scientology's formerly-confidential ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOperating%20Thetan"&gt;Operating Thetan&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (OT) materials. Touretzky views the actions of the Church of Scientology as being "a threat to free speech", and has endured harassment by the Church of Scientology for his activities. 

The Church of Scientology continues to suffer damage to its public reputation through increased exposure on the Internet and vocal protests by Scientology critics such as Prof. Touretzky. A recent event that focused intense attention on Scientology's totalitarian attitude was the leak of an internal Church of Scientology propaganda video to the Internet video sharing site &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;♡❤YouTube♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, in which celebrity Scientologist &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; spoke heavily in Scientology's jargon and stated that that "we [Scientology] are the authorities" on resolving the difficulties of humanity. The declaration of war by ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ followed shortly after this leak, in the form of a video posted to the Internet. 

The ongoing dispute, cast by some as ♡❤Scientology versus the Internet♡❤, brought Scientology terms such as "SP" (♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASuppressive%20Person"&gt;Suppressive Person&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, an enemy of Scientology) and "KSW" (♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AKeeping%20Scientology%20Working"&gt;Keeping Scientology Working&lt;/a&gt;♡❤) into general usage by non-Scientologists from the late 1990s onwards; increased attention has been drawn to Scientology by the release of the Cruise video in addition to media coverage. This focus has caused an even greater propagation of these terms across the outside world, as Touretzky comments in the interview.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ asked Prof. Touretzky about the impact that the activities of ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ will have on Scientology, the public relations effect of the Tom Cruise video, the recent departure of individuals from the Church of Scientology's executive management, the strategies that ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ will employ and Touretzky's experiences of picketing the Church.

Voters went to the polls and to caucuses in 24 states Tuesday, providing both Democratic presidential candidates, New York Senator &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and Illinois Senator &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, with significant wins. On the Republican side, Arizona Senator &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; surged ahead of his main rival, former Massachusetts Governor &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Tuesday"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's early results showed big wins for Hillary Clinton in some very delegate-rich states, including the state she represents, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, where she lived when her husband, former President &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, was governor. But she also won the state of Massachusetts, in spite of the fact that Massachusetts Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Kennedy"&gt;Edward Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had endorsed Obama. Clinton also scored victories in &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.

Barack Obama won his home state of &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28US%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Delaware"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="North%20Dakota"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. Although Clinton won in the states with the largest delegate counts, Obama will still garner a large number of those delegates because the Democrats award them by proportion of the vote for each candidate.

The biggest Super Tuesday prize, California had Clinton winning on the Democrat side and McCain winning the Republicans.

On the Republican side, it was a good day for John McCain, who won seven states in the early hours of vote counting. Mitt Romney, so far, has won his home state of &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="North%20Dakota"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; and Utah. Former Arkansas Governor &lt;a href="Mike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; won his home state as well as &lt;a href="West%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28US%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. Both Huckabee and Romney say they will stay in the race, but analysts say the big wins by McCain have given him the momentum and the delegate lead that could help him clinch his party's nomination fairly soon.

In both parties, Super Tuesday was a watershed in that it ended the phase of the campaign when candidates could win a state or two in hopes of building the perception of momentum. From now on it will be a flat-out contest for delegates.

The next contests will be this coming Saturday when &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; holds its Presidential primary, Kansas Republicans hold caucuses and Democrats hold caucuses in both &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; and the state of &lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;. The process of selecting candidates for each party will culminate in the national conventions. The Democrats will meet in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADenver"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the end of August and the Republicans will meet during the first week of September in Minneapolis.

The director of the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that his agency used the extreme interrogation technique known as &lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt; on three terrorism suspects nearly five years ago. In testimony to the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Intelligence%20Committee"&gt;Senate Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hayden"&gt;Michael Hayden&lt;/a&gt; urged lawmakers not to place restrictions on the interrogation methods available to U.S. intelligence agencies.

Director Hayden's testimony was the most detailed description to date of the CIA's use of "enhanced" interrogation techniques.

"In the life of the CIA detention program, we have held fewer than 100 people," he said. "Fewer than a third of those people have had any techniques, enhanced techniques, used against them in the CIA program."

He confirmed that among those "enhanced" techniques used was waterboarding - which induces the feeling of imminent drowning, and which critics say amounts to torture.

"Waterboarding has been used on only three detainees," he said.

He said those three detainees are &lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed"&gt;Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; - one of the architects of the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011th%20attacks"&gt;September 11th attacks&lt;/a&gt; on New York and Washington, &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Zubaydah"&gt;Abu Zubaydah&lt;/a&gt; - who is believed to have been a top &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaida"&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt; strategist, and &lt;a href="w%3AAbd%20al-Rahim%20al-Nashiri"&gt;Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri&lt;/a&gt; - who is believed to have played a key role in the bombing of the USS Cole. All three are being held at the U.S. detention facility at &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%2C%20Cuba"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;.

Hayden said waterboarding was used against the three detainees nearly five years ago because of circumstances at the time, including the belief that additional attacks against the United States were imminent.

Hayden defended the CIA's use of extreme interrogation techniques as lawful, and urged lawmakers not to impose restrictions on such methods.

Congress is considering legislation that would restrict the CIA to using only the interrogation techniques authorized by the U.S. Army's field manual, which does not include waterboarding.

In appearances before Congress on Wednesday, Defense Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt; and a top military official are expected to underscore decreased violence in Iraq. But they are likely to face strong questioning from lawmakers about ongoing war costs.

When President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s budget for the 2009 fiscal year was sent to Congress this week, Secretary Gates defended the $515 billion request from the Pentagon.

In the overall figure, he noted, are billions of dollars to support U.S. military operations in &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20in%20Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20in%20Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and the administration's global &lt;a href="w%3Awar%20on%20terrorism"&gt;war on terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. "A $70 billion emergency bridge fund that would cover war costs into the next calendar year," he said.

The story behind that figure is the ongoing struggle between President Bush and the Democratic-controlled &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; over war funding.

Last year, the president asked for about $190 billion in a supplemental request outside the regular defense budget for war costs in the current 2008 fiscal year. The amount approved by Congress, just over $86 billion, left a large gap.

When Gates and military &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Chairman"&gt;Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman&lt;/a&gt; Admiral &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Mullen"&gt;Michael Mullen&lt;/a&gt; appear before the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; armed services committees, they will be pressed for harder cost projections, as Congress continues to assess the impact for the U.S. economy of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.

White House Budget Director &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Nussle"&gt;Jim Nussle&lt;/a&gt; was asked this week if the Bush administration has a realistic hope it can obtain its Pentagon regular budget and supplemental war funding requests from an opposition Congress. "It's worth whatever we need to spend and we have made, I think, a very careful determination of what that is. So, I don't believe it is just a negotiation point. I think it is what it takes for us to be safe, and to be the kind of super power that can maintain that safety," he said.

Asked why budget figures do not appear to reflect a reduction in costs because of the eventual withdrawal of about 30,000 troops from Iraq to pre-military surge levels, expected to be complete later this year, Nussle would only refer reporters to the Pentagon.

And while the question of troop levels will be a key topic for lawmakers, in the context of questioning on the overall Pentagon budget, Gates may not provide much in the way of enlightenment.

Media reports quoting testimony prepared for the House and Senate hearings say he will point to what he calls significant variables weighing against making any realistic estimate of how much Congress may be asked for in the final year of the Bush administration.

Based on numerous supplemental requests for Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years, members of Congress expect the $70 billion bridge fund to be followed by additional requests to sustain U.S. forces.

As for the $100 billion or so in 2008 supplemental funds that has been held up by bickering between Capitol Hill and the White House, congressional Democrats are looking to testimony in April from the U.S. commander in Iraq, General &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Petraeus"&gt;David Petraeus&lt;/a&gt;.

That will provide Congress with an update on progress by Iraqi forces toward shouldering more of the security burden, what that means for U.S. troop numbers, and what Americans can expect to be paying as President Bush leaves office and a new administration takes over in 2009.

Tornadoes have been reported across the southern &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, with some sources saying as many as 48 have died. The &lt;a href="w%3ANOAA"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; have reported that several buildings have been damaged in the tornadoes, including a hospital in &lt;a href="Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;. 
At least 69 tornadoes have been reported to have taken place in the last two days, most of which took place on the same day as US citizens were voting in caucuses and primaries on a day known as super Tuesday.

<h3>&lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

The launch director of Atlantis said that “the scope of the mission is first of course to bring the Columbus laboratory to space, to install it on the international space station, make all the connections, and of course activate the module, power it and bring the cooling and do all the activation."

The ESA Program manager for the International Space Station said that he thought the “the European team are looking forward to the launch on Thursday." Leroy Cain, the American manager of the mission said that he believed "the team is in great shape and we're ready to move forward," 

NASA said that “the five mission specialists for the flight are also spending full days with checklists and practicing their flight tasks.” He also said that the astronauts “have simulators at their disposal that let them rehearse the complex duties required in orbit.” The flight is due to be launched at 19:45 UTC (14:45 local time) tomorrow.

Hill wrote an open letter addressed to Karin Pouw, Public Affairs Director of the Church of Scientology International, in response to a 15-page statement issued by Pouw on January 14 which was highly critical of &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Morton"&gt;Andrew Morton&lt;/a&gt;'s new book on prominent Scientologist &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise%3A%20An%20Unauthorized%20Biography"&gt;Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Hill's letter was posted to the Internet newsgroup &lt;a href="w%3Aalt.religion.scientology"&gt;alt.religion.scientology&lt;/a&gt; on January 25, and has since been widely posted on other Internet message boards. 
In Pouw's statement on Morton's book, she called it a "bigoted defamatory assault replete with lies". In her letter to Pouw, Hill responded "I am absolutely shocked at how vehemently you insist upon not only denying the truths that have been stated about the church in that biography, but then take it a step further and tell outright lies." Specifically, Hill rebuked the Church of Scientology's denial of a practice called "&lt;a href="w%3ADisconnection"&gt;disconnection&lt;/a&gt;", where members are instructed to sever all ties with friends and family who are critical of Scientology and deemed a "&lt;a href="w%3ASuppressive%20Person"&gt;Suppressive Person&lt;/a&gt;", or SP.

Hill wrote that it was this particular policy which broke up her family when she was 16, going on to detail how the Church of Scientology restricted her communications with her parents: "Not only was I not allowed to speak to them, I was not allowed to answer a phone for well over a year, in case it was them calling me."
When contacted for a comment on Hill's letter, Karin Pouw told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;♡❤: "The church stands by its statement of 14 January. The church does not respond to newsgroup postings." Hill explained her motivation for writing the letter to the ♡❤Agence France-Presse♡❤: "My intention is to put it on a public forum so they are pressured into changing their ways -- even if it is just to cover for themselves."

In a broadcast of the television program ♡❤Inside Edition♡❤ which aired Tuesday, Hill spoke with reporter Les Trent about Scientology's disconnection policy. Hill described a pregnant friend whose parents are still members of the Church of Scientology; but will not speak with her: "She lives in L.A. - her parents live right around the hill from her, you know she tried to call them when she was having her first child, and they were like: 'No, sorry, I can't speak to you.'" The Church of Scientology told ♡❤Inside Edition♡❤ that the allegation made by Hill is "the opposite of what the church believes and practices." Hill last spoke to her uncle David Miscavige four years ago, around the same time that she viewed a promotional video featuring Tom Cruise, at an awards ceremony. This video was recently leaked to the Internet and appeared on the video sharing site &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube took the video down due to a legal complaint from the Church of Scientology, but though the website &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt; received a similar legal complaint, Gawker has stated that the video is newsworthy and will not be removed.
Prominent &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;free speech&lt;/a&gt; activist and critic of Scientology &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20S.%20Touretzky"&gt;David S. Touretzky&lt;/a&gt; commented on these recent developments, in an interview Wednesday with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ reporter : "She has nothing to do with Chanology [the recent anti-Scientology movement that has gathered on Internet message boards], but what we're seeing here is a "perfect storm" of entheta [material considered negative by Scientology]. It's all coming together in a chain reaction: The Tom Cruise video, Andrew Morton's bio, Kirstie Alley's craziness, Kimora Lee Simmons, Jenna Miscavige, and there's more to come!" Another critic of Scientology, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Bunker"&gt;Mark Bunker&lt;/a&gt; of the website XenuTV.com, compared the recent revelations to troubles in Scientology founder &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;'s family: "Just as L. Ron Hubbard’s family was rocked with turmoil, so it seems is Miscavige’s." Bunker commented on the ♡❤Inside Edition♡❤ piece: "This is a jaw-dropping TV segment — although Inside Edition clearly didn’t understand just how important a story they had."

In an interview published Wednesday in the ♡❤New York Post♡❤, Hill stated that she has been harassed by the Church of Scientology for speaking out against the organization: "The church has contacted several of my friends, telling them that I am smearing the church and I am going to be declared a suppressive person and asking my friends if they would disconnect from me and, in at least one case, insisting that they do." The ♡❤New York Post♡❤ attempted to contact Karin Pouw for a comment, but she did not respond in time for their publication.

<h1>1960's guru icon Maharishi Mahesh Yogi dies</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=1960%27s%20guru%20icon%20Maharishi%20Mahesh%20Yogi%20dies&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aguru"&gt;guru&lt;/a&gt; who taught some of the 20th century's most famous celebrities and created a multi-billion dollar spiritual empire has died. &lt;a href="w%3AMaharishi%20Mahesh%20Yogi"&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href="w%3ATranscendental%20Meditation"&gt;Transcendental Meditation&lt;/a&gt; movement, died at his home in &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Netherlands"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. He is believed to have been 91 years old.

Known for his long white beard and tendency to giggle, he became a well-known counter-culture figure in the 1960's. Members of the Beatles rock music band made repeated pilgrimages to the Himalayan foothills to study his meditation technique, known as TM.

Little is certain about the yogi's early life in central India. His given name and birthday are disputed. It is known he studied physics at &lt;a href="w%3AAllahabad%20University"&gt;Allahabad University&lt;/a&gt;.

A professor of psychology at the school, Emmanuel Ghosh, says the guru's academic training, combined with study under a Vedic swami, helped to make him accessible to those in the West seeking alternative answers to life's questions during the socially tumultuous 1960's.

"He had a rational approach," said Ghosh. "He had a scientific background and he could tell the West that 'You could test my theories through science.' He was the first one who started this whole system of reducing stress by breath control, by meditation and you could measure it in objective terms."

Maharishi also tutored other &lt;a href="w%3Apop%20musicians"&gt;pop musicians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; actors and film directors. His TM movement attracted millions of followers worldwide who paid hundreds of dollars to receive a personal mantra to recite for 20 minutes, twice a day.

Professor Ghosh at Allahabad University says, despite his fame and success overseas, Maharishi was just one among many gurus in his native India.

"His influence in India has been negligible. Every guru is independent to propagate his own method of salvation or nirvana," said Ghosh. "So he took off for a while [in India] as long as he was appreciated in the West."

Perhaps his biggest legacy in India is the country's largest chain of privately owned schools. Other institutes and universities based on his teachings also exist in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

In later years, some of the guru's projects and beliefs earned him ridicule, such as hoping to raise $10 trillion to achieve world peace and banish poverty and encouraging followers to learn what he called "yogic flying". While many adherents praise Maharishi for propagating a scientifically verifiable ancient method to help them deal with the stress of modern life, some disenchanted followers considered TM a quasi-religious cult more interested in raising funds than spirits.

A firm in &lt;a href="w%3AOxford"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has recently released plans for a &lt;a href="w%3Ahypersonic"&gt;hypersonic&lt;/a&gt; passenger airplane able to travel at speeds up to &lt;a href="w%3AMach%20number"&gt;Mach&lt;/a&gt; 5 with a range of 20,000 km. &lt;a href="w%3AReaction%20Engines%20Limited"&gt;Reaction Engines&lt;/a&gt; of Oxfordshire says the &lt;a href="w%3AReaction%20Engines%20A2"&gt;A2&lt;/a&gt; plane could be in service within 25 years, carrying 300 passengers at a top speed of almost 4,000 mph, which is twice the speed of the &lt;a href="w%3AConcorde"&gt;Concorde&lt;/a&gt;. It would be able to reach &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels%20Airport"&gt;Brussels Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; non-stop in just five hours.

It is 143 meters (469 feet) long, which is approximately twice the length of the &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;Airbus A380&lt;/a&gt; and would be the first man-made object to cruise for extended periods at such speeds within the Earth's &lt;a href="w%3Aatmosphere"&gt;atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;. Man-made aircraft have travelled this fast before; they, however, were inefficient rocket powered aircraft, that were only capable of short range.

The cost of a trip on the A2 is expected to be comparable with current first class tickets on standard flights, of around &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;6,900 (&lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;3,500), although it is possible prices will drop in the future.

"The A2 is designed to leave Brussels international airport, fly quietly and subsonically out into the north Atlantic at Mach 0.9 before reaching Mach 5 across the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Pole"&gt;North Pole&lt;/a&gt; and heading over the Pacific to Australia," said &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Bond%20%28rocket%20developer%29"&gt;Alan Bond&lt;/a&gt;, the head of Reaction Engines.

Due to the heat generated in high-speed flight, the plane would have no windows. Instead, television screens connected to video cameras on the outside of the plane will be placed in front of passenger seats.

The jet may be more environmentally friendly than other planes because it uses &lt;a href="w%3Aliquid%20hydrogen"&gt;liquid hydrogen&lt;/a&gt; for power rather than fossil fuel, and thus would not necessarily produce any pollution during the flight. The energy to produce the liquid hydrogen could come from an environmentally friendly source.

"Our work shows that it is possible technically; now it's up to the world to decide if it wants it," Bond said.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; Tech Briefs INSIDER newsletter 02/05/08 reports that the winner of the $20,000 first prize in the agency's "Create the Future" contest is an invention called "Litroenergy", the luminous output of micro particle "Litrospheres." Their self-luminance reportedly endures for over 12 years. The spheres are inexpensive, making them useful in many ways. The emitted light is said to be equivalent to a 40 watt bulb, sufficient for reading.

The invention is reported to safely encapsulate a small quantity of electron-emitting &lt;a href="w%3Atritium"&gt;tritium&lt;/a&gt; with light emitting &lt;a href="w%3Aphosphors"&gt;phosphors&lt;/a&gt; inside a robust microscopic sphere. Mixed into paints, plastic films or adhesive tape the spheres can be applied to surfaces for under a dollar per square foot. The maker suggests they will find first use in safety applications such as exit signage and aircraft corridor marking.

Since winning the reality television series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%27s%20Next%20Top%20Model"&gt;America's Next Top Model&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in December 2006, &lt;a href="w%3ACariDee%20English"&gt;CariDee English&lt;/a&gt;, a small-town girl from &lt;a href="w%3AFargo%2C%20North%20Dakota"&gt;Fargo, North Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, was plucked from relative obscurity to be the new look for &lt;a href="w%3ACoverGirl"&gt;CoverGirl&lt;/a&gt; Cosmetics, the newest fresh face on the cover of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASeventeen%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Seventeen&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and affiliated with the largest modeling agency in the world, &lt;a href="w%3AElite%20Model%20Management"&gt;Elite Model Management&lt;/a&gt;. 

However, she feels her greatest accomplishment is being the spokeswoman for the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Psoriasis%20Foundation"&gt;National Psoriasis Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, in which she is a motivational speaker and gives encouragement to psoriasis sufferers. CariDee has even lobbied in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; for the passage of a bill which would ask the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Institute of Medicine to increase spending on finding a cure for psoriasis. You can read more about her role with the National Psoriasis Foundation &lt;a href="http%3A//www.psoriasis.org/caridee/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ reporter sat down and talked with CariDee earlier in the week to discuss her own issues with psoriasis, how she has helped other sufferers in her role as spokeswoman for the Foundation, as well as what it's like to be a new model in New York City and her thoughts on how the fashion industry operates today.

This is the second in a series of articles with ♡❤America's Next Top Model♡❤ contestants. Articles will be published sporadically.

<h2>Intro and her Super Bowl pick</h2>
♡❤♡Mike Halterman:♡❤♡ Hi! How are you doing today?

♡❤♡CariDee English:♡❤♡ Fine! Doing good.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ So I heard you went to the Super Bowl last Sunday.

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ Oh, no, I didn't get to go! I've been in New York for Fashion Week. Did someone tell you I went?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Yeah, Jose [her manager at Elite Model Management] told me you had. Well, did you have a team to root for, anyway?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ Of course! I was going for New York! This was the first time that a team won in the state I was living in! I'm from North Dakota, and we don't have any professional teams, so it was pretty cool.

<h2>From North Dakota to the big city</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ I'd imagine it's a big change moving from small-town North Dakota to New York City. What do you remember thinking in your first weeks in New York City?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ I don't know...it was kind of overwhelming! I remember being overwhelmed. There were trash and pigeons everywhere...and an endless amount of walking! But you know, I just love how big it is and how there are just...endless dreams. You have the opportunity to accomplish so much here.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Did you miss home or ever think about just moving back to North Dakota?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ No, I could never move back to North Dakota. What would I do?

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Well, you were a fashion photographer, you could have went back there for some work...although I don't know how much you'd be in demand there.

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ Yeah, it wasn't even an option! Not a thought.

<h2>On representing the National Psoriasis Foundation</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ So you're currently a spokeswoman for the National Psoriasis Foundation. What have you found, in your interactions with others who have had the disease, are their reactions once the disease manifests itself?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ I think a lot of people try to hide away from it, and I want people to be comfortable in their own skin, no pun intended. I just want people to be comfortable with themselves, because I know I hid under clothes for years.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ In your experience as ambassador, what story touched you the most?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ It really makes me upset because there are a lot of great medications out there and the government won't fund payments for patients. There was a 9-year-old boy who was on a great medicine and then his insurance dropped him from it. It came back and it's now covered 95% of his body. You know, it's just heartbreaking to be able to be treated for it and then not be able to afford it.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Were your reactions to psoriasis and discovering you had it comparable with those of other people?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ No, because I understood what it was when I had it. Other people may be scared of it when they discover they have it, because they might not know what it is.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Did relating with others with the condition give you a personal boost?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ Oh, yeah, absolutely. Seeing a little boy, healing and still living life, that's an inspiration to me. We're all just trying to be here for each other. No one person is above anyone else, we're just trying to support each other and find a cure together.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ As an ambassador for psoriasis awareness, you've become a role model of sorts to young girls and women who are afflicted with the disease. What kind of advice have you given to people coping with the disease?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ "I have psoriasis, I don't let psoriasis have me." Don't live your life through your disease.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Do you think that having had obstacles like your psoriasis and depression have helped you enter the industry more grounded than other girls who may not have had such rough experiences?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ Yeah, I mean, I only know my own experiences, but I didn't take anything for granted. I was grateful for being able to start in such a difficult industry and having that background to be able to overcome things on my own.

<h2>On her former photography work</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ You've worked behind the camera before you stepped in front of it; has this helped you as a model?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ It's helped me to understand the relationship and connection you need to have between a model and photographer, and what the photographer wants out of the model, like what art they want to create, and the importance of it.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Would you like to step back behind the camera at some point?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ For fun, absolutely. I love doing that for fun, and...recreational, for sure. It'll always be a hobby of mine.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Experiencing both the photography side of the spectrum as well as being in front of the cameras, what do you deem extraordinary in terms of the aesthetic? What is beauty to you?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ Beauty is having confidence. If a woman is confident in front of the camera, and exudes that confidence, then there's no room for error. So, confidence, definitely.

<h2>♡❤Top Model♡❤ and her modeling career</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Obviously your experience on Top Model was very positive. However, has the experience impacted you negatively at all?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ I think the only negative thing about it is that fans seem to think that if you're not on the cover of all these magazines, that you're not getting work. Not everything is covered equally. It's a different age now that a lot of celebrities are on the covers of magazines, and people go "Oh, well, this show hasn't produced a Top Model!" We've been doing a lot of work in a lot of different things and I think people forget that.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ I've been following your career, and I've noticed you haven't been doing a lot of runway work as opposed to print modeling, which you've done a lot of. Do you have any fashion shows lined up in the near future?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ I've actually done a lot of runway work, but the thing is that the runway work never gets as much press as the print work does, so I've done a lot more shows than what people have seen on the Internet. It's difficult now too, because a lot of girls have to be ♡❤skinny♡❤ skinny now, and I think I have a good walk and a good spring/summer look, but you know, I'm a size 0. 0 or a 2. I went in to see a fashion designer for the winter designs and I knew I wouldn't be thin enough for this job, and I'm 125 pounds at 5'10". I'm a grown woman, I'm not prepubescent anymore, so if that means I'm not thin enough and that means I'll lose a job, then you know, I'll take that risk. I'm healthy.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ What is more fun to you, photoshoots or runway?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ I love photoshoots. Runway is great because you do quick hair, makeup, wardrobe, and you get a huge rush from that, but with photoshoots there's a sense of accomplishment, I can see what I've done and get totally "in my zone."

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ We know you as wacky and fun-loving on Top Model. Since you've come to New York, what's the wackiest thing you've done?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ It's a hard question! I can't think of any...every moment is wacky in New York! I think one good moment was when my brother and I went out to Times Square at maybe 2:30 in the morning. We went to this 24-hour Starbucks and drank all this coffee, and then we had an artist sketch our picture, and then we went on a buggy ride and we didn't end up getting back home until 5 in the morning. It was a lot of fun.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ How do you reconcile the demands of a potentially busy modeling day with the need to let loose and be free-spirited?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ I'd just jump off the Empire State Building with a parachute. [♡❤laughs♡❤] No, I like to go out with friends, go dancing, hit the clubs, but if I have a photoshoot the next day, I just want to stay in with my boyfriend.

<h2>Looking back and what's coming next</h2>

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ It's been over a year now since you won Top Model. Was 2007 all you hoped it would be?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ Yeah, and more! It was great. It was the best year so far.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ What one achievement was your favorite?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ Honestly, being the spokesperson for the National Psoriasis Foundation. Not just in the United States, either; I've been to Canada, all over Europe, I loved Switzerland, and then down to Argentina. I'm a global spokesperson for psoriasis, and that's fun to do.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ Anything coming up work-wise you want to share with us?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ Yep! I'm starting my own show with MTV, where I'll be the executive producer and host.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ What's it going to be about?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ I can't say anything yet! But it'll be very funny.

♡❤♡MH:♡❤♡ And finally, do you have any special words for all the Top Model fans out there?

♡❤♡CE:♡❤♡ Oh, Gosh, I have millions of words! [♡❤thinks about what to say♡❤] I feel like I'm accepting an award! I want to thank all of you for supporting me and I lean on you guys more than you realize.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is defending the use of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainterrogation"&gt;interrogation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; technique known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in certain, rare circumstances when suspects are believed to have knowledge of an imminent threat. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; now admits it used the technique roughly five years ago on three top terror suspects.

White House spokesman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Fratto"&gt;Tony Fratto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says President Bush personally authorized the disclosure - breaking with the long-standing practice in the administration of refusing comment on specific interrogation techniques.

He says the decision to have Central Intelligence Agency chief &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hayden"&gt;Michael Hayden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; go before a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20committee"&gt;Congressional committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and reveal the use of waterboarding in the past was difficult, because it could provide the enemy with information about the CIA's program for questioning terror suspects.

"This decision to allow General Hayden to talk about the technique wasn't taken lightly," Fratto said. "There was discussion of great concern about starting to talk about something we don't ordinarily do for reasons that we feel very strongly about."

Fratto says so much misinformation has been disseminated about the interrogation program, that the White House felt it was time to set the record straight.

Fratto says waterboarding - which simulates drowning - was approved in a few specific instances and with certain safeguards in place.

The CIA banned the practice in 2006. Fratto says interrogators might be able to use it again, but emphasized they would need authorization from the president to do so.

He noted that any CIA request to use the technique would have to be declared legal by the Justice Department before consideration at the White House. He says approval depends on the circumstances, adding one important factor would be the belief that an attack might be imminent.

"Any change to the enhanced interrogation technique that may be used will follow the process that I outlined which includes a legal review and notification of Congress," he said.

Critics have called waterboarding a form of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . But Fratto says its use in the past under the conditions approved by the attorney general and the president was legal.

On Capitol Hill, a senior Democrat - Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Durbin"&gt;Dick Durbin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Illinois - denounced the use of waterboarding under any circumstances. He noted that in its annual human rights report, the U.S. State Department is quick to condemn other nations that use harsh interrogation techniques on prisoners.

"So once a year we stand in judgment of the world, and condemn them for engaging in waterboarding and torture techniques on their prisoners," he said. "And yet it is clear from the testimony yesterday of General Hayden, that we have engaged in some of those own techniques."

The U.N.'s torture investigator also responded to the CIA disclosure, calling on the Bush administration to give up its defense of enhanced interrogation methods such as waterboarding. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManfred%20Nowak"&gt;Manfred Nowak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; in Geneva that these techniques are totally unacceptable under international law.

In &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, the government and opposition have resumed talks on the dispute over the elections that sparked a month-long wave of violence. Relief officials say the humanitarian toll continues to rise and are calling for a speedy solution. 

Relief officials appealed to political leaders to stabilize security throughout Kenya as the number of people fleeing violence in some parts of the country continued to rise.

A Kenya &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spokesman, Tony Mwangi, says the instability is aggravating the humanitarian crisis. 
"There are a lot of areas that require immediate assistance in the form of food as well as shelter for freshly displaced people and this is mostly in the western region of the country and a bit of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARift%20Valley"&gt;Rift Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ," Mwangi said.

Nearly 100 people have been killed in the violence in the past several days, mostly in western Kenya. The Red Cross says as a result the death toll has risen to about 1,000 and the number of homeless has grown to more than 300,000.

Mwangi said his organization has provided some assistance to most of the displaced in the country but not enough. He said security was an essential condition for the efficient distribution of aid.

"Our humanitarian response moves a lot faster when security is available. And while the Kenya Red Cross have access to some of the areas that have been affected the speed at which we would like to operate is not the best," Mwangi said.

Mwangi said the best solution is for the displaced to be able to return home where they can receive food rations while their homes and communities are rebuilt. The camps, which are prone to disease, criminality and social problems, are not a long-term solution.

The talks aimed at resolving the Kenyan crisis continued Wednesday. They focused on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKenyan%20presidential%20election%2C%202007"&gt;disputed December elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that sparked the violence.

The opposition accuses the government of rigging the elections in order to install President &lt;a href="Mwai%20Kibaki"&gt;Mwai Kibaki&lt;/a&gt; for a second term. The government says the opposition should take its objections to the courts.

Secretary-General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who is overseeing the talks, was joined by two other members of the mediation team, South Africa's former first lady &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGraca%20Machel"&gt;Graca Machel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's former president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Mkapa"&gt;Benjamin Mkapa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Mr. Mkapa told reporters the talks are progressing at a good pace.

He says the talks show cooperation from both sides and a serious commitment to achieving Kenyans' expectations of living in peace and unity.

Several hundred business leaders Tuesday announced that industrial production had been reduced by 40 percent during the past month. Exports had been hard hit by the paralysis of transportation. And hotel occupancy in tourist areas had fallen from 90 percent to 10 percent.

They forecast that economic growth would decline by several percentage points from its recent rate of more than six percent. They said 400,000 jobs could be lost in the next six months and the country could fall into recession if the crisis continued.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;United Nations Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; has expressed concern about crises in &lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. The U.N. chief is recently back from Africa where he attended the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; summit in &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; and met with leaders in Kenya.

On rebel efforts to overthrow the government in Chad in recent days, the secretary-general welcomed an African Union initiative to have the leaders of &lt;a href="w%3ALibya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt; mediate the crisis. He says the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; will do its utmost to help resolve the crisis, urging the &lt;a href="w%3ASecurity%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; to act swiftly to help bring an end to the violence.

"It has devastating consequences not only for the people of Chad and Darfurian refugees seeking shelter there, but also for Darfur itself," said Ban.

Mr. Ban told reporters the situation in the neighboring &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of Sudan is no less troubling. He says the deployment of the AU-U.N. peacekeeping force, known as &lt;a href="w%3AUNAMID"&gt;UNAMID&lt;/a&gt;, must be sped up and urged member states to properly equip the troops.

"UNAMID still lacks required aviation and ground transportation - chiefly helicopters. Additional troops will not make up for this shortfall," said Ban. "Those countries that called for intervention in Darfur are under special obligation to deliver on their promises."

While at the AU summit, Mr. Ban says he discussed some of the outstanding issues affecting the deployment with Sudanese President &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt;, and he expects the &lt;a href="w%3AStatus%20of%20Forces%20Agreement"&gt;Status of Forces Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (SOFA) to be signed this week. But Mr. Ban remained vague on whether some of the agreement's sticking points - such as night flights, land agreements, and advance notice of U.N. movements - had been settled.

On Kenya, Mr. Ban says he has been deeply engaged in the post-election crisis and told political leaders during his visit there that they bear particular responsibility for the future of Kenya.

"I stressed to all the Kenyan leaders the need to stop the unacceptable violence and killings, and to resolve their differences through dialogue and democratic process. I also appealed to all the political leaders to think beyond their individual interests or party lines and to look to the future of Kenya as one country," he said.

Mr. Ban also met in &lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt; with his U.N. predecessor, &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, who is leading the panel of eminent Africans trying to mediate the crisis, and said they discussed his roadmap for the talks.

Security of U.N. personnel in Africa and elsewhere has been high on the secretary-general's agenda, especially in the wake of the &lt;a href="w%3ADecember%2011%2C%202007%20Algiers%20bombings"&gt;December bombing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAlgeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt; that killed 17 staff members. Mr. Ban announced that he is naming diplomat &lt;a href="w%3ALakhdar%20Brahimi"&gt;Lakhdar Brahimi&lt;/a&gt; to chair an independent panel on safety and security of U.N. personnel and premises. Brahimi is an Algerian, but Mr. Ban says he has no concerns about his fairness or objectivity in heading up the panel.

&lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;'s sea and transport ministry said the &lt;a href="w%3AM/S%20UND%20Adriyatik"&gt;UND Adriyatik&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; freight ship caught fire in the &lt;a href="w%3AAdriatic%20Sea"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt; 13 nautical miles west of the town of &lt;a href="w%3ARovinj"&gt;Rovinj&lt;/a&gt; on the early morning hours of February 6, 2008. An &lt;a href="w%3ASOS"&gt;SOS&lt;/a&gt; was launched at 4.04 local time. It said that the 193-metre long ship was sailing from &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; in Turkey to &lt;a href="w%3ATrieste"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; in Italy and was carrying 200 trucks and nine tons of dangerous material, in addition to between 100 and 200 tons of ship fuel, causing fears of environmental damage. An official said Croatian fire-fighting planes and ships were trying to extinguish the blaze. As the fire started inside the ship, there was no way of extinguishing it from the outside. The ship's 22 crew members and nine passengers were rescued by the Greek ship Ikarus Palace that was sailing nearby and were on their way to Venice.

There were fears of an explosion if the fire was to reach the fuel tanks. Also, the water currents were pushing the ship towards the Croatian coast. However, reports said the fire was diminishing by the end of the day.

Former &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; governor and presidential hopeful &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;, 60, has announced his intentions to "suspend" his presidential bid. Romney spent millions of his own money during the campaign.

"If I fight on in my campaign, all the way to the convention, I would forestall the launch of a national campaign and make it more likely that Senator Clinton or Obama would win," Romney said during his speech when he announced he would be abandoning his campaign. "And in this time of war, I simply cannot let my campaign, be a part of aiding a surrender to terror."

With Romney's departure, most say that the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; will nominate Senator &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Republican%20National%20Convention"&gt;2008 Republican National Convention&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;St. Paul, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. McCain currently leads in delegate count. There is also speculation that McCain will pick &lt;a href="Mike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt;, who remains in the race, as his running mate.

&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt; has launched from &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center%20Launch%20Complex%2039"&gt;LC-39A&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; on mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20module"&gt;Columbus module&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. Liftoff occurred at 19:45 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, which is 14:45 local time at the launch site. ♡❤Atlantis♡❤ successfully reached orbit about eight and a half minutes later. 

Columbus is the first research module to be added to the Space Station since 2001, and its launch came seven years to the day after the last research module, &lt;a href="w%3ADestiny%20laboratory%20module"&gt;♡❤Destiny♡❤&lt;/a&gt; was launched, also aboard ♡❤Atlantis♡❤. Docking with the International Space Station, on the PMA-2 docking port, is scheduled for Saturday. Earlier today, a &lt;a href="w%3AProgress%20spacecraft"&gt;Progress spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; docked with the Space Station, carrying new supplies for the outpost.

The Shuttle is carrying a crew of seven &lt;a href="w%3AAstronaut"&gt;Astronaut&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Frick"&gt;Stephen Frick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20G.%20Poindexter"&gt;Alan G. Poindexter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALeland%20D.%20Melvin"&gt;Leland D. Melvin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARex%20J.%20Walheim"&gt;Rex J. Walheim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Schlegel"&gt;Hans Schlegel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20G.%20Love"&gt;Stanley G. Love&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AL%C3%A9opold%20Eyharts"&gt;Léopold Eyharts&lt;/a&gt;.

The launch had previously been delayed twice due to problems with fuel sensors in the Shuttle's external tank. A connector was replaced, and the third launch attempt proceeded without any sensor problems.

During the post launch press conference, it was reported that three pieces of foam debris were observed falling from the External Tank, however these were all small pieces of debris, so it is expected that any damage caused would not be mission-threatening.

STS-122 is the fifth orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, the 24 Shuttle mission to the ISS, the
29 flight of ♡❤Atlantis♡❤ and the 121 overall Shuttle mission. It is scheduled to last 11 days, and conclude with a landing at the Kennedy Space Center on 19 February. Twelve further Shuttle missions remain before 
its retirement in 2010.

&lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n pilot Marwoto Komar has been arrested over a crash he was involved in. &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737-400"&gt;737&lt;/a&gt; that shot off the runway at &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta%20International%20Airport"&gt;Yogyakarta International Airport&lt;/a&gt; on March 7 last year, killing 21.

The final report into the disaster blamed &lt;a href="w%3Apilot%20error"&gt;pilot error&lt;/a&gt; for the crash, which killed several &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n journalists following a visit by their foreign minister as well as Indonesian nationals. The investigation determined that Komar was responsible, having brought the plane in at almost double the safe landing speed. He attempted a landing at 408 kph (254 mph), which is 160 kph (100 mph) above the safe speed. The plane overshot the runway, coming to rest in a rice field where it caught fire.

On Monday, Komar was arrested. He has been charged with manslaughter over the crash, and if convicted could face five years imprisonment. However, the &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Air%20Line%20Pilots%20Associations"&gt;International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations&lt;/a&gt; (IFALPA) commented that they were "saddened" to hear the news.

IFALPA contends that further investigations are needed into the crash, and that criminal proceedings could prevent an accurate version of events from ever being known.

A statement was released that read as follows: "The Federation expects that Capt. Komar will be released ... as he has agreed to fully cooperate with the police investigation and clearly poses no danger to society. He remains a professional who was involved in an unfortunate tragedy."

&lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Allyn%20Root"&gt;Wayne Allyn Root&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading competitors for the &lt;a href="w%3ALibertarian%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Libertarian Party's&lt;/a&gt; nomination for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, won the &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; primary on &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Tuesday%20%282008%29"&gt;Super Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.

He came second in &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Hess"&gt;Barry Hess&lt;/a&gt;, a native of the state. In &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; he was beaten by &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Kubby"&gt;Steve Kubby&lt;/a&gt;, taking third place. Mr. Root did not campaign in any of these states.

The Libertarian Party will hold their national convention on May 22, ending on May 26. During this time, nearly 1,000 delegates will meet at the &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%27s%20Mark%20Hotel"&gt;Adam's Mark Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; to choose their presidential and vice presidential nominees.

Currently, Mr. Root has raised the highest amount of money out of all the Libertarian candidates, $14,330.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; has passed the bipartisan &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 152 billion economic stimulus package that gives one-time rebates to United States citizens, US$600 for individuals or US$1,200 for couples plus US$300 for each child. US$300 checks would be sent to people on low-income including retirees on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Security"&gt;Social Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which was not included in the original bill backed by President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. The plan would begin to decrease rebates for citizens with taxable incomes of US$75,000 for individuals and US$150,000 for couples. The checks would go out to more than a 130 million Americans according to Treasury secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Paulson"&gt;Henry Paulson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The House overwhelmingly approved the more broad Senate amended bill which included the low-income portion mentioned above along with provisions that would keep &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aillegal%20aliens"&gt;illegal aliens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from receiving a rebate check. Despite some opposition from some Congressmen, such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20B.%20T.%20Campbell%20III"&gt;John B. T. Campbell III&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%27s%2048th%20congressional%20district"&gt;California's 48th congressional district&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the plan passed overwhelmingly 380&amp;ndash;34.

Campbell called the plan "wealth redistribution" and noted it did not have safeguards to prevent illegals from receiving these rebates and also claimed that stimulus plan would increase the deficit more and noted the cause of the looming recession was because of "credit problems."

The &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; voted hours earlier on the bill which passed in the Senate, 81&amp;ndash;16. after having to shed some incentives included by Senate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which caused the bill to fail. Some of the incentives that were left out of the plan in a compromise to gain &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; support were demands for benefits for long-term unemployed workers and stipulation that would allow low-income citizens to pay off heating bills and let home builders pay off losses off the current year against previous tax years. 

President Bush approved of the package, noting in a statement, "This plan is robust, broad-based, timely, and it will be effective, this bill will help to stimulate consumer spending and accelerate needed business investment."

On Thursday, a local man known for his outbursts and disruptive behavior with city officials killed five people at a city council meeting in &lt;a href="w%3AKirkwood%2C%20Missouri"&gt;City of Kirkwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. During the melee, he was shot dead by police.

Among those killed were Councilwoman Connie Carr, two police officers and two others at the meeting.

The suspect shot and killed a Kirkwood Police officer on the way into City Hall where he shot a second officer. He then proceeded to shoot five more people in the room, killing 3 more. Kirkwood Police called to the scene for shots fired, returned fire killing the suspect. According to &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20County%20Police%20Department"&gt;St. Louis County Police Department&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson Tracy Panus.

"He came from the back of the room," said Janet McNichols, a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Post-Dispatch"&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ correspondent. "He kept yelling 'shoot the mayor' and he just walked around shooting anybody he could." 

The two wounded are a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASt._Louis_Post-Dispatch%23Suburban_Journals"&gt;Suburban Journals&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter and Mayor Mike Swoboda. Swoboda underwent emergency surgery to treat a gunshot wound to the head Thursday night at St. John's Mercy Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ACreve%20Coeur%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Creve Coeur&lt;/a&gt;. Hospital spokesman Bill McShane delined to discuss Swoboda's injuries. He did note that another ♡❤Suburban Journals♡❤ reporter Todd Smith was in satisfactory condition. Smith was shot in the hand. 

According to McNichols, the gunman was Charles Lee "Cookie" Thornton who was arrested two years ago in the same council chambers for refusing to leave a meeting after a confrontation with Swoboda and the council. He was asked to stop and was arrested when he refused to leave the chamber. 

According to &lt;a href="w%3AKSDK"&gt;KSDK&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; affiliate, Thornton had been banned from City Council meetings, but had made it known that he would be at Thursday night's meeting and extra police were assigned ahead of time. 

KSDK also reported that the shooter fired at City Attorney John Hessel who had thrown chairs at the assailant in an attempt to stop him. The assailant then moved behind a curved desk where council members sat to fire on them.

Swoboda, council members Michael H.T. Lynch and Conne Karr, and Public Works Director Kenneth Yost were shot, said the ♡❤Post♡❤♡s McNichols. 

Thornton fled the building and was shot by responding Kirkwood police outside the building. 

About 30 people were in the meeting according to McNichols.

Accused &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akidney"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; racketeer Amit Kumar has been arrested in &lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; at a jungle resort near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChitwan%20District"&gt;Chitwan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Police are still seeking suspected co-conspirators, including Kumar's brother Jeevan Rawat. Nepalese police are holding Kumar under currency laws, charging that he was in possession of large amounts of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;United States dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Nepal has strict laws about foreign currency.

Kumar, who had become the subject of an international manhunt for allegedly harvesting hundreds of kidneys of poor people in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrgan%20transplant"&gt;transplantation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to wealthy clients. He is said to have done so through a mixture of bribes and coercion.

Hotel staff at the resort where he was staying, said that he kept a low profile, but suspicions arose when he was cutting out articles about his own case from print &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anewspapers"&gt;newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

India is seeking &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aextradition"&gt;extradition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but the fact that Nepalese authorities have added their own charges of illegal organ transplants in on top of the foreign currency possession charges, could delay proceedings.

Meanwhile, Poonam Kumar, who is Amit Kumar's wife and lives in &lt;a href="Brampton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Brampton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; with their two sons, claims that "My husband is innocent... You tell me what human would want to do these things to anyone. My husband didn't do anything wrong."

"My husband is not a monster as being portrayed around the world, but a doctor who just wants to help people in need" said the 28-year-old woman. "I have great respect for media but it has pre-judged the issue." She added that she has not left her home for seven days and is running out of groceries. The boys have not attended school since last week when world media began knocking on her door. "I don't know what my options are. I don't know where I'm going to go," Poonam Kumar said. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Prakash%20Jaiswal"&gt;Sri Prakash Jaiswal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20Home%20Affairs%20%28India%29"&gt;Minister for Home Affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is not worried about problems with the extradition. "We have very good relations with our neighbour Nepal. These relations go back to centuries. It will not be a problem in extraditing Dr Amit Kumar," he said.

When asked how Amit Kumar could have crossed the border, Sri Prakash Jaiswal said: "The Indo-Nepal border is porous as we all know. He made use of this. But this does not mean the present condition should continue. We will have to take some measures to control crossing of the border."

One victim, known as Ranjinder, told ♡❤Times of India♡❤ that, "We were shifted from one vehicle to another and were confused about where we were. The Nepali driver promised me the job of a cook at a guesthouse. I was taken to a house where I cooked for the first few days." He was told that blood tests were necessary to protect the health of the guests at the house. Dalip, another laborer, said, "They told us it was necessary since the foreign guests were prone to infections. There were two men inside the house with pistols."

Both Ranjinder and Dalip were &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aanesthesia"&gt;anasthesised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and woke up after their kidneys had been removed.

"Initially they lured the poor with promises of employment. They were then convinced to part with their kidneys and a deal was negotiated," said a police official.

On February 4th, 2008 Judge Vaughn R. Walker dismissed the &lt;a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s lawsuit against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUri%20Geller"&gt;Uri Geller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Walker dismissed the case, concluding in his 25 page opinion that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; District Court in &lt;a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; did not have jurisdiction over Geller, a &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; subject, or Explorologist, LTD, an &lt;a href="England"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; company that holds certain rights to him. 

The lawsuit was filed in May 2007 by the EFF on behalf of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Sapient"&gt;Brian Sapient&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and his organization the Rational Response Squad. Sapient has posted a excerpt from the PBS documentary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecrets%20of%20the%20Psychics"&gt;Secrets of the Psychics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , starring &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Randi"&gt;James Randi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , on &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Geller claimed he owned the video clip and forced YouTube to remove the video. However, Sapient filed a counter-DMCA claim and the video has since been restored pending the lawsuits.

Walker suggested that the case be moved to Philadelphia where Explorologist, LTD (Geller's business) filed an earlier lawsuit against Sapient, claiming that the YouTube post violated English Copyright Law.

The &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGreek%20national%20football%20team"&gt;national football team&lt;/a&gt; has defeated the &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFinnish%20national%20football%20team"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; 2-1 in a friendly football match.

Finland scored the first goal in the 66th minute when &lt;a href="w%3AAlexei%20Eremenko"&gt;Alexei Eremenko&lt;/a&gt; managed to get the ball to uncovered player &lt;a href="w%3AJari%20Litmanen"&gt;Jari Litmanen&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn put it past substitute goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AChrisostomos%20Michailidis"&gt;Chrisostomos Michailidis&lt;/a&gt;. Just one minute later Greece equalised when &lt;a href="w%3AAngelos%20Charisteas"&gt;Angelos Charisteas&lt;/a&gt; headed a free kick from &lt;a href="w%3AGiorgos%20Karagounis"&gt;Giorgos Karagounis&lt;/a&gt; into the Finnish goal.

In the 72nd minute Greece moved into the lead as &lt;a href="w%3ABenfica"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt; midfielder &lt;a href="w%3ACostas%20Katsouranis"&gt;Costas Katsouranis&lt;/a&gt; scored a distant but powerful shot, bouncing it beneath goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Enckelman"&gt;Peter Enckelman&lt;/a&gt;.

Both sides missed chances, with Finn &lt;a href="w%3AJonatan%20Johansson"&gt;Jonatan Johansson&lt;/a&gt; failing to capitalise on opportunities in the 7th and 4th minutes, causing Finland to lose out on having dominated the first half. Greek defender &lt;a href="w%3ASotiris%20Kyrgiakos"&gt;Sotiris Kyrgiakos&lt;/a&gt; kicked a shot over the bar shortly before half time.

Also competing in the four-nation tournament, held in &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, are &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Greece are the current European champions, whilst Cyprus and Poland both qualified for &lt;a href="w%3AEuro%202008"&gt;Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt;, making Finland the only team in the line-up not to be competing in this year's European championships.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANebraska%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Nebraska Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; has banned the use of the electric chair in the &lt;a href="w%3Acapital%20punishment"&gt;execution&lt;/a&gt; of murderers. The court found that the application violated the &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Since July 2002, Nebraska has been the only state in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to use electrocution as its only executional method.

The case developed from death sentence of Raymond Mata Jr., who was convicted in the murder of three-year-old Adam Gomez. Mata's sentence was upheld by the court but stayed it stating that when petitioning for a date, the state should establish that it has a "constitutionally acceptable method of carrying out Mata's sentence." With this ban, no states retain electrocution as their primary means of execution; many other states retain it as an option if their primary methods are declared illegal or the condemned chooses them.

A memorial service has taken place for Australian actor Heath Ledger, who died January 22 in New York. Hollywood celebrities and many other loyal fans bid farewell to the well known actor. His death has been deemed accidental by the New York City Medical Examiner and was attributed to a toxic mixture of prescription drugs and pain killers. The star died in his Manhattan apartment last month.

The service was held at Penrhos College in Perth, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and was attended by over 100 people, although the actual funeral was only attended by Ledger's close family. Before the funeral, Heath's father, Kim Ledger, said that "the funeral will be very, very private and there will only be 10 people there, immediate family and nobody else."

In addition to family, the memorial service was attended by actors and actresses who have worked with Ledger, including &lt;a href="w%3ACate%20Blanchett"&gt;Cate Blanchett&lt;/a&gt; who starred with Ledger in the Bob Dylan bio-flick, I'm Not There. Blanchett spoke of the times she shared with Ledger in New York and Los Angeles. The Other speakers included his parents, sister and Neil Armfield, a director of Ledger's last Australian film, Candy. 

An emotional Williams, was wearing dark glasses and a white dress with black trim, she was not accompanied by her daughter Matilda. Williams walked in clutching the arm of Ledger's older sister, Kate.

Williams issued a statement following Ledger's death saying, "My heart is broken. I am the mother of the most tender-hearted, high-spirited, beautiful little girl who is the spitting image of her father. All that I can cling to is his presence inside her that reveals itself every day."

The Ledger family asked the media not to visit the funeral because they claim they will find it easier to cope without the media present. Ledger's father said, "It's a pretty sad time. We're finding it difficult to cope by ourselves, let alone cope with everybody around the world." He continued, however, by saying that the family does, "really appreciate the outpouring and the emotional support from all over the globe."

Ledger starred in the 2005 movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABrokeback%20Mountain"&gt;Brokeback Mountain&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ which earned him &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20Globe%20Award"&gt;Golden Globe Award&lt;/a&gt; nominations for Best Actor. It was on the set of Brokeback Mountain where he met Michelle Williams and their relationship began. He additionally starred in the 2000 movie ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Patriot%20%282000%20film%29"&gt;The Patriot&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ with &lt;a href="w%3AMel%20Gibson"&gt;Mel Gibson&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Scotland Yard says suicide bomb blast killed Bhutto, not bullet</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Scotland%20Yard%20says%20suicide%20bomb%20blast%20killed%20Bhutto%2C%20not%20bullet&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; investigators from &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; have concluded that former &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i Prime Minister &lt;a href="Benazir%20Bhutto"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt; was killed as the result of a suicide bomb blast and not an assassin's bullet. The results of the investigation were handed over to Pakistani government officials in &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;. 

The findings by Scotland Yard support the Pakistani government's version of how Ms. Bhutto was assassinated after leaving a political rally last December in &lt;a href="w%3ARawalpindi"&gt;Rawalpindi&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately before she was attacked, Ms. Bhutto was waving to supporters from the roof of her armoured car.

The Scotland Yard detectives concluded that Ms. Bhutto died when the force of a suicide bomb blast rammed her head into the roof of the car. The head of Pakistan's team investigating the assassination, Abdul Majeed, read the findings of the British &lt;a href="w%3Apathologist"&gt;pathologist&lt;/a&gt; who assisted with the investigation.

"The blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle causing a severe and fatal head injury," Majeed said.

Television footage of the attack shows a single gunman firing shots toward Ms. Bhutto seconds before the explosion. Investigators determined the person firing the gun was also the suicide bomber.

"All the evidence indicates that one suspect has fired the shot before detonating an improvised explosive device," Majeed said. "At the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of Mrs. Bhutto's vehicle."

Pakistan President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; invited Scotland Yard to investigate the cause of Ms. Bhutto's death after some of her supporters charged that the government could be involved in the attack and was covering up circumstances of her assassination.

Officials of Ms. Bhutto's &lt;a href="Pakistan%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Pakistan People's Party&lt;/a&gt; maintain she was shot during the attack. Even after the results of the Scotland Yard investigation were released, party spokeswoman Sherry Rehman insists that an assassin's bullet hit the former prime minister.

"We clearly saw even on footage that she recoiled from a bullet and she fell inside," Rehman said. "The issue really is that this gives us all the more reason to ask for a larger &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; investigation into what led up to the events of December 27 and to what is behind the hand that pulled the trigger and to who are the financiers, sponsors, organizers and perpetrators of this crime."

The Scotland Yard report notes that despite the lack of a detailed search of the crime scene or an autopsy of Ms. Bhutto's body, sufficient evidence is available for investigators to draw what they are calling reliable conclusions.

Detectives relied on &lt;a href="w%3AX-ray"&gt;X-ray&lt;/a&gt;s of Ms. Bhutto's head and a detailed examination of video footage of the attack. The British team only investigated how Ms. Bhutto was killed, not who was behind it.

The Pakistani government says an &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaida"&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;-linked militant chief based on the border with &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for her killing.

At least four people have been arrested in connection with the case, including a 15-year-old boy who told police he was among a five-man suicide squad charged with assassinating the opposition leader.

Ms. Bhutto's death led to widespread rioting and protests and forced a delay of nationwide elections currently scheduled for later this month.

"Five singers, one drummer. No guitars, no bass, no keyboards but nevertheless an unbelievable melodic metal experience."

That's how the official website of &lt;a href="w%3Avan%20Canto"&gt;van Canto&lt;/a&gt; describes the band. Hailing from &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, van Canto are what is called an &lt;a href="w%3Aa%20capella"&gt;a capella&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ametal%20music"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt; band, the pioneers of this new genre.

The band released their debut, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Storm%20to%20Come"&gt;A Storm to Come&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, in December 2006. Exactly a year later, van Canto announced a global signing to &lt;a href="w%3AGun%20Records"&gt;Gun Records&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ASony%20BMG"&gt;Sony BMG&lt;/a&gt;, and their debut was released worldwide on December 14.

Van Canto are now experiencing considerable success. They recently provided support for &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asymphonic%20power%20metal"&gt;symphonic power metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Nightwish"&gt;Nightwish&lt;/a&gt;, as well as receiving a slot at the internationally famous &lt;a href="w%3AWacken%20Open%20Air"&gt;Wacken Open Air&lt;/a&gt; festival in Germany. The prestigious event sees them sharing the bill with acts such as &lt;a href="w%3AHatebreed"&gt;Hatebreed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASonata%20Arctica"&gt;Sonata Arctica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAs%20I%20Lay%20Dying"&gt;As I Lay Dying&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASoilwork"&gt;Soilwork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChildren%20of%20Bodom"&gt;Children of Bodom&lt;/a&gt;, Nightwish, &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt; and headline act &lt;a href="w%3AIron%20Maiden"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;.

Van Canto's second album will be recorded across this month and next, with famed producer &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Bauerfeind"&gt;Charlie Bauerfeind&lt;/a&gt;, although no release date has yet been confirmed.

In light of recent events, van Canto member and founder Stefan Schmidt has given the band's first interview in &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, all previous interviews being in &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20language"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AItalian%20language"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;. Wikinews now exclusively brings you that interview below.

&lt;br style="clear:none;"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt; 
<h2>Interview</h2>
<h3>On the early days</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- How did you decide on the concept for the band?

</ul>
After the split of my former band Jester’s Funeral I wanted to do something vocal oriented with a heroic attitude. It wasn’t planned to leave out all instruments in the beginning, it was an idea developed in the studio turning out to work great.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Are there any similar bands you could say inspired you, or was it an original idea?

</ul>
We are playing melodic metal, so my inspiration as a composer can be found in &lt;a href="w%3ABlind%20Guardian"&gt;Blind Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and Nightwish. &lt;a href="w%3AMetallica"&gt;Metallica&lt;/a&gt; has always been a great influence for me, too. I don’t listen to many a capella bands, though. There’s a German a capella band called the &lt;a href="w%3AWise%20Guys"&gt;Wise Guys&lt;/a&gt; which I like, but it’s &lt;a href="w%3Apop%20music"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; and doesn’t have to do much with our style of singing or performing. Combining the metal style with the performing style a capella is the original part of the idea.

<ul>
BULLET::::- In the music world, as with all aspects of life, new or rare ideas often meet with difficulties. How hard was it to get people to take you seriously at first?

</ul>
It wasn’t that hard because we did not do much for it. We just presented our idea and many people liked it, some others didn’t. We don’t put much time in convincing people starting their argumentation with “you don’t use guitars, this is no metal”. I think everyone who takes the time to listen to our songs or to visit us performing live can see that we really love metal music and love to sing.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Before you got your world signing, you changed drummers. Is the previous drummer still involved in any way with the band?

</ul>
Yes, Strilli is still a friend of the band. Van canto first was planned as a studio project among friends. We didn’t expect it to turn out that successful. So Strilli joined the band for recordings and the video shoot although he had I think 4 or 5 bands at that time. When van canto seemed to demand more time, he decided to focus on other projects. It was not a problem for us, because he told us early and still managed to play all shows with us until we had our new drummer

<ul>
BULLET::::- How did you select his replacement?

</ul>
Bastian is my long time band mate since 12 years now. We played together in all our bands, only interrupted by the first van canto year, when he lived in China for one year. After he returned he was the first and only choice to follow up Strilli.

<ul>
BULLET::::- When ♡❤A Storm to Come♡❤ was first released, did you expect the rapid success you subsequently received?

</ul>
To be honest, from time to time we hoped it, but didn’t expect it. If you put that much time in a personal hobby and you notice that the result, the first songs, sound really great, of course you hope that other people like it as well. But the fact that we receive that much positive feedback in shortest time, without any support from a company or management makes us very happy. It shows that metal still works, there are thousands of people out there waiting for new music, fanzine authors working hours and hours on reviews and interviews without getting any money for it. It’s unbelievably great.

<ul>
BULLET::::- How did you come to be selected for the Nightwish tour at such an early stage in the band's career? How did they discover you?

</ul>
We got in touch with our current record company in April 2007. They managed to get in contact with the booking company of the “on a dark winter’s night”-performances. So we weren’t actually chosen by Nightwish themselves, and it was only for two shows, but nevertheless this was great.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Do you feel being associated with them has given or will give your popularity a boost?

</ul>
Of course! We played in front of 15.000 People within 24 hours and every magazine was there to see the first show of the new Nightwish singer in Germany. This was a great experience for us and the audience welcomed us very kindly.

<ul>
BULLET::::- How easy or hard was it to get your world record deal? Did you see a lot of rejection beforehand, or was it fairly straightforward having by then shown the industry you were serious?

</ul>
Unlike the approach we chose with our former bands, we didn’t contact any record company with our self-produced debut, but managed everything on our own. So this time the record companies contacted us after van Canto was recognized in the internet.

<ul>
BULLET::::- What about your first video, for ♡❤The Mission♡❤. How has that gone down with the industry?

</ul>
We did this on our own as well. A friend of ours did all the writing, cutting and effects. We only had to pay a cameraman, a lighting technican and a make-up artist for 13 hours. It was great to see how many professional people have fun doing their work and not demand thousands of euros of a new formed band.

<h3>On the new album</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- Are things on track for the recording of the new album?

</ul>
Yes, everything works fine. We recorded drums in November and January and will record all voices in March.

<ul>
BULLET::::- When do you expect it to be released?

</ul>
That’s up to the record company, I think it will be released in summer, so that the Wacken crowd can sing out the new songs.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Can you give us an idea of what to expect from the new material?

</ul>
If you do something new, you don’t have any references on how to sound. We noticed many things in the year after the recording of “a storm to come”. We now better know which words and syllables sound good in which context of the song. 
So I think our bass voice will be “more bass” our guitar voices will be “more guitar” and so on. From the songwriting point of view we are still in the melodic metal genre, what we call hero metal. We will also do some covers.

<ul>
BULLET::::- What's it like working with Charlie Bauerfeind?

</ul>
Great. He’s a great guy with a very high musical understanding. Having worked with Blind Guardian he definitely knows how to push voices, and many of them, in the right direction.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Do you expect to release any singles this time round? Will there be another music video?

</ul>
It’s too early to tell, we will first finish the recordings and then see what we can do around the songs.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Do you anticipate comparable success with this album?

</ul>
We wait for nothing but are thankful for everything happened so far and everything that is about to happen. Let’s see.

<h3>On Wacken Open Air</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- There are a lot of very big names announced for Wacken, as usual. Do you feel daunted by this?

</ul>
Not daunted, but really exited. If we can really manage to shake hand with Iron Maiden I’m sure not being able to speak one comprehensible word, haha. But I guess every band playing on this year’s Wacken will try to shake hands with them so I better not too disappointed if it doesn’t work out.

<ul>
BULLET::::- What about in terms of style? Wacken is known for the variety, but your music is the most unusual and amongst the lightest at the festival. Is that a worry for you? What sort of reaction do you expect?

</ul>
On every festival we played so far, people were first irritated, then a little bit amused and not later than the third song we played most of the people were enthusiastic about our songs. I hope this will be the way it turns out to be in Wacken.

<ul>
BULLET::::- What are your opinions on the other acts there? Are there any you want to see yourselves?

</ul>
Iron Maiden of course, Nightwish are there and I’m also looking forward to the &lt;a href="w%3AAvantasia"&gt;Avantasia&lt;/a&gt; show.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Have any of you ever been to Wacken before as a fan or fans?

</ul>
Of course. I have been there 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2005.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Do you expect Wacken to open up new opertunities for you? Can we expect van Canto at, say, festivals in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;?

</ul>
Hmm – we hope so. We also have a great fan base in &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and try to get over there in the summer to do some shows.

<ul>
BULLET::::- How long is your slot at Wacken?

</ul>
We don’t know yet.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Will we see more new material than anything, or will you perform a mix?

</ul>
This depends on how long our slot is, but I think the focus will be on the second album then.

<h3>On the future of metal</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- Do you expect a capella metal to become a more common genre?

</ul>
I don’t know. I think it would be great if other bands tried out so we can share our experience and do not have to find out everything on our own, haha.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Do you expect other bands to be influenced and encouraged by your success?

</ul>
I hope so. When we get mails from musicians or metalbands influenced by our style of songwriting our by the courage for doing something new we feel really great. I only started playing music because I was inspired by other bands as a teenager, it would be great if we could inspire other musicians, too.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Do you think the industry should be more accepting of fresh or unusual ideas?

</ul>
I think the term “the industry” is too general for that kind of question. I think that today the chances to get heard are better than 10 years ago. Everybody can produce an “ok-sounding” album and put up a video in youtube. And if it’s done well and the idea sticks out, the industry will contact the band, which is their job, actually. 

<ul>
BULLET::::- One subject that's been in the news a lot recently is bands complaining they feel exploited and/or by their record labels. Have you found this yourself?

</ul>
We all had bad experiences with former bands and former record labels, but most of these labels have been one- or two-man-companies that didn’t have much money to invest. That’s why we decided to do everything on our own until we get a partner that is able to do all the things we do, only better. 

<ul>
BULLET::::- Another common complaint is about illegal downloading "killing" the indutry. What's your opinion on that?

</ul>
Illegal downloading is not only killing the industry but also the bands behind. You can’t earn much money with music today, so of course I’m not happy when I read a comment under our youtube video saying “who can rip me the record? Where can I download it?”. I think we offer many possibilities for people who just want to check out one song: We have the youtube video, we have a stream player on our website and you can find lots of live bootlegs in the web. So if you really like the music you should buy a CD to give us the possibility to continue.
But I think in metal most people act this way, they really buy CDs because they like to own the cover, the booklet and everything. It’s ok for us.

<ul>
BULLET::::- What trends do you think we will see in metal over the next decade?

</ul>
I don’t know and that’s the interesting part of it. Metal has been declared being dead about 1000 times and every year there are new bands with new ideas, great musicians and lots of people listening. I think there is much more to come.

<ul>
BULLET::::- What advice do you have for artists of any genre strugling to find acceptance from the industry?

</ul>
I don’t feel I am in the position of giving advice. We had a good idea, worked hard on it and were a little bit lucky finally. Perhaps it’s the most important thing to make music because you like it, not because you are expecting something. All van canto members have been playing in metal bands for about 10 or 12 years and now it seems as if people start to recognize us. Even if they hadn’t, I’m sure that I would have continued playing metal, because I like it. It’s a very important part of myself, so I don’t waste a thought on leaving that part away.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWriters%20Guild%20of%20America"&gt;Writers Guild of America&lt;/a&gt; (WGA) &lt;a href="w%3AWriters%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike%20%282007%E2%80%93present%29"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt;, which has crippled entertainment productions in Hollywood since November, may be over as early as Wednesday.

In an email to its members Saturday, the WGA announced the arrangement of a tentative agreement with the studios. The union's members will vote on the agreement sometime during the next two weeks. However, a decision to return to work could be made as early as Tuesday. The WGA has recommended that its members support the contract, as it provides money to writers whose work is transmitted over the Internet.

There were two meetings held with the writers, one in New York and the other in Los Angeles where the writers seemed to be enthusiastic about getting back into business. Such shows as Desperate Housewives, the American The Office, and Grey's Anatomy will begin again if the votes go as planned.

Executive producers for TV series, sometimes called show runners, are heading back to work before the guild takes a final vote. They are preparing for the writer's return, which is now expected to be as early as Wed. Show runners are also members of the guild. They are allowed back at work Monday under the stipulation that their work only consists of producer related tasks.

&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, on mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-122"&gt;STS-122&lt;/a&gt;, has docked with the PMA-2 docking port on the &lt;a href="w%3AHarmony%20%28ISS%20module%29"&gt;♡❤Harmony♡❤ module&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Atlantis♡❤, carrying seven astronauts, launched on Thursday on a mission to deliver the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20module"&gt;♡❤Columbus♡❤ module&lt;/a&gt; to the Station.

Soft docking occurred at 17:17 GMT, followed by a hard dock at 17:35. This is the first time a Shuttle has docked to the ♡❤Harmony♡❤ module, since its installation in October 2007, during Shuttle mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-120"&gt;STS-120&lt;/a&gt;.

Prior to docking, ♡❤Atlantis♡❤ performed a &lt;a href="w%3ARendezvous%20pitch%20maneuver"&gt;rendezvous pitch maneuver&lt;/a&gt; (RPM), rotating the orbiter through 360 degrees in order to allow an inspection of its heat shield. This was completed between 16:24 and 16:32.

NASA engineers are particularly interested in a loose insulation blanket on one of the OMS engine pods at the aft end of the Shuttle, which was discovered during inspections on Friday. The problem is similar to one which occurred on ♡❤Atlantis♡❤♡ previous flight, &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-117"&gt;STS-117&lt;/a&gt;.

Around three hundred pictures of the heat shield and OMS pods were taken, and transmitted to Earth for analysis.

Other problems under evaluation are reported to include a damaged tile towards the front of the shuttle, and an entire tile falling away from the rear of the shuttle when its engines ignited at launch. It is not believed that any of these issues will threaten the Shuttle or its crew.

Leak checks were then conducted, ahead of the opening of connecting hatches, which occurred at 18:40, and the subsequent boarding of the ISS by the crew of ♡❤Atlantis♡❤.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARandall%20Munroe"&gt;Randall Munroe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the writer of the popular webcomic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Axkcd"&gt;xkcd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The comic is known for its geeky humor and minimalist drawing style that generally uses stick figures. Munroe worked as a contractor for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; before writing xkcd full time in 2006. 

Wikinews reporter interviewed Munroe at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVericon"&gt;Vericon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Harvard's annual science fiction convention.

<h2>Interview with Randall Munroe</h2>

♡❤♡So could you tell us a little about yourself and xkcd?

RM: xkcd is a webcomic that I started while I was in the middle of more productive things, school and work, that sort of by accident turned into a big thing and eventually became what I did professionally. I quit my job and got out of school and started drawing pictures on the internet. A lot of math and computer people like it, science people. It's sort of nerdy in general.

♡❤♡So, you have a somewhat non-standard style rule for typing out "xkcd" which I know has caused great consternation on Wikipedia and elsewhere.♡❤♡ 

RM: Well, the first thing is, it started off as a screename and an irc nick, where I’m very used to seeing it all lowercase. There are a lot of trendy things, from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ae.e.%20cummings"&gt;e.e. cummings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the poet, up through businesses that take that sort of thing. It is a big problem for starting sentences. If you want to start a sentence with “xkcd” it seems very wrong not to capitalize it. But I really grew to dislike capital X, lower case “kcd” because that made it seem like a word or a name more than a string of letters. The whole purpose is that it is a really abstract string. Capitalizing it is sort of saying something about it. If you’re used to treating abstract strings in programming, changing case is not a trivial thing. It's changing what the string is. So when it is in its canonical form, that’s the real xkcd, the other forms look wrong to me. So but on the other hand, I try not to make things too hard on people so I say “ok, all lower case is preferred if you want to capitalize, I prefer all caps. Mixed case is my third and least favorite choice” But to some extent that’s just style. Not for any particularly important reason. 
<h3>The comic</h3>
♡❤♡When did you realize you had a genuinely successful webcomic?♡❤♡ 

RM: When it first started out there was a brief flurry of people when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACory%20Doctorow"&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; linked to me with Boing Boing and it had only been up for a couple of weeks then, but “whoa there are lot of people reading this. This is a cool feeling. I like. It's neat seeing so many people respond and laughing and it makes me want to write more”. That was really the turning point so then I did it for a little while. I stopped for that winter, 2005-2006, and then started doing it again, and at that point I was picking up readers gradually. It was continual slow, sort of exponential climb. And from then on, it was just a matter of ok, we’ve hit a hundred readers a day, ok we’ve hit 500. and then a thousand. And at some I, you know, realized “whoa this is a lot of people.” But it sort of sneaks up on you. 

♡❤♡I should actually apologize slightly if there’s much overlap between these questions and questions you got during the panel.♡❤♡ 

R. When I’ve done this so much I have no memory of past questions. You can ask me the same thing three or four times. 

♡❤♡Maybe I should and then go back to the same question later and see. So if you had to give advice to someone starting a webcomic what would you say?♡❤♡

R. Don’t look at xkcd and think that it means that you don’t have to take care with what you do. There are a lot of comics that have the same general idea, good writers, but they don’t realize that presentation is important. Just because a comic is successful with stick figures doesn’t mean you can make it hard to read; that you should scan it sloppily. It's important to think about it from the readers looking at it, and see from their point of view, like are they going to get it. Another big tumbling block is do not comment on your jokes after you make them, do not write “this is how I feel about this comic” because then they won't form their own opinions and they won’t believe the ones they’ve formed. Pay a lot of attention to the experience of someone reading it, and keep that in mind.

♡❤♡I know just from reading the &lt;a href="http%3A//forums.xkcd.com/"&gt;forums on xkcd&lt;/a&gt; that some people have been critical as it’s become more of a standardized joke-a-day webcomic instead of a personalized more or less scans of your old pages and artwork. How would you respond to that? ♡❤♡

RM. I guess only about 2% of the population is going to like the strip in the first place so I always expected that there are a lot of people who don’t like the strip and aren’t going to read it. Frequently people started reading for the more artistic stuff and then now want more of that. I don’t really know what to say to that other than that what I’m doing is what I feel like I have to contribute more of. I feel like there are a lot of people who are good at the kind of art they are doing and you know, have better messages there. Whereas when I’m telling a joke and I get it just right that’s what I’m doing well. I’m just just doing whatever I think I can do well and will be proud of and so if that wanders from one thing to another over time, that’s not something I can control. 

♡❤♡That’s related actually to the next question. You have a separate forum for discussion. And the forum not only has discussion on the comic but has, ah serious business and news and sections for math and science and pretty much a lot different things. So how is that? Whats your experience with the forums fora, and related to that what made you decide to add the additional, you know, topical to xkcd but more tangential. If you could comment more directly on what the thought process is there?♡❤♡

RM: I’m less involved in the forums than some other people. Davean is in the business with me is running the forums with me, and my old roommate Belial. 

♡❤♡I hadn’t thought of the IRC readers as potentially different from the forum readers so I’m wondering if other than the obvious connection, aside from the obvious correlation you’re going to get from IRC being more technical, a little more difficult to use obviously. Have you noticed any other differences in the types of people on IRC as opposed to the forum users.♡❤♡

RM: Really I feel they’re pretty similar. I wouldn’t say that it's more difficult or that there is a higher barrier of entry. We get just as many dumb people on IRC as we get on the forums. Just as many trolls or people wandering in. Every community has its trouble causers and the really good people and everyone sort of mixing. I don’t think that the demographics are all that different really. It's just a matter of which medium you’ve had more experience with and are more comfortable in. 

♡❤♡You also have your "blag" which is really a blog.(Comic 148 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xkcd.com/148/"&gt;Mispronouncing&lt;/a&gt;) What about that?♡❤♡

RM. The blag is a fun thing. A project for me. as for the community on the blag, I don’t think there’s much of a community. There are people who read it, mainly when it gets linked to by something. There are people who are reading it and commenting but they generally are talking back and forth to me, they’re not talking to each other as much so I feel like that’s just a place to talk about interesting, science technology and funny things. There haven’t been a lot of posts so far. It's sort of a young thing so we’re sort of waiting to see where that goes.

♡❤♡What’s your favorite xkcd comic?♡❤♡ 

RM: There are some, ones where I feel like I got things right. I’ve always liked &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xkcd.com/150/"&gt;the ball-pit one&lt;/a&gt;. Hearing about how people like it and how people respond to it makes me like it even more. There have been a lot of new ones where it would be easier to name, but the ones that have been around long enough people have really responded to way back when the answer to this was the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xkcd.com/108/"&gt;comic about the MC Hammer slide&lt;/a&gt;, and I liked that one. I feel that one worked out pretty well. There have been a lot in the last year or so, last 6th months that where I felt I got things right. The one with &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xkcd.com/195/"&gt;the internet map&lt;/a&gt; made it all over the place, and since then there have been a few where they’ve been so well-reviewed that I think of them as high points of the strip. But I don’t know; I have soft spot that’s sort for the silliness of some of them. 

♡❤♡You've had comics that have included actual people such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Stallman"&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xkcd.com/225/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . What has been your reaction to meeting people you’ve discussed or mentioned or made fun of, or gently poked in the comic?♡❤♡

RM: It’s extremely surreal. And I mean just discovering that my, this is a normal person, and this is someone from my history books and I’m sitting here eating food with them. And that has not stopped being weird. And a lot of the time I feel like I should be having more substantial conversation than I am. I’m almost at a loss because it's such an enormous feeling. It makes me realize why people act so weird when they meet me, because I might be the same to them. 

♡❤♡So is there anyone you’ve put in the comics that you’d like to meet but haven’t?♡❤♡

RM: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJaneane%20Garofalo"&gt;Janeane Garofalo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for a while now. My fans have been acting out my comics and I was making them weird and the fans were still acting them out. So I was just like, I’m going to make one that is impossible for you to make happen and then that can be the standing challenge. If someone can do that then I can start worrying about this again. And so I had &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xkcd.com/254/"&gt;Janeane Garofalo jumping a motorcycle off of a crashing space station&lt;/a&gt; towards a volcanic island with dinosaurs while she is armed with a tranquilizer gun. I figured that would be good. The reason I mentioned her was because I’ve been watching some of her movies and she’s just adorable. 

♡❤♡Somewhat on that topic, there was—I don’t know if you saw it—there was a website that had a fake news article about a hundred xkcders commit suicide by imitating one of your comics.♡❤♡

RM: I read that, I forgot exactly what site it was maybe BBspot. 

♡❤Note it was BBspot. See
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.bbspot.com/News/2007/10/xkcd-comic-reenactment-leads-to-100-deaths.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;♡❤

♡❤♡So that's the sort of thing you're thinking of in terms of people imitating things? ♡❤♡

RM: I generally don’t worry about you know, that people are going to do something deadly because I mention it. That would be bad but I don’t think that would be my responsibility if that happened. I do sort of wonder about is, people acting out something that has negative effects on the community. If I put some kind of prank that in real life that would be mean-spirited or hurtful and if someone does that to someone famous and would lead to tension and bad feelings, then I would feel bad.

♡❤♡You did say on your blag at one point that “But remember, I am not advocating doing anything dangerous unless it’s really cool.”&lt;a href="http%3A//blag.xkcd.com/2007/07/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤♡

RM: Yeah well, that’s sort of my running thing. That was sort of a response to people who were really concerned about blame and always have disclaimers that say "by the way, we don’t endorse this". I’m like, do you mean that? Do you have to say that? Can you say that? If you say "I do endorse this" does this change things? What if I say I endorse it if it's really cool. And I don’t know. When I do something it's my responsibility; I’m deciding whether to take that risk and if someone gets an idea from me and goes and does something dangerous that’s up to them. I didn’t say well do dangerous things no matter what, so...

♡❤♡The man in the black hat seems to at least many readers to be one of your favorite characters. Can you talk about him a bit?♡❤♡

R. Well, I decided early on that I sometimes wanted to be an asshole and sometimes I wanted to be sappy and romantic. And unlike the nerdiness and the romance, the asshole seemed harder to reconcile in one character and make that believable. I started putting the man in the hat, when I just wanted to say the most absurd thing. A lot of the time, I’m in a real life situation and I think what’s the most hurtful thing, what’s the worst way this can go, and have someone do that gleefully. That’s just a recipe for comedy right there. Then I have the guy in the hat so I’d put all that on him and then say “but that’s not the main guy, he’s much nicer than that” and, and I took that, the black hat symbolizes that for me because Aram from the now ended webcomic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMen%20in%20Hats"&gt;Men in Hats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also wore a hat. 

♡❤♡So it’s not &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20hat"&gt;Black-hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the hacker sense?♡❤♡

R. No, it’s actually a black hat because there are only so many articles of clothing you can draw on a stick figure. I realized that I associated a black hat with gleeful asshole and that was a character I liked a lot of a since ended strip.

<h3>Specific comics</h3>

♡❤♡Regarding Comic 304, "Nightime Stories" &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xkcd.com/304/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;- &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20for%20the%20Dead"&gt;Speaker for the Dead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnder%27s%20Game"&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?♡❤♡

R. Speaker for the Dead is a much more grown up book. I felt much less of a connection to growing up so I would say Ender’s Game. I’ve read Speaker. I appreciate it some extent. I didn’t feel as personal as Ender’s game. And I didn’t respond to it the same way. I reread Ender’s Game every half a year or so for quite a while. Probably 12 or 15 times now where it just was such an engaging story and such an engaging set of characters. I went back to it over and over. And that’s something I haven’t done with any of the other books in that section of the Ender’s series.

♡❤♡That comic made fun of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AXenocide"&gt;Xenocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and didn’t mention the final book &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChildren%20of%20the%20Mind"&gt;Children of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at all. Do you have an opinion there? ♡❤♡

R. I have not read either of those books since high school, and for me that’s getting further and further away. So I haven’t read either of those books in 6 or 8 years. My memories of Children of the Mind are that at least had had the end of the story there and so at least playing out, and being “ok, that happened.” I don’t remember all the details but that there was something to it. All my memories of Xenocide are a girl with obsessive compulsive disorder and Chinese history for many pages. So I didn’t have very good feelings to Xenocide. But neither of those two did I feel were on the same levels as Ender’s Game or Speaker for the Dead. I just picked Xenocide as the most clear target of them.

♡❤♡Have you seen Orson since this conference started?♡❤♡
♡❤(&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrson%20Scott%20Card"&gt;Orson Scott Card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was the featured speaker at Vericon)

R: I have not. I have a t-shirt though that he signed.

♡❤♡Obviously he’s aware this specific one about Xenocide.♡❤♡

R: Xenocide followed from that joke I decided to make. I wanted her to be reading a book and wanted him (the character) to object to it and I worked out how the conversation should go. And then I asked ok who should I pick on? I ended up with Xenocide because I just don’t have great memories of it. It could be if I reread it I’d enjoy it. But um.

♡❤♡But you did say in the alt-text, “cue nasty emails from all 7 seven fans of Xenocide”. So it seems you understood that it was one of Orson’s less popular works at best♡❤♡

R: I can’t resist getting in another crack like that. Even if that’s not true, it's funny to say so. It's like whenever you say anything about, about “we’ve offended the persons in favor of what we don’t like here” you can always throw in “fortunately that’s not many people that don’t like that thing”. That’s almost a standard gag.

♡❤♡Did you actually try the 28 hour day?(Comic 320, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xkcd.com/320/"&gt;28-Hour Day&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤♡

R: Yeah. I tried it a couple times in fact. I’m coming off of a 5 day period of doing that when I was rolling my schedule around. So I found that if I do it for more than a week I start to go crazy. 

♡❤♡That’s exactly what you said in the alt-text actually.♡❤♡

R. Yeah that was. it gets to be the Sunday mornings where you have to stay up until the afternoon and nothing is happening. And no one is awake . The campus is dead. The apartment is dead. The internet is dead. And you have to stay awake, and you’ve already been awake for 14 hours. That’s when I’d fail at that. And then I’d fall asleep. And then you’re back on the standard college student schedule. And that’s when it always failed for me. And I’d always start to feel really tired in the middle of the day even though from the equations I shouldn’t.

<h3>On Wikipedia and Wikinews</h3>
R. It is interesting talking to any wikiproject. You aren’t talking to one person you are reading the words of a community and so now I’m almost feel like I’m not talking to you across the table I’m talking to some random internet mass and so you know “hello, internet, what are you doing on this page? Are you browsing this from work?” There’s an odd feeling to it. I’ve also have this urge to play with wikirules. I wanted for a while to find something I could say in an interview that couldn’t be repeated on Wikipedia.

I was thinking something almost &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKurt%20G%C3%B6del"&gt;Godelian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; like saying making a sentence that in some way depends on the way it's presented on Wikipedia and if you try to present it on Wikipedia with a neutral point of view by virtue of taking that action you are changing the point of view to do something.

I wanted to do an announcement saying that I could threaten to commit a crime or threatening to donate money to a charity. This money will go the charity determined by the placement of this comment in the Wikipedia article about this. 

So by making the decision about where to place it you would be making the decision about how the real life event would go and how the rest of the article would go. And if you make it important enough people can’t just cling to the guidelines and say I’m writing it the best way, and if you make it something like a million dollars to either Africa or Asia, hunger relief suddenly you have the responsibility

♡❤♡I’m almost worried about including that in the interview, just because I could see some sufficiently rich troll actually implementing that. ♡❤♡

R: Hey, if you don’t put it in the article, I’m going to talk about this.

♡❤♡So in general how has you experience been with Wikipedia? How did you first here of it, and actually have you heard of Wikinews before this interview?♡❤♡

R: I’ve been on Wikinews a number of times. Whenever there is a news story where the data is still being sorted out, there have been press releases but no one is really sure what’s going on, it's sometimes the place to go, to see. Information will always be being added. I feel that like if there’s a piece of information that got out there it's on Wikinews, it won’t disappear and be ignored. What will happen is sometimes there will be a couple of different sources. You go to the news sources and you don’t know which of those sources they have. And so then you go the next one, and you have a different sort of information. And so Wikinews is sort of sticky, someone with one source came in and gave their information. Someone from this source came in and gave theirs. They’re all going to build up slowly there.

Yeah. I think very highly of Wikipedia. I think that’s most of the criticisms about it are completely missing the point. The reason Wikipedia is useful is not because it has a similar error rate to Britannica for example. That’s one thing you often see in comparison. I think that a lot of the criticism of Wikipedia misses a key point -- that the way people interact with Wikipedia is fundamentally different from interaction with any other reference source in history. Wikipedia is a system for pooling information. It's where you go to find the consensus of interested parties backed up by citation. Yes, someone can edit an article and cause harm, but someone can also shoot you in the face while you're walking down a street. It doesn't make walking on streets a broken behavior. People use Wikipedia, by and large, properly -- as a glance at the collected pool of information on a subject, to figure out what something is or how it works. It's not a scholarly reference book, and I don't know anyone who treats it like one.

<h3>Politics and religion</h3>

♡❤♡Now we’re going to move on to something fairly controversial, because just I can’t resist. Religion and politics. You criticized &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Earth%20creationism"&gt;Young Earth creationism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and in the same strip (Comic 258, &lt;a href="http%3A//xkcd.com/258/"&gt;Conspiracy Theories&lt;/a&gt;) make a bug report to God. It's not clear how much the strip represents your own religious views but how much does that one? How much do others? ♡❤♡

R: It’s a hard balance. I try to avoid being preachy because I can just talk endlessly for anything especially when someone is listening to me because it's part of their job. I could go on and on. I’ve avoided making the comic too personal just to avoid people feeling like they are reading someone else's stuff. They should feel "that could be me." If I were like this is the part that represents me and this isn’t that takes away from some of that. But I don’t think there’s any contradiction there. I think that Young Earth creationism is such a fringe idea that this concept that the Earth is young is not representative of anything that’s real spirituality. That’s a misunderstanding. They are looking at science and then convincing themselves that their ideas are scientific and then really thinking we’re doing science here and deceiving themselves. It seems much more like a delusion than anything to do with the validity of religion. And for making a bug report to God- Einstein would talk about God all the time. It's sort of a device. Einstein didn’t believe in God not in the way we talk about it today. But he’d talk about understanding what God did when he made the universe in looking at physics. That’s sort of the same way I approach that. It’s a convenient device. It’s a way to make a joke or something. At one point I referred to the “the gods” as a multiple thing because that works just as well I feel like.

♡❤♡The &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; strip (Comic 367, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xkcd.com/367/"&gt;Fandom&lt;/a&gt;) got a lot of interesting reactions particularly on your forum.♡❤♡

R: I just battened the hatches and didn’t listen and didn’t read any of it. I was like ok, I’m going to do a joke here. The joke involves Ron Paul and I like the joke. I’m now going to just hide from any political fall out... but anyone who has looked at Ron Paul at any length probably realizes that there are a lot broken things about our system and want someone who will just up and fix those things. And Ron Paul has a lot of ideas. We should just change this, this is just right, we should sweep away all this argument, all these structures that have built up and just follow the Constitution, and there are some good ideas. At to how practical it is, that’s to be debated in a case by case basis. But I like the freshness of it all, that’s not to say I’d necessarily vote for him that’s I’d necessarily would vote against him. He seems to represent actual “let’s think about this, let’s come up with the best idea. Lets do it because it's right." and I’m all in favor of that attitude.

♡❤Note: Shortly after this conversation, Munroe endorsed &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to among other things Obama's consultation with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Lessig"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; known for fighting for looser copyright restrictions and for making &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Munroe said the following in a follow-up email♡❤: 

R: Although pretty important, I don't think that copyright, or more broadly internet policy in general, should be someone's main reason for supporting a candidate. I chose it because I think it's a good example of Obama's decision-making and what sets him apart from so many politicians, and because it provided a convenient background to segue into talk about his anti-corruption efforts and to leadership in general.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Fire%20Brigade"&gt;London Fire Brigade&lt;/a&gt; are currently tackling what they have described as a "major fire" at &lt;a href="w%3ACamden%20Market"&gt;Camden Market&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

Early eyewitness reports state that a "strong smell of gas" and "explosions" preceded the blaze, which reportedly has a number of people trapped.

Local bar patrons have been evacuated away from the danger zone, as over 20 fire engines and about 100 firefighters attempt to contain the blaze, which has shooting flames "30 feet in the air". Nearby houses and flats are also being evacuated, and roads near the fire are also being sealed off.

London Ambulance Service reports no casualties so far.

A moderate &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; struck &lt;a href="Baja%20California%20%28state%29"&gt;Baja California&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Border at around 8:15 p.m. (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;pacific time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) February 8. 

With a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of 5.1, the quake's center was reported to have been between the towns of Mexicali and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATijuana%2C%20Mexico"&gt;Tijuana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . No injuries or damage was reported.

Director of civil defense in Mexicali, Fire Capt. Rene Rosado, said several factories have been cleared of workers so that engineers might access possible damage to the structures. Another two bridges have been closed so that cracks could be examined. 400,000 people have been left without electricity, and 1.2 million are unable to use their cell phones. 

The initial quake was followed by around 15 aftershocks and felt, "pretty widely in Southern California, southwestern Arizona and probably northern Mexico," said Jessica Sigala, a geophysicist with the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS).

At least two children in &lt;a href="Baghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; have died after eating cake poisoned with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Athallium"&gt;thallium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and at least nine others remain ill. The cake was given to people at an Iraqi sports club near the capital.

The Secretary of the Iraqi Air Force and his daughter are also among the victims. All are currently receiving treatment in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmman%2C%20Jordan"&gt;Amman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aantidote"&gt;antidote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the deadly poison is not available in Iraqi hospitals. The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has flown in the antidotes and treatments for the victims, several of which are seriously ill.

"This is a disturbing incident," said a police spokesman.

Thallium is used in poisons to kill rats and insects and is also considered the assassin's drug or "The Poisoner's Poison" because it is tasteless. Former Iraqi dictator &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; used the poison against many of his enemies, and it has not been used since his rule of the country.

So far, it is not known how the cakes were poisoned, but the Air force Secretary says that the cakes were seemingly delivered to the club as a "goodwill gesture." Two officials at the club then took the cake home, where members of the families ate it. He now believes someone conspired to kill him and his family.

"The use of thallium in this way appears to show that someone in Adhamiya is reviving the techniques of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Intelligence%20Service"&gt;mukhabarat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [Saddam's secret police]. What happens if al-Qaida gets the know-how? We are urgently trying to discover how much thallium is out there and who would know how to utilize it," added the spokesman.

An investigation is ongoing, but police say that the cakes were made at a local bakery in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdhamiyah"&gt;Adhamiyah district&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Baghdad. Police also say that the bakery has recently been a host for &lt;a href="Sunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; militants.

The &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; noble family of Waldburg-Wolfegg has sold the manuscript known as the ♡❤The Housebook♡❤ to an unknown buyer. There is speculation in the German press that it was purchased by Baron &lt;a href="w%3AAugust%20von%20Finck%2C%20Jr."&gt;August von Finck&lt;/a&gt; who currently resides in Switzerland, and that the price paid was €20 million. 

It is unclear whether the purchase is in fact legally valid because the manuscript was sold without the permission of the government of &lt;a href="w%3AT%C3%BCbingen"&gt;Tübingen&lt;/a&gt; required by the law of dissolution (similar to the common law institution &lt;a href="w%3AFee%20tail"&gt;Fee tail&lt;/a&gt;). German law forbids the export of such a precious manuscript, which is registered in the list of national cultural property. 

♡❤The Housebook♡❤ of Wolfegg is an illustrated manuscript that was created after 1480 by an unidentified artist known as the &lt;a href="w%3AMaster%20of%20the%20Housebook"&gt;"Master of the Housebook"&lt;/a&gt; (or Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet) and possibly other artists. It was exhibited at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Gallery%20of%20Art"&gt;National Gallery of Art&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 1998.

&lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, the junior senator from &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and 2008 US presidential candidate has swept all three of today's Democratic contests, two caucuses in &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; and the primary in &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. Obama also won the tiny United States territory of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Virgin%20Islands"&gt;United States Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt;.

Obama won nearly 30% more over opponent &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ANebraska%20Democratic%20caucuses%2C%202008"&gt;Nebraska caucuses&lt;/a&gt;. Obama also had a major lead over Clinton in the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Democratic%20caucuses%2C%202008"&gt;Washington caucuses&lt;/a&gt; by a 2-1 margin. Commentators have noted that Obama seems to perform well in caucus states. 

Louisiana's &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana%20Democratic%20primary%2C%202008"&gt;Democratic primary&lt;/a&gt; was also won by Obama in a large margin, winning nearly 53% of the vote over Clinton's 39%. The state, which is still suffering from the effects of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; three years later could play a large role in the election this year.

Despite these wins it is still a close and race between the two Democratic candidates, with Obama showing a lead in pledged delegates, and Hillary Clinton showing a narrow lead when &lt;a href="w%3Asuperdelegates"&gt;super delegates&lt;/a&gt; are taken into account. Each candidate needs to win the support of 2,025 delegates to secure the nomination.

After the voting and caucusing ended yesterday both candidates gave a speech at the Democratic Party's &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Jefferson"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Jackson"&gt;Jackson&lt;/a&gt; Dinner in Virginia- Clinton giving her standard stump speech and refusing to talk about what had happened during the day; Obama repeating many of the things he had said earlier in his "Yes We Can" speech, this time with detailed policy proposals as well as "hope-mongering".

The two candidates were in &lt;a href="Maine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; today doing last minute campaigning before tomorrow's &lt;a href="w%3AMaine%20Democratic%20caucuses%2C%202008"&gt;Democratic caucuses&lt;/a&gt; there and are also preparing for the "&lt;a href="w%3APotomac%20primary"&gt;Potomac primary&lt;/a&gt;" which will involve the nation's capital of &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; and the bordering states of &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; to be held on February 12.

<h1>Tentative Agreement Reached In Writer's Strike</h1>
Saturday, February 10th, marked the day on which the Writer's Strike came closest to being resolved since it began. The 12,000 writers on strike tentatively agreed to a three year contract with production companies. The writer's will remain on strike until the compromise is ratified and confirmed by the boards of the two writer's guilds. A compromise would mark a much needed accomplishment for producers all around the country who have had their ability to produce television shows and movies greatly diminished by the length of the strike.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has visited &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, which was hit by over 25 tornadoes which caused over 33 deaths. In the visit Mr.Bush said that “the government has got a role to play” in repairing the damage from the tornado and that anyone who has been affected should call 1-800-621-3362 to "find out the help that is available.”

Mr.Bush started the speech by saying that he “looked in their [Phil and June Spears, residents of Tennessee] eyes and saw incredible sadness and worry.” He continued by saying that he believes “the Governor [of Tennessee] joins me in sharing our concerns with you.”

Later in the speech Mr.Bush said that he’s “sorry you're going through what you're going through,” to the residents of &lt;a href="w%3AMacon%20County"&gt;Macon County&lt;/a&gt;, which he was visiting. He continued by saying that “life sometimes is unfair and you don't get to play the hand that you wanted to play,” and that he believes “the question is when you get dealt the hand, how do you play it?” He continued by saying that the community of Macon County “is going to be as strong as ever.”

President Bush was under considerable criticism after people believed he did not help the citizens of New Orleans. The White House is being sensitive to criticism because they are not going to every state that has been struck by these storms. The reason that President Bush is going to Tennesse and Arkansas and not any other states is because they are the only ones that asked for help,fuck you.

An oil rig in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Sea"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; has been evacuated after a security alert.
Up to 539 oil workers are being moved off the affected rig in an operation
that began at 09:20 UTC this morning.

Barry Nielson, a Squadron leader with the RAF was quoted (BBC News) as saying
"It's unusual, that's probably the best way to describe it. But it falls within our normal operating procedures and we are reacting accordingly."
By the end of the day, the alert had ended, with Kathy McGill (manging director of the firm responsible for the rig) being quoted as saying "We are very relieved that this has turned out to be a false alarm, but we obviously had to treat it seriously and act appropriately to ensure the safety and well being of all our people."

Around 8:50 p.m. Korean Standard Time (11:50 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) on Sunday, a fire broke out at &lt;a href="w%3ASungnyemun"&gt;Sungnyemun Gate&lt;/a&gt; (more commonly referred to as Namdaemun Gate), one of the most iconic &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n landmarks, located in the center of &lt;a href="w%3ASeoul"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;.

Approximately 30 firetrucks and 90 firefighters were sent to the site and were able to bring the initial blaze under control by around 10:30 p.m. 

However, around 10:40 p.m., the fire rekindled at the second floor of the gate, as firefighters were in the process of extinguishing embers. By 11:00 p.m. the fire had spread over to the roof of the gate. The Korean Fire Department reports that the second blaze had started as the Department was seeking permission from the Korean Cultural Heritage Administration to dismantle parts of the gate in order to stop any possible further fires from spreading. 

At about 12:40 a.m. of the 11th, the second floor had collapsed, and the fire was spreading to the first floor; at 1:50 a.m. the first floor collapsed.

Officials have yet to reach a conclusion on the origin of fire, and have presented three possibilities; arson, electric faults or accidental origins.

As the interior of the second floor of the Gate is off-limits to civilians, the Korean Fire Department initially eliminated the possibility of arson, and stated that an electric short or spark from the electric lighting could have been the cause. This possibility was later discarded as a firefighter reported, after examination, that there was no electric wiring on the second floor, as Korean Cultural Heritage Administration regulations prohibit it.

Three eye-witnesses have submitted testimonies. A taxi driver has reported seeing a man in his fifties climb up the staircase carrying a shopping bag, shortly after seeing sparks. Police have stated that the driver's testimony differs in several crucial factors from the other two witnesses. 

Firefighters have reported finding two cigarette lighters on the second floor, inceasing the possibility of arson as the cause.

Police have been unable to obtain evidence from the four closed circuit televisions(CCTVs) installed around the gate.

Officials of the Korean Cultural Heritage Administration have stated that restoration will take two to three years and will cost 20 billion won, equivalent of 21 million USD. 

Officials report that no sprinklers or fire alarms were installed inside the gate, and only eight fire extinguishers were placed on both the first and second floor.

Namdaemun, built during the Joseon Dynasty, is the oldest wooden structure in Seoul and was entitled 'National Treasure No. 1' in 1962 after restoration.

In recent years, arsons started by evangelical Christians have damaged many Buddhist temples and Korean momuments.

The &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt%20national%20football%20team"&gt;national football team&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica%20Cup%20of%20Nations"&gt;Africa Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; champions for the sixth time in the history of the competition by beating the &lt;a href="w%3ACameroon%20national%20football%20team"&gt;national team&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Cameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; 1-0 in the &lt;a href="w%3AOhene%20Djan%20Stadium"&gt;Ohene Djan Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Aboutreika"&gt;Mohamed Aboutreika&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal in the game in the 77th minute after Cameroon failed to clear the ball from their area under a period of heavy attacking play. This was Aboutreika's 34th international goal for his country and was driven into the bottom corner of the net from a distance of 16yds. 

Egypt's victory closes the tournament, the 26th occasion the trophy has been contested, which began on 20 January 2008 and was hosted by &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AGhana%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Ghana's national team&lt;/a&gt; came third overall with &lt;a href="w%3AC%C3%B4te%20d%27Ivoire%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Côte d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt; taking fourth place in the final standings. 

Cameroon and &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Barcelona"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20Eto%27o"&gt;Samuel Eto'o&lt;/a&gt; was the tournament's highest goalscorer with 5 goals.
