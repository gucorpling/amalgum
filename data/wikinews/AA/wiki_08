According to a recent report by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Census%20Bureau"&gt;Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the pecking order of the most populous U.S. cities has changed. The report, issued June 30, shows in 2004 &lt;a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, with an estimated population of 904,522 is the nation's 10th-largest city, overtaking &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with its smaller population of 900,198.

The U.S. Census traditionally releases population figures for the year previous to the date the figures are made public.

<h3>'Capital of Silicon Valley' still an unknown among Americans</h3>
According to a report in the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%20Mercury%20News"&gt;San Jose Mercury News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, Mayor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Gonzales"&gt;Ron Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is saying the new ranking may help people across the U.S. be more interested in San Jose and think of it as a world-class city. "It puts us in a very distinguished class," he told the paper.

But for many, northern [[California}}'s largest city, the self-proclaimed "Capital of Silicon Valley" remains an enigma. In a country not noted for its geographical knowledge prowess, many Americans have no idea where San Jose actually is. Culturally, the city may be best known as the title location of a [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Dionne Warwick|Dionne Warwick]]&lt;/span&gt; hit song with the ironic title, ♡❤Do You Know the Way to San Jose?♡❤

Many locals claim the city suffers from a self esteem problem stretching back to 1852 when San Jose lost the honor of being the California state capital to [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]&lt;/span&gt; . Additionally, for most of its existence, San Jose has been overshadowed by its smaller and more glamorous neighbor to the north, [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]&lt;/span&gt; . 

"San Francisco has been in the limelight since 1849, and it was the capital of everything west of [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:the Mississippi|the Mississippi]]&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; it was a huge presence in the psyche of the world, and we can never replace that," David Vossbrink, San Jose city spokesman, told the ♡❤[[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:San Francisco Chronicle|San Francisco Chronicle]]&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. 

It doesn't stop with San Francisco; San Jose is routinely outshined by other Bay Area cities such as [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Oakland, California|Oakland]]&lt;/span&gt; , California, which is one-third its size. Additionally, the city's own Silicon Valley suburbs, including [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]&lt;/span&gt; and [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Cupertino, California|Cupertino]]&lt;/span&gt; , regularly steal the national spotlight from San Jose.

As far as the workkforce is concerned, San Jose continues to reel from the dot-com meltdown of the early 2000s. With an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent, it has a higher jobless rate than the national average of 5.1 percent. For a couple of years after the 2000 tech crash, San Jose lost population as thousands of unemployed fled to look for work elsewhere.

But the city is on the mend and does have some legitimate bragging rights aside from sheer size. Despite the unemployment, San Jose is America's wealthiest big city with an average household annual income of $70,000. It consistently ranks as "The Safest Big City in America," according to FBI crime statistics as having the lowest violent crime rate for any U.S. city with a population over 500,000. The local public university, [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:San Jose State University|San Jose State]]&lt;/span&gt; is the largest within the California State University system.

Economically, an increasing number of large companies also are opting to call San Jose home, including [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Cisco Systems|Cisco Systems]]&lt;/span&gt; , [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Knight Ridder|Knight Ridder]]&lt;/span&gt; , [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:eBay|eBay]]&lt;/span&gt; and [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Adobe Systems|Adobe Systems]]&lt;/span&gt; .

<h3>Slowdown in 'Motown' a long time coming</h3>

For many media outlets covering San Jose's ascendence into the ranks of the United States' Top 10 cities, the real story has been the decline of Detroit and its symbol as a Midwestern industrial giant.

For decades, Detroit, the self-styled "Motor City," rested its fortunes with the American automobile industry. Each of the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]&lt;/span&gt; automobile manufacturers, [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:General Motors|General Motors]]&lt;/span&gt; , [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Ford Motor Company|Ford]]&lt;/span&gt; , and [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]&lt;/span&gt; , maintained headquarters there.

But with the shift of the U.S. economy away from heavy industry to services and technology, cities like Detroit suffered, while cities like San Jose prospered. 

Detroit's decline in population is not a new phenomenon. In the 1950s, the city had a population of about 1.8 million, ranking as the fourth-largest U.S. city. But its fortunes started changing in the 1970s with the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:OPEC|OPEC]]&lt;/span&gt; oil embargo and the rise of Japan as an automobile-producing powerhouse. As the city's fortunes waned, many residents fled Detroit for the suburbs or opted to leave Michigan altogether.

"It's part of a pattern for the heavily industrialized cities, but I think Detroit is a specific case. There's been an ongoing dynamic here of people, middle-class people in Detroit, fleeing the city looking for better schools, better lifestyles, better services. So it has been a particularly hard fall," Dana Johnson, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit said in an interview with the ♡❤New York Times♡❤.

Detroit has also been taking its knocks in recent statistics. Unlike San Jose's reputation for being a safe place to live, Detroit tops the list of most violent U.S. big cities. In the past year, ♡❤[[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Time magazine|Time magazine]]&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ named Detroit Mayor [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Kwame Kilpatrick|Kwame M. Kilpatrick]]&lt;/span&gt; among the worst mayors in the U.S.

Along with the exodus of people and 7.8 percent unemployment rate, Detroit harbors a sight unseen in San Jose, blocks of vacant housing. For years these vacant buildings have been the targets of arsonists on the so-called [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Devil's Night|Devil's Night]]&lt;/span&gt; , where blocks of homes have been set ablaze in Detroit.

Additionally, unlike San Jose, which is in the process of moving 1,800 employees into a new $388 million city hall and faces shortage of police officers, shrinking Detroit faces a $300 million budget deficit and the prospect of laying off 700 police and fire-fighting personnel in the next few months.

According to a report from the &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20for%20the%20Coordination%20of%20Humanitarian%20Affairs"&gt;Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (OCHA), 500,000 &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;ns are directly affected by a drought, around 400,000 are internally displaced, and an additional 12,000 Somalians had been affected by seasonal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aflood"&gt;flooding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the central regions of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHiraan"&gt;Hiraan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20Shabelle"&gt;Middle Shabelle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as well as in 
the self-declared northwestern republic of &lt;a href="Somaliland"&gt;Somaliland&lt;/a&gt;.

"Overall, the extended effects of four years of drought, which adversely impacted livelihoods and coping mechanisms, combined with chronic food insecurity, and more recently flooding has exacerbated the suffering of Somalis," said the report.
OCHA estimates that around 44,000 people were directly affected by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and many still need urgent humanitarian assistance, the agency said. An estimated figure released by OCHA stated that $162,266,738 would be needed to be raised to target an estimated 900,000 vulnerable people. As of June 10, donors had funded approximately 39 percent of this appeal.

The December &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean%20Tsunami"&gt;Indian Ocean Tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; devastated the northeastern Somali coastline, further worsening the humanitarian situation now seen in Somalia. Good seasonal rains in Somalia which have ended a four-year drought have done little to help the estimated 900,000 Somalians in need of humanitarian aid.

An underwater volcano near the island of &lt;a href="w%3AIwo%20Jima"&gt;Iwo Jima&lt;/a&gt; (translation: "Sulfur Island") in the Pacific Ocean has caused a 3,280 ft (1,000m) column of vapour to rise from the water, coastguard officials said yesterday morning. The column of steam was reported on Saturday by Japanese troops who were stationed on the island.

An observational expedition to assess the activity was prematurely ended due to safety concerns, though the possibility of a tsunami was denied. Officials who flew over the area said the surface of the water "appeared red", which would suggest underwater volcanic activity. The expedition returned with video footage confirming earlier reports, said Shigeyuki Sato, a spokesperson for the coast guard. The survery crew found "grayish mud" rising from the ocean, though it is not known whether volcanic gases are being released.

The area known as &lt;a href="w%3AFukutokuoka-no-ba"&gt;Fukutokuoka-no-ba&lt;/a&gt; has a history of seismic activity, with at least ten historic eruptions in the last century. The most recent underwater volcano eruption was in 1986 and lasted three days. Japan's Meteorological Agency said there was no current danger of a tsunami, often caused by underwater seismic activity.

Swedish media company &lt;a href="w%3AModern%20Times%20Group"&gt;Modern Times Group&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Stockholm-based TV channel &lt;a href="w%3ATV3"&gt;TV3&lt;/a&gt;, claims monetary damages from Swedish mobile telephone operator &lt;a href="w%3A3%20%28telecommunications%29"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; totaling 300 million &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Krona"&gt;Swedish kronor&lt;/a&gt; for trademark infringement by using the number "3" as their name. Modern Times' TV3 has used a logotype saying "3" for many years. 

However, on July 1 the Stockholm district court (Stockholms tingsrätt) decided that TV3 does not have exclusive rights to the number 3, disagreeing that the mobile telephone company's use of the numeral was a violation of Swedish trademark protection laws.

TV3 has three weeks to appeal the verdict to keep it from becoming legally enforceable. In making the decision, the Stockholm court allowed other disputes between the companies not concerning the use of the numeral "3" to continue to be argued before it.

17 Afghan civilians, including women and children, are thought to be have been killed as the result of U.S. aircraft bombing the village of Chechal in the east of Afghanistan late last week, said a governor.

The air strike occurred last Friday in the same area as an elite U.S. military team went missing three days ago. 
Provincial governor &lt;a href="w%3AAssadullah%20Wafa"&gt;Assadullah Wafa&lt;/a&gt; told the Associated Press “seventeen civilians died in the U.S. bombing of the village.” He went on to comment that casualties consisted of women and children, though he did not know the exact figure.

A U.S. military statement claimed that the "compound" bombed was a “known operating base for terrorist attacks in &lt;a href="w%3AKunar%20province"&gt;Kunar province&lt;/a&gt; as well as a base for a medium-level terrorist leader,"

The statement, written after criticism in the press of the U.S. military’s lack of precaution in these matters, then went on to say the U.S. armed forces “regret the loss of innocent lives and follow stringent rules of engagement specifically to ensure that non-combatants are safeguarded. However, when enemy forces move their families into the locations where they conduct terrorist operations, they put these innocent civilians at risk."

One member of the missing military team has been recovered and is currently being “evaluated” on Monday, a U.S. Defence Department spokesperson said, though he refused to comment on details regarding his whereabouts and health. 

Afghan and U.S. forces are currently in the &lt;a href="w%3AKunar"&gt;Kunar&lt;/a&gt; province searching for members of the missing military team. U.S. officials at the time of the bombing said in a statement that the attack utilised “precision-guided munitions that resulted in the deaths of an unknown number of enemy terrorists and non-combatants," 

The statement continued, concluding that "battle damage assessment is currently ongoing." 

In May, Afghan president &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt; voiced his concerns over the excessive number of civilian casualties as a result of US-led operations. 

Some observers have speculated that the attack on the village was a deliberate response to the downing of a US transport helicopter last month. In that incident, 16 troops died in the worst single blow to American forces since the Taliban was ousted in 2001.

<h1>'Bad language' at Live 8 concerts trigger complaints to the BBC</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27Bad%20language%27%20at%20Live%208%20concerts%20trigger%20complaints%20to%20the%20BBC&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The BBC, who broadcast the &lt;a href="w%3ALive%208"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt; event throughout Saturday and Sunday, has received hundreds of complaints regarding "swearing outbursts". &lt;a href="w%3AMadonna"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASnoop%20Dogg"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt; are among those who used "bad language" before the 9:00PM watershed. 

Following last year's &lt;a href="w%3ASuperbowl"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, where U.S. broadcasting networks were criticised for not forecasting &lt;a href="w%3AJanet%20Jackson"&gt;Janet Jackson's&lt;/a&gt; bodily exposure, the BBC pledged to incorporate a time delay of several seconds in &lt;a href="http%3A//news.yahoo.com/news%3Ftmpl%3Dstory%26amp%3Bu%3D/ap/20050623/ap_en_bu/bbc_guidelines"&gt;certain live broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; in order to provide a level of censorship to potentially violent/unsuitable scenes. 

The Live 8 event, however, was broadcast live. 

The BBC, said a spokesperson, had received "just under" 400 complaints regarding the use of language in its coverage.

"Millions of people enjoyed our 12 hours of live broadcasting. We are sorry if any offence was caused.", she added.

The stars accused of swearing before the watershed include &lt;a href="w%3ASnoop%20Dogg"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMadonna"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt;, Johnny Borrell (&lt;a href="w%3ARazorlight"&gt;Razorlight&lt;/a&gt;) and Billie-Joe Armstrong (&lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Day"&gt;Green Day&lt;/a&gt;).

Previous complaints received by the BBC range from 240 complaints made as a result of the new 3D weather map, to 47,000 in the build up to the broadcast of &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Springer%20-%20The%20Opera"&gt;"Jerry Springer - The Opera"&lt;/a&gt;.

The kidnappers of &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt's&lt;/a&gt; ambassador to &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Ihab Al-Sherif, remain anonymous amid pleas for his well treatment. Egyptian Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Aboul%20Gheit"&gt;Ahmed Aboul Gheit&lt;/a&gt; said that &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; was working with Iraqi authorities to advance the release of Mr. Al-Sherif, who was kidnapped on Saturday.

A search of insurgent hideouts conducted by Iraqi and U.S. forces began on Monday in western parts of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. 

Abul Gheit pledged that everyone involved "handle the situation wisely".

"Our colleague... went to Iraq to serve the interests of the Iraqi people. We hope that they try their best in locating him and that he returns safely to his family," he said while in Libya for an African Union summit. 

"We understand the fury of the Iraqi people but this man is working for the benefit of the Iraqi and the Egyptian people and therefore we wish that he is treated accordingly."

An unidentified source said Mr Al-Sherif was "buying a newspaper" when he was kidnapped last Saturday. Witnesses said that a gunman "hit him on the head with a pistol as others shouted that he was 'an American spy'". He was then pushed into one of two BMWs used in the kidnapping. More than 36 hours afterwards no group have claimed responsibility or made any demands.

Egyptians in Iraq are no strangers to kidnappings. Last July, rebels kidnapped Egyptian diplomat Mohamed Mamdouh Qutb, who was freed unharmed. The gunmen from this case released a statement saying that their actions were in response to Egypt offering to train Iraq's security forces, an offer that was later withdrawn.

Mr. Al-Sherif arrived in Iraq on June 1, shortly before his promotion to the position of ambassador &amp;mdash; a move that was praised by Iraq's foreign minister. The Egyptian government upgraded its relations with Iraq in mid-June to "full embassy status". 

Some believe the U.S. is "urging" Arab states to appoint ambassadors in order to "support the new government and curb the resistance." Egypt had withdrawn its ambassador to Iraq 14 years ago, and was in support of the first gulf war in 1991.

In a meeting on Monday in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Church%20of%20Christ"&gt;United Church of Christ&lt;/a&gt; overwhelmingly approved a resolution supporting same-sex marriage, therefore becoming the largest Christian denomination to do so. UCC has over 6,000 congregations and 1.3 million members.

In a press conference, Rev. John H. Thomas said, "On this July Fourth the General Synod of the United Church of Christ has acted courageously to declare freedom, affirming marriage equality, affirming the civil rights of same gender couples to have their relationships recognized as marriages by the state, and encouraging our local churches to celebrate and bless those marriages."

Thomas also acknowledged that the issue of marriage equality is "the source of great conflict" not only in society but also in the churches. The UCC, he said, "is no exception" and "there are clearly great differences among our own members over this."

The decision is non-binding but asks member churches to consider wedding policies "that do not discriminate against couples based on gender" and support laws granting equal marriage rights for gays and lesbians.

Some member churches have suggested they may leave the denomination but most members appeared to support the resolution noting some ministers already perform same-sex ceremonies.

UCC was criticized last year for creating a television commercial including a gay couple being excluded from a church. The 30-second ad was rejected by most TV networks.

According to recent polls, Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;'s popularity has hit an all time low in response to his policies in industrial relations. This has combined with a backlash against Treasurer &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;w:Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, after he said in an interview on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALateline%20%28news%29"&gt;Lateline&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that religious teachings caused children "only a little harm". This comment followed a media stunt at a major church where Mr. Costello was attempting to capture the "Religious Right" vote.

The Liberal party has hit back by calling the public reaction "Labor propaganda".

Soon after a UN report &lt;a href="Nine%20hundred%20thousand%20Somalis%20face%20food%20crisis"&gt;highlighted the food crisis facing Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, a ship carrying food aid to Somalia has been hijacked off the coast of the country and its ten crew members abducted. The pirates are demanding a ransom of half a million dollars for the return of the ship.

Neither the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Programme"&gt;UN World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt; (WFP) nor the ship's owners are willing to pay the ransom. &lt;a href="Pirates%20killed%2030%20sailors%20in%202004"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt;, pirates killed 30 sailors.

The WFP hopes the ship will be released soon but cannot continue shipments until then because of safety concerns. If the ship is released soon, there will be no interruption in aid supply.

The WFP believe the crew is still on board the ship and that the crew are "fine". They hope the ship will be returned to them shortly.

The WFP supplies about 3,000 tons of food for about 275,000 Somalis per month, and the country currently has about two weeks of stocks left.

Sunnis have turned their weapons on al Qa'eda fighters in a town in western Iraq.

The local Sunni leaders in Husaybeh are fighting the followers of a Jordanian born terrorist, Abu Musab Zarqawi, who uses the town as a point to smuggle foreign fighters into the country.

Fighting first broke out in May, when a local tribal sheik was murdered on the orders of Zarqawi, and fighting broke out using small arms and mortars. The Shiek had invited US Marines to lunch as a sign of goodwill.

The foreigners have also enforced a strict Islamic code forbidding the wearing of Western clothing, and shops selling music and satellite dishes have been closed.

Anyone suspected of helping Coalition troops is kidnapped or killed - even those seen to be helping the Iraqi government, such as officials responsible for water and electricity supplies. As a result, local services have collapsed.

"We thought they were patriotic. Now we discovered that they are sick and crazy. They interfered in everything, even how we raise our children. They turned the city into hell, and we cannot live in it anymore," said Arkan Salim, 56, who fled the town with his wife and four children.

The US military in the town has not been targeted - in fact the insurgents have taken care to avoid firing mortar rounds too close to the US base, less they become involved in the fighting. Local tribes have secretly tipped off the US military so they can bomb the terrorists.

Iraqis said that the fighting is a sign of the fracturing in support foreign fighters in Iraq are experiencing. They have been losing public support amongst Sunni communities, the Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim Jafari said, after attempts to include Sunnis in the political process.

The man charged with stabbing three participants at &lt;a href="w%3AJerusalem"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;’s June 30 gay pride parade faces attempted murder charges.

Yishai Shlisel, an &lt;a href="w%3Aorthodox%20Jew"&gt;orthodox Jew&lt;/a&gt;, said his deep religious conviction led to his actions. "I came to murder on behalf of God. We can’t have such abomination in the country," Shlisel said during a police interrogation, according to authorities. 

The combination of police eye-witnesses, video evidence and his confession led to Shlisel being charged with three counts of attempted murder Tuesday in a Jerusalem district court. Prosecutors allege Shlisel purchased an 18-centimeter (seven inches) knife in preparation of going to the parade with the intent to kill homosexuals.

Medical authorities say the victims, two aged 18 and one aged 50, suffered light to moderate stab wounds.

Even before this knife attack, the 2005 Jerusalem gay pride parade already had an extensive legal record. Jerusalem Mayor Uri Lupolianski's previous decision to cancel the parade as inappropriate for his city was overturned in court. About 5,000 gay pride marchers and 1,000 protestors turned up for the Thursday night event.

Police temporarily halted the parade after a group of 100 orthodox Jews attempted to force their way through police barricades chanting "Gay is shame!" One man, allegedly Shlisel, did break through and stabbed three marchers. Other religious protestors against the march, including Jews, Christians and Muslims, were peaceful according to authorities.

<h1>House votes to repeal Washington D.C. handgun ban</h1>

A 30-year ban on loaded shotguns, rifles and handguns in homes and businesses is set for repeal in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington DC&lt;/a&gt;, where one of the strictest gun possession laws in the nation is in existence. The &lt;a href="w%3A%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; voted 259-161 on June 30 to allow an amendment by &lt;a href="w%3A%20Mark%20Souder"&gt;Mark Souder&lt;/a&gt;, R-Ind. to become attached to the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Federal%20district"&gt;federal district’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A%20appropriations%20bill"&gt;appropriations bill&lt;/a&gt; that later passed 405-18.

“My amendment gives D.C. citizens the same rights at work as they have at home.” said Souder, a congressman from &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. 

The next step for a repeal is in the &lt;a href="w%3A%20United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; where a bill titled “District of Columbia Personal Protection Act” was introduced in May by &lt;a href="w%3A%20George%20Allen%20%28politician%29"&gt;George Allen&lt;/a&gt;, R-Va. and &lt;a href="w%3A%20Kay%20Bailey%20Hutchison"&gt;Kay Bailey Hutchison&lt;/a&gt;, R-Tx. Senator Allen, who according to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%20Times-Dispatch"&gt;Richmond Times-Dispatch&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has presidential aspirations in the 2008 election, said of the bill’s introduction that it would, “give the law abiding citizens of the capital their constitutional right to protect themselves again.” It currently has 32 Senate co-sponsors, and sponsorship of the bill is expected to climb to 50 in the 100-member chamber before debate on the bill's passage begins.

Passage of the Senate bill would overturn the city law that has support from the mayor, city council, police chief and many of its citizens. The law requires trigger locks on all firearms or they must be kept disassembled. Handguns are banned outright. 

District residents are witness to a federal legislation process that many see as trampling upon their permanent residency status. Locally elected leaders are able under the &lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20of%20Columbia%20Home%20Rule%20Act"&gt;Home Rule Act&lt;/a&gt; to make their own laws, but local District of Columbia representatives have no vote in either the House or Senate, rendering them helpless in that political arena.

D.C.'s mayor &lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20A.%20Williams"&gt;Anthony Williams&lt;/a&gt; said, "It's discouraging when members of Congress who don't represent our city try to shove their laws down our throats."

A similar act to repeal the gun ban passed the House in 2004, but it was not taken up by the Senate.

In what has been called the busiest start in recorded history for the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="hurricane"&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt; season, newly-formed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Cindy%20%282005%29"&gt;Tropical Storm Cindy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was making its way toward the U.S. &lt;a href="Gulf%20Coast"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;.

The storm was expected to make landfall in &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; with 70 mile-per-hour winds also affecting neighboring states of &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; panhandle area late Tuesday night. Weather forecasters were calling for up to 10 inches of rain, lightning and the possibility of tornadoes to be spawned by the storm.

Cindy is expected to weaken after making landfall and is not expected to develop into a full-fledged hurricane since it is too close to the shore and will be robbed of warm ocean waters essential for a tropical storm's growth. A true hurricane is defined as a tropical storm with sustained wind speeds of 74 miles per hour or greater.

Cindy wasn't alone in U.S. hurricane weather news Tuesday. Another tropical storm, named Dennis, formed in the warm shallow waters of the Caribbean off the coast of &lt;a href="Jamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;. Dennis is expected to pass into the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and develop into a hurricane as it strengthens over the gulf waters.

Oil companies which have crude oil pumping rigs which resemble man-made islands in the Gulf of Mexico are busy evacuating to take workers to safety as Dennis approaches.

The U.S. hurricane season lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30. Officials say that never before in recorded history have there been four named storms by July 5.

Three teenagers were killed and two others were seriously injured near &lt;a href="w%3ADyer%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Dyer, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; early Tuesday afternoon when a driver with a restricted learners license, lost control of her &lt;a href="w%3ASUV"&gt;sport utility vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, ran off the road, and struck several trees. Kayla Pate, 16, lost control of her vehicle when her right tires left the road and she attempted to swerve back onto it.

Two teens were pronounced dead on the scene and one later died in hospital. The deceased were identified as 17-year-old Ryan Williams, 15-year-old McKenzie Coble, and 15-year-old Anthony Jones. Driver Pate and another passenger, Hope Jones, were seriously injured. None of the teens were wearing seatbelts.

Tennessee's Graduated Driver License stipulates that drivers under 18 can have only one passenger in a vehicle unless he or she is accompanied by a licensed driver more than 21 years old who holds an unrestricted license. Tennessee also requires seatbelts for drivers and all passengers.

&lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; is threatening to break the &lt;a href="w%3Apatent"&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AAbbott%20Laboratories"&gt;Abbott Laboratories&lt;/a&gt; as it pushes ahead with its programme to supply its people with free &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; drugs. 

Brazil has given Abbott a deadline of July 7 to cut the prices of its drug Kaletra or a Brazilian company will begin cloning it. This move would test recent &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Organization"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt; concessions allowing poor countries to produce generic drugs for local health emergencies. 

Abbott has said that Brazil's demand goes "against the spirit" of the WTO agreement, since it has the ninth largest economy in the world, and that this could damage future research for improved treatments. 

Previous programmes have been negotiated between companies and governments to produce generic versions of AIDS drugs, but this is the first time a country has threatened to use powers negotiated at the WTO by producing the drug without the cooperation of the patent holder. 

Several campaign groups are supporting the move, hoping that other developing countries will be able to take the lead of Brazil and produce generic drugs for their own populations. Michael Bailey, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam International, said: "The impact of breaking the patent would be enormous. If a major country such as Brazil goes through with this, not only will it help ensure sustainability of their excellent treatment programme, it will set a hugely important precedent for other countries."

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce"&gt;US Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; has issued a statement urging Brazil to reconsider and suggesting that the move could create a rift between the countries. Thomas Donohue, Chamber President and CEO said: "Brazil’s threat to strip patent rights from a U.S. company should concern all investors and every business around the world because of the precedent it sets for the treatment of intellectual property."

<h1>Protestors detained after violence near G8 summit</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Protestors%20detained%20after%20violence%20near%20G8%20summit&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Eight police officers have been injured and more than 32 people detained after protestors made an attempt to block the M9 road and railway lines. 

The violence occurred when residents of a camp site near Stirling in central Scotland began a mass movement towards the Gleneagles summit. A branch of &lt;a href="w%3ABurger%20King"&gt;Burger King&lt;/a&gt; in the Springkerse area of Stirling was also vandalised.

World leaders from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; are meeting in the 5 star &lt;a href="w%3AGleneagles"&gt;Gleneagles&lt;/a&gt; hotel and golf course to discuss world issues. The presidents and prime ministers will debate, among other things, debt relief to &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aclimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;. 

More than 100 activists dressed in black, many hiding their faces with clothing, "streamed" from the temporary campsite early Wednesday morning, where close to 5,000 protestors are said to be staying. 

A camera man for the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press%20Television"&gt;Associated Press Television&lt;/a&gt; said he saw a "group of around 100 smashing the windows of stationary cars and throwing stones at police." 

&lt;a href="Bob%20Geldof"&gt;Bob Geldof&lt;/a&gt;, organiser of the &lt;a href="w%3ALive%208"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt; concerts and original &lt;a href="w%3ALive%20Aid"&gt;Live Aid&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, has described the violent protestors as "idiots". Many have criticised Geldof's overexposure in the news, especially as apparent spokesman of the anti-G8 protests.

<h3>Previous summits</h3>
Previous G8 summits that resulted in violent protests were situated in &lt;a href="w%3AGenoa%2C%20Italy"&gt;Genoa, Italy&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, and &lt;a href="w%3AEvian%2C%20France"&gt;Evian, France&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. Police responsible for Wednesday's summit have taken no chances: roughly 10,000 police are on standby in Gleneagles, among watchtowers and surveillance cameras. A five-mile (8 kilometres) long fence of steel surrounds the hotel, complimented by no-fly zone above.

Earlier this week protesters clashed with riot police in &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;, the capital. As many as 100 appeared in court on Tuesday, as a result of police officials' promise of "zero tolerance".

"Make no bones about it, if we encounter people who are prepared to use violence to achieve their aims ... we will take robust action," said Tayside Police Chief Constable John Vine in Auchterarder, the village closest to the Gleneagles hotel and country club. 

Protestors and police officers numbering more than 20 were injured in over 6 hours of rioting in the Princes Street shopping area of Edinburgh, bringing the city centre to a standstill. Running clashes, baton charges, and mounted surges were some of the methods used by riot police at the scene. 

<h3>Agenda</h3>
British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; will, as the host, set the agenda of this years' summit. He is said to want "breakthroughs in global warming as well as Africa".

Blair's &lt;a href="w%3ACommission%20for%20Africa"&gt;Commission for Africa&lt;/a&gt; has proposed to double &lt;a href="w%3Aaid"&gt;aid&lt;/a&gt; to Africa by 2010, as well as a second US$25 billion increase in aid to Africa, and US$75 billion annual increase in worldwide aid.

<h1>Tanzania accused of supporting terrorism to destabilise Burundi</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tanzania%20accused%20of%20supporting%20terrorism%20to%20destabilise%20Burundi&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The African news website www.abarundi.org has accused &lt;a href="Tanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; of being a state sponsor of &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, by helping Hutu-extremists in neighbouring &lt;a href="Burundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt; to destabilise the country's newly-elected government. As widely predicted, Burundi's ruling "Frodebu" party, which has close links to Tanzania, was heavily defeated in this week's elections. The former Hutu rebel group CNDD-FDD, now a multi-ethnic party, won a convincing victory with 58% of the vote. Frodebu polled just 22%. 

It was the first national democratic vote since 1993, when a military coup plunged Burundi into a decade-long, ethnically-charged civil war. During the election campaign, CNDD-FDD accused Frodebu of stirring up racial divisions, and of employing members of the Hutu-extremist FNL to kill and intimidate voters. The FNL rebels have remained outside the Burundian peace process, despite the restoration of democracy, and a series of heavy defeats by the Burundian army. On June 16th attackers believed to be members of the FNL massacred six churchgoers in the Muhuta district of Rural Bujumbura. During earlier local elections, the FNL had attacked a polling station, killing a United Nations peacekeeper, and killed several people in "hit and run" attacks on the Burundian capital Bujumbura. Frodebu denied involvement in the violence, but have recently admitted "political collaboration" with the FNL.

www.abarundi.org reports that the Tanzanian government has offered material support to the FNL leader and helped formalise the "unholy alliance" between Frodebu and the FNL:

"With the assistance of the Tanzanians, [FNL leader] Agathon Rwasa has moved his HQ from the hills around Bujumbura, where he was already in difficulty, to the Tanzanian capital &lt;a href="w%3ADar%20Es%20Salaam"&gt;Dar Es Salaam&lt;/a&gt;, where he can enjoy the protection of the Tanzanian secret service."

"Rwasa, who has nothing more to lose, has accepted that the success of the elections mean political death for the FNL, and their position as 'Hutu defenders' has become obsolete."

"But if Rwasa's strategy is merely his own survival, Frodebu's calculation is far more diabolical - they intend to perpetuate Burundi's bloody civil war and state of insecurity, in order to undermine the new institutions."

<h1>London to host 2012 Olympic Games</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=London%20to%20host%202012%20Olympic%20Games&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
London is to host the 2012 &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Games"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;.

The announcement was made today by &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IOC) president Jacques Rogge following four rounds of voting, penultimately shortlisting London and Paris. 116 members of the IOC in &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; voted throughout the rounds from a pool of cities comprising of &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.

The final tally was 54 votes for London, and 50 for Paris. 
The voting came after all five cities made their final presentations to the assembled members.

The news was met with screams of joy from the 15,000 people who had gathered in &lt;a href="w%3ATrafalgar%20Square"&gt;Trafalgar Square&lt;/a&gt; in London, while jeers and boos rang out across Paris, as rain began to fall in the French capital.

Former Olympic runner &lt;a href="w%3ASebastian%20Coe%2C%20Baron%20Coe"&gt;Sebastian Coe&lt;/a&gt;, who led the British bid, told &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; Radio Five Live afterwards: "I'm in a state of shock. The whole team has made a fantastic effort. This shows that the United Kingdom is a special place for sport, passionate about sport."

This is the first time the Games will be staged in London since 1948, while this marks the third failure by Paris to host the Olympics. London has hosted the Games twice before, making it the first city ever to host them three times.

The official announcement was given by the IOC at 12:46 BST today, after much speculation. The 2012 London Olympics are widely anticipated to bring about a revival of both sporting culture in England, and the much maligned &lt;a href="w%3ADocklands"&gt;Docklands&lt;/a&gt; area of London, where most main sporting venues will be constructed.

<h3>Dignitaries</h3>

Present, physically or by video link, were several dignitaries of the participating countries, including the British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, French President &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Sof%C3%ADa%20of%20Spain"&gt;Queen Sofía&lt;/a&gt; of Spain, and Russian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMikhail%20Fradkov"&gt;Mikhail Fradkov&lt;/a&gt;.

Tony Blair is quoted to have said via a recorded video message "Our vision is to see millions of young people participate in sport and improve their lives. London has the power to make this happen."

Also present with the British campaign team were world famous soccer player &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Beckham"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt;, athletes &lt;a href="w%3ADenise%20Lewis"&gt;Denise Lewis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Redgrave"&gt;Sir Steven Redgrave&lt;/a&gt;, and Her Royal Highness &lt;a href="w%3AAnne%2C%20Princess%20Royal"&gt;Princess Anne&lt;/a&gt;, who brought with her a message from &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20II"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;:

"I've been impressed by the way everyone has united behind London's bid. As a country we share a passion for sport."

French President Jacques Chriac was also present, along with actress &lt;a href="w%3ACatherine%20Deneuve"&gt;Catherine Deneuve&lt;/a&gt; and singer &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Hallyday"&gt;Johnny Hallyday&lt;/a&gt;, both French.

"The heart of Paris and the heart of France are beating in unison in the hope of becoming Olympic host in 2012...you can put your trust and faith in France, you can trust the French, you can trust us," he said.

America's assembly consisted of New York Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. Senator &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and bid leader &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Doctoroff"&gt;Dan Doctoroff&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on New York's multicultural make up and readiness. Mr. Bloomberg chose to remind the Committee of New York's recovery after the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;.

"In our city's darkest hour, we asked ourselves, can we recover? ...New Yorkers stood up then and said, 'Yes, we can recover, we will rebuild and we must continue to welcome everyone.' That spirit will be given to your Games."

U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and former President &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; spoke in a recorded video message.

Russian President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; delivered his case in a live video clip, urging the Committee to take advantage of a "unique and truly historic opportunity", and to select Moscow for the games in 2012.

"Moscow is a meeting place of cultures. Moscow is perfectly suited to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games," he said.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt; from Spain and Queen Sofía argued in favour of Madrid.

"The whole Spanish royal family is convinced that Madrid fully meets the conditions to offer to the world the best Olympic Games," said Queen Sofía.

Questions from the IOC regarding threats from the &lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20people"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; extremist group &lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt; drew the following response:

"Absolute security is assured...It's our main priority. Those who have tried to attack our candidacy will see that this is something that is doomed to disappear in Madrid and all of Spain."

A controversial patent directive has been thrown out in a landslide vote. 648 MEPs out of 680 voted today to reject the proposal, aimed at bringing Europe in-line with a similar U.S. bill. 

"This is a great victory for those who have campaigned to ensure that European innovation and competitiveness is protected from monopolisation of software functionalities and business methods. It marks the end of an attempt by the European Commission and governmental patent officials to impose detrimental and legally questionable practices of the European Patent Office (EPO) on the member states," said the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, in opposition to the directive.

Adversaries to the patent directive claim that a bill covering Intellectual Property (IP) would "stifle innovation" in Europe, as it allows the patenting of implementation within software. Many anti-patent activists say that if the bill were passed, small businesses and hobbyists would be in danger of lawsuit from corporations and their extensive patent portfolios.

<h1>European Parliament rejects computer-implemented inventions directive</h1>
The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has rejected the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adirective%20on%20the%20patentability%20of%20computer-implemented%20inventions"&gt;directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (software patent directive) sustained by lobbies of large software publicists such as the corporations &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASiemens"&gt;Siemens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANokia"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlcatel"&gt;Alcatel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , grouped under the title of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEICTA"&gt;European Information &amp; Communications Technology Industry Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (EICTA, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.eicta.org/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The directive involved the granting of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asoftware%20patent"&gt;software patents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

648 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament"&gt;MEPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; out of 680 rejected the text, 18 voted for and 14 abstained.

A rejection vote became the expected outcome when the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;European People's Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , initially in favour of the directive, decided to reject it.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Greens"&gt;European Greens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20European%20Socialists"&gt;Socialist Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Liberal%20Democrat%20and%20Reform%20Party"&gt;European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also voted for rejection of the directive for heterogeneous reason. Michel Rocard, author of a number of amendments to the original directive, said that the majority of the modifications were unlikely to be supported by the Commission and Council, with whom the Parliament would have had to enter a Conciliation procedure if it had voted for maintaining the directive in moditifed form. "Better have no text at all than a bad one", he added.
Before the vote, Rocard pointed at the irritation of the Parliament towards the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : "There is collective anger throughout the Parliament because of the way the directive was handled by the Commission and the Council".

During the debate on Tuesday, Commissioner &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoaqu%C3%ADn%20Almunia"&gt;Joaquín Almunia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told MEPs: "Should you decide to reject the common position, the Commission will not submit a new proposal.".

The rejection was welcomed by small and medium software companies, as well as by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Software"&gt;Free Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; supporters. The Directive had been subject to an intense campaigning, within the Parliament, in the news media and on the Internet. The supporters of the Council position appear to have spent several ten millions, hiring prestigious PR agencies with at least 30-40 lobbyists who roamed the halls of the Parliament every day for 3 months, and many full-page advertisements in EU newspapers such as European Voice, EU Reporter etc. The opponents of software patentability (that is supporters of the position taken by the European Parliament in its 1st reading of 24 September 2003), coordinated under the roof of the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII), also had several lobbyists stationed in Brussels, conducted several conferences and demonstrations and published some newspaper advertisements, with a total budget of nearly 100,000 eur apart from countless unpaid working hours of a dedicated supporter base, consisting mainly of programmers and software entrepreneurs.

Joshua J. Goyette allegedly confessed to breaking into a &lt;a href="w%3ASaxonburg%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Saxonburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; retirement home and beating 86-year-old Gertrude "Trudy" Johanson in the early morning of June 25, 2005. The crime, which shocked the small community north of &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, was not the only one which occurred recently at area retirement homes. Goyette is also suspected in a May incident where another apartment at the Commons of Saxonburg was broken into through a first floor window and the 90-year-old woman inside was groped while she slept.

Goyette, 25, has addresses listed in court documents in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Bedford%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;New Bedford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;; and in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, his mother's home.

The alleged confession was given last Thursday, June 30, 2005, in New Bedford, Massachusetts, to Pennsylvania state police investigators. Goyette is currently being held in the &lt;a href="w%3AButler%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Butler County&lt;/a&gt; prison in lieu of $300,000 cash bond. He faces charges of attempted homicide, aggravated assault, burglary and criminal mischief.

On Wednesday, in a case that toes the line between a search for the source of criminal activity and the right to &lt;a href="w%3Afreedom%20of%20the%20press"&gt;freedom of the press&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reporter was jailed after she refused to reveal her confidential source to a grand jury investigating the leak of a covert &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; operative's name to the media.

Chief U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered correspondent &lt;a href="w%3AJudith%20Miller%20%28journalist%29"&gt;Judith Miller&lt;/a&gt; to jail immediately and said she must stay there until she agreed to testify or for the rest of the grand jury's term, which lasts through October.

"If journalists cannot be trusted to keep confidences, then journalists cannot function and there cannot be a free press," she said in the courtroom.

"I do not make confidential pledges lightly, but when I do I must honor them. If I do not, how can I expect people to accept my assurances."

"Your honor, in this case I cannot break my word just to stay out of jail," Miller told the judge during the hearing which lasted about an hour.

Miller also noted that she did not consider herself to be above the law and that she had thought long and hard over the July 4 &lt;a href="w%3AIndependence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt; holiday about her decision.

She said her decision was necessary to help ensure an independent free press.

The biggest music festival in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Eastern%20Europe"&gt;South Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, Exit Festival, will start tomorrow. The festival is organized on &lt;a href="w%3APetrovaradin"&gt;Petrovaradin&lt;/a&gt; fortress in &lt;a href="w%3ANovi%20Sad"&gt;Novi Sad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, and will last from July 7 to July 10. This will be the fifth annual Exit festival.

The festival includes 21 stages, featuring a diverse range of music, from classical to techno. The program is scheduled to last from 6 pm to 8 am every night, with both domestic and foreign musicians.

It is expected that tens of thousands of people, mostly from ex Yugoslavian republics, will attend. This year's performers include Apocalyptica, Fatboy Slim, White Stripes, Underworld, Garbage, Slayer, Laibach, Ian Brown, Carl Cox, Freq Nasty, Marky &amp; Patife, Sasha, Felix da Housecat, Dave Clarke, Napalm Death, Sandy Rivera, Darren Emerson, Mutiny, Danny Howells, Christian Varela, Michel De Hey, Valentino Kanzyani, 2 Many DJs, Marko Nastic, etc.

<h3>Political implications</h3>

The organizers decided to commemorate the &lt;a href="w%3ASrebrenica%20Massacre"&gt;Srebrenica Massacre&lt;/a&gt; with one minute of silence on midnight between July 10 and July 11. The festival is in part sponsored by the city of Novi Sad, which is currently ruled by the Serbian Radical Party which is opposed to publicly recognizing war crimes committed by the Serbs in Bosnia in a way that Exit orginizers intend. The president of the Serbian Radical Party, Tomislav Nikolić said: "If that festival, which is intended for young people having fun, turn into any kind of political provocation, there will be no Exit next year."

A book by &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Rick%20Santorum"&gt;Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;PA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), entitled "It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good", hit stores in Washington over the weekend. Its official publication date is July 25th. Intended as a response to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's book "It Takes a Village", certain passages of the book have already caused concern in certain circles. Also in the book, Santorum compares &lt;a href="abortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aslavery"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and advocates against public school systems and two income families.

Already facing perhaps the toughest re-election bid in the country, opponents and supporters of Santorum are using the book to tout their positions. T.J. Rooney, the state &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; chairman, had this to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"References to how families are compromised when both parents work outside the home, how it takes a societal toll on Pennsylvania families or American families, it just shows a complete lack of understanding of the real world in which the vast majority of Pennsylvanians reside."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he's a Democrat himself, journalist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJules%20Siegel"&gt;Jules Siegel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; disagrees with Rooney, "From what I read in the July 10 AP story about Sen. Santorum's encounter with Hillary Clinton, I believe that he and I share common views on some aspects of child-rearing. Democrats can't handle motherhood issues because NOW-style feminists will not allow an honest discussion of what to do about the economic consequences of motherhood. Daycare is not the answer. I'm eager to see what Santorum says about right to life after birth."
Hillary Clinton's office refused to comment on the book. 

<h3>Quotes from the book</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- "The notion that college education is a cost-effective way to help poor, low-skill unmarried mothers with high school diplomas or GED's move up the economic ladder is just wrong."
BULLET::::- "Respect for stay-at-home mothers has been poisoned by a toxic combination of the village elders' war on the traditional family and radical feminism's misogynistic crusade to make working outside the home the only marker of social value and self-respect."
BULLET::::- "The African proverb says, 'It takes a village to raise a child." "The American version is 'It takes a village to raise a child - if the village wants that child.'"

According to a report by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, 9 out of 10 &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; users have adjusted their online behaviour because of &lt;a href="w%3Aspyware"&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt;. Of the 2,001 adults surveyed, 97% said that they had heard of the term spyware and 78% said they “had a good idea what the term meant.”

61% said they were very confident or somewhat confident they could keep things
like computer viruses, spyware and &lt;a href="w%3Aadware"&gt;adware&lt;/a&gt; off their computers. However, 34% said they have had spyware on their home computers. This number is probably much higher. In an October 2004 study, by &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%20Online"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt; and the National Cyber Security Alliance, 53% of respondents said they had spyware or adware on their computers, but a scan showed that 80% of respondents actually had such programs installed.

68% of home internet users report that they have experienced problems that are normally associated with spyware. These problems include computers slowing down or crashing, new unfamiliar programs appearing on their computers and Internet home page changing without user action.

49% consider spyware to be a serious threat to their online security. 91% of internet users say they have made at least one change in their online behaviour as a result of spyware. 34% have stopped downloading programs from the Internet. 89% said they do not open email attachments unless they are sure they are safe. 25% say they have stopped using &lt;a href="w%3APeer-to-peer"&gt;peer-to-peer networks&lt;/a&gt;, a common source of spyware. 8% say they have switched to a different &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%20browser"&gt;web browser&lt;/a&gt;.

The Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project report was based based upon a telephone &lt;a href="w%3Asurvey"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates between May 4 and June 7, 2005. The Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project is a non-profit research centre that produces reports that study the social effects of the Internet.

67% percent of homes in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; now have internet connectivity.

The rapper, &lt;a href="w%3ALil%27%20Kim"&gt;Lil' Kim&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Kimberly Jones, was sentenced to one year and one day in prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine after lying to a grand jury. Jones had been questioned about the involvement of several of her acquaintances in a gunfight. Jones had testified before a grand jury that she did not see her manager the day of the altercation and claimed that she did not recognize a photo of one of her associates. Jones also said that she took "complete blame" for the same perjury committed by her assistant, Monique Dopwell.

The fight broke out in front of the "Hot 97" radio station in New York. Jones' entourage came across the rival rap group, Capone-N-Noreaga, and confronted the group about the song, "Bang, Bang", which contained an insult to Jones.

Three bomb explosions have hit &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; trains, and a further bomb destroyed a bus in the city centre. The &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan Police Service&lt;/a&gt; has initially confirmed that 33 people have been killed in the four explosions on &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;'s transport system this morning, and said the overall number of wounded was as high as 700, in what are believed to be terrorist attacks. (See later reports in the box at the side for later announcements made on following days.) 

The first reports were of an explosion at 08:49 &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;+1) on the &lt;a href="w%3AHammersmith%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Line"&gt;Hammersmith &amp; City Line&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20Street%20station"&gt;Liverpool Street station&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAldgate%20East%20tube%20station"&gt;Aldgate East&lt;/a&gt;. Explosions also occurred on a train between &lt;a href="w%3AKing%27s%20Cross%20St.%20Pancras%20tube%20station"&gt;King's Cross&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A%20Russell%20Square%20tube%20station"&gt;Russell Square&lt;/a&gt; and another at &lt;a href="w%3AEdgware%20Road%20tube%20station"&gt;Edgware Road&lt;/a&gt;. The explosions are currently being reported, and &lt;a href="British%20Prime%20Minister%20Tony%20Blair%20speaks%20about%20London%20bombings"&gt;described by Prime Minister Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, as being "terrorist attacks." Traces of explosives were found at two of the sites according to the BBC.

&lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed one explosion onboard a double decker red London bus travelling south outside the on . Police cannot confirm whether this bomb was intended for another train and accidentally detonated aboard the bus instead.

Pundits are speculating the attack was co-ordinated by &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Shane Brighton, an intelligence expert at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence, claims that, "If what we are looking at is a simultaneous bombing &amp;mdash; and it does look like that &amp;mdash; it would very certainly fit the classic al Qaeda methodology." Two militant Islamist groups are reported to have &lt;a href="Group%20claims%20responsibility%20for%20London%20explosions"&gt;claimed responsibility for the blasts&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Casualties</h3>

In a special news conference at 15:30 BST, July 7, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Brian Paddick of the Metropolitan Police confirmed 33 fatalities so far, 45 critical/serious injuries and approximately 300 minor injuries. 

At 08:51 BST a bomb exploded on a &lt;a href="w%3ACircle%20Line"&gt;Circle Line&lt;/a&gt; Underground train 91 metres/100 yards into the tunnel from Liverpool Street. Seven are known to be dead.

At 08:56 BST a bomb detonated on a &lt;a href="w%3APiccadilly%20Line"&gt;Piccadilly Line&lt;/a&gt; train between King's Cross and Russell Square. Twenty-one are dead; it is believed more bodies remain in the tunnel, which is one of the deepest on the Underground network.

At 09:17 BST a bomb exploded on another Circle Line train between Edgware Road Station and Paddington. The blast blew a hole in a wall, and another train was hit by debris from it. A third train is also involved. Five are known to be dead.

At 09:47 BST a No. 30 bus (Hackney - Marble Arch) blew up at the junction between Tavistock Square and Woburn Place outside the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Medical%20Association"&gt;BMA&lt;/a&gt; building. It has been estimated that thirteen people died.

Earlier, quoting the Associated Press, Yahoo News had reported "at least 40 people were killed and more than 350 wounded". Also, the same report says "two U.S. law enforcement officials said at least 40 people were killed".

<h3>Reports</h3>
The first reports that came in were from London's Liverpool Street station talking of an explosion on the Metropolitan Underground line and the station being evacuated. Later a BBC and a &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DUser_talk%3ADan100%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D96997"&gt;Wikinews reporter&lt;/a&gt; spoke of a bus being destroyed by a bomb blast in Tavistock Square outside the British Medical Association offices. 

The initial reports of explosions were believed to have been the result of power surges. This was because the first indication of any disturbance was the opening of circuit breakers in the Underground, which was observed in the control room. This is usually due to a power surge, but in this case the actual cause was damage to the track circuits by bombs.

At approximately 10:50 BST reports were made that there was an additional, as yet unidentified explosion along Houndsditch, near Liverpool Street Station. Police were also warning pedestrians at Russell Square that a series of controlled explosions would be made shortly.

BBC News 24 has reported additional unspecified incidents at &lt;a href="w%3ABrighton"&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALuton"&gt;Luton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASwindon"&gt;Swindon&lt;/a&gt;. These stations have been closed and there has been no official confirmation of the nature of the incidents, if any actually occurred.

The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair told London Live that there have been "events" at Edgware Road, Kings Cross, Liverpool Street, Russell Square, Aldgate East and Moorgate.

At 11:30 &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;+1) St. Mary's Hospital released a statement that they have admitted 4 critical, 8 severe and several minor injures. Injuries are limb damage, cuts, burns, head injuries and chest problems.

The exact causes of the explosions are still unknown. Initially, it was thought that it was some technical fault. However, the police later suspected terrorist attacks. Police are still unsure if the bombs were simply left in packages or whether there were some sort of suicide attacks.

According to the Associated Press, a senior Israeli official said Scotland Yard told Israel minutes before the explosions that it had received warnings of possible "terror attacks". Sky News says this has been denied by Scotland Yard. Sir Ian during his interview with Sky stated that there had been no specific intelligence. 

German news magazine ♡❤Der Spiegel♡❤ (as well as unconfirmed information from CIA) has reported that a letter from an organization calling itself "Secret organization - Al Qaeda in Europe" has appeared, claiming responsibility for the bombings. See &lt;a href="Group%20claims%20responsibility%20for%20London%20explosions"&gt;our related story&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

A broadcast interruption on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Thursday at 16:00 UTC said a group naming itself "Al Jihad Network in Europe" claimed responsibility for the bombings. 

A police spokeswoman has confirmed two deaths at Aldgate station. Television and radio reports are now saying there have been four separate incidents with up to 150 casualties, speculating that the blasts may be related to terrorist activity.

The Associated Press is reporting that a US law enforcement official has put the toll at 40 killed.

Emergency Services press conference at around 15:15 &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;+1) confirms at least 33 fatalities, not including those resulting from the incident on the number 30 bus.

The CBC reports at least 52 fatalities, including 17 from the incident on the number 30 bus according to media reports.

It has been reported that in the early stages of the attack, information was only distributed to civilians within the center of London, and authorities had a specific policy of not providing information to the global media, in case any information provided to the media could be used by additional terrorists to target vulnerable locations during an evacuation procedure. This was probably partly to blame for the early confusion amongst the media.

<h3>Effects of the incidents and responses from the emergency services</h3>

Emergency services are also attending King's Cross and &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20Street%20station"&gt;Liverpool Street Station&lt;/a&gt;.

The entire tube network and all buses within &lt;a href="w%3Azone%201"&gt;zone 1&lt;/a&gt; have been suspended and many buses are now being used to ferry the 'walking wounded' to the hospitals. The underground will be closed for an indefinite period of time, but according to Fox News Channel United States, the closure will last at least for all of today.

All emergency services are responding en-masse to a "major incident" and are responding only to life-threatening emergency calls. Patients are being turned away at hospitals to free room for those injured by the attacks. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Congestion%20Charge"&gt;London Congestion Charge&lt;/a&gt; has been suspended for the 7th and 8th of July.

The Jerusalem Post reports that the Army was dispatched to seal off the Israeli Embassy as Israel's Finance Minister is present for a conference. The army have reportedly been involved with rescues at . Police have denied this report (originally made on &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt;). 

The police have cordoned off roads around &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.co.uk/maps%3Fq%3Dupper%2Bwoburn%2Bplace%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.027799%2C0.063845%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;Upper Woburn Place&lt;/a&gt; following a massive explosion on a bus in the vicinity. Traffic is at a standstill in many places in the capital. &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20for%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/a&gt;'s security branch are reporting that police are advising everyone in London not to use any public transport and the &lt;a href="w%3ACabinet%20Office"&gt;Cabinet Office&lt;/a&gt; are advising staff to remain in offices until further notice. A further email sent to all staff by Defra's permanent secretary indicates that Charing Cross and Waterloo mainline railway stations have been closed down for police searches, and that other stations could close for similar reasons later today.

As at 09.30 BST, Kings Cross Thameslink was experiencing delays and overcrowding but no serious difficulties.

Businesses have been hit by the uncertainty of the events &amp;ndash; the &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100%20Index"&gt;FTSE&lt;/a&gt; had fallen almost 3.5% by 11.47UTC (&lt;a href="http%3A//finance.yahoo.com/q%3Fs%3D%255EFTSE%26amp%3Bd%3Dt"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), but started to recover a little by early afternoon. The value of the pound has dipped, and the London crude oil price has dropped. International markets are also suffering, with falls in share indexes felt as far as South Africa. See &lt;a href="Financial%20markets%20react%20to%20London%20blasts"&gt;our related story&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

According to Fox News Channel United States, all London schools are in lockdown and students are being kept in schools.

The Authorities are asking people in London to stay where they are, indoors if possible. Take inside any bins or bags of rubbish they have left out for collection, providing they check their contents first. Arrangements are also being made for when schools finish as schools have been asked to keep pupils safe inside until the usual school closing time.

The UK Highways Agency has stated that at the request of the police, the message "Avoid London - Turn on Radio" is being displayed on electronic motorway message signs on the &lt;a href="w%3AM25%20motorway"&gt;M25&lt;/a&gt; and other major routes approaching London.

The US Homeland Security Department asked authorities in major cities for heightened vigilance of major transportation systems. Department spokesman Roehrkasse indicated that the department had not received any indications of plans that this type of attack is planned in the United States. Later, the department raised the terror alert level to orange. See &lt;a href="Homeland%20Security%20raises%20transit%20terror%20alert"&gt;our related story&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

<h3>Official responses</h3>
A joint statement of the G8 leaders was made by Tony Blair at a press conference, also attended by US President George Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin. See &lt;a href="British%20Prime%20Minister%20Tony%20Blair%20speaks%20about%20London%20bombings"&gt;our related story&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

&lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;The Queen&lt;/a&gt; and many other world leaders have also issued statements. See &lt;a href="World%20leaders%20respond%20to%20London%20blasts"&gt;our related story&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

<h1>International stock markets tumble after UK blasts</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=International%20stock%20markets%20tumble%20after%20UK%20blasts&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Some stock markets fell sharply Thursday upon news that London was hit by a series of coordinated explosions.

The FTSE 100 Share Index fell over 150 points, over 2.8%. Among the hardest hit stocks were airlines, hospitality and insurance companies, according to reports. 

At 11:41UTC, the &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100"&gt;FTSE 100&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/fds/hi/business/market_data/stockmarket/3/default.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the yardstick used to measure the largest &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; companies on the stockmarket had fallen 3.85%, dropping by 201.2 points to 5028.40. British Airways and the Hilton group lead the losers with drops of over 7% each as investors speculated about a terrorist involvement in the attacks which could adversely affect tourism and travel.
In &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="w%3ACac%2040"&gt;Cac 40&lt;/a&gt; Index &lt;a href="http%3A//newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/fds/hi/business/market_data/stockmarket/1/default.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of France's forty largest companies took an even worse beating, dropping almost 4% by 11:47UTC by 170.37 points to 4109.58. Among the top losers was Axa Insurance which dropped by 5.4%.

Across the border in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="w%3ADax"&gt;Dax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/fds/hi/business/market_data/stockmarket/18/default.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had shed 3.15%, or 145.47 points, by 11:50UTC to 4470.02 points. Again among the top losers was a major insurer – Allianz which fell over 5%.

It seems that airlines and insurers have been hit the worst so far. &lt;a href="w%3ARyanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt; has dropped 7.73% or over €400m in value and &lt;a href="w%3AEasyJet"&gt;easyjet&lt;/a&gt; has shed 7.28%.

Shortly after news of the explosions spread to trading floors, shares of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; fell more than 6 percent. Other stocks affected included &lt;a href="w%3ACarnival%20Corporation"&gt;Carnival Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AInterContinental%20Hotels%20Group"&gt;InterContinental Hotels Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHilton%20Group"&gt;Hilton Group&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APrudential"&gt;Prudential&lt;/a&gt;.

The FTSE had recovered 116 points at 13:43 after it's initial fall of 206. Increased volume of FTSE futures on LIFFE has meant that many people have been able to profit from the fall.

The price of gold has jumped by 1% as investors seek a secure place for their money.

United States markets have fallen significantly as well, with the Dow having fallen by 65 points, the S&amp;P 500 7.57, and the NASDAQ 7.51 as of 13:43UTC.

&lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; has tightened its security, raising its security level to red, after the French government heard news of the &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20in%20London"&gt;London explosions&lt;/a&gt; on its transport network.

The French Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt;, convened the French ministers of defence, interior and foreign affairs to discuss the terrorist attacks. While giving no details, Villepin said that security was likely to be boosted on public transport and at important public buildings.

Expressing sympathy and solidarity for the terrorist attacks in London, Villepin said, "More than ever, democracies must rally together and show unity in the face of the terrorist threat. More than ever, we must show vigilance and determination."

President &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; also gave his condolences to British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom are currently attending the G8 summit in &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.

Chirac's spokesman said, "The president of the republic expressed to the British prime minister the horror caused by the tragic events in London and offered him sincere condolences."

Amid the confusion surrounding today's &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; blasts, officials have urged the public to avoid the city if possible to allow emergency services to operate more quickly.

All rail and underground stations remain closed, although efforts are being made to reopen them. Air links are now closed at &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Stansted%20Airport"&gt;Stansted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGatwick"&gt;Gatwick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20City%20Airport"&gt;London City&lt;/a&gt; airports.

Those trying to contact friends and family via mobile have struggled as the largest mobile networks, &lt;a href="w%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AO2%20plc"&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20SA"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt;, have all suffered from full capacity on several occasions this morning meaning voice calls failed. 

On the web, websites such as &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20for%20London"&gt;TfL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.g8.gov.uk"&gt;G8 2005&lt;/a&gt; website struggled for a short time at one point this morning under the strain of so many web users visiting them. The national grid has said that it has sustained no damage to the electricity network.
On the &lt;a href="http%3A//195.188.249.61/map/browse.cgi%3Fclient%3Dtcc%26amp%3BX%3D550000%26amp%3BY%3D150000%26amp%3Bwidth%3D500%26amp%3Bheight%3D300%26amp%3Bclient%3Dtcc%26amp%3Bgride%3D%26amp%3Bgridn%3D%26amp%3Bcoordsys%3Dgb%26amp%3Bscale%3D2000000%26amp%3Bin.x%3D1%26amp%3Bout.x%3D0%26amp%3Bup.x%3D0%26amp%3Bdown.x%3D0%26amp%3Bleft.x%3D0%26amp%3Bright.x%3D0%26amp%3BcurrentChk%3Dchecked%26amp%3BplannedChk%3D%26amp%3BvmsChk%3Dchecked%26amp%3BtrafficChk%3Dchecked%26amp%3Boverviewmap%3DGB_small%26amp%3BtrafficBox%3Don%26amp%3Bcurrent%3Don%26amp%3Bvms%3Don%23"&gt;Traffic England&lt;/a&gt; site run by the Highways Agency, London has been marked as a 'Closed area'.

The Royal Mail is warning customers that mail collections and deliveries across the UK will be disrupted because of the incidents. Royal Mail vehicles will not be moving in or out of London, or between Royal Mail sites in central London for the remainder of today. At least 25 per cent of the UK's mail moves through London, even if its end destination is elsewhere. Disruption may therefore be felt throughout the UK. Royal Mail expects to issue further information later today.

Bus services in Zone 1 have resumed as of 16:00 BST.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, in a short statement at midday BST from &lt;a href="w%3AGleneagles%2C%20Scotland"&gt;Gleneagles, Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, said that it was his intention to travel to &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; within a few hours to get a clearer picture of the events, before returning to the &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; summit this evening. Looking visibly shocked, he said that he believed it was "reasonably clear" that it was an act of terror, and that he hoped that the people of Britain could demonstrate that their will to overcome the events is greater than the terrorists' wish to cause destruction. He also said that his determination to "defend" the British way of life outweighed "extremist determination" to destroy it.

He also made it clear that all members of the G8 council wish to continue talks in his absence, he is currently on his way back to London to talk directly to police chiefs and ministers.

<h4>Text of the statement</h4>

<h3>Statement from the G8</h3>
At the G8 conference in &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh, Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister Blair made a statement at a press conference accompanied by other leading politicians from the G8 countries, including Presidents &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Chirac&lt;/a&gt;.

World leaders at the &lt;a href="w%3A31st%20G8%20summit"&gt;G8 Meeting at Gleneagles&lt;/a&gt; have made statements following the bomb attacks in London today.

Queen &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; offered this official statement following the attacks:

France's Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; made a short statement to offer moral and material support to the population of London. The "&lt;a href="w%3AVigipirate"&gt;Vigipirate plan&lt;/a&gt;" was raised from "orange" to "red".

Australia's Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; said the attacks were:

Canadian Prime Minister &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; made a statement from the G8 summit, stating:

US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; made a statement in Edinburgh, vowing to be "extra vigilant" in pursuit of terrorism.

In Spain, which saw attacks on Madrid last year, the Spanish Government said it would help the UK, "pursue the criminals who have carried out such a repugnant attack against a city that was celebrating its election as the host of the &lt;a href="w%3A2012%20Summer%20Games"&gt;Games of the XXX Olympiad&lt;/a&gt;". The European Parliament President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJosep%20Borrel"&gt;Josep Borrel&lt;/a&gt;, expressed his condolences, saying: 

Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh of India expressed outrage at terrorist attacks in London, saying these only ♡❤"underscore our contention that terrorism is a global phenomenon that needed to be tackled with concerted effort."♡❤ Recalling that India was the victim of a terrorist attack only two days ago when heavily armed men assaulted a shrine at Ayodhya before being killed, Dr Singh said the incidents demonstrated that ♡❤"global terrorism does not respect international boundaries and we all need to work together to counter it."♡❤

Danish Prime Minster &lt;a href="w%3AAnders%20Fogh%20Rasmussen"&gt;Anders Fogh Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; calls the attack in London "terrible": 

The Norwegian &lt;a href="w%3AHarald%20V%20of%20Norway"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt; telexed Queen Elisabeth II: 

Support for Great Britain came from the President of Serbia and the Prime Minister of Kosovo. The President of Serbia and Montenegro, &lt;a href="w%3ASvetozar%20Marovi%C4%87"&gt;Svetozar Marović&lt;/a&gt;, sent his condolences to Queen Elizabeth II and Tony Blair, and expressed solidarity of citizens of Serbia and Montenegro with the British people:

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; crashed his mountain bike into an unfortunate police officer in &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. 

Mr. Bush, who celebrated his 59th birthday last night was cycling on a bike around the &lt;a href="w%3AGleneagles%20Hotel"&gt;Gleneagles Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, where he is staying for the &lt;a href="w%3A31st%20G8%20summit"&gt;31st G8 summit&lt;/a&gt;, when he, perhaps partially due to the bad weather, crashed into one of the police officers responsible for his and the other leaders' safety. 

The officer had to be taken to the hospital having suffered a twisted ankle whilst Mr. Bush, who was wearing a helmet, only suffered minor bruises despite landing on asphalt. The president had to return to the hotel by van because the bike was too badly damaged.

Bush has been involved in two similar accidents during his presidency. In 2003, he fell off a &lt;a href="w%3ASegway"&gt;Segway&lt;/a&gt; personal transporter, and in 2004, he fell off a mountain bike.

German news magazine ♡❤Der Spiegel♡❤ reported today that a letter from an &lt;a href="w%3Aextremist"&gt;extremist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; organization calling itself "Secret Organisation Group of &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AJihad"&gt;Jihad&lt;/a&gt; Organisation" has appeared, a previously unheard-of organization, claiming responsibility for the explosions in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; today. The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; later released a statement, translated from &lt;a href="w%3AArabic"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, from the group. The text reads as follows:

♡❤In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate, may peace be upon the cheerful one and undaunted fighter, Prophet Muhammad, God's peace be upon him.♡❤

♡❤Nation of Islam and Arab nation: Rejoice for it is time to take revenge against the British Zionist Crusader government in retaliation for the massacres Britain is committing in Iraq and Afghanistan. The heroic mujahideen have carried out a blessed raid in London. Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters.♡❤

♡❤We have repeatedly warned the British Government and people. We have fulfilled our promise and carried out our blessed military raid in Britain after our mujahideen exerted strenuous efforts over a long period of time to ensure the success of the raid.♡❤

♡❤We continue to warn the governments of Denmark and Italy and all the Crusader governments that they will be punished in the same way if they do not withdraw their troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. He who warns is excused.♡❤

♡❤God says: "You who believe: If ye will aid (the cause of) Allah, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly.♡❤

The statement was published on &lt;a href="w%3AQal3ah"&gt;Qal3ah&lt;/a&gt;, an internet forum which has been used before for announcements by Al-Qaeda, though the validity of the claims are currently unconfirmed. At a press conference, the Metropolitan Police stated they had not received any claims of responsibility from any group.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;United States Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; has raised the terror alert level to "orange" for trains in reaction to the &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20in%20London"&gt;bombings of three subway trains and a bus in London&lt;/a&gt;.

The United States has a &lt;a href="w%3AHomeland%20Security%20Advisory%20System"&gt;five-level terror alert system&lt;/a&gt; in which orange is the second-highest level.

Homeland Security Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chertoff"&gt;Michael Chertoff&lt;/a&gt; asked citizens for increased vigilance and asked cities to increase their security on their transit systems. 

"Currently, the United States has no specific, credible information suggesting an imminent attack in the United States," says Chertoff.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, part of the Department of Homeland Security, has alerted stations in high-risk areas to stand 24/7 patrols.

In &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACapitol%20Hill%20police"&gt;Capitol Hill police&lt;/a&gt; announced plans to search buses, tour vans and larger vehicles traveling on the roads leading to the Capitol. 

In &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; today, local police stood guard at Muni and BART stations. &lt;a href="w%3AAmtrak"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt; rail lines released a statement saying that they are stepping up their security around their country-wide stations. Local sheriff dispatches have been seen patrolling even the smallest rail stations.

&lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; said in a web statement Thursday that it has killed &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;'s top envoy in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIhab%20al-Sherif"&gt;Ihab al-Sherif&lt;/a&gt;. 
The &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic terror group released a video showing a blindfolded al-Sherif identifying himself, but did not show his death.

Egypt's President &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Hosni Mubarak&lt;/a&gt; confirmed these reports, but did not say how the government had validated Al-Qaeda's claims.

Mr Al-Sherif, 51, had been serving in &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; as chief envoy since early June; he was abducted on 03 July while out buying a newspaper, eyewitnesses said. He was not accompanied by any security at that time.

Al-Sherif had also served as deputy envoy from 1999&amp;ndash;2003.

&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Romania"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACalin%20Popescu-Tariceanu"&gt;Calin Popescu Tariceanu&lt;/a&gt; announced his government is quitting yesterday, after facing the decisions of &lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20Court"&gt;Constitutional Court&lt;/a&gt; ruling that some of the laws pushed in a fast-forward manner through the Parliament were breaking the fundamental law in two minor articles, making them impossible to adopt. 

The laws were considered very important in the process of Romania's &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; integration and they were establishing new rules in the field of justice. Other laws related to the reparations for communist expropriation were adopted later as there was no objection regarding them. The government has already survived a vote of confidence in order to push the projects into full laws, and as a result was unable to ask for a second vote of confidence with the laws modified to satisfy the contitution.

Tariceanu and his ministers are saying that the Constitutional Court was partial, because the judges were previously members of the main opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3APartidul%20Social%20Democrat"&gt;Social-Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, which is allegedly trying to stage a scene of government incompetence. The second allegation is that the laws were meant to speed up the retirment of old judges, educated during communist years, a category which includes the Constitutional Court judges.

Tariceanu declared that he wants early elections, but outcome of this move is unpredictable, due to the tedious process the Romanian law established for it. Opposition parties claim this is a way for the current coalition to obtain more places in the parliament, and speak of a political crisis created artificially by the ruling coalition. All the parties in the parliament are supporting the integration of Romania in the EU in 1 January 2007, and say integration in 1 January 2008 represents a failure in politics of the other parties.

The Police sealed off Princes St while the bomb squad performed a controlled explosion on board an &lt;a href="Edinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; double-decker bus, following reports of a suspicious package on board. 

A block of Princes street was closed to the public from approximately 17:30, while investigations were carried out. Later a second controlled explosion was carried out in a store at the east end of Princes St.

All local shops and homes were evacuated, and as of 20:30 remained unable to access their property while continuing evaluation of the scene was carried out. Traffic approaching the area was diverted, and motorists urged to stay away from the area unless essential.

Following earlier blasts in London the Police treated the situation very seriously, but it later emerged to be a false alarm. The blockade follows several days of planned closures for marches surrounding the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMake%20Poverty%20History"&gt;Make Poverty History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="G8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; conference.

A Florida man is being charged with 3rd degree felony for logging into a private &lt;a href="w%3AWi-Fi"&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; (Wireless Fidelity) Internet access point without permission. Benjamin Smith III, 41, is set for a pre-trial hearing this month in the first case of its kind in the United States.

This kind of activity occurs frequently, but often goes undetected by the owners of these wireless access points (WAPs). Unauthorized users range from casual Web browsers, to users sending e-mails, to users involved in &lt;a href="w%3Apornography"&gt;pornography&lt;/a&gt; or even illegal endeavours.

According to Richard Dinon, owner of the WAP Smith allegedly broke into, Smith was using a laptop in an automobile while parked outside Dinon's residence.

There are many steps an owner of one of these access points can take to secure them from outside users. Dinon reportedly knew how to take these steps, but had not bothered because his "neighbors are older."

Amid news of a drop of the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20peso"&gt;Philippine peso&lt;/a&gt; for a sixth straight week, Philippine President &lt;a href="w%3AGloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday asked all members of the cabinet to resign, preparing the road for change in the administration.

In the past month the peso has fallen 3.1 percent due in part to accusations that Arroyo cheated in last year's elections, as well as accusations that her family members have been taking kickbacks from illegal gambling operations.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABangko%20Sentral%20ng%20Pilipinas"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt; may move to buy the peso in an attempt to stem the decline and raise lenders' reserve requirements so they have less money to bet against the currency.

While Arroyo was asking for the resignations, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima and other officials, including Tax Commissioner Guillermo Parayno, Customs Commissioner Bert Lina, Budget Secretary Emilia Boncodin and Trade Secretary Juan Santos, called for Arroyo's resignation. The text of their statement is available .

However, Arroyo refused, and while addressing the nation via radio she said "I am not resigning my office. To do so under circumstances that connote an &lt;a href="w%3AEDSA%20Revolution"&gt;Edsa&lt;/a&gt; 3 (the third people's revolution) would condemn any successor to the possibility of an Edsa 4, then an Edsa 5, and so on and so on, unless our political system were first reformed to make it more responsive to the people's will, such that changes in leadership come about in an orderly and stable manner..."

Arroyo said that the time had come to face the fact that the political system had degenerated so much that partisan agenda is coming before national interest.

She pointed to the huge emigration from the country as an indication of the large problems within, while endless scandals and conflict seem to plague the southeast Asian nation.

The President ended her address by promising to bring a resolution to all that has plagued the country.

The IOC meets later today to discuss the new Olympic Program.

The vote, held in &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, surprised some supporters of the sports, who believed that there were enough votes to retain them.

Later Police statements have confirmed a rise in the death toll from the &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;London bombings&lt;/a&gt;, which initial reports on July 7 had put at 33.

At 08:51 BST a bomb exploded on an &lt;a href="w%3AHammersmith%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Line"&gt;Hammersmith &amp; City Line&lt;/a&gt; Underground train 91 metres/100 yards into the tunnel from Liverpool Street. Seven are known to be dead.

At 08:56 BST a bomb detonated on a &lt;a href="w%3APiccadilly%20Line"&gt;Piccadilly Line&lt;/a&gt; train between King's Cross and Russell Square. Twenty-one are dead.

At 09:17 BST a bomb exploded on a &lt;a href="w%3ACircle%20Line"&gt;Circle Line&lt;/a&gt; train between Edgware Road Station and Paddington. The blast blew a hole in a wall, and another train was hit by debris from it. A third train is also involved. Five died.

At 09:47 BST a No. 30 bus (Hackney - Marble Arch) blew up at the junction between Tavistock Square and Woburn Place. Two people were killed.

Around seven hundred people were injured. Three hundred were taken to hospital by ambulance, while the remainder presented themselves.

Twenty-four hours after a series of bomb blasts rocked London, the city's transport system is returning to normal, although a &lt;a href="Security%20alerts%20in%20central%20London"&gt;series of security alerts&lt;/a&gt; have caused some disruption.

All the major train stations are now open, with the only service alteration being at King's Cross, where GNER is operating a revised service. Suburban services in and out of King's Cross are normal.

On the London Underground, services are running on most lines with only some delays. Four lines are still seriously affected though:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Piccadilly line: No service from Hyde Park Corner to Arnos Grove. Buses are running from Arnos Grove to Finchley Central to connect with Northern line services.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines: closed

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Metropolitan line: no trains running between Baker Street and Aldgate

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- District line: no service from High Street Kensington to Edgware Road

</ul>
The King's Cross St Pancras station is also closed.

On the roads, the London Congestion Charge has been suspended, although Transport for London is advising against driving in central London today.

Several roads remain closed as of 9.20am BST - the A11 (Aldgate Highstreet) and the A1211 at the A10 in Bishop's Gate are both shut to traffic. 

The A4200 (Eversholt Street) is closed between the junctions with the A501 (Euston Road) and the A40 (Vernon Place).

The A3212 (Millbank) is closed between the A3203 (Westminster) and the A202 (Vauxhall Bridge Road).

Finally, the B452 (Argyle Road / Drayton Green Road) is closed between Sutherland Road and Manor Road.

Outside of London, the motorway network is running well.

One Wikinews reporter in Central London noted how many more cyclists there were, especially in Hyde Park.

Euston, Liverpool Street Station, and Charing Cross train stations have all reopened after they were closed at some point after earlier alerts proved to be false alarms.

In a press conference this morning, the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan Police Service&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the death toll from yesterday's bombing has risen to "more than 50". (&lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;Initial reports&lt;/a&gt; had put it at 33, rising in &lt;a href="Death%20toll%20from%20London%20bombings%20rises%20to%2037"&gt;later reports&lt;/a&gt; to 37.) Police are unable to give an exact figure at this moment due to the difficulty of removing bodies, and believe the figure is likely to rise. Some bodies have yet to be recovered from the Piccadilly line train caught between Kings Cross and Russell Square.

However speaking at the press conference, Metropolitan Police chief Sir Ian Blair said he did not expect the death toll to reach three figures. The total number of casualties remains at 700, with 350 requiring hospital treatment. Twenty-two people remain in hospital in a serious condition, with one person dying.

Author of the &lt;a href="w%3ASasser%20worm"&gt;Sasser worm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASven%20Jaschan"&gt;Sven Jaschan&lt;/a&gt; (19), was convicted today for 
three cases of computer sabotage and four of illegal data modification, to which he had pleaded guilty at the start of his four-day trial. 

The regional court in Verden, Germany, condemned Jaschan to a 21 month suspended sentence. He is also expected to undertake 30 hours of community service and will not have to pay court costs. Public prosecutor Lutz Gaebel had called for 200 hours of community service and a two-year suspended sentence.

Jaschan, an 18 year old computer science student at the time, was arrested in May 2004 after international investigations were launched. He was then released pending trial. The arrest followed tip offs to the police, which may have been prompted by Microsoft's offer of US$250,000 for information leading to the arrest of the person responsible. He was tried as a minor since he authored Sasser at the age of 17. The trial was held behind closed doors, with details reported to the press by Katharina Krützfeldt, the court spokesperson.

The &lt;a href="w%3Acomputer%20worm"&gt;worm&lt;/a&gt; began to spread in April 2004 on Windows XP and Windows 2000 operating systems which had not been patched with &lt;a href="http%3A//www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-011.mspx"&gt;MS04-011&lt;/a&gt;. The worm hit companies and home users worldwide, with reported cases at &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20Air%20Lines"&gt;Delta Air Lines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHM%20Coastguard"&gt;HM Coastguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGoldman%20Sachs"&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADeutsche%20Post"&gt;Deutsche Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A%20RailCorp"&gt;Australia Railcorp&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;. 

The BBC reported that the worm had affected millions worldwide, and Heise noted that experts had estimated several million euro worth of damage.

According to various sources Jaschan was 'fingered' by a couple of his friends who were after the 'Microsoft Anti-Virus Reward' of $250,000 US Dollars. According to Microsoft's Web site, rewards of $250,000 can still be collected for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for launching the MyDoom.B worm, the Sobig virus and the MSBlast.A [aka Blaster] worm. Furthermore, Microsoft have another $4 Million in hand for rewards required for future malicious software authors they want to have arrested and prosecuted.

<h1>Blair: G8 leaders announce $50 billion aid increase; talks on trade and climate change</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Blair%3A%20G8%20leaders%20announce%20%2450%20billion%20aid%20increase%3B%20talks%20on%20trade%20and%20climate%20change&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced at a press conference today the results of the &lt;a href="w%3A31st%20G8%20summit"&gt;31st G8 summit&lt;/a&gt; in Gleneagles, Scotland.

Blair, the seven other leaders of the &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; nations, and the leaders of Algeria, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania stood on the step of Gleneagles to address the press. The Prime Minster said "We speak today in the shadow of terrorism but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve."

Among the decisions made was a commitment to another $48 billion (£28.8 billion) per year by 2010 in aid which Blair says can indeed, in time and if properly seen through, will make "very substantial progress" towards "making poverty history". The deal was secured following a last-minute commitment by Japan.

Half of this aid will be sent to Africa. Some analysts have raised fears that African economies will not be able to absorb so much aid so quickly, and that the money could fuel corruption.

Only $20 billion of this deal is new money - the rest has already been pledged on previous occasions.

The US, Germany and Italy rejected a plan by Blair to double aid immediately by borrowing against future aid budgets.

"It isn't the end of poverty in Africa, but it is the hope that it can be ended," Blair said. "It isn't all everyone wanted, but it is progress - real and achievable progress. It is the definitive expression of our collective will to act in the face of death and disease and conflict that is preventable"

There will also be further pushes towards ending the debt of the poorest nations, but only confirmed a &lt;a href="G8%20finance%20ministers%20agree%20on%20deal%20to%20relieve%20debts%20of%2018%20poorest%20nations"&gt;earlier deal&lt;/a&gt; to cancel the debts of 18 countries.

Campaigners have welcomed the news, but have said that it does not go far enough, falling short of the hopes of the people who had embraced the &lt;a href="w%3ALive%208"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMake%20Poverty%20History"&gt;Make Poverty History&lt;/a&gt; drives. 

"Today the G8 have chosen not to do all that campaigners insist is necessary to free people trapped in the prison of poverty," the Make Poverty History read this evening. "But more action is urgently needed if they are to play their role in bringing about real change for the world's poorest people."

The leaders also pledged to end farm subsidies - but did not say by when. However, they called for talks on trade liberalisation to reach a conclusion by the end of 2006. 

The Prime Minister was cautious not to "over-sell" the decisions that had been made but he was resolute and confident in the possibilities for progress in the future.

Less progress was made in the realm of climate change with countries agreeing that climate change was a problem but without any concrete decisions. Talks will be held on the matter, particularly with China and India, beginning in November.

The G8 have also announced a $3 billion aid package for the Palestinian Authority.

450 sheep leapt to their deaths in the &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; village of Gevas. The chain reaction started when one sheep went over the cliff, enticing nearly fifteen hundred others to follow. According to the Aksam newspaper, by the time the 450 had died, the pile of sheep carcasses at the bottom of the cliff had apparently grown large enough to cushion the fall somewhat, resulting in the saving of the other 1550. 

"There's nothing we can do. They're all wasted," said Nevzat Bayhan, a member of one of the 26 families whose sheep had been lost. "Every family had an average of 20 sheep," continued Abdullah Hazar, "but now only a few families have sheep left. It's going to be hard for us."

The sheep were worth an estimated $100k USD, which is a significant amount of money in a country whose average &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGross%20domestic%20product"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is only on average $2,700 USD per head.

&lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; braces for the arrival of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Dennis"&gt;Hurricane Dennis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJeb%20Bush"&gt;Jeb Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astate%20of%20emergency"&gt;state of emergency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on a televised press conference Friday afternoon at 2:00 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEST"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Dennis weakened slightly after making landfall in &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and now packs sustained winds of 145 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amiles%20per%20hour"&gt;miles per hour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Thousands have fled the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Keys"&gt;Florida Keys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; under a mandatory evacuation order where the storm is expected to strike sometime this evening.

The storm wobbled slightly after arriving in Cuba where it claimed up to three lives. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmateur%20radio"&gt;Ham radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; operators reported that most power lines are down in the province of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACienfuegos%20Province"&gt;Cienfuegos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where a major seaport is located on Cuba's southern coast. 

According to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, 18 lives were claimed by the storm in &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt; yesterday when it passed over that island nation.

The storm is expected to continue on a north-westerly path that will brush the southern tip of Florida and head up the state's &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; coastline, where warm gulf waters could fuel the storm and raise it to a Category 5 storm.

Speculation has begun on the possibility of higher gas prices as gulf oil refineries are threatened.

Hurricane Dennis comes quickly on the heels of 3-day ago &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Storm%20Cindy"&gt;Tropical Storm Cindy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in what is noted as record storm activity for this early in the hurricane season.

The first known case of bird flu in the Philippines has occurred at an isolated farm in a town just north of the capital Manila, the Philippine government has confirmed.

Agricultural Secretary Arthur Yap said it is not clear whether it is the deadly H5N1 strain responsible for the deaths of more than 50 people in Asia since 2003 but confirmed that a strain of flu, H5, had been found in ducks.

Mr. Yap told a news conference, "It is a low-risk flu strain found in three healthy ducks and the risk to human health is almost nil."

Transportation and sales of live poultry within a three-kilometre radius of the affected farm has been banned by the government.

The Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Ian Blair, has announced that thirteen people died when a bomb exploded on a bus in Tavistock Square. Initially, only two people were thought to have been killed.

All bodies have now been removed from the wrecked bus. The rear of the bus and the roof of the upper deck was torn off in the blast. The bomb was either on the floor or resting on a seat at the rear of the upper deck when it detonated. It is thought that it contained less than 10 pounds (5kg) of explosives.

Upholding a previous decision by a lower court, the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis ruled that the federal Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act is unconstitutional because it does not provide an exception for the health of the woman.

While the ban does provide an exception for the life of the mother it does not for the health of the mother.

"When `substantial medical authority' supports the medical necessity of a procedure in some instances, a health exception is constitutionally required," Judge Kermit Bye of the 8th Circuit wrote in the opinion. 

"In effect, we believe when a lack of consensus exists in the medical community, the Constitution requires legislatures to err on the side of protecting women's health by including a health exception." Judge Bye went on to say.

The decision upheld a previous ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf of Lincoln, Neb. Federal judges in New York and San Francisco have also ruled in decisions overturning the ban. The decisions have been appealed and are expected to eventually be addressed by the Supreme Court.

President Bush signed the ban in 2003, but due to legal challenges it has not been enforced.

Security in &lt;a href="w%3ACopenhagen"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, was tightened after &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;the attacks on London&lt;/a&gt; Thursday when 49 people were killed. Denmark supported the U.S.-led war on &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and fears of an attack are rising. "It's not a question of if we'll be attacked, but when" said security specialist Mikkel Vedby at the University in Copenhagen.

"This is how the world has become in the 21st century. There are people out there that want to harm us. They are at war with us and it seems we're in war with them. We might be safe tomorrow or the next ten years." said Mikkel Vedby. He later added that Denmark needed to get ready to face a major terrorist attack.

&lt;a href="Group%20claims%20responsibility%20for%20London%20explosions"&gt;The group that has claimed responsibility for the attacks on London&lt;/a&gt;, the "Secret Organisation Group of Al-Qaeda of Jihad Organisation", issued a statement yesterday where attacks on countries that supported the "&lt;a href="w%3Acrusade"&gt;crusades&lt;/a&gt;" against &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; are threatened. Denmark is on that list. The statement has not been verified.

<h3>Denmark safe</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3AAnja%20Dalgaard-Nielsen"&gt;Anja Dalgaard-Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, a security expert from the &lt;a href="http%3A//transatlantic.sais-jhu.edu/Staff%2520Bios/anja"&gt;Danish Institute for International Studies&lt;/a&gt;, disagrees and says Denmark is not in danger of being a terrorist target because radical Islamic groups there are too small to be able to organise an attack. "It is true we are in a similar position as the UK. The Danish government does work closely with the United States and the United Kingdom governments because of Iraq and Afghanistan."

As in other countries, security in Denmark has been stepped up at airports, rail stations, ports, borders, and other public places.

Residents along the US Gulf Coast evacuated or hunkered down Saturday as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Dennis"&gt;Hurricane Dennis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lashed the Florida Keys with wind and sheets of rain and churned along a path toward areas still rebuilding from last year's storms.

More than 1.4 million people from the Florida Panhandle to Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi are under evacuation orders. Landfall was expected Sunday afternoon anywhere from the Florida Panhandle to southeast Louisiana.

At 6am CDT July 10, the center of Hurricane Dennis was located near latitude 28.2 north, longitude 86.2 west.

Dennis is moving north-northwest at about 15 mph.

As of 6am CDT July 10, according to the National Weather Service, maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph, making Dennis a category four hurricane on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaffir-Simpson%20Scale"&gt;Saffir-Simpson Scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The National Weather Service is calling this an extremely dangerous storm.
Hurricane force winds extend outward 125-140 miles from the center. Rainfall totals of 12 inches are expected along the United States Gulf Coast, meaning flash flooding will be a concern in many areas. Storm surges in excess of 12-14 feet are expected along the Gulf Coast from the Florida panhandle west through Louisiana. Isolated tornadoes are possible throughout Florida tonight and tomorrow.

Dennis churned into Cuba packing winds in excess of 145 mph, leaving homes destroyed, and leading to reliance on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmateur%20radio"&gt;ham radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a means of communication. According to CNN, Dennis caused at least 10 deaths throughout Cuba. The Cuban Meteorological Service reported destruction to 85% of its communication infrastructure. 
Flooding led to widespread problems in Haiti, where the storm claimed 22 lives according to CNN. Mudslides, triggered by the large volume of rain blocked roads and sent 3,000 people to seek shelter in designated storm shelters in Jamaica. 

When the storm moved across Cuba, oil companies began shutting down rigs in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and residents in coastal areas of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; started boarding up windows and preparing for the worst. The storm is expected to make landfall in the United States sometime Sunday evening, following a similar path as Hurricane Ivan last year. Current paths indicate the Florida Keys will be brushed by on the way to the Florida panhandle, coming ashore near Pensacola, FL.

<h2>Stage 1 - Fromentine - Noirmoutier-en-l'Ile 19.0km Individual Time Trial</h2>

 1. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Zabriskie"&gt;David Zabriskie&lt;/a&gt; (USA) Team CSC 20:51&lt;br&gt;

David Zabriskie dominates the course and the competition to edge out Armstrong by 2 seconds. Most of Armstrong's challengers finish over a minute down. &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Ullrich"&gt;Jan Ullrich&lt;/a&gt; is demoralised by having Lance, who started 1 minute after him, catch and overtake him.

<h2>Stage 2 - Challans - Les Essarts 181.5km</h2>

 1. &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Boonen"&gt;Tom Boonen&lt;/a&gt; (Belgium) Quick.Step 3:51:31&lt;br&gt;

Tom Boonen dominates the first bunch sprint of this years Tour as he powered away to finish a bike length in front of his two biggest rivals for the Green Points Jersey in Hushovd and McEwen.

<h2>Stage 3 - La Chataigneraie - Tours 212.5km</h2>

 1. Tom Boonen (Belgium) Quick.Step 4:36:09&lt;br&gt;

Robbie McEwen crossed the line in third place but was relegated to last place after the Jury of Commissaires examined the finish in which McEwen had leaned on fellow Australian heavily with his arm and head at over 60 km/h. Tom Boonen wins easily in front of Peter Wrolich and O'Grady.

<h2>Stage 4 - Tours - Blois 67.5km Team Time Trial</h2>

 1. Discovery Channel 1:10:39&lt;br&gt;

Discovery Channel takes the stage and Lance pulls on the ♡❤maillot jaune♡❤ (yellow jersey) for the first time this year after Dave Zabriskie from Danish Team CSC crashs within the last couple of kilometres of the stage. Team CSC had been 6 seconds in front of Discovery at the 45.8km time check in Onzain.

<h2>Stage 5 - Chambord - Montargis 183.0km</h2>

 1. Robbie McEwen (Australia) Davitamon-Lotto 3:46:00&lt;br&gt;

Robbie McEwen edges out rival Tom Boonen by half a wheels length. His victory is a consolation after being relegated in Stage 3 putting him behind in the chase for the sprinters Green Jersey.

<h2>Stage 6 - Troyes - Nancy 199.0km</h2>

 1. &lt;a href="w%3ALorenzo%20Bernucci"&gt;Lorenzo Bernucci&lt;/a&gt; (Italy) Fassa Bortolo 4:12:52&lt;br&gt;

A stage dominated by rain and a 175km breakaway by veteran Frenchman &lt;a href="w%3AChristophe%20Mengin"&gt;Christophe Mengin&lt;/a&gt; of the Francaise des Jeux team. Mengin bravely held on to a narrow lead of about 10 seconds as the peleton approached the final kilometre. Bernucci and Vinokourov attacked just prior to this point and had almost bridged the gap when Mengin went down in a slippery right hand bend. Bernucci avoided Mengin and stayed upright, while Vinokourov slowed and pulled a foot from his pedals. As the peleton rounded the same corner almost all of the 20 riders in the peleton went down. Bernucci held on to take out the first win of his pro career, while Vinokourov got his foot back in and maintained his second place. Vinokourov efforts enable him to gain a 7 second time split plus a time bonus of 12 second moving him up in to third in the General Classification.

<h2>Stage 7 - Lunéville - Karlsruhe 228.5km</h2>

 1. Robbie McEwen (Australia) Davitamon-Lotto 5:03:45&lt;br&gt;
Australian Robbie McEwen wins his second stage of this years Tour winning in a long straight bunch sprint in Karlruhe in Germany. The win levels the score between Robbie and Tom Boonen each with 2 stage wins so far. Earlier in the day &lt;a href="w%3AFabian%20Wegmann"&gt;Fabian Wegmann&lt;/a&gt; a German on German team Gerolsteiner lead a solo breakaway from the peleton to pick up points in the King of the Mountains competition. Even though he was caught by the pack before the finish it was a successful day for Wegmann as he claimed the polka dot jersey for the King of the Mountains leader and also lead the tour as it pass over the border into to Germany. The tour returns into France today with the stage finishing in Gerardmer.

&lt;a href="MSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; translator Jacob Keryakes has stated that the claim of responsibility for the London bombings of July 7, supposedly made by a militant &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslamism"&gt;Islamist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; group, contains an error in one of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQur%27an"&gt;Quranic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; verses that it cites, suggesting that the claim may be phony. "This is not something &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaida"&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; would do," he said. 

The claim of responsibility by ♡❤The Secret Organization of al-Qaida in Europe♡❤ for the London attacks has also been questioned on the grounds that the rhetoric is not consistent with militant Islamic ideology. The statement asked "the Nation of Islam and the Nation of Arabism to rejoice" about the attacks. 

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Islamic expert Mishari al-Thaidi wrote in an essay published Saturday in the London-based Arabic ♡❤Asharq Al Awsat♡❤ newspaper: "What strikes attention here is addressing the Arab nation. The Jihadists have never recognized Arab nationalism. This is close to pan-Arab or Baathist terminology."

The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Pirates"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; rallied to beat the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mets"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; in the first game of a home series at &lt;a href="w%3APNC%20Park"&gt;PNC Park&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, July 8, 2005.

The Pirates went into the bottom of the 9th inning down, 5-1, and gave up the first two outs but managed to load the bases. The Mets then put in their closer, Looper, against &lt;a href="w%3ATike%20Redman"&gt;Tike Redman&lt;/a&gt;. Redman, after fouling off several pitches in a 11-pitch at bat, finally hit one to bring the score to 5-3. Looper gave up 4 runs total in the bottom of the ninth, but managed to get out of the inning with the score tied. In the top of the 10th, the Pirates closer, &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Mesa"&gt;José Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, allowed no hits. Then, in the bottom of the tenth, &lt;a href="w%3AHumberto%20Cota"&gt;Humberto Cota&lt;/a&gt; hit a line drive with men on first and second with two outs to score the winning run.

<h1>Video game's secret sex scenes spark outrage</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Video%20game%27s%20secret%20sex%20scenes%20spark%20outrage&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institute%20on%20the%20Media%20and%20the%20Family"&gt;National Institute on the Media and the Family&lt;/a&gt; (NIMF), a media watchdog group based in &lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Minneapolis, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; issued a "nationwide parental alert" today. This came after finding out about hidden sex scenes in the popular &lt;a href="w%3Avideo%20game"&gt;video game&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto%3A%20San%20Andreas"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The game also has been criticised as being too violent. This is not limited to ♡❤San Andreas♡❤: the entire series has come under fire for its content, mostly the last two games, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto%203"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 3&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto%3A%20Vice%20City"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The sex scenes come in the form of a "mini-game" in which the player controls the male with the task of maximising his cohort's "excitment." The hidden game in GTA: San Andreas is not advertised or easy to find but can be unlocked by modifying the game using a program which has been widely available on the Internet for weeks. But for NIMF and the &lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Software%20Ratings%20Board"&gt;Entertainment Software Ratings Board&lt;/a&gt; (ESRB), the organization which rates video games and rated GTA: San Andreas &lt;a href="w%3AESRB"&gt;'M' for Mature&lt;/a&gt;, the hidden mini-game came as a surprise. As such, the ESRB has launched an investigation into the matter.
To unlock the hidden sex mini-game on the Playstation 2 requires an &lt;a href="w%3AAction%20Replay"&gt;Action Replay&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AGameShark"&gt;Gameshark&lt;/a&gt;. These devices cannot transfer new content to a console but can enable content already contained on the game disc. The presence of this minigame on an unmodified retail version implies that it was created by the game's creators rather than hackers or the mod community.

&lt;a href="w%3ARockstar%20Games"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;, the game's publisher, refused to comment on whether the sex scenes were inserted by their programmers. Rockstar Games has also said, "We thoroughly support the work of the ESRB, and believe that it has an exemplary record of rating games and promoting understanding of video game content. We also feel confident that the investigation will uphold the original rating of the game, as the work of the mod community is beyond the scope of either publishers or the ESRB."

In the game the character may have girlfriends, and at a certain point in his stats he can entertain his girlfriend with some "coffee". However, the "hot coffee" modification unlocks the secret sex scenes after the two share a drink.

The sex scene portrays &lt;a href="w%3Aoral%20sex"&gt;oral sex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Acoitus"&gt;coitus&lt;/a&gt;, but genitals are not shown. A video of the secret sex scene can be found here&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2673401"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (warning: contains mature content).

It's interesting to note that modifying a video game's source code is a violation of the software licensing agreement. Rockstar announced that it may pursue legal proceedings against Action Replay, whose device enables the hacking of the console version of San Andreas. When it comes right down to it, its much easier (and quicker) to find free adult content on the internet, or download pornographic movies from a P2P network, than it is to crack a video game.

Rockstar Games may be subject to a &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20Recall"&gt;Mandatory Recall&lt;/a&gt;.

The University of Alberta is set to expand into the heart of Edmonton's downtown with plans now in place to purchase the aging Hudson's Bay building on Jasper Avenue between 102nd Street and 103rd Street. The deal, which is yet to be approved by the University's Board of Governors, could result in students starting classes in the building as early as September 2006.

The building has been a huge vacancy in the downtown core, with only the broadcasting corporation &lt;a href="w%3ACHUM%20Limited"&gt;CHUM Limited&lt;/a&gt; using any space. University of Alberta President Indira Samarasekera has said there are no plans to ask the company, which owns 91.7 The Bounce and A-Channel to move.

The deal would also solve the University's space crunch. The total University population is growing much faster than the number of facilities required to support it, so expanding beyond the current campus makes sense. Establishing a presence downtown will also help the University and it's many spin off companies.

The University has not yet decided how the project would be funded, but is currently looking at a number of options, including partnerships with all three levels of government.

Philip Alston, an official with the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; is decrying a &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;n court decision to sentence a 50-year-old man to death by &lt;a href="w%3Astoning"&gt;stoning&lt;/a&gt; after he admitted to having sex with another man. Reports have not named the individual.

The incident in question happened after the 50-year-old man was acquitted of charges that he had sexual relations with a much younger man. During further questioning, the judge asked the accused if he ever had sex with any other men. 

Upon answering yes, the judge convicted the man of &lt;a href="w%3Asodomy"&gt;sodomy&lt;/a&gt; and sentenced him to death by stoning.

Nigeria, the most populous African country, is one of many countries that has started to adopt &lt;a href="w%3ASharia"&gt;Sharia&lt;/a&gt;, or traditional &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; law as detailed in the &lt;a href="w%3AKoran"&gt;Koran&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2000, 12 of Nigeria's northernmost states have adopted Sharia codes for their courtrooms. Under Islamic law, &lt;a href="w%3Ahomosexual"&gt;homosexual&lt;/a&gt; conduct is a crime punishable by death.

"Sodomy cannot be considered one of the most serious crimes for which, under international law, the death penalty can be prescribed. The punishment is wholly disproportionate," Alston, U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, said in a written statement Friday.

Nigeria's southern states are mostly &lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; and do not follow Sharia law.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — A rally in San Francisco's &lt;a href="w%3AMission%20District"&gt;Mission District&lt;/a&gt; to protest the current &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; summit in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; turned violent Friday as protestors turned on police officers and empty storefronts. Both police and protestors charge the other side with violence. 

At least one police officer was rushed to a nearby hospital with head wounds. Other injuries have yet to be reported. The California city, widely considered a &lt;a href="w%3Aprogressive"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; bastion in the U.S., has since 2003 allowed impromptu, unlicensed rallies and protests where police are trained not to interfere with protestors unless public safety is threatened.

The protesters began their rally at 7:47 p.m. at the corner of 16th and Mission streets in San Francisco near the &lt;a href="w%3AWells%20Fargo"&gt;Wells Fargo&lt;/a&gt; bank. Reportedly, in less than an hour 150 people had gathered at the corner. 

By 8:51 p.m., more than 200 people began to move down the street towards 23rd and Mission streets through the heart of San Francisco's &lt;a href="w%3ALatino"&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt; enclave. Since the protestors failed to notify the city of their march and failed to get a permit, police told the marchers that the street march was illegal, asking the protesters to move to the sidewalk. 

They began to move up 24th towards Valencia, where the first arrest was made of a protestor setting off illegal fireworks. Protesters who didn't know the specifics, heard of the arrest and started to step off of the sidewalk and run to avoid police. At 9:14 p.m. organizers called for a regroup at 16th and Mission. 

Most people went to regroup, though some stayed behind. Windows were broken at Wells Fargo, &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20America"&gt;Bank of America&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AKFC"&gt;KFC&lt;/a&gt; restaurant as well as other corporate targets, labeled as symbols of global capitalism. 
American flag burnings re-energized the group and trash cans were lit on fire. Protestors then moved newspaper stands into the street to create barricades against police cars. 

Later, a police car was believed to have been set on fire due to a collision with a protester's sign. It turned out that it had only been a red smoke bomb. But the officer was beaten by protestors. The protest dispersed by 11:23 p.m. after an ambulance arrived to take the police officer to a nearby hospital. 

Organizers of the protest reportedly claimed theirs was not just an anti-G8 protest, though they were the main target. A group calling itself "&lt;a href="w%3AAnarchist%20Action"&gt;Anarchist Action&lt;/a&gt;" said that the protest was also march against capitalism and gentrification in San Francisco.

24-year-old Dutchman Pieter Weening takes out the eighth stage of the &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; to Gérardmer by millimetres over German &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Kl%C3%B6den"&gt;Andreas Klöden&lt;/a&gt;. 

Weening joined a breakaway just as the route crossed the border to return to &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; after starting the day in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Weening was caught by Klöden just before he reached the summit of the Col de la Schlucht with 15 km to the finish. 

Weening and Klöden worked together to hold off the 30 strong pack by 27 seconds. Weening sat in Klöden's slipstream as they approached the line, and pulled out at the last moment to pip the German on the line by millimetres.

After a press conference in London from the Metropolitan Police and Transport for London, more details are emerging about the attacks in London on Thursday.

Data from the Underground system's power and control systems have revealed that all three bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other, at 8.50am, with the managing director of Transport for London, Tim O'Toole saying the bombs went "bang bang bang, very close together".

The first bomb to detonate was on the Liverpool Street train soon after it left for Aldgate on the Circle line, seconds before the others. The blast tripped out the power system, visible in the control room. The first call the police received that morning reported "a bang" at Aldgate East, coming within a minute of the blast.

The Edgware Road train, leaving for Paddington and also on the Circle, exploded opposite a train coming from the other direction, making people think at first that it was a derailment. The first call to the Police spoke not of an explosion, but of a person falling under the wheels of the train. The confirmation of a bomb did not come until 9.17am, but by that time the emergency services were already on scene.

Transport for London's new ♡❤TrackerNet♡❤ software is fully opertational on the Circle line, which allows for precise tracking of trains, but is not yet fully installed on the Piccadilly line. The first indication of the Piccadilly line bomb was when the tunnel telephone system wires were cut by the blast, an event logged by other software. The cutting of the lines then tripped out the track current. The tunnel itself suffered only slight damage and is safe, but the train - which was packed with commuters heading for Russell Square - is very badly damaged.

London Underground declared a 'code Amber' within minutes, moving trains to platforms and opening all doors. A 'code Red' - full evacuation - was set at around 9.15am. O'Toole described the decision to evacuate as being "very grave, not taken lightly". When questioned as to whether everything possible had been done on the day to save lives, the managing director of Transport for London was "very proud" of the choices made that morning.

As investigations continue, all bodies have been removed from the sub-surface Circle line trains, but the carriages themselves are still in situ while a painstaking forensic investigation takes place.

Currently, work is on-going to retrieve bodies and forensic evidence from the carriage of the train in the deep tunnel of the Piccadilly line near King's Cross. Teams of rescue workers looking for human remains are working alongside forensics experts in a "meticulous" search to find evidence.

Conditions are described as being very difficult, with high temperatures and lots of dust. Work was halted over Friday night when conditions became too bad, and resumed this morning. Efforts have been made to improve the ventilation.

Work will continue throughout tonight and possibly into Sunday. The exact number of bodies still in the wrecked carriage is unknown.

Access from King's Cross is impossible, so workers are taking the longer route from Russell Square station to get to the front of the train.

Police have revealed that the bombs were 'high explosives' - not homemade. However they are declining to be specific about their composition as the information could be useful when they interrogate suspects.

Police will not confirm or deny if any parts of a timer have been found, but have said that "any device will now be in a million pieces". Police believe the use of timers more likely than suicide bombings as the blasts were so closely timed, but are not ruling out anything.

Today &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Walt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;The Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt; issued a joint statement with business partners &lt;a href="w%3ARoy%20E.%20Disney"&gt;Roy E. Disney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Gold"&gt;Stanley Gold&lt;/a&gt; to the media, as a show of reunion between the two camps after nearly three years of hostility. 

Roy E. Disney, son of company co-founder &lt;a href="w%3ARoy%20O.%20Disney"&gt;Roy O. Disney&lt;/a&gt; and nephew of the company namesake &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt;, had resigned from his job as chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney%20Feature%20Animation"&gt;Feature Animation&lt;/a&gt; at the company after experiencing difficulty with the company's board of directors, many of whom were biased towards company CEO &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Eisner"&gt;Michael Eisner&lt;/a&gt;'s view of what direction the company should take. 

Eisner is due to retire from the company this September, and the talks with Disney and Gold are believed to have been led by Eisner's successor, &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Iger"&gt;Bob Iger&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently President and COO of the company. Iger has shown great interest in building relationships back up with many companies who have refused to work with Disney until Eisner leaves, such as &lt;a href="w%3APixar"&gt;Pixar Animation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Lucas"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt;.

Large scores of Disney fans had hoped Roy would read the &lt;a href="w%3ADisneyland"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; Dedication Speech on the theme park's fiftieth birthday next week, which was originally read by Walt on the park's opening day, but Roy had already entered an annual sailing race from &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;.

Police have revealed that the Tavistock Square bus bomb did not explode until nearly an hour after the bombs on the Underground system detonated.

The bomb exploded at 9.47am, while all three Tube bombs exploded within &lt;a href="London%20Tube%20bombs%20went%20%27bang%20bang%20bang%2C%20very%20close%20together%27"&gt;50 seconds of each other&lt;/a&gt; at 8.50am.

Police are looking into "every possibility" as to why the bomb exploded such a long time after the others, and are not ruling anything in or out.

However they have stated that the bomb, consisting of 5kg of high explosives, was in a bag on the floor or on a seat at the rear of the upper deck - and not strapped to a person.

At the scene of the blast itself a meticulous finger tip search is taking place to find evidence. The roof of the bus has been taken away for a thorough forensic examination.

The bus itself will be removed in due course.

The bus was fitted with an internal CCTV system, but it has not yet been stated if it was working. However the bus was seen by numerous traffic cameras as it made its journey that morning, and police are reviewing hours of footage.

&lt;a href="Thirteen%20people%20died%20in%20London%20bus%20bombing"&gt;Thirteen people&lt;/a&gt; died in the blast outside the British Medical Association building.

After scouring the &lt;a href="Caribbean"&gt;Caribbean islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Dennis"&gt;Hurricane Dennis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; moved on toward the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf coast&lt;/a&gt; but not before its deadly fury was unleashed upon the region's many island nations.

The fury of Dennis overnight wracked the area with torrential flood, causing rains, dangerous &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arip%20tide"&gt;rip tides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , tidal swells, and winds up to 175 miles per hour. According to reports from humanitarian aid organizations, at least 10 died in &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and 22 in &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;. As of 9 July 2005 18:06 (UTC), reports of dead and injured from other Caribbean countries had not been reported.

Cuba, which has a national emergency response program in the event of Hurricanes, evacuated 660,000 people from the eastern part of the island, which was considered to be the most vulnerable part of the country. But Saturday morning, president &lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; confirms in a national broadcast that at least 10 Cubans died as a result of the storm. Dennis slammed into Cuba's southern coastal province of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACienfuegos%20Province"&gt;Cienfuegos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Friday afternoon with Category 4 force winds. It emerged on the north side of Cuba considerably weakened to Category 1.
In nearby &lt;a href="Jamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;, although the island was spared the full force of Dennis, rains and tidal swells caused widespread flooding in 28 communities. Hundreds of families faced a weekend camped out in emergency shelters as health officials inspected flood areas for safety.

Police are in the process of evacuating Birmingham City Centre and part of the Ladywood residential district after having received intelligence regarding a possible threat. An estimated 20,000 people are being moved. Nightlife sites are being closed and people are being told to go home. The evacuation was begun at about 8.15 p.m. (1915 UTC) after the police issued a "Public Warning". Cars are being prohibited from entry inside the Inner Ring Road, and &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%20New%20Street%20station"&gt;New Street railway station&lt;/a&gt;, the hub of the British passenger railway system has been closed. 

A police spokeswoman said that the investigation was 'proportional' to the threat, but refused to comment on details of the threat. "&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Midlands%20Police"&gt;West Midlands police&lt;/a&gt; are now closing down the &lt;a href="w%3ABroad%20Street%2C%20Birmingham"&gt;Broad Street&lt;/a&gt; entertainment zone and asking people to leave Birmingham town centre and go home," said the spokesman.

&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%20Five%20Live"&gt;BBC Radio Five Live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt; have unconfirmed reports of controlled explosions in the city's Chinatown district.

A &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News%2024"&gt;BBC News 24&lt;/a&gt; correspondent reports that the Police have prevented motorists from returning to their cars and hundreds of city revellers are filing their way on foot along Bristol Road to converge on the Edgbaston Cricket Ground.

In a press conference, West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Hyde said that the intelligence they received is not believed to be connected to Thursday's terrorist bombings in London.

Earlier in the evening a controlled explosion on "a suspect package" had been carried out on a bus in Corporation Street, but they "no longer believe it was suspicious device".

It appears that this was a hoax, unconfirmed reports on Australian Teleivision have reported. The evacuation order was lifted at about 6 a.m.

Broad Street is the City's best-known entertainment area and is home to hundreds of bars and clubs.

A Friday protest in downtown &lt;a href="w%3A%20Richmond%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; drew around 200 protesters to &lt;a href="w%3A%20Virginia"&gt;Virginia’s&lt;/a&gt; state capital to demonstrate against &lt;a href="w%3A%20strip%20mining"&gt;strip mining&lt;/a&gt; practices of Massey Energy Company. Demonstrators marched through town and gathered in front of the company’s office building where nearly 20 laid in the street of the city’s main thoroughfare, and were nearly arrested. A few linked arms around a sidewalk structure to avoid being hauled away by police.

Chanting “Blankenship, Blankenship, Blankenship,” and waving bed sheets for flags, the demonstrators demanded to be seen and heard by the Massey Chairman and CEO, Don Blankenship. Arrests for &lt;a href="w%3A%20civil%20disobedience"&gt;civil disobedience&lt;/a&gt; were avoided when two security guards were sent by the company to retrieve a list of their demands. 

The demonstration, timed to coincide with &lt;a href="w%3A%20Scotland"&gt;Scotland’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A%20G8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; conference, was organized by a group called “Mountain Justice Summer” and environmentalists to protest mountain top removal mining techniques. The company’s mining operations are located in the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Appalachian%20Mountains"&gt;Appalachian Mountain chain&lt;/a&gt; in the states of Virginia, &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;. Massey is the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' fourth-largest coal mining operation.

A statement issued by a Massey spokesman defended their respect of people’s rights, and decried what they said was, “a great deal of misinformation.”

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%20Times-Dispatch"&gt;Richmond Times-Dispatch&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that unofficial “legal observers” accompanied the demonstrators and carried notebooks to record crowd and police activity.

On Saturday, Doug Clifton, editor of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A%20Cleveland%20Plain%20Dealer"&gt;Cleveland Plain Dealer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, said that the newspaper is trying to find a way to publish two "profoundly important" news stories, without the use of documents he states were illegally leaked to staff reporters. On legal advice, the newspaper was withholding the stories out of fear that reporters might be jailed. Clifton did not further characterize the subject of the investigative stories. 

"Basically, we have come by material leaked to us that would be problematical for the person who leaked it," Mr. Clifton said in a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ telephone interview. "The material was under seal or something along those lines."

A newspaper industry trade journal quoted Mr. Clifton saying, "The reporters say, 'Well, we're willing to go to jail, and I'm willing to go to jail if it gets laid on me,'" he said, "but the newspaper isn't willing to go to jail. That's what the lawyers have told us. So this is a TIME Inc. sort of situation," according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEditor%20%26amp%3B%20Publisher"&gt;Editor &amp; Publisher&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Inc."&gt;TIME Inc.&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Cooper"&gt;Matt Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, who along with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ correspondent &lt;a href="w%3AJudith%20Miller%20%28journalist%29"&gt;Judith Miller&lt;/a&gt;, both long held out against a &lt;a href="w%3Acontempt%20of%20court"&gt;contempt of court&lt;/a&gt; order to name their sources in the outing of &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt;. Cooper agreed Wednesday to testify, but it is unclear if he has the consent of his source, and Miller was sentenced to jail for refusing to cooperate.

Although ♡❤Time Inc.♡❤ was not specifically pursued by special prosecutor &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick J. Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; in the case, they agreed to release Cooper's reporting notes.

The ♡❤Plain Dealer♡❤ has the highest circulation in &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and was listed last year as the nation's 21st largest daily paper.

<h1>North Korea to rejoin six-nation talks</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=North%20Korea%20to%20rejoin%20six-nation%20talks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Last night, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; agreed to rejoin a six-nation talk on disarming its &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20weapon"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt; after more than a year of dissent. The agreement was reached at a dinner meeting hosted by the Chinese which included &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Assistant Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Hill"&gt;Christopher Hill&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Beijing.

North Korea's &lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20Central%20News%20Agency"&gt;Korean Central News Agency&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement saying the talks would resume because the preconditions for negotiations were met: "The U.S. side clarified its official stand to recognize the DPRK as a sovereign state, not to invade it and hold bilateral talks within the framework of the six-party talks." 

North Korea would allow talks if the United States would treat the country with respect, referring to earlier comments by Condoleezza Rice, who had called North Korea an "outpost of tyranny." According to the statement, the North Korean government views the meeting with Hill as a "retraction" of these earlier comments.

The Chinese government has offered to host the talks once again. China has hosted three prior talks without substantial results.

<h1>Mixed reactions to G8 summit</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mixed%20reactions%20to%20G8%20summit&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Friday, the annual meeting of the leaders of the world's eight most powerful countries, the Group of Eight (G8), ended ahead of schedule with few resolutions to the disappointment of many. The G8 meeting ended early Friday to accommodate Tony Blair, who requested to return to London in response to &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;Thursday's bombings&lt;/a&gt; in London. At the conclusion of the meeting, the leaders , however $30 billion had already been pledged previously.

The group was unable to make significant progress regarding global warming, but made several key decisions relating to combating poverty in Africa. The eight leaders pledged to double the previously proposed aid of $25 billion to $50 billion a year by 2010. The group also confirmed an &lt;a href="G8%20finance%20ministers%20agree%20on%20deal%20to%20relieve%20debts%20of%2018%20poorest%20nations"&gt;earlier announcement&lt;/a&gt; that they would cancel the debt of 18 countries, mostly in Africa, selected from among the 38 &lt;a href="w%3AHeavily%20Indebted%20Poor%20Countries"&gt;heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs)&lt;/a&gt;.

Additionally, $2 billion was earmarked for aid to the Palestine Nation. In addition to the increase in aid for Africa, the group announced universal access to AIDS treatment, committed to a peacekeeping force in Africa, and heard African leaders' promises to move toward democracies that follow the rule of law.

<h3>Disappointment from anti-poverty activists</h3>
Adriano Campolina Soares, head of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.actionaid.org.uk/"&gt;ActionAid's&lt;/a&gt; Americas office, stated her disappointment with the resolutions. "The G8 have completely failed to deliver trade justice. President George W. Bush and the European Union have played a cynical game of bluff. The US has no intention of giving up or lowering the massive subsidies it gives its cotton farmers, that are forcing 10 million farmers in West Africa out of business. Poor countries should take this as a warning that they will have a hard fight in the upcoming trade talks at the World Trade Organization."

Jennifer Morgan, climate-change director for the World Wildlife Fund expressed frustration with the United States' effort. "There's been no movement from the Bush administration, even the very noble efforts of Prime Minister Blair to get President Bush to change his position have failed."

<h3>Others happy with resolution</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3AU2%20%28band%29"&gt;U2&lt;/a&gt; singer &lt;a href="w%3ABono"&gt;Bono&lt;/a&gt; sees it in a different perspective. "It's worth stopping for a second and looking back down the valley of where we've come from, we jumped up and down when Live 8 raised $200 million, and now, to stop for a second, we are talking about $25 billion in new money."

&lt;a href="w%3ALive%208"&gt;Live 8&lt;/a&gt; organizer &lt;a href="Bob%20Geldof"&gt;Bob Geldof&lt;/a&gt; described the summit as a "qualified triumph." 

&lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, British Chancellor of the Exchequer: "It makes you angry because there's nothing in science or technology or medicine that should prevent us from tackling poverty. It's a lack of political will and if Gleneagles is about anything it's bringing together all the countries of the world - rich and poor - agreeing that we've got to take the action that's necessary. That's why I hope by the time Gleneagles is finished we can say that the timetable for action and poverty is one that will lead to great improvements by 2015."

Former Sudanese rebel leader &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Garang"&gt;John Garang&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as vice president of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; as part of the agreement ending the &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Sudanese%20Civil%20War"&gt;Second Sudanese Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. He is the first vice president the country has had.

As well as the vice presidency, Garang will have control over the autonomous southern region of Sudan.

"I John Garang Demabior swear by almighty God that as the first vice president of the Republic of the Sudan, I shall be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Republic of the Sudan." He said.

The cordon had been largely lifted at 6am BST after the centre was sealed off for most of the night.

Police Chief Constable Paul Scott said on Sunday that "a real and very credible threat" had faced Birmingham, but he declined to be specific about its nature.

However he stressed that the intelligence he had received indicated that the threat had been genuine.

Scott said that the evacuation had been "a proportionate response to the information. We haven't had this level of threat before, the people of Birmingham were in danger last night."

But the Chief Constable also explained that "I do not believe that the incident that we are dealing with this evening is connected with the events of July 7 in London."

Four controlled explosions were carried out on a bus to destroy suspected explosive devices after a call by a member of the public, but later investigations showed that they had been safe. 

A further suspicious package at the Travelodge hotel on Broad Street was also declared safe.

The people of &lt;a href="w%3ALuxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; voted a slight yes today on a referendum on the &lt;a href="w%3AEU%20Constitution"&gt;EU Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, which was the first national referendum since 1937. A large turnout was expected considering that there is a legal obligation to vote in Luxembourg, overall 220 000 people voted out of 223 000 voters. A close vote was expected as the last opinion poll a month ago indicated a small advantage for the "yes", but a substantial 16% of non-decided.

The results were ♡❤♡56.52%♡❤♡ voted "Jo" (Yes) and ♡❤♡43.48%♡❤♡ voted "Nee" (No).

Traditionally, Luxembourgers are pro-European, and all the major parties backed the approval. However globalisation, rising unemployment, immigration &amp; the new Eastern members made some of them feel uneasy, same as in neighbouring France and in the Netherlands where a majority of people rejected the treaty.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Dennis"&gt;Hurricane Dennis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; regained strength during its north-westerly crossing of the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to surge into &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;'s western &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Panhandle"&gt;panhandle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMobile%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale"&gt;Category 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; force that packed sustained winds of 120 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amiles%20per%20hour"&gt;mph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Rosa%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Santa Rosa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOkaloosa%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Okaloosa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEscambia%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Escambia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were the first Florida counties hit by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeyewall"&gt;eyewall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the hurricane at 3:25 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Daylight%20Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sunday afternoon.
The small storm eye of the powerful hurricane spared the region more major destruction.

The compact storm picked up travel speed from 14 to 18 mph as it came to within 3 hours of landfall, where the storm's eye made for the Pensacola Bay. Its strength suddenly dropped from Category 4 before it struck land and moved swiftly inland. It continued to gain speed, traveling at 21 mph, while its strength sapped to Category 2 on a track into the Ohio Valley.

Residents of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Walton%20Beach%2C%20Florida"&gt;Fort Walton Beach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APensacola%2C%20Florida"&gt;Pensacola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who remained in the region, were told hours before the storm's arrival that storm shelters were full, and they were urged to stay home or find other shelter. In Escambia County Florida, officials announced at 2pm they were no longer able to respond to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; calls for help due to the high winds.

The storm came 10 months after &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Ivan"&gt;Hurricane Ivan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which struck the panhandle and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20Bay"&gt;Mobile Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region last year. Dennis landed just 50 miles east of Ivan's, where recovery efforts from that storm were still ongoing. The Dennis landfall matched Ivan's Category 3 wind speeds.

Power outages were reported in Mobile and across the panhandle. Florida governor &lt;a href="Jeb%20Bush"&gt;Jeb Bush&lt;/a&gt; promised in a televised press conference that all efforts to restore power would be done as quickly as possible so that, "people can help themselves" recover from the storm. A hospital administrator at Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola said it lost power at 2:30pm, and can operate 60 hours using back-up power generators.

Sunday evening, &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; declared that Florida has major disaster areas, making the state eligible for &lt;a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;FEMA&lt;/a&gt; assistance. 

In &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, interstate highway I-65 was re-routed for northbound traffic only when an evacuation order was issued on Friday, by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Riley%20%28Alabama%29"&gt;Governor Riley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20County%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaldwin%20County%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; counties. Northern parts of the state, up into the southern part of &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, were booked full with those who evacuated. A curfew lifted Sunday at 6pm in the city of Mobile.

The &lt;a href="Mississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region was victim of the Category 5 storm, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Camille"&gt;Hurricane Camille&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in 1969.

The Icelandic investment firm &lt;a href="w%3ABaugur%20Group"&gt;Baugur&lt;/a&gt; has decided to withdraw from the &lt;a href="w%3ASomerfield"&gt;Somerfield&lt;/a&gt; bid because of legal action against some of it's core employees including its CEO, &lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%B3n%20%C3%81sgeir%20J%C3%B3nsson"&gt;Jón Ásgeir Jónsson&lt;/a&gt;, and chief of board, Haukur Loftsson. Baugur Group will also sell each share it owns in Somerfield.

Baugur Group had previously made EUR1.5 billion bid as had been covered on Wikinews.

&lt;a href="Baugur%20makes%20a%20US%241%2C8%20billion%20bid%20for%20Somerfield"&gt;Baugur makes a US$1,8 billion bid for Somerfield&lt;/a&gt;

Baugur used to own 5.5% of Somerfield's shares, but they will be sold to the Iranian businessman Roberts Tchenguiz for 190 pence per share, in total about 55 million pounds. Baugur will probably earn 30 million pounds by selling them.

Baugur has also reached agreement with it's partner companies that if they will be able too buy Somerfield they will repay Baugur what it has spent on research.

Baugur decided to withdraw from the bid so that the legal actions would not harm it's partner companies.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo%2C%20Brazil"&gt;São Paulo, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
On Friday, Brazilian police officers detained a leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; at Airport of Congonhas in &lt;a href="w%3ASao%20Paulo"&gt;Sao Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. He tried to board carrying R$200,000 (83,744.90 USD) and US$100,000 undeclared in cash. The money was hidden in his bag and in his underwear.

The man who was detained is José Adalberto Vieira da Silva, 39, Organization secretary of the Workers' Party from &lt;a href="w%3ACear%C3%A1"&gt;Ceará&lt;/a&gt; and the adviser of state deputy José Nobre Guimarães. Guimarães is the brother of &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Genoino"&gt;José Genoino&lt;/a&gt;, President of the Workers' Party, the ruling party in Brazil.

José Adalberto, was detained on Friday, at about 11 a.m. (local time) when he was boarding to &lt;a href="w%3AFortaleza"&gt;Fortaleza&lt;/a&gt;. Authorities detected through the airport's X-rays equipment that a great quantity of money was inside Adalberto's bag. After the bag was opened, the officers discovered R$200,000 (83,744.90 USD) in cash. The authorities took José Adalberto to another room in the airport. After searching in his clothing, police officers discovered US$100,000 hidden in Adalberto's underpants. The authorities charged José Adalberto for boarding without notification with more than R$10,000 (4,187.25 USD), which is forbidden by Brazilian laws.

Adalberto is currently being held in São Paulo, awaiting trial. The deputy José Nobre Guimarães denied any involvement in this case and fired José Adalberto Vieira da Silva.

<h2>Workers' Party President resigns</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Genoino"&gt;José Genoino&lt;/a&gt;, the Worker's Party President, resigned on Saturday (9). Mr &lt;a href="w%3ATarso%20Genro"&gt;Tarso Genro&lt;/a&gt;, the current Minister of Education, left the ministry and assumed the Worker's Party Presidency.

José Genoino is the third official to resign since the Brazilian deputy &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Jefferson"&gt;Roberto Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; began to give details about an alleged huge corruption scheme involving politicians from the government, the Worker's Party, the &lt;a href="w%3AAg%C3%AAncia%20Brasileira%20de%20Intelig%C3%AAncia"&gt;Brazilian Agency of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (Abin) and public and private enterprises. On July 5, the party's treasurer Delubio Soares and the general-secretary Silvio Pereira had resigned.

A day of national commemoration has taken place across the United Kingdom, with the main events in London, to mark the culmination of a week commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II. It is expected to be the last official national commemoration in the United Kingdom to mark the end of WWII.

After consulting veterans groups, the British Government chose to hold the national day of commemorations on 10 July, instead of separate days for &lt;a href="w%3AVE%20Day"&gt;VE Day&lt;/a&gt; (8 May) and &lt;a href="w%3AVJ%20Day"&gt;VJ Day&lt;/a&gt; (15 August).

The day began with a service at &lt;a href="w%3AWestminster%20Abbey"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt; at 11:00 BST, led by &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; and attended by Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, Archbishop of Canterbury &lt;a href="w%3ARowan%20Williams"&gt;Rowan Williams&lt;/a&gt; and hundreds of World War II veterans. The terrorist attacks in London on 7 July were also mentioned during the service, drawing parallels between the resilience of Londoners during the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Blitz"&gt;Blitz&lt;/a&gt; in WWII. A lunch was later held by the Queen at &lt;a href="w%3ABuckingham%20Palace"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt; for WWII veterans of the Armed Forces and Home Front. 

The Queen later led the parade down The Mall in a carriage, escorted by the &lt;a href="w%3AHousehold%20Cavalry"&gt;Household Cavalry&lt;/a&gt;. A "Reflections of World War II Commemoration Show" began at 15:00 on Horse Guards Parade, attended by the Royal Family, politicians, veterans and others. The show was designed to portray a variety of experiences of World War II, including speeches, such as Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Churchill"&gt;Winston Churchill's&lt;/a&gt; "&lt;a href="w%3AWe%20shall%20fight%20on%20the%20beaches"&gt;We shall fight on the beaches...&lt;/a&gt;", and popular songs of the time, all of which were performed by current entertainers, including actor &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Hardy"&gt;Robert Hardy&lt;/a&gt;, who portrayed Winston Churchill. The Queen made an address during the show, expressing her admiration for veterans of WWII while also drawing on the recent attacks on London. 

The guns of the light cruiser &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Belfast"&gt;HMS Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, which saw service in WWII, signalled the beginning of a two-minute silence at 15:45 pm, which ended again with the firing of Belfast's guns. Buglers of the Indian Army performed the Last Post.

A "Parade of Standards", numbering over a hundred, began to march down The Mall to Buckingham Palace at 16:15, led by the Queen in an open-top car. Large crowds began to converge on the palace, with the Royal Family later appearing on the palace's balcony, evoking memories of the VE Day celebrations on 8 May 1945. A flypast of WWII-era aircraft took place at 17:00, including a Lancaster bomber, flanked by a &lt;a href="w%3AHawker%20Hurricane"&gt;Hawker Hurricane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASupermarine%20Spitfire"&gt;Supermarine Spitfire&lt;/a&gt;, which released a million poppies.

In New Zealand, &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20William%20of%20Wales"&gt;Prince William of Wales&lt;/a&gt;, who is visiting New Zealand for his first official royal duties abroad, laid a wreath at the &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; Cenotaph to commemorate the end of World War II. New Zealand Prime Minister &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; and Governor-General Dame &lt;a href="w%3ASilvia%20Cartwright"&gt;Silvia Cartwright&lt;/a&gt; also attended.

Sources close to three distributors of the &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; operating systems have announced that &lt;a href="w%3AProgeny%20Linux%20Systems"&gt;Progeny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMandriva"&gt;Mandriva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATurboLinux"&gt;TurboLinux&lt;/a&gt; are working together on a new Enterprise Linux distribution in the hope of competing with &lt;a href="w%3ANovell"&gt;Novell's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Hat"&gt;Red Hat's&lt;/a&gt; products. 

The new distribution will be &lt;a href="w%3ADebian"&gt;Debian-based&lt;/a&gt;, making it the first Debian-based enterprise Linux distribution. According to &lt;a href="http%3A//eweek.com"&gt;eWeek.com&lt;/a&gt;, the distribution will support both Debian's native .deb package format (including &lt;a href="w%3AAdvanced%20Packaging%20Tool"&gt;APT&lt;/a&gt;) and Red Hat's original &lt;a href="w%3ARPM%20Package%20Manager"&gt;RPM&lt;/a&gt; system, in order to remain compatible with the many Red Hat-based enterprise distributions such as &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux"&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASUSE"&gt;SUSE&lt;/a&gt; - according to one vendor, "Basically the objective is to produce a distro that can act like Debian, use the Debian repository, but any Red Hat engineer should be comfortable with it." The distribution will also include a (within Debian) pioneering Web-based service manager for easy system administration, comparable to &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux"&gt;RHEL's&lt;/a&gt; tools of late.

&lt;a href="w%3AMethamphetamine"&gt;Methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; use is now the nation's most serious drug issue, according to a survey recently completed by the National Association of Counties (NaCO). The survey received responses from 500 county law enforcement agencies in 45 states. 58 percent of counties in the survey said that methamphetamine was their largest drug problem followed by &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; (19%), &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; (17%) and &lt;a href="w%3Aheroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; (3%) as the most problematic drug for each county. 

Methamphetamine is a growing problem, nearly double what it was three years ago in many regions. Over the last three years, 88 percent of counties have experienced an increase of meth-related crimes. Regions reporting the largest growth include the Upper Midwest, Southwest, and the Northwest - all reported a 93 percent increase in meth-related arrests. The Lower Midwest came in a close second with arrests increasing by 90 percent. 

Meth labs use highly flammable and explosive materials to produce the drug. Due to this, meth labs have been known to explode in spectacularly devastating events. The waste produced in the process of making methamphetamine is disposed of using improper methods, leaving significant amounts of toxic waste in streams, groundwater, and septic systems.

The report contains numerous inaccuracies. Notably it states that "In the past 70 years, a new group of drugs have appeared on the horizon. These are not drugs like heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, but rather the synthetic drugs that use amphetamines as a primary ingredient in their manufacture. Known collectively as methamphetamine, they have been nicknamed meth, crank, crystal, speed and many other local or regional variations."

Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887, dating the appearance of amphetamines to almost 120 years ago, not 70 as stated in the report. The drugs themselves are known collectively as "amphetamines" not as "methamphetamine" which is only one specific compound, not a group of compounds. Other amphetamines include &lt;a href="w%3ADexedrine"&gt;Dexedrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMDMA"&gt;MDMA (Ecstacy)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMDA"&gt;MDA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMDE"&gt;MDE&lt;/a&gt;. Amphetamine itself has been prescribed to millions of children and adults alike to treat ADD/ADHD. Dexedrine has been &lt;a href="http%3A//abcnews.go.com/sections/2020/DailyNews/2020_pilotpills021220.html"&gt;used by the Air Force&lt;/a&gt; to keep pilots alert during long missions. 

In another error of fact the report states that "in 1965 the federal food and drug laws were amended to try to decrease the black market sales of amphetamines" - Amphetamine products were first curbed in 1959 when Benzedrine was removed from store shelves by the FDA. It is possible that the authors thought that the &lt;a href="http%3A//thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z%3Fc104%3AS.%2B1965%3A"&gt;Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996&lt;/a&gt; was a 1965 bill because its designator was "Bill Number S.1965".

&lt;a href="w%3AGale%20force"&gt;Gale force&lt;/a&gt; winds ripped through &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and the South Coast of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; late on Saturday night, causing widespread damage and extensive power outages, with up to 30,000 homes going without electricity at one point. The strong winds caused trees to be uprooted, in one instance crashing down upon an unsuspecting motorist, killing a man in his 60's and severely injuring his wife.

The &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Emergency%20Service"&gt;State Emergency Service&lt;/a&gt; (SES) has responded to over 800 calls for help to repair damage caused by the storms, however the storms have subsided somewhat and flood warnings around &lt;a href="w%3ABega"&gt;Bega&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMoruya"&gt;Moruya&lt;/a&gt; have been withdrawn.

One hundred people walked in &lt;a href="w%3AZagreb"&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; Pride parade yesterday in Zagreb, &lt;a href="w%3ACroatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;. Guarded by five hundred policemen, the parade promoting tolerance towards non-heterosexual people went without any major incidents. Helena Štimac Radin, president of the Government's institution for sexual equality, was present at the parade.

Organizers of the parade, the feminist organization Epikriza, said that postponing the event caused low turnout this year. It was not clear for about three weeks if the parade would take place at all, as the initial organization Iskorak, which was supposed to organize the parade this year, decided not to initiate it as they felt another type of event would be more appropriate.

Participants held banners saying "Love always wins", "Homophobia is illness" and "Sexual education into schools". 

Several groups of people protested the parade, carrying banners reading "Raise your own children, not mine." They also disseminated flyers with "Croatian women and men, say no to faggoting of Croatia" written on them.

"I am angry because my tax money is spent on this kind of thing. There is money for these sick people, but there isn't for schools and kindergartens. It drives me crazy", one of the protestors said according to the newspaper Novi List. The parade was in part sponsored by the city of Zagreb.

Bypassers shouted insults at the paraders, who replied with "Gay is OK" and "Zagreb is gay". Police checked the identification of several skinheaded young men, but there were no larger incidents.

Two weeks ago, the government of &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; threatened to break the patent on the most widely-prescribed &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; medication, &lt;a href="w%3AKeletra"&gt;Keletra&lt;/a&gt; (produced by Abbott Labs), if the makers would not comply with the government's requests. After holding its ground during the days leading up to the deadline set by Brazilian authorities, Abbot Labs has finally reached an agreement with the Brazilian government and is lowering its prices to levels deemed appropriate by the government of Brazil. 

Brazilian law allows Brazil to break patents on medicines when there is a "risk to public health". After determining that the current prices were so exorbitant that they posed a significant risk to public health, the Brazilian government-owned chemical laboratories could begin manufacturing the drug themselves. 

Brazil spent $107 million producing the drug this past year, and stated that the new financial deal will save the government $18 million next year, and $259 million over the next six years.

Brazilian citizens receive free AIDS medication, paid for by the government. This bulk purchasing arrangement allows Brazilian citizens to receive the most affordable healthcare in the developed world.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has promised that his &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20government"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; will do whatever it can to assist &lt;a href="w%3ASchapelle%20Corby"&gt;Schapelle Corby's&lt;/a&gt; legal team. He said this as part of a three page letter sent in response to a request from Corby herself. 

"Let me assure you that the Australian Government will continue to provide every assistance it can under our legal system, consistent with our approach to date," he said. 

Corby was recently sentenced by an &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; court to 20 years in jail for attempting to smuggle four kilograms of &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; into the island of &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;. The case has been controversial in Australia, with many people believing she is innocent and that the legal process was unfair.
It has been alleged that the drugs were planted in Ms. Corby's luggage by baggage handlers, as part of a smuggling ring internal to Australia, and that they were not collected by the intended "pick up", leaving them in Ms. Corby's possession when she arrived in Bali. The Bali High Court decided during an appeal that new evidence should be heard in the case. During the original case a number of key witnesses were not called. 
Corby's lawyers are now collecting new information and preparing for the case. Mr Howard pledged to support them in this process. 

"Looking ahead, the Australian government will do what it can to support your legal team as they work to collect further evidence in Australia", he said.

Tens of thousands of people gathered in &lt;a href="w%3ASrebrenica"&gt;Srebrenica&lt;/a&gt; today to remember the &lt;a href="w%3ASebrenica%20Massacre"&gt;massacre&lt;/a&gt; of over 8,000 Muslims, mostly men and boys, which happened on 11th July 1995. This is considered the worst atrocity in Europe since the end of World War II.

610 victims of the massacres were buried today after their bodies were recovered from multiple mass graves. 1,300 bodies have been identified with DNA testing but 4,500 body bags of human remain still need to be identified

Serbian president &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Tadic"&gt;Boris Tadic&lt;/a&gt; attended the memorial and paid his tribute to the victims by bowing before their coffins. Tadic's attendance caused outrage among Serbian hardliners but has been applauded by the international community.

French, Dutch and UK ministers were also present, as well as former US Balkan envoy Richard Holbrook.
UK foreign secretary &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt; apologized on behalf of the world community stating that it is "♡❤the shame of the international community that this evil took place under our noses and we did nothing about it♡❤". He also called it "♡❤sickening♡❤" that &lt;a href="w%3ARadovan%20Karadzic"&gt;Radovan Karadzic&lt;/a&gt; and General &lt;a href="w%3ARatko%20Mladic"&gt;Ratko Mladic&lt;/a&gt;, the men accused of overseeing the massacre, have not yet been captured and brought to justice.

Security was tight after two bombs were found in the area last week. More than 1,500 policemen are patrolling the area.

&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; low fares airline &lt;a href="w%3ARyanair"&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt; has announced it is to commence service of two new routes from &lt;a href="w%3AShannon%20Airport"&gt;Shannon Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Clare"&gt;County Clare&lt;/a&gt;, Ireland. It will now fly to &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; daily and to &lt;a href="w%3ANantes"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; three times a week. The airline will also increase the frequency of its Shannon-&lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; route.

Shannon airport has seen its traffic figures soar in the past year since Ryanair established a new base there. Ryanair CEO &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20O%27Leary"&gt;Michael O'Leary&lt;/a&gt; has said he expects the new routes to bring an additional 200,000 passengers to the airport.

Despite the positive announcement of the new routes on Thursday, Ryanair's share price plunged by 10% on the same day due to the &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;London bombings&lt;/a&gt; that morning. However the share price recovered substantially on Friday.

Ryanair is the world's most profitable airline, having reported record profits of €269m earlier this year, and is pursuing an aggressive expansion plan which will see it's total number of passengers jump to 70m over the next few years. At present Ryanair has 91 aircraft and 230 &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737's&lt;/a&gt; on order.

The former managing director of &lt;a href="w%3ABSkyB"&gt;BSkyB&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor East, has been appointed director of sport at &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; sports TV company &lt;a href="w%3ASetanta"&gt;Setanta&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to working for BSkyB Mr. East, 54, was head of sport at &lt;a href="w%3AITV"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt; for 22 years. The new role will involve gaining the rights to different sports events, and possibly even the premiership.

Setanta initially started out by broadcasting &lt;a href="w%3AGAA"&gt;GAA&lt;/a&gt; games to Irish people living abroad particularly in the US. Today, backed by an investment by &lt;a href="w%3AAIG"&gt;AIG&lt;/a&gt;, it is pursuing an ambitious plan to grow its business - it currently broadcasts the Scottish Premier League and earlier this week it bought control of North American Sports Network. North American Sports Network broadcasts baseball, &lt;a href="w%3ANFL"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; football, &lt;a href="w%3Abasketball"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANascar"&gt;Nascar&lt;/a&gt; motor racing outside the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;. Also in the planning stages is a &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an sports station for the US market.

On Monday, &lt;a href="w%3ABrittania%20House"&gt;Brittania House&lt;/a&gt; in Bradford, UK was closed due to a security alert. A Wikinews reporter received notification that the Yorkshire Building Society Howard House Branch was closed until further notice. This turned out to be an evacuation of a small area due to a suspect package. It was a false alarm.

Britain has been in an increased state of vigilance since &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;last Thursday's attack&lt;/a&gt; with fifty security alerts on the Tube according to Metro newspaper and &lt;a href="UK%20Police%20evacuate%20Birmingham%20city%20centre"&gt;the evacuation of Birmingham city centre&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday night.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; rebounded from a tough loss on Saturday to win Sunday's game 9-4 against the &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Indians"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; thanks to some timely hitting.

Randy Johnson (9-6) allowed three runs on nine hits, six of which were leadoff hits. His performance bested Tribe starter Jake Westbrook (6-11), who pitched well to start the game but then surrendered two runs in the 4th inning and three in the 5th as the Yankees' hitters constructed a lead.

Recently acquired reliever Wayne Franklin threatened to lose the lead in the 7th inning, but was saved by Tanyon Sturtze, who came on to get the final out of the inning. Gary Sheffield then responded in the bottom of the inning with a three-run homer hit deep into the right-center field bleachers, stretching the Yankee lead to 9-4.

&lt;a href="w%3AMariano%20Rivera"&gt;Mariano Rivera&lt;/a&gt; closed out the game with a two-inning appearance, recording his 20th save. He enters the All-Star break preparing for Tuesday's game, along with Sheffield and &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Rodriguez"&gt;Alex Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt;. The Yankees currently trail the AL East leader &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Red%20Sox"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; by 2.5 games, but face tough road series against the BoSox, Rangers, and &lt;a href="w%3AAnaheim%20Angels"&gt;Angels&lt;/a&gt; when play resumes on Thursday.

A Muslim preacher has used a Gaza radio station to praise the "blessed actions" of those responsible for the London terror attacks. The unidentified preacher made an appearance Saturday on the controversial station &lt;a href="w%3ASawt%20Al-Quds"&gt;Sawt Al-Quds&lt;/a&gt;, during which he praised both the London attacks and the assassination of Egypt's Ambassador to Iraq, &lt;a href="w%3AIhab%20al-Sherif"&gt;Ihab al-Sherif&lt;/a&gt;.

In a statement translated by the right-wing Israel National News, the preacher also attributed the bomb attacks in London to &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;, saying they were a timely response from the terrorist leader to scenes of public celebration following London's successful Olympic bid. 

"The sirens of joy were heard in Britain, and Osama bin Laden again redrew the map, thus announcing that the voice of the subjugated will be heard everywhere."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3%3Fid%3D85559"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Sawt Al-Quds ("Voice of Jerusalem") is a Syrian-based radio station broadcasting to the Gaza Strip. It is believed to be affiliated with &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt;.

The London bombings have been condemned by many Muslim clerics. Speaking of the response by Iraqis to the London bombings, a UK spokesperson for the Multi-National Division (South-East) said, "Most of the feed back from Friday pray[ers] in the British Area of Operation were against the attacks on London."

Germany's main opposition parties, the &lt;a href="w%3ACDU"&gt;CDU&lt;/a&gt; and its sister party, the Bavarian &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Social%20Union%20in%20Bavaria"&gt;CSU&lt;/a&gt;, presented their manifesto for the upcoming &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20federal%20election%2C%202005"&gt;federal election&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin today. With this progam, titled ♡❤Deutschlands Chancen nutzen♡❤ (Using Germany's Opportunities), the CDU wants to return to power in the election, which will most likely take place on September 18th of this year.

The number one issue in this election will be employment. Germany is struggling with 4.7 million unemployed people and the CDU wants to reduce labor costs and make the hiring and firing of new employees easier. The party also intends to reduce income-taxes but plans to raise the value-added tax from 16% to 18%.

Party chair &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, called their program the "♡❤most honest in a long time♡❤" while incumbent chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt; said that Merkel would make "♡❤everything more expensive and nothing better♡❤".

In &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, England the North West Development Agency (NWDA) has approved funds of nearly £33 million (about $57.6 million U.S. dollars) for the construction of the &lt;a href="w%3AMuseum%20of%20Liverpool"&gt;Museum of Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; on Mann Island at the &lt;a href="w%3APier%20Head"&gt;Pier Head&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; part of Liverpool's &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Educational%2C%20Scientific%20and%20Cultural%20Organization"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Heritage%20Site"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt; waterfront. An additional £7.5 million (about 13.1 million U.S. dollars) has been allocated for the creation of a canal link across Mann Island, encompassing central docks, the Pier Head, and the &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Dock"&gt;Albert Dock&lt;/a&gt;.

The museum is to replace the current &lt;a href="w%3AMuseum%20of%20Liverpool%20Life"&gt;Museum of Liverpool Life&lt;/a&gt;. The future museum, which is presently a £65 million pound project, is to be the situated on the site of the failed "Fourth Grace" building. The "Three Graces" are: the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Liver%20Building"&gt;Royal Liverpool Building&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACunard%20Building"&gt;Cunard Building&lt;/a&gt;; and the &lt;a href="w%3APort%20of%20Liverpool%20Building"&gt;Port of Liverpool Building&lt;/a&gt;. The abortive Fourth Grace was a controversial building known as "The Cloud", the brainchild of architect &lt;a href="w%3AWill%20Alsop"&gt;Will Alsop&lt;/a&gt;. It was cancelled in July 2004 after local opposition, rising costs and the belief that the design was unrealistic. 

The future museum, which will be designed in the shape of an "X", will feature 10,000 square metres of exhibition space on Liverpool's cultural and social history, including present exhibits of the Museum of Liverpool Life.

The two projects are considered integral aspects of Liverpool's successful bid in 2003 for the 2008 &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Capital%20of%20Culture"&gt;European Capital of Culture&lt;/a&gt;.

Thomas Charles Damron, aged 22, was charged in the death of 18 year old Kathryn Sutherland, killed Saturday afternoon in a four-car crash Saturday afternoon near &lt;a href="w%3ARomeo%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Romeo, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;.

Damron, arraigned Monday afternoon, was charged with operating a vehicle with the presence of drugs causing death, possession of marijuana, and negligent homicide. Preliminary investigations indicate that Damron crashed into the rear of another vehicle starting a chain reaction that ultimately led to still another car crossing into the westbound lane where it struck the victim's car.

Kathryn Sutherland died after she was airlifted to the University of Michigan Medical Center.

Since 1822, the &lt;a href="w%3AFulton%20Fish%20Market"&gt;Fulton Fish Market&lt;/a&gt; on South Street in &lt;a href="w%3ALower%20Manhattan"&gt;Lower Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; has been operating virtually unchanged and surrounded by the ever-changing &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;NYC&lt;/a&gt;. It is expected to be relocated to a new $85 million, 400,000-square-foot facility at &lt;a href="w%3AHunts%20Point%2C%20Bronx%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Hunts Point&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Bronx"&gt;The Bronx&lt;/a&gt; beginning this week.

Originally set for January, the move was delayed until this month to allow time to add more safety and security items at the new facility. 

Some restaurant food buyers expressed concern that a move to the new facility will raise &lt;a href="w%3Afishmonger"&gt;fishmonger&lt;/a&gt; prices. Fish stall owners agree the move raises their &lt;a href="w%3Aoverhead"&gt;overhead&lt;/a&gt;.

Rudy Washington, deputy to former mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;, said that a plan by the city to open the fish unloading operations to a bidding process at the new facility could lead to &lt;a href="w%3Amafia"&gt;mafia&lt;/a&gt; control. During Giuliani's tenure, Washington was in charge of the cleaning up the market of mafia influence. 

The market has gotten fish from a &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island"&gt;Long Island&lt;/a&gt; company since 1995.

According to an ♡❤&lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ report, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Hillary%20Rodham%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Rodham Clinton&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;NY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) stated during the inaugural of the Aspen Ideas Festival, "I sometimes feel that Alfred E. Neuman is in charge in Washington." The event was organized by the Aspen Institute, a think tank unaffiliated with any particular political party.

She claimed that Bush's attitudes towards many major issues are in line with the ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMAD%20Magazine"&gt;Mad magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ character's philosophical catch line: "What, me worry?" Republican groups denounced the comment, saying that Sen. Clinton was merely making a partisan attack for political gain at a time when the nation should be focusing on national security issues. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Committee"&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt called Senator Clinton "part of today's angry and adrift Democrat Party."

Many have speculated that the former first lady and current &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; senator will make a presidential bid in the 2008 election, but the Associated Press related Sen. Clinton's words as that she is "too wrapped up in her Senate work and re-election effort to think about that."

Emilio Menendez, a Spaniard, and Carlos Baturin German, an American, became the first gay couple to be married under a new law allowing &lt;a href="same-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. The couple tied the knot in the town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATres%20Cantos"&gt;Tres Cantos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , outside of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Wedding guests included family and friends, as well as journalists and politician Pedro Zerolo, the governing Socialist Party's top official for social issues.

Spain is only the third nation in Europe to legalise same-sex marriage, after the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. The bill was passed by the lower house of Parliament on 30 June 2005, overruling a rejection by the upper house, the Senate. Although the move was opposed by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; groups, polls suggest that a majority of Spaniards support the decision. There were protests in Madrid prior to the bill being passed, and a Roman Catholic group submitted a 600,000-signature petition urging a referendum.

State run television broadcast images of the happy couple after the ceremony. Menendez told reporters, "The happiest day of our lives was when we fell in love with each other. We have been together for 30 years, there have been many wonderful days, today is yet another wonderful day."

In a televised report on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Tuesday morning, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Senators &lt;a href="John%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; expressed their belief that &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt;, a top advisor to President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, should be fired. Kerry spoke from the podium and answered reporters' questions, while Clinton nodded in the background. Kerry spoke clearly for the removal of Rove, and reporters who noted Clinton's nods in agreement with Kerry queried her. She replied in support of Kerry's comments, "I agree with that." 

The &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; refused to comment Monday on Karl Rove's involvement in the leak of the name of the covert &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reporter, &lt;a href="w%3AJudith%20Miller"&gt;Judith Miller&lt;/a&gt;, was jailed for violating a &lt;a href="w%3Acontempt%20of%20court"&gt;contempt of court&lt;/a&gt; order by refusing to testify about her source, and &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20%28magazine%29"&gt;TIME magazine&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Cooper"&gt;Matthew Cooper&lt;/a&gt; also involved with withholding his source now appears ready to testify. 

The leak of undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame's name two years ago by a member of the executive branch was in response to her husband disputing the Administration's allegations that Iraq was at the time attempting to buy so-called &lt;a href="w%3AYellowcake"&gt;Yellowcake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUranium"&gt;Uranium&lt;/a&gt; from countries in Africa. Her husband, a former ambassador under the first president Bush, &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20C.%20Wilson"&gt;Joseph Wilson&lt;/a&gt; has been proven correct in his assertions that &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; was not attempting to gain or purchased uranium from &lt;a href="w%3ANiger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;. 

White House Press Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; refused to comment on a series of questions which increased in intensity quickly during a &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%2011"&gt;July 11&lt;/a&gt; White House Press Briefing. The inquiries were about whether the White House stood by an earlier comment that any official found to be involved would be fired, and also about when President Bush found out that Karl Rove, his deputy chief of staff, was involved. 

During the most heated part of the exchange, David Gregory of NBC News called the refusal to comment "ridiculous." 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤♡DAVID GREGORY:♡❤♡ Scott, I mean, just -- I mean, this is ridiculous. The notion that you're going to stand before us after having commented with that level of detail and tell people watching this that somehow you decided not to talk. You've got a public record out there. Do you stand by your remarks from that podium, or not? 
♡❤♡MR. McCLELLAN:♡❤♡ And again, David, I'm well aware, like you, of what was previously said, and I will be glad to talk about it at the appropriate time. The appropriate time is when the investigation -- 
♡❤♡DAVID GREGORY:♡❤♡ Why are you choosing when it's appropriate and when it's inappropriate? 
♡❤♡MR. McCLELLAN:♡❤♡ If you'll let me finish -- 
♡❤♡DAVID GREGORY:♡❤♡ No, you're not finishing -- you're not saying anything. You stood at that podium and said that Karl Rove was not involved. And now we find out that he spoke out about Joseph Wilson's wife. So don't you owe the American public a fuller explanation? Was he involved, or was he not? Because, contrary to what you told the American people, he did, indeed, talk about his wife, didn't he? 
♡❤♡MR. McCLELLAN:♡❤♡ David, there will be a time to talk about this, but now is not the time to talk about it. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McClellan also refused to comment on whether or not President Bush had confidence in Rove as his deputy chief of staff.

&lt;a href="w%3APadraig%20Harrington"&gt;Padraig Harrington&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; golfer currently ranked ninth in the &lt;a href="w%3AOfficial%20World%20Golf%20Rankings"&gt;Official World Golf Rankings&lt;/a&gt;, has pulled out of the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Open"&gt;British Open&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Andrews"&gt;St Andrews&lt;/a&gt; to be with his family. The top golfer's father, Patrick, passed away yesterday after a long battle with cancer. Harrington's place in the competition will be filled by &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden's&lt;/a&gt; Henrik Stensen.

Patrick Harrington who was a former garda, was diagnosed with cancer in March when Padraig won his first US tour title. Patrick who was 72 played in two &lt;a href="w%3AAll-Ireland%20Football%20Final"&gt;All-Ireland Football Finals&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3ACork"&gt;Cork&lt;/a&gt;.

Padraig Harrington, who turns 34 next month, has played on three &lt;a href="w%3ARyder%20Cup"&gt;Ryder Cup&lt;/a&gt; teams for &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and has won numerous European and international competitions.

&lt;a href="West%20Yorkshire"&gt;West Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; Police searched six houses in &lt;a href="Leeds"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; today in connection with the London bombings. Houses were searched in the Burley, Beeston and Holbeck areas. Further properties were searched in Dewsbury, about eight miles from the city centre. The raids began at 6:30am BST this morning after warrants were issued under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATerrorism%20Act%202000"&gt;Terrorism Act 2000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Police are still in attendance at one property, and are describing the searches as ♡❤significant♡❤, and "intelligence led".

Access to one house was gained using a robot-deployed controlled explosion. Other houses were entered by armed police.

London Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair said that the operation "is directly connected to the outrages on Thursday". A "significant amount" of explosives was recovered from the Burley property. Following the discovery of the explosive, military bomb disposal experts were sent to the scene. Around 600 people were evacuated from the surrounding area. Temporary food and shelter is being provided by the local council at Kirkstall Leisure Centre, a mile away.

Four explosions have rocked a brand new, soon to be online power station in &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29"&gt;Basque reigon&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AAmorebieta"&gt;Amorebieta&lt;/a&gt;. 

Shortly before the blasts, warning calls were made to Basque newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGara"&gt;Gara&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and the Basque emergency road service known as DYA, police rushed to the scene and evacuated workers. The calls were made by the Basque separatist group &lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;.

There are no confirmations of injuries or structual damage from the blasts at the moment. Spanish radio however reports that there were no injuries and some minor structual damage. Witnesses to the explosions say they were small.

Warning calls before blasts are common by ETA, usually ♡❤Gara♡❤ will get the call.

The plant is run by ESB International.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Abreu"&gt;Bobby Abreu&lt;/a&gt;, welcome to the spotlight.

The &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Phillies"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt; star, now 31 and a two-time All-Star, has produced well for the Phillies over the last half a decade without the glamour of other top players. However, last night there was no denying that he was the star of the show.

And what a show it was. The first batter in the 2005 &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Run%20Derby"&gt;Home Run Derby&lt;/a&gt;, Abreu proceeded to shatter the previous record of 15 home runs in a round, belting 24, including a 517-foot moonshot that exited the stadium in right field, going through two bats in the process. This rampage came immediately after ESPN announcers Chris Berman and Joe Morgan described &lt;a href="w%3AComerica%20Park"&gt;Comerica Park&lt;/a&gt;, the site of the Derby, as a difficult park to hit home runs in.

In the second round, Abreu edged past Boston's &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Ortiz"&gt;David Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; (who himself hit an astounding 17 homeruns in the first round) and Milwaukee's &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Lee"&gt;Carlos Lee&lt;/a&gt; to earn a spot in the finals alongside Detroit star &lt;a href="w%3AIvan%20Rodriguez"&gt;Ivan Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt;. Rodriguez, who snuck into the second round with 7 dingers, swatted the most in the second round, but his home-field advantage deserted him in the finals as Abreu smashed 11 over the fences to win the Derby for his native Venezuela.

Abreu's three-round total of 41 homers broke &lt;a href="w%3AMiguel%20Tejada"&gt;Miguel Tejada&lt;/a&gt;'s record of 27, set last year in Houston's Minute Maid Park.

Local Law enforcement officials acting on behalf of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; raided offices of &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; and several computer makers this morning, a spokesman for the EU said. He did not specify which countries or which other firms were involved. However, a spokesman for Intel Germany, Hans-Jürgen Werner, said that Intel's offices in &lt;a href="w%3AMunich"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASwindon"&gt;Swindon&lt;/a&gt; were among those searched.

It emerged on Wednesday 13th, that raids also took place at Intel's facility in &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Kildare"&gt;County Kildare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in relation to the firms anti-competitive business practices. Intel employs over 5,000 people at its Irish manufacturing facility.

The raids are most likely connected to an ongoing anti-trust investigation against Intel by the EU. It is alleged that the company used its market dominance to bully its clients into buying its chips instead of &lt;a href="w%3AAMD"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; ones. Intel is denying the allegations.

Four people were killed today at a &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20bombing"&gt;suicide bombing&lt;/a&gt; near a shopping center in &lt;a href="w%3ANetanya"&gt;Netanya&lt;/a&gt;. One of the dead was the suicide bomber. 90 others were injured, five of them seriously. &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt; has claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to Reuters' &lt;a href="w%3ATulkarem"&gt;Tulkarem&lt;/a&gt; office and identified the bomber as Ahmad Abu-Halil of Tulkarem.

At about 6:35 p.m. local time (UTC +3), Abu-Halil detonated himself on a crosswalk, after approaching a group of four young women, French tourists according to some of the reports, who were crossing the road. Nearby automobiles were also damaged by the explosion, and some of the shopping center's windows were shattered. Local police said that the bomber carried around 10 kg of explosives, as well as nails and metal pellets, on an explosive belt that was strapped to his body. Netanya's mayor, Miriam Fierberg, was present on the scene of the attack and immediately began assisting the injured.

It was later published that the casualties are two 16-year-old girls from &lt;a href="w%3ATel-Aviv"&gt;Tel-Aviv&lt;/a&gt;, who were killed on the scene attack. The two other victims died in the hospital - a 31-year-old woman from Netanya and a 50-year-old woman from Netanya, whose daughter and granddaughter were seriously injured in the attack.

The &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; (PA) condemned the attack. PA official Jibril Rajoub called it "♡❤hurtful to our cause♡❤" and chief negotiator &lt;a href="w%3ASaeb%20Erakat"&gt;Saeb Erakat&lt;/a&gt; said that "♡❤those who carried out this attack want to sabotage the efforts being exerted to have a smooth and peaceful disengagement from Gaza and a revival of the peace process♡❤".

The Israeli government on the other hand alleges that the PA is not doing enough to stop terrorism. ♡❤"Israel has done all it could to ease up Palestinian needs but the PA has not fulfilled obligations undertaken at Sharem al Sheikh and shows no signs of doing so"♡❤ said David Baker, an official in the office of Prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;.

In light of the bombing, Israeli defence minister, &lt;a href="w%3AShaul%20Mofaz"&gt;Shaul Mofaz&lt;/a&gt;, cancelled a meeting with the Palestinian minister for civil affairs, &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Dahlan"&gt;Mohammed Dahlan&lt;/a&gt;, set for this evening to coordinate various issues regarding Israel's withdrawal from the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;.

This was the third attack in Israel in one day. Earlier this morning two Israeli soldiers were injured when a bomb was detonated near the automobile they were driving near Netzer Hazeni in the Gaza Strip. Minutes before the attack in Netanya there was another attack attempt when a suicide bomber drove a stolen truck loaded with explosives into a civilian settlement of Shavey Shomron in &lt;a href="w%3ASamaria"&gt;Samaria&lt;/a&gt;, but he detonated the vehicle without harm to anyone but himself. The bomber was injured and is being treated at a local hospital.

As rolls through the Caribbean the death toll in &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; has continued to rise. According to Cuba's president, , the death toll of the hurricane has gone from 10 deaths yesterday to 16 deaths today. He explained the situation with a several hours long speech which commenced Monday evening and continued on until Tuesday morning. In the speech Castro estimates in total $1.4 billion US in property damage. He also stated the hurricane damaged 120,000 homes, 15,000 of which were destroyed and stated that the &lt;a href="w%3Acitrus"&gt;citrus&lt;/a&gt; crops were wrecked by the 240km/h winds of the hurricane. 

Castro has rejected a $50,000 offer of aid from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Castro explains that he won't be willing to accept the any aid until the U.S. lifts the &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20embargo"&gt;trade embargo&lt;/a&gt; on his country. Castro claims the embargo is "genocidal" against his people. Some other nations have similar trade embargoes with Cuba; Castro has also said that aid will only be accepted from nations that do not have such arrangements.

Dramatic developments today have revealed new information about last &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;Thursday's bomb attacks&lt;/a&gt; on London. &lt;a href="Arrest%20over%20London%20bombing"&gt;One person has been arrested&lt;/a&gt; after a series of .

The four men alleged to be responsible for the bombings travelled by train from Leeds to &lt;a href="w%3AKings%20Cross%20Thameslink%20railway%20station"&gt;King's Cross&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday morning, where they were seen on CCTV at 8.30am. Three of them, likely British citizens of Pakistani origin, came from Leeds while another joined them en route. One of the three from Yorkshire was reported missing by his family at 10pm that evening. 

Three of them then boarded underground trains. The fourth alleged bomber - the man reported missing from Leeds - died onboard the bus, but there are no clear reasons for why he did not follow the same pattern as the others. It has been confirmed that at least three of the four bombers died in the blasts. Forensic evidence and items belonging to all of the men were found in the debris of the target vehicles.

Police also found a car at Luton train station, which is on the route from Leeds to King's Cross. A series of controlled explosions was carried out on the car. It is understood that one of the bombers drove equipment in the car to Luton, while the others travelled by train.

Materials used to make explosives were also found at one of the houses in Leeds.

A second car was found on the property of a recovery company in Leighton Buzzard; it had been 'routinely recovered' from Luton train station on the evening of Tuesday, July 12. Bedfordshire Police, working in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police and the British Transport Police, sealed off the area within a 50 metre radius of the vehicle. The area was re-opened at 9.30pm BST, although a police presence remained until the next day. It has not yet been revealed why the car was towed away or what was contained inside it.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20Defence%20Minister%20alludes%20to%20possible%20Iraq%20troop%20reduction&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The UK Secretary of State for Defence &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reid"&gt;John Reid&lt;/a&gt; has admitted the withdrawal of 5,500 of the 8,500 British troops in Iraq by spring 2006 is a possibility. It comes after a report was leaked to the &lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Mail"&gt;Mail on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the 7 July London bombings. 

The document (Options for Future UK Force Posture in Iraq) was marked "Secret - UK eyes only" and also contained information on possible U.S. troop reductions, bringing the number of Coalition forces in Iraq down to 66,000. About 176,000 Coalition troops are presently in Iraq, 130,000 of which are from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Armed%20Forces"&gt;United States Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. However, the document also reveals there is division between the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;, which apparently favours a "relatively bold reduction", and U.S. commanders in Iraq who are more cautious. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Army"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; is the lead component of the Multi-National Division (South-East). It has maintained forces in the 8,000+ region since the end of the 2003 Iraq War. In the document, Mr Reid admitted that a large reduction of British and U.S. forces would make it difficult for other countries to keep their force in Iraq. 

Mr Reid, who took up the position of Secretary of State for Defence on 6 May 2005, admitted that the document was made by him for Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;. In the document, Mr Reid stated that a decision would need to be made later this year on British forces levels in Iraq. The possible transfer of control of &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Muthanna"&gt;Al Muthanna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMaysan"&gt;Maysan&lt;/a&gt; provinces, followed by &lt;a href="w%3ABasra%20Governorate"&gt;Al Basrah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADhi%20Qar"&gt;Dhi Qar&lt;/a&gt; provinces in 2006, were also included in the document. It estimated the reduction of British forces could save about £1 billion pounds (about $1.7 billion U.S. dollars).

In a statement on 10 July made in response to the leaking of the document, Mr Reid denied that the document signalled any change in policy, stating that, "No decisions on the future force posture of UK forces have been taken. But we have always said that it is our intention to hand over the lead in fighting terrorists to Iraqi security forces as their capability increases. We therefore continually produce papers outlining possible options and contingencies."

On 4 July, during a debate in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Reid had hinted at possible reductions in forces, saying that, "By and large, about 12 [of 18] of the provinces are relatively free of terrorist attacks. As the Iraqi forces become trained to take the lead, it is possible, over a period of time, to hand the lead role to Iraqi forces in certain areas of the country and gradually, we hope, over the whole country."

A spokesperson of the MND (SE) was questioned by a Wikireporter. When asked whether speculation of reductions would affect British forces morale in Iraq, it was insisted that, "The British forces will continue to operate in the professional manner to which they always have done." 
The spokesperson added, "No decision on the future posture of UK forces in Iraq has been taken. There has been no change in policy. Assisting the Iraqis to improve the security environment remains our top priority."

Speaking of the response by Iraqis to the London bombings, the spokesperson said, "Most of the feed back from Friday pray[ers] in the British Area of Operation were against the attacks on London."

Doctors at the regional burn center at St. Joseph Hospital in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Wayne%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Fort Wayne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; are treating a patient flown in from war-torn &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. 

U.S. Army's 113th Battalion, which is made up of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndiana%20National%20Guard"&gt;Indiana National Guardsman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , discovered five-year-old Zia after a propane explosion in suburban &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; earlier this year destroyed homes and killed six of the boy's family members. 

The blast left Zia with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Athird%20degree%20burn"&gt;third degree burns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on his arms, torso and legs. Guardsmen, familiar with the Fort Wayne burn center, worked with non-profit group, Northeast Indiana Burn Council to raised $18,500 to fly Zia, accompanied by his father Abdul Qahir, to Fort Wayne for treatment.

Upon arrival, he was rushed to the St. Joseph burn unit, where after a few days of recovery from
travel, underwent his first surgery June 23. The second and final surgery was postponed nine
days from an original date of July 2 because the boy developed an infection in one of his wounds,
which is common for burn patients.

The second surgery grafted skin onto burn wounds on Zia's arm, chest and the second toe on his
right foot. Tuesday, doctors said Zia was recovering and appeared to be in good spirits. In
preparation for their planned return trip to Afghanistan in September, doctors are teaching Zia's
father physical therapy techniques needed for further recovery. "Without good therapy, he could
be right back where we started," Dr. John Mancoll, the lead surgeon on the case, said in an
interview with the ♡❤Fort Wayne Journal Gazette♡❤ newspaper.

&lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; has come to a deal with the regional U.S. bank, , to buy Hudson for US$1.9 billion. The new addition will be folding into its&lt;a href="w%3AMaine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3ATD%20Banknorth"&gt;TD Banknorth&lt;/a&gt;, which is 51% owned by TD Financial.

The company's shares had been dropping in the course of the past year because of allegations of &lt;a href="w%3Amoney-laundering"&gt;money-laundering&lt;/a&gt; violations and after an earnings warning, making it a good steal for TD. The acquisition will greatly increased TD's influence in &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;.

This continues the recent trend for Canadian banks expanding into the U.S. where regulation on bank mergers is less strict than in their home country.

"This transaction delivers on our shared vision for growth and marks a significant milestone in TD Banknorth's expansion strategy," TD Bank CEO and president Ed Clark said in a statement.

Of the approximately 700 people wounded in the attacks, only 7 were Australians, however there are many more Aussies spread throughout &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; at any time.

To be eligible for the rebate, the calls must have been made between 6pm &lt;a href="w%3AAEST"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; Thursday the 7th through to 6am Saturday the 8th, according to Telstra chief Sol Trujillo. As well as this, Telstra customers who have a relative who has been hospitalized as a result of the event will be eligible for a rebate for a period of one month from July 7.

Applying for the rebate involves Telstra customers calling a special number which will appear on their next bill. Telstra has been working with the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; to provide further assistance to customers.

At least 127 died early this morning when three trains crashed in a chain reaction in a station near Ghotki in the &lt;a href="w%3ASindh"&gt;Sindh&lt;/a&gt; Province of &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. It is feared the fatality count may rise as high as 200-300 people. Around 800 others were injured, many of them seriously. Officials for &lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20Railways"&gt;Pakistan Railways&lt;/a&gt; told AP that the accident happened at about 4am local time (2300 UTC Tuesday) when an express train from &lt;a href="w%3ALahore"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt; bound for &lt;a href="w%3AKarachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt; crashed into another train which had broke down earlier and was sitting at the station. Almost immediately after, a third train slammed into carriages derailed from the first crash. In total some 13 cars derailed. The incident is blamed on the driver of the Karachi train who reportedly misread a signal.

The line between Lahore and Karachi, the nation's biggest cities, is among the busiest in the country.

It is Pakistan's worst train accident since December 1989 when a crash near Sangi, about 35 miles (56 kilometres) from today's crash site, killed over 400 people.

Reacting to the &lt;a href="Suicide%20attack%20hits%20mall%20in%20Netanya%2C%20Israel"&gt;suicide bombing&lt;/a&gt; yesterday in a Netanya mall, the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israel Defence Forces (IDF)&lt;/a&gt; entered the city of &lt;a href="w%3ATulkarem"&gt;Tulkarem&lt;/a&gt;. The city has been governed by the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority (PA)&lt;/a&gt;, since March 22nd this year.

In addition, a general closure was ordered on the occupied territories of the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;. The closure will hold until the assessment of the situation changes, according to the IDF.

The IDF ordered a curfew on Tulkarem at the beginning of the operation, at 2:30 a.m. (+3 UTC), Palestinians reported. Soldiers announced in loudspeakers that the city was under curfew and that all local residents were to remain inside their homes.

One Palestinian policeman was killed and one was injured, as well as two Israeli soldiers, when the Israeli forces came under fire while entering the city, according to the IDF spokesperson. 

The IDF arrested five wanted &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt; members in the city. According to IDF officers, the operation is aimed at the Islamic Jihad organization, which staged the suicide attack in Netanya yesterday, as well as another suicide bombing attempt in a Jewish settlement in &lt;a href="w%3ASamaria"&gt;Samaria&lt;/a&gt;.

The Israeli government asked the PA to arrest the wanted terrorists numerous times, according to high-ranking officers in the IDF.

"♡❤The main objective is to locate Islamic Jihad members that operate under the shelter of the PA military responsibility♡❤", said Colonel Erez Weiner of the IDF. "♡❤We arrested five wanted members, some of whom were involved in the &lt;a href="Explosion%20in%20central%20Tel%20Aviv%20nightclub"&gt;bombing of the Stage nightclub&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATel-Aviv"&gt;Tel-Aviv&lt;/a&gt;. The forces are also trying to locate the explosives lab that is behind yesterday's car-bomb in Shavey Shomron. Apart from a few minor incidents we did not meet any opposition from the Palestinian side♡❤", Colonel Weiner said.

The suicide bombings in Netanya and Shavey Shomron and the reoccupation of Tulkarem follow five months of relative calm in the Israel-PA relations.

The 'Return to Flight' mission for the Space Shuttle ♡❤Discovery♡❤ is to go ahead later today despite an accident on the launch pad yesterday.

At about 5pm EDT Tuesday one of Discovery's cockpit window covers became detached and fell sixty feet. The falling cover struck the left Orbital Maneuvering System pod (situated to one side of the tail fin), damaging several thermal protection tiles. The tiles provide vital protection to the Orbiter as it makes its fiery re-entry to Earth's atmosphere.

A replacement panel was fitted in less than an hour, with the only effect being a delay in rolling back the pad's Rotating Service Structure.

This has been the only issue in the build up to today's launch, the first Shuttle flight since the ♡❤Columbia♡❤ Orbiter broke up during re-entry in February 2003. All crew were lost in that incident, which has been blamed on damage to a wing thermal protection system panel, caused by a block of fuel tank insulation that became detached and hit the Orbiter during the first moments of flight.

♡❤Discovery♡❤ is due to take off at 3.51pm EDT today. The chance of a weather-related delay to the launch has increased to 40% - due to the possibility of thunderstorms in the area.

A nurse from &lt;a href="w%3ASunderland"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; superglued her (now former) boyfriend's eyes shut when he would not stop paying attention to swimsuit clad women while the two were on holiday in .

After an argument, the boyfriend, Disc Jockey Lee Scullion (31), went for an afternoon nap in their hotel room. When he woke up, he discovered that he could not open his eyes and that his watch was glued to his wrist. Glue was also smothered over his lips and nose as well as on his eyelids. In addition, his girlfriend Laura Dunn (26) is reported to have smashed Lee's £650 ($1,128.47 US) digital camera, while he is said to have burned her passport.

Laura Dunn, who is currently working in a care home, said "he wouldn't give me the attention I deserved" and that she "decided to teach him a lesson to remind him not to look at other women." She also said she hoped her career would not be affected by the fight.

A suicide bomber has killed as many as 24 children in Iraq.

According to an Iraqi eyewitness, US troops were handing out sweets to children gathered around their Humvee military vechicle in eastern Baghdad when a bomber drove a car carrying explosives up to the group and detonated his weapon. One US soldier was killed and three more injured.

The local hospital's morgue has received 24 dead children, mostly aged between 10 and 13.

Army spokesman Major Russ Goemaere said "The car bomber made a deliberate decision to attack one of our vehicles as the soldiers were engaged in a peaceful operation with Iraqi citizens."

A Reuters camera man saw the car explode between houses, reducing three to rubble. The area is very poor and the residents are a mixed community of Sunnis, Shia and Christians.

Women were wailing in the street alongside a crumpled child's bicycle and pools of blood after the attack.

Hundreds of distraught parents gathered at the local hospital desperately searching for their children.

One father who lost a son said "Why do they attack our children? They just destroyed one US Humvee, but they killed dozens of our children."

A joint US-Iraq offensive launched in Baghdad in May has considerably reduced the number of suicide bombings, but authorities admit such attacks are hard to eliminate.

A similar car bomb attack in September last year killed at least 34 children in Baghdad. That attack also saw the victims gathering round US troops who were handing out sweets, to mark the opening of a water treatment plant. 

Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said on Tuesday that declining levels of violence in his country were allowing Iraqi security forces to begin taking over duties from US troops in many cities, in a move that may pave the way for withdrawal of Western forces.

Up to 400 members of the &lt;a href="w%3ABorana"&gt;Borana&lt;/a&gt; tribe living across the border in &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; attacked the nomadic Gabra people aiming to steal their livestock. The societies are not monetarized - cattle is the main form of wealth.

The two groups have been fighting over water and pastures for years in the semi-arid land. Cross-border raids for livestock are very common in the area, but it is said that this is one of the most deadly and severe attacks in Kenya's history. The attack may be in retaliation for an earlier raid on the Borana, in which six people were killed.

Whole families were killed in this most recent attack. Okille Hukha survived when he ran into a bush, but his wife and four children were murdered. Darare Bathachas' son, wife and grandson were also killed, but she survived by going under a bed.

A woman watched as her four children were killed, and her husband beheaded. A grandmother spoke of how she hid under a table while her forty year old son, his wife and their nursery school age son were killed.

Ten Borana were later killed in a revenge attack.

Kenyan police are pursuing the attackers, moving on foot in the rugged terrain but supported by three helicopters. Thousands of sheep and goats as well as cattle, camels and donkeys have been recovered.

The Kenyan &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; Society have sent a helicopter carrying medics and supplies to aid the injured in the local hospital.

A boy of 14 has been charged with seven counts of rape. 

Police were granted more time to question the boy, who cannot be named, before charging him with the attacks of four primary school girls in &lt;a href="w%3ASalford"&gt;Salford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AManchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;.

Four children &amp;mdash; one aged 10, two aged 8, and a 7 year-old &amp;mdash; were attacked between 5pm and 6.40pm on Sunday at Mandley Park.

A series of threats have been made to &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; barbers who have been cashing in on the upsurge in popularity of 'Marine' and french hairstyles amongst Baghdad youths. Over the past few weeks barbers were warned not to cut beards and not to offer the western hairstyles, unless they wanted 'swords over their necks'. Many barbers have put up signs saying that taboo haircuts are not available in their shops. Those who flout these threats have been killed.

According to Maj. Col. Abbas Dilemi of the Baghdad Police, some of the extremists have been caught, but they have turned out to be criminals paid by third parties to make the threats and carry out the murders of those who ignore them.

Mr. Mohamed Sa'eed, a leading figure in the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution, has castigated those responsible for the threats saying: 'and now groups from abroad come carrying temporary ideology that did not exist even in the Middle Ages,' then stated that there 'should be no compulsion in religion' whilst calling for juristic and intellectual work to defeat extremism.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Ebbers"&gt;Bernard Ebbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , founder and former CEO of telecommunications giant &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorldCom"&gt;WorldCom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , now MCI, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the corporate accounting fraud totaling &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;11 billion. The once-powerful company plunged into &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in July 2002. 

The sentence was handed down by Manhattan federal court Judge Barbara S. Jones. Mr. Ebbers, who is 63, asked for a lenient sentence due to his failing health and a heart condition, and because of his philanthropy. 

Prosecutors pushed for a life sentence, and said the sentencing "should prove to be a deterrent" to corporate wrongdoing. "The enormity of the crimes that Ebbers committed cannot be overstated: the fraud at WorldCom was the largest securities fraud in history," prosecutors wrote in papers filed last month. 

Jones rejected defense lawyers' contentions that the government overstated the losses, and that Ebbers was not a mastermind of the wrongdoing. Jones believed Ebbers deserved a harsh sentence, and said "Mr. Ebbers was the instigator of the fraud.".

Ebbers appeared to be tense when arriving at the court and even shoved a photographer out of his way. After the sentence was given, Ebbers was seen weeping. His first day of prison will be October 12.

In March, Ebbers was found guilty of fraud, conspiracy, and seven counts of filing false documents with regulators. 

WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy last year under the name &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMCI"&gt;MCI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which was one of the many companies WorldCom had acquired. In May, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVerizon"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; agreed to acquire the company.

Americans pay twice as much for heart-bypass surgery as the socialized Canadian system, with no difference in outcome, according to today's issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine in a study funded by American drug company, &lt;a href="w%3APfizer%20Inc."&gt;Pfizer Inc.&lt;/a&gt;. The research found that heart bypass surgery costs an average of $10,373 in Canada, compared with $20,673 in the United States. Even though the costs were double in the United States, the rate of complications and death following bypass surgery was similar. 

High administrative costs and overtreatment are usually blamed for the higher cost in the profit-driven U.S. system. Americans spent $5,635 per capita on health care in 2003, while only $3,003 was spent by Canadians. Health spending accounts for almost 15 per cent of gross domestic product in the U.S. and just under 10 per cent in Canada; while at the same time, all Canadian residents are full covered. In addition, the average Canadian lives 2 years longer than the average American.

This is one of the first studies directly comparing the costs of surgery in Canada and the United States and it reinforces the view of Dr. Mark Eisenberg, head of cardiovascular epidemiology at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal; "The conventional wisdom is that health care is much more expensive in the U.S. and the conventional wisdom is right." by finding that Canada's socialized system is far more cost efficient than the U.S. model.

The cost of medications used to treat bypass patients were as much as 68 percent greater in the U.S. than in Canada and the cost of a surgical bed was 36 percent greater in the U.S.. In Canada, nursing accounted for 44 percent of the treatment costs, compared with 21 percent in the U.S. and patients stayed longer in hospital following surgery in Canada.

The U.S. space agency &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; called off the launch of &lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20shuttle"&gt;Space shuttle&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤Discovery♡❤ today after a problem with a fuel sensor in the external tank used to detect fuel exhaustion. According to the agency-run NASA TV, the low-fuel sensor was either malfunctioning or damaged. The launch was already facing the threat of a scrub due to thunderstorms in the area.

The sensor is one of four used to trigger the engine cutout after launch. Although only two are required for normal operation, and the Shuttle can be flown with one, NASA elected to maintain full redundancy. Should more of the sensors fail, the engine might burn out due to lack of fuel, a situation that has not been tested.

The problem was detected during a simulation of an empty tank. When placed in a mode simulating an empty tank, three of the sensors correctly registered that the tank was empty, while the faulty sensor stayed in the "full" state. NASA is currently unsure whether the problem relates to the sensor, the instrumentation circuits reporting the sensor's state, or the simulation circuits.

The problem comes after a separate incident yesterday when a cockpit window cover fell from the Orbiter, &lt;a href="Shuttle%20launch%20on%20schedule%20despite%20launch%20pad%20accident"&gt;damaging thermal protection tiles&lt;/a&gt;. A similar problem caused the replacement of the fuel tank in June. NASA described the problem as an "intermittent fault".

The launch, which was scheduled for 3:51 ET (20:51 UTC), would have been the first launch of a shuttle since ♡❤Columbia♡❤&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s February 2003 crash which killed all crew members aboard.

It is still unknown to NASA officials what caused the sensor to become defective. It is also unknown at the moment whether the issue will be fixed on the launch pad, or in the &lt;a href="w%3AVehicle%20Assembly%20Building"&gt;Vehicle Assembly Building&lt;/a&gt; - in which it takes close to a full day's time to transport a shuttle between the two areas.

In the interim, the crew of the shuttle will stay at &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;KSC&lt;/a&gt; unless there are further delays, in which case the crew might be transported back to &lt;a href="w%3ALyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center"&gt;JSC&lt;/a&gt; in Houston for refresher training.

Italian police have launched a swoop on suspected Islamic extremists across Italy. 

About 200 search warrants were issued, with about 175 being detained. It comes a day after the Minister of the Interior &lt;a href="w%3AGiuseppe%20Pisanu"&gt;Giuseppe Pisanu&lt;/a&gt; warned of the potential threat posed by extremists, saying that "terrorism is knocking on Italy's door".

After the 7 July London bombings, a statement was made by an Al Qaida affiliated group claiming responsibility for the London attacks. In it, Denmark and Italy were specifically warned of attacks "in the same way if they do not withdraw their troops from Iraq and Afghanistan."

In other news, a &lt;a href="w%3ABrescia"&gt;Brescia&lt;/a&gt; court jailed two &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Africa"&gt;North Africans&lt;/a&gt; accused of being part of a terror cell planning attacks in Italy. The court jailed another man on lesser charges. Six other North Africans, suspected of being in the same cell, are being tried in &lt;a href="w%3ACremona"&gt;Cremona&lt;/a&gt;. 

Of the two convicted, Iman Mohamed Rafik of &lt;a href="w%3AMorocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; was jailed for four years and eight months, while Kamel Hamroui received a sentence of three years and four months. They had been arrested in connection with the 16 May 2003 Al Qaida &lt;a href="w%3ACasablanca%20Attacks"&gt;attacks on Casablanca&lt;/a&gt;, Morocco which killed 45 people, including 12 suicide bombers.

A &lt;a href="w%3Aboxer%20%28dog%29"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt; is missing in &lt;a href="w%3AWestmoreland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Westmoreland County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, after it chased off a bear to protect three children. According to Bill Rusko, the father of two of the children, the bear crossed Route 30 in &lt;a href="w%3ALigonier%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Ligonier Township&lt;/a&gt; and moved towards the three kids as they played badminton. The year-old dog, Major, then ran around the bear to distract it and bit it in the face. As the bear ran back into the woods, the dog chased it. It remains missing; however, neighbors say they saw it in the area. Major is now safe at his home.

Profiles of the suspects in the &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;July 7, 2005 bombings in London&lt;/a&gt; have been released. They are all British nationals.

<h3>The four alleged suicide bombers</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Shahzad Tanweer, 22, attended Leeds Metropolitan University, where he studied sports science.

BULLET::::- Lindsey Germaine: Piccadilly Line train, Jamaican-born resident of Aylesbury.

</ul>
Shahzad and Hasib were reported missing by their families the previous week.

The suspects were caught on surveillance camera arriving at Kings Cross station at 08:30 BST, each carrying military style back packs, on the day of the blasts. The suspects were then seen going their separate ways twenty minutes before the explosions. It is suspected that the delayed fourth bombing aboard a double-decker bus was intended for travelers on the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Line"&gt;Northern Line&lt;/a&gt;, which had been suspended earlier that morning.

A husband and wife team from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStafford%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Stafford County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; were arrested Wednesday on charges they sold authentic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADriver%27s%20license"&gt;driver's licenses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to illegal immigrants and others for between $2,000 and $3,500. 

Francisco J. Martinez, 57, a manager of a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Motor%20Vehicles"&gt;Department of Motor Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (DMV) service center in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpringfield%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Springfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and his wife Miriam Martinez, 56, a former DMV employee, allegedly sold 50 fraudulent licenses, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APersonal%20identity"&gt;ID’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , since January 2004. They face federal charges of conspiring to commit identification fraud, a possible 15 years in prison and a fine up to $250,000.

The break in the case was made when police arrested Daniel Jose Guardia Lopez, 25, on June 13. Lopez, an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexandria%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; resident, is an illegal immigrant from &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;. He pleaded guilty Monday for his involvement in the fraud, and turned informer after confessing to acting as a gatekeeper that arranged for other illegals to obtain phony ID’s through the Martinez couple.

This is the second incident in as many years where the selling of phony ID’s was uncovered in Virginia. The need for awareness was raised when it was learned that seven of the nineteen hijackers involved in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; attacks had Virginia ID’s. U.S. Attorney Paul J. McNulty, speaking on the federal crackdown that has ensued, said “A few years ago, one could fraudulently obtain a driver’s license for about $100.” Obtained legally, they cost $20. He called “reprehensible” the alleged actions of the Martinez couple. 

Court documents for the case record that Lopez, who worked as a construction worker, would collect the ID fee from other illegal Bolivians, and keep $500 for himself. He would then steer the person to the service center where Mr. Martinez worked. Martinez, a longtime employee and 4-year supervisor, would often fill out the immigrant’s application, and falsely certify that an ID from another state was surrendered.

Lopez became involved with the Martinez’s when his own driving privileges had been suspended. He met Miriam, who arranged to have a new ID issued to him, through her husband. A working relationship developed between the two, and Miriam would call Lopez and tell him when to appear at the DMV service center with clients who followed behind him in the scheme. The arrest of Lopez was unknown to Miriam when he made a monitored call to her and said he had 2 cousins from Bolivia. This ultimately led to undercover agents, who posed as the cousins, being issued ID’s by Francisco, her husband. During this &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asting%20operation"&gt;sting operation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the 2 agents paid $6,000 and presented no identification.

Virginia DMV spokeswoman, Pam Goheen, said one of the steps taken to beef up enforcement and auditing efforts at service centers is to have all applications double checked by "document verifiers". Goheen said, "There is a heightened awareness of the importance of a driver's license," and called the arrests "unfortunate and disappointing".

Miriam Martinez was a clerk at a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATysons%20Corner%2C%20VA"&gt;Tysons Corner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; DMV service center for 2 years ending in 1998, and then again briefly in 2003. The earlier incident of ID fraud stemmed out of that location. Both cities, Tysons Corner and Alexandria, are within commuting distance to &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has announced that 150 &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Special%20Air%20Service%20Regiment"&gt;SAS&lt;/a&gt; personnel will be serving in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; within two months, and a further 200 troops will follow them by early next year. According to Mr Howard the decision is the result of a request from the United States and others. 

Opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; has said that &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; supported the plan. Mr Beazley has been critical of the government in recent weeks because of its military focus on &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; rather than Afghanistan, which he says is the source of the terrorist threat. 

Beazley offered that it has been "obvious for some time that the job was only partially completed when the commitment was made earlier." 

The commitment comes amid a resurgence of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; and an increase in &lt;a href="w%3AInsurgency"&gt;insurgency&lt;/a&gt; activities in Afghanistan. 

"The progress that has been made in the establishment of a legitimate government in Afghanistan has come under increasing attack and pressure from the Taliban - and some elements of &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;," Mr Howard said. 

The additional troop commitment has been welcomed by the Afghani government. Lutfullah Mashal, Afghanistan's Interior Ministry spokesman, said that assistance with security or reconstruction and development is always welcome, however he expressed disappointment that the deployment would only be for 12 months. Mr Howard has said that he does not like to make open ended commitments, and also stated that extra security would be needed for the &lt;a href="w%3AAPEC"&gt;APEC&lt;/a&gt; summit in 2007. 

"At the time of the APEC meeting and in the months leading up to it, the need in this country is for a heightened elite security capacity," he said.

A two-minute silence at noon BST (UTC+1) has been marked by millions across the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; to remember those who died last Thursday in the London attacks.

In &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, all buses and cabs came to halt, and all people in their offices stood outside. Trains were not stopped but the two-minute silence was announced and marked through the underground and overground services. Aeroplanes delayed their takeoff to respect the two-minute silence.

At the bombing sites, wreaths were laid in respect, with hundreds gathering at the sites to mark the silence.

&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Emily"&gt;Hurricane Emily&lt;/a&gt; has hit the small eastern &lt;a href="w%3ACarribean"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href="w%3AGrenada"&gt;Grenada&lt;/a&gt;. The hurricane, which has been upgraded to Category 2 status, hit the island early this morning and has caused widespread damage. It has been reported that many buildings have lost their roofs and there has been much flooding.

The storm affected the northern parishes of St. Patrick's and St. Andrew's the worst and also caused considerable damage to the nearby islands of &lt;a href="w%3ACarriacou"&gt;Carriacou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APetite%20Martinique"&gt;Petite Martinique&lt;/a&gt;. No fatalities have yet been reported. Earlier this year &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Dennis"&gt;Hurricane Dennis&lt;/a&gt; hit &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHaiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, leaving 41 people dead.

Last year &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Ivan"&gt;Hurricane Ivan&lt;/a&gt; devastated the island and resulted in the deaths of 39 people. 

Emily is the fifth tropical storm to develop this hurricane season. It was the earliest time on record that five named storms had formed in the Atlantic. Emily, along with Dennis, reached hurricane status. Arlene, Bret and Cindy remained tropical storms. 

The British &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;, which usually deploys two ships to the Caribbean, has placed the destroyer &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Liverpool%20%28D92%29"&gt;HMS Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; and the tanker &lt;a href="w%3ARFA%20Wave%20Knight%20%28A389%29%29"&gt;RFA Wave Knight&lt;/a&gt; on standby. During Hurricane Frances and Ivan last year, &lt;a href="w%3AHMS%20Richmond%20%28F239%29"&gt;HMS Richmond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARFA%20Wave%20Ruler%20%28A390%29"&gt;RFA Wave Ruler&lt;/a&gt; were actively involved in humanitarian relief. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Mitchell"&gt;Keith Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; of Grenada had effectively run his country for seven hours from Richmond after his home had been destroyed.

<h1>Rail manslaughter charges are dropped in Hatfield, England</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rail%20manslaughter%20charges%20are%20dropped%20in%20Hatfield%2C%20England&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Charges against the five rail bosses accused of manslaughter on four people who died in the Hatfield, England train crash, have been dropped at the Old Bailey. 

Alistair Cook, 50, Sean Fugill, 50, Keith Lea, 53, and two executives from Balfour Beatty - Anthony Walker, 46, and Nicholas Jeffries, 53 all denied the manslaughter charges. A charge of corporate manslaughter has also been dropped against the engineering firm Belfour Beatty. 

But the five men and their employers, &lt;a href="w%3ABalfour%20Beatty"&gt;Balfour Beatty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARailtrack"&gt;Railtrack&lt;/a&gt;, still face health and safety charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act.

Four people were killed and many more were injured when a high speed train travelling from Leeds to London derailed just outside &lt;a href="w%3AHatfield"&gt;Hatfield&lt;/a&gt; on 17 October 2000. An investigation after the crash found that a cracked section of rail caused the train to come off the tracks.

After five months on trial, the judge Mr Justice Mackay told the jury to find the men not guilty, saying: 

"It is not open to you to convict any of the six defendants on charges of manslaughter"

He added: "I must ask you to accept my ruling, which does not affect one way or the other the important decisions you will have to make when considering verdicts on the health and safety counts." 

Mr Justice Mackay made the decision after reviewing the evidence and listening to submissions.

The collapse of yet another high-profile corporate case will more than likely put pressure for changes to current laws to make it easier to prosecute in corporate manslaughter cases. Work on new corporate manslaughter legislation has been under way for more than a decade in response to the problems encountered in bringing successful prosecutions. The latest proposals would criminalise gross management failure and the government has promised legislation before the end of next year.

&lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; has joined the controversy over a mod for &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto%3A%20San%20Andreas"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; called "Hot Coffee" which disables the game's built-in censorship mode, allowing players to participate in graphic sex mini-games within the game.

The ESRB have continued to state that they are not intending to take any action against Take2 Interactive (the game's producers). 

Patricia Vance, the president of the ESRB, said that the author of the modification "actually had to change the underlying code [of the game]. It's not a cheat, It's not an Easter egg... Game developers have been known to deactivate parts of their code without removing them from the finished products. Oftentimes, changes are toward the end of development, and they program workarounds."

Four &lt;a href="w%3AteleSUR"&gt;Telesur&lt;/a&gt; promotions have caused controversy in sectors of the Colombian government. The network, financed by the governments of &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, started its test broadcastings on May 24 from &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt;. It is expected that the channel will begin its definitive programming on July 24.

The promos are:

Telesur says that its purpose is counterbalanceing to the giants of the news agency in America, like CNN or Univisión. Colombian organisms of intelligence declared to the newspaper El Tiempo that in the channel "there are subjects related to the national and international terrorism" and the channel "shows a negative image of Colombia".

TeleSur already signed an agreement with two regional Colombian channels: the Channel Capital, from Bogota, and the Telepacífico, who transmits to west of Colombia from &lt;a href="w%3ACali"&gt;Cali&lt;/a&gt;. According to the agreement the Colombian channels will transmit part of the Telesur programming.

The manager of the Channel Capital, Héctor Pinilla, said that the channel 's directive board will decide the contents of the channel TelesUR which will be transmitted by the regional station. As to the controversy, Pinilla said: " the government sometimes suffers of too much excitement of pursuit. Let it act freely, not on behalf of the extremist sectors, but yes on behalf of the press freedom ".

A building being prepared for demolition collapsed this morning in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;'s Upper West Side around 9 a.m. EDT. Five people are known to be injured from the accident, as well as one rescue worker who was injured in the aftermath. None of the injuries were life-threatening.

The building was a supermarket, which was being taken down to make room for a high-rise building, something that residents took issue with. The roof, front wall, and scaffolding all fell to the ground, as stated by Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta.

Soon after the incident at least 100 police and fire department personnel combed the wreckage for more victims, using search and rescue dogs to find people by scent. They quickly accounted for the twenty-five construction workers who were working on the supermarket. Most of the victims' injuries were broken bones, including one person who broke all four extremities.

Subway lines 1, 2, and 3 have been closed or redirected in response, along with the M104 bus.

About 200 cars were burned by young people on the night of July 13 in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A%C3%8Ele-de-France%20%28r%C3%A9gion%29"&gt;Île-de-France&lt;/a&gt;, the metropolitan area of &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. As the police cars arrived, youths began to pelt the vehicles with rocks, firecrackers and bottles. Rioters broke store windows at Argenteuil. Police used flash-balls and smoke grenades. The riots ended with 70 men being arrested. A police officer was wounded by a rocket and was taken to hospital. Shop windows were broken at &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArgenteuil"&gt;Argenteuil&lt;/a&gt;. It is not the first time vehicles have been attacked on 13-14 July in France.

A coordinated Palestinian attack of four Qassam &lt;a href="w%3Arocket"&gt;rockets&lt;/a&gt; and more than 20 &lt;a href="w%3AMortar%20%28weapon%29"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt; shells took place around 6 p.m. IST (+3 UTC). The weapons were fired at the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; collective farms of Netiv Ha'asara and Nahal Oz, as well as other villages and military bases across the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; border.

A 22-year-old woman, Dana Galkovitz, was killed when her home suffered a direct hit by one of the rockets. One person was lightly injured and three others were treated for anxiety.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; both claimed resposibitily for the attack. However, the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israel Defense Forces (IDF)&lt;/a&gt; claim that the attack was carried out by the &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;. "♡❤The Hamas has revealed its true face, from now on we will act against it freely♡❤", an IDF source said.

According to Palestinan militants, the attack avenges the killing of a militant leader by the IDF in Nablus, in the aftermath of Tuesday's &lt;a href="Suicide%20attack%20hits%20mall%20in%20Netanya%2C%20Israel"&gt;suicide attack on the city of Netanya&lt;/a&gt;.

This attack is a further blow to the fragile cease-fire between Israel and the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority (PA)&lt;/a&gt;, which has been in place since February this year.

During the past 4 years, thousands of mortar shells and rockets have been fired on Israeli towns and villages by Palestinian militant organizations.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20General%20of%20Canada"&gt;Governor General of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdrienne%20Clarkson"&gt;Adrienne Clarkson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; signed an ordinance today removing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Ahenakew"&gt;David Ahenakew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from membership in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20Canada"&gt;Order of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Ahenakew becomes the second person to be stripped of the honor; former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANHLPA"&gt;NHLPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Eagleson"&gt;Alan Eagleson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was the first to be removed in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A1998"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Eagleson admitted guilt on charges of extortion and obstructing justice.

Ahenakew was removed from the Order three days after being convicted of charges of willing promoting hatred against the Jewish people. The charges stem from comments made to a reporter in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2002"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJews"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Ahenakew stated that Jews were "a disease" and that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHitler"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was trying to "clean up the world" when he "fried six million of those guys." 

The Advisory Council of the Order of Canada met on June 29 at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARideau%20Hall"&gt;Rideau Hall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the residence of the Governor General, to discuss Ahenakew's fate. After the meeting, Ahenakew was sent a letter, asking for him to respond to the possible revocation or surrender his membership voluntarily. A deadline for Ahenakew to respond was set at July 9, which Ahenakew did not. That led to Governor General signing the ordinance to remove Ahenakew from the Order. Ahenakew has to surrender his Order &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainsignia"&gt;insignia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which consists of a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amedal"&gt;medal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , lapel pin, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ascroll"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Ahenakew loses the right to use &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apost-nominal%20letters"&gt;post-nominal letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in his name, and loses the right to use the Order &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amotto"&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in his personal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acoat%20of%20arms"&gt;coat of arms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; released two photographs at 15:30 today as a result of an intense investigation into London bomb attacks of last week. The photographs show Hassib Hussain who is believed to be bomber of London bus #30. The first photograph is a passport photo of Hasib Hussain and the second shows is a crop of a &lt;a href="w%3AClosed-circuit%20television"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt; image from &lt;a href="w%3ALuton"&gt;Luton&lt;/a&gt; station at 7:20 on the day of the attack.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; claimed in a statement that they believe that the 18 year old traveled from West Yorkshire in the company of three men. He was seen at &lt;a href="w%3ALuton%20Railway%20Station"&gt;Luton Station&lt;/a&gt; at 07.20 on the morning of the bombings. Police are trying to gain more eyewitness information and have asked the public to call the telephone number: 0800 789321 (+44 800 789321 if outside the UK) if they saw Hussain last Thursday around the &lt;a href="w%3AKings%20Cross%20railway%20station"&gt;Kings Cross&lt;/a&gt; area. 

The Metropolitan Police made a request for any additional information about Hasib's whearabouts after he left Luton.

"We need to establish his movements between 8.26am at King's Cross and 9.47am on the #30 bus when the explosion occurred.
Did you see this man at King's Cross? Was he alone or with others? Do you know the route he took from the station? Did you see him get on to a #30 bus? And if you did, where and when was that."

One hundred students from &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; who decide to pursue graduate studies abroad will get €15,000 a year scholarships from the Fund for Young Talents. Students who wish to apply must have at least an 8.5 GPA on 5 to 10 scale, and must be younger than 26. Additionally, students must commit to work in Serbia for at least 5 years after finishing their graduate studies. 

Scholarship will be awarded based on the student's GPA and the prestige of the university to which they apply. Also, one thousand university seniors will be awarded €250 a month. 

The secretary of the Serbian Student Union, Marko Milovanović, is satisfied with this action, but also notes that it would be better if economic needs of students were taken into account as well.

The Fund for Young Talents will provide funding to about 2.5% of students in Serbia.

&lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Active"&gt;First Active&lt;/a&gt; has become the first financial institution to offer 100% mortgages in the Republic of &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The bank previously offered 100% financing to professionals in finance and medicine, but is now to offer this product to anyone who can afford to meet the repayments.

The development is a huge boost for first time home buyers who have been struggling to get on the Irish property market in recent years due to the rapid increase in house prices. A typical first time buyer in &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; with 92% financing would normally have to put down a deposit of €20,000-€30,000 in cash, but now have the option to produce no deposit.

First Active has said that 100% mortgages will be available across its entire range of mortgage products.

Note however that this is not necessarily an entirely positive development.

The United States and most of Europe have experienced a housing price bubble in recent years. A bubble occurs when buyers purchase a property not because its price is appropriate for its actual value but because they expect the price to significantly rise in the short term permitting resale with a profit.

In other words, the prices people pay for properties becomes divorced from the real value of the property; the purchase is speculative and depends purely upon the expectation that people will continue to buy properties in this way (e.g. without proper consideration of their real value).

The terrible weakness in this is that when the market corrects itself and prices fall to a level where properties are being priced at their actual realistic value, anyone holding a property loses a great deal of money, since the price they paid does not reflect the actual realistic value of the property.

This kind of shock to the housing market is extremely undesirable. Significant write downs in the value of property often significantly depress the economy as a whole.

Less than 100% mortgages force buyers to invest a significant amount of money in the act of purchasing their house, which tends to discourage purely speculative purchasing, thus helping to mediate house price bubbles.

With 100% financing, anyone who can meet repayments can speculatively purchase a property. This naturally encourages pricing bubbles.

<h1>NHL lockout ends</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NHL%20lockout%20ends&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; and its players &lt;a href="w%3Alabor%20union"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANHL%20Players%20Association"&gt;NHL Players Association&lt;/a&gt;, came to a long sought-after agreement Wednesday over a new &lt;a href="w%3ANHL%20Collective%20Bargaining%20Agreement"&gt;NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, ending a &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League%20labor%20dispute%20%282004-05%29"&gt;bitter and damaging 301-day lockout&lt;/a&gt; of the players. The agreement came after a all-night negotiation session with the union. However, the deal must still be ratified by owners and players. A vote for ratification will be held on Thursday, July 21, 2005.

The deal includes a &lt;a href="w%3Asalary%20cap"&gt;salary cap&lt;/a&gt; for players. The combined salary of all players in the league cannot exceed 54% of league-wide revenue. Players who are still under contract will have a 24% rollback.

Also in the proposed deal are some rule changes. Smaller goaltending equipment, making two-line passes across the neutral zone (fom blue-line to blue-line) legal, and shootouts at the end of an overtime period in the case of tie games are all rules that will probably be enacted when the new season begins.

The lockout was very damaging to the NHL. The league became the first United States sport organization to cancel an entire season. It is the second time the &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Cup"&gt;Stanley Cup&lt;/a&gt; has not been awarded: the first time was in 1919 during an &lt;a href="w%3Ainfluenza"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; outbreak.

Shortly after midnight (UTC +3) the &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Air%20Force"&gt;Israeli Air Force (IAF)&lt;/a&gt; attacked several &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; targets in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;. The attack was in reaction to the &lt;a href="Palestinian%20rocket%20attack%20kills%20Israeli%20woman"&gt;rocket and mortar attack on Israel today&lt;/a&gt;. No injuries or fatalities were reported.

One of the buildings that were attacked is an ammunition warehouse in Khan-Yunus and another one is an office of the Hamas in the &lt;a href="w%3AJabalia"&gt;Jabalia&lt;/a&gt; refugee camp, the &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)&lt;/a&gt; reported.

Six &lt;a href="w%3Amissile"&gt;missiles&lt;/a&gt; were fired from &lt;a href="w%3Agunship"&gt;helicopter gunships&lt;/a&gt;, according to Palestinian sources. The missiles at Jebalia were fired on a Hamas religion studies center and the others were fired on a rocket launch site near the Khan-Yunus cemetery. A third firing was at an empty building in the &lt;a href="w%3ADeir%20el-Balah"&gt;Deir el-Balah&lt;/a&gt; area.

Electric power was lost in wide parts of &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;.

The IDF has decided to divide the Gaza Strip into three parts in order to prevent the passage of weapons and militants between different parts of the strip. This is the first time in months that the IDF has taken such a step, which is a burden on the Palestinian civil population.

<h1>Wilson calls for Rove removal</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wilson%20calls%20for%20Rove%20removal&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

U.S. Federal grand jury testimony by Karl Rove was reported in the press Friday detailing testimony by Karl Rove on the Plame "leak". The information was obtained by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on the condition of anonymity because of grand jury hearing secrecy. The reported source was in the legal profession.
The press reports followed Thursday's televised call by former U.S. Ambassador &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20C.%20Wilson"&gt;Joseph Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, the husband of one-time CIA operative Valerie Plame, for President Bush to honor his word to remove any official involved in the Plame leak. 

On Thursday's ♡❤NBC's "Today"♡❤ show, Wilson said it was time for the President to "stand up and prove to the American people that his word is his bond and fire Karl Rove." and "this cover-up is becoming unraveled. That's why you see the White House stonewalling."

Amid refusals by President Bush or his &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; press secretary &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; to comment on the on-going investigation into the Plame leak, the Bush overall approval rating, now at 45%, has slipped one point from May. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20News"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ poll found for the first time that 45% chose poor, versus 41% good, for rating the president as "honest and straightforward". His disapproval rating, now 49%, is up 2 points.

American support for the war effort in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; remains strong, at 57 to 42% in favor. And the majority believe the war in Iraq is part of the broader goal of battling global terrorism by a margin of 61 to 34 %.

Given the favorable opinion ratings on the war, the current furor in the press and by partisan &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; are questions about personal accountability, and not about U.S. war policy. Bush has so far demonstrated by his silence that he is willing to let the matter of Rove be settled by the court.

Special Prosecutor &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of the federal probe seeking what is believed to involve two officials at the White House. At issue concerning Rove is whether he broke the &lt;a href="w%3AIntelligence%20Identities%20Protection%20Act"&gt;Intelligence Identities Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;. The act makes it a felony crime for Rove to intentionally and knowingly leak the identity of Plame. At the time, Plame was a &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; Counter-proliferation Division employee.

Fitzgerald is not obliged to publicly reveal any information on testimony received during grand jury hearings on the matter, and has not commented. What is known is that &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Cooper"&gt;Matt Cooper's&lt;/a&gt; reporting notes sent by e-mail to his employer ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATIME"&gt;TIME&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ magazine show that Rove identified Judith Plame as "Wilson's wife", and from the context of their conversation, Cooper's notes report that she "apparently works" at the CIA. Whether he revealed that Plame was a covert agent remains to be found. 

Mr. Wilson has from the start shown his willingness to comment on the actions of the Bush administration. From his July 2003 Op-Ed piece, which started this whole affair, he was critical of statements made by Bush during his &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20the%20Union%20Address"&gt;State of the Union Address&lt;/a&gt;. Then in August 2003 after his wife's covert cover was blown, came his angry statement to try and get &lt;a href="w%3AKarl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt; "frog-marched out of the White House in handcuffs". 

On Tuesday this week, during the heightened controversy from the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ordered release by ♡❤TIME♡❤ of Cooper's notes, Wilson said "that Rove was intimately involved in the smear campaign launched after the [Novak] article appeared," according ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20News"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ report. "Now to find out he talked to Matt Cooper before then only compounds the outrage at the abuse of power." Wilson's statements were made off camera.

&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Futebol%20Clube"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="w%3ACopa%20Libertadores%20de%20Am%C3%A9rica"&gt;Copa Libertadores de América&lt;/a&gt; competition, beating &lt;a href="w%3AClube%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Paranaense"&gt;Atlético Paranaense&lt;/a&gt; in the second round of the Final match at home with a score of 4-0. The first round between the Brazilian teams was drawn 1-1 at Atletico's stadium.

Amoroso opened the scoring for Sao Paolo in the 17th minute. On the 45th minute, as the game approached half time, Atletico were awarded a controversial penalty, however, fate would fall Sao Paolo's way as Atletico missed their chance to draw the game level.

Fabao scored a wonder goal for Sao Paolo in the 53rd minute to make it 2-0, and by now, Atletico seemed out of it.

Luizao &amp; Diego Tardelli completed the 4-0 drubbing late on, in what could have been a momentous night for Atletico, turned horribly wrong. 

Sao Paolo came out winners and are crowned South American champions for the 2004/2005 season. Sao Paolo will go on to face Liverpool later this year to decide the World Club Championship. Liverpool is this season's European champions.

The amendment would have revoked access to classified information from federal employees who disclose the information to unauthorized sources. This followed an attempt by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Senators to strip &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Staff"&gt;White House Deputy Chief of Staff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt; of his security clearance.

The amendment comes as &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; declined to reaffirm his pledge to fire any official involved in the leaking of covert &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href="Valerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; after documents &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asubpoena"&gt;subpoenaed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; named his chief advisor Karl Rove as a source of the leak.

In a press briefing on September 29th, 2004, White House spokesman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in response to the question "Scott, has anyone &amp;mdash; has the president tried to find out who outed the CIA agent? And has he fired anyone in the White House yet?", stated that "The president has set high standards, the highest of standards for people in his administration.

Bush said that "If somebody did leak classified information, I'd like to know it, and we'll take the appropriate action." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030930-9.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nytimes.com/2005/07/14/politics/14rove.html%3Fex%3D1278993600%26amp%3Ben%3Dfe3da3650fdea52a%26amp%3Bei%3D5090%26amp%3Bpartner%3Drssuserland%26amp%3Bemc%3Drss"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302343.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; however, misrepresented Bush's promise as a promise to fire only those administration officials who "knowingly" or "illegally" disclosed Plame's identity.

In a press conference this Monday, White House spokesman Scott McClellan was asked if the president stood by his statements made in September 2003, in light of recent evidence that Karl Rove was involved in the leak. Scott McClellan declined to reaffirm this policy, citing an ongoing investigation.

Pressed to explain its statements of two years ago that Rove wasn't involved in the leak, the White House refused to do so.

"If I were to get into discussing this, I would be getting into discussing an investigation that continues and could be prejudging the outcome of the investigation," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.

The statements made by Scott McClellan two years ago were made during the investigation that continues and may have prejudiced the outcome of the investigation. When reporters asked McClellan to explain this inconsistency, McClellan gave the same response. When asked if the Administration was told not to discuss the investigation while it was ongoing ♡❤after♡❤ he claimed that Karl Rove was not involved in the leak, and not before, Scott McClellan gave the same response. &lt;a href="http%3A//rawstory.com/news/2005/TRANSCRIPT_WHITE_HOUSE_GRILLED_0711.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Senate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leader &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; added this amendment to the Bill:

Senate Majority Leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATennesse"&gt;Tenn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ., amended the amendment:

The first part of this amendment was in response to Joe Wilson's correction of George W. Bush's representation of his and his associates' intelligence assessment regarding &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYellowcake%20forgery"&gt;uranium in Niger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The second was in response to recent criticism of the treatment of prisoners in detention facilities operated by the United States, most notably at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by officials including Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Durbin"&gt;Richard Durbin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The Republican-controlled Senate ultimately voted down both amendments on July 14th.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Representative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARush%20Holt"&gt;Rush Holt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;D-N.J.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has introduced legislation for an investigation that would compel senior administration officials to turn over records relating to the Plame disclosure.

&lt;a href="w%3ATorino%20Calcio"&gt;Torino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AF.C.%20Messina"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt; are facing the risk of expulsion from &lt;a href="Serie%20A"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; because of fraud. Both clubs submitted false financial information to the Serie A management.

Covisoc, the body who must ratify that all clubs have the funds necessary to be registered for the new season, have found problems with both outfits.

As it stands now, they are not part of the Italian First Division but the pair have submitted an appeal on July 12 against the initial decision.

A final verdict on whether the clubs can compete in the top-flight next term is expected on July 15.

Numerous other clubs in lower Divisions are facing similar problems, with &lt;a href="w%3AA.C.%20Perugia"&gt;Perugia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASalernitana%20Sport"&gt;Salernitana&lt;/a&gt; risking demotion from &lt;a href="w%3ASerie%20B"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 20 clubs are in trouble in &lt;a href="w%3ASerie%20C"&gt;Serie C&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Serie%20A"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; champions &lt;a href="Juventus"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed the $24,000,000 (£13,700,000, €20,000,000) capture of &lt;a href="Arsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; captain &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Vieira"&gt;Patrick Vieira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The central midfielder, who will now partner Brazilian - Emerson, has signed a 5 year contract at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStadio%20Delle%20Alpi"&gt;Stadio Delle Alpi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Juve had been in talks for the 29-year-old for the last few weeks and a deal has been completed.

Vieira will now link up with boss &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFabio%20Capello"&gt;Fabio Capello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; again after a brief stint at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAC%20Milan"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with him almost a decade ago.

The Frenchman joins the side despite being strongly linked with a move to &lt;a href="Real%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; over the last two summers.

Vieira ends his Premiership stay after nine years in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; since he became &lt;a href="Arsene%20Wenger"&gt;Arsene Wenger&lt;/a&gt;'s first signing at Arsenal.

A new format will be in place this year for the &lt;a href="w%3ACoppa%20Italia"&gt;Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt; (TIM Cup).

72 clubs will take part - all 20 from &lt;a href="w%3ASerie%20A"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;, all 22 from &lt;a href="w%3ASerie%20B"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt;, and 30 clubs from &lt;a href="w%3ASerie%20C"&gt;Serie C&lt;/a&gt;.

All but the 8 Serie A clubs participating in &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA"&gt;UEFA's&lt;/a&gt; European competitions will begin play in the first elimination round. Those 8 will not join until the Round of 16.

The clubs will be seeded 1 (Inter, as defending champion) through 72 with matchups determined accordingly (not through a random draw). So in the first round, #9 seed will play #72, #10 vs #71, etc.

The first three rounds will be just one match, at the field of the lower-seeded team. Overtime and penalties will resolve ties (not replays). From the Round of 16 on, ties will be home-and-away.

The calendar:

Following an attack on Israel by Palestinian militants, &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority (PA)&lt;/a&gt; Interior Minister Nasser Yousef has declared a state of emergency. Yousef claims militants opened fire on PA security forces when the security forces stopped the militants firing rockets into Israel. In the firefight 6 militants were injured. Other firefights have broken out in northern Gaza. The &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israel Defense Forces (IDF)&lt;/a&gt; blame &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; militants for the attacks.

A masked militant in Gaza City told reporters "Resistance is legal and as long as the Zionists are violating the Hudna, or truce, no one would prevent us from responding to these violations, and we would cut the arms of those who would try to halt us".

He said this is definitely a strategic energy power move by &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, and it was not for economic gain. Others are still worried about EMP.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;U.S. Treasury Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20W.%20Snow"&gt;John Snow&lt;/a&gt; heads a committee that can block the takeover. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; passed a measure in June by a wide margin to form the committee under Snow. U.S. national security concerns are at stake according to analysts and many conservatives.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; reluctance to allow China's unsolicited bid for an American oil company surprises some. When Russia claimed their own oil companies could not be bought by Americans for both "strategic" and "national security" reasons, the United States was vehemently opposed to that position.

Kenyans living near a village where 76 people died in a massacre on Tuesday have fled their homes.
6,000 people from around Turbi village in north-eastern Kenya have gone to Marsabit, the nearest large town. 
Two men were killed in revenge attacks on Thursday, police said and more huts have been burnt in Turbi. 
Security forces in armoured cars and helicopters are pursuing the raiders.

The tree said to have sheltered the &lt;a href="w%3ATolpuddle%20Martyrs"&gt;Tolpuddle Martyrs&lt;/a&gt; when they met in an attempt to form one of the world's first trade unions has been dated for the first time. The Sycamore Tree is still alive and is under the care of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt; in the village of &lt;a href="w%3ATolpuddle"&gt;Tolpuddle&lt;/a&gt;, Dorset, UK. The Trust calculates that the tree is around 320 years old meaning that it would have been 150 years old when the Martyrs met in 1834.

The story of the Tolpuddle Martyrs is important to many trade unionists in the UK and across the globe. An annual festival is organised in the village by the &lt;a href="w%3ATUC"&gt;Trades Union Congress&lt;/a&gt; (the umbrella body for trade unions in the UK) attended by thousands of people. 

Nigel Costley, the regional secretary of the South West TUC, was quoted as saying: "The Tolpuddle Tree is one of the most famous trees in the country because it was under there that the Martyrs met - a move that led to their deportation, pardon, and ultimately the foundation of the trade union movement."

There were six men in the group who came to be known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs. They were all farm labourers and lived in poverty. Their leader, George Loveless, decided to set up a union to give the labourers bargaining strength over their wages. Labour associations had been legalised but the men were arrested under a law forbidding the swearing of oaths. They were tried and deported to &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; but were released in 1836.

<h1>Possible 'mastermind' of London bombings captured in Egypt</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Possible%20%27mastermind%27%20of%20London%20bombings%20captured%20in%20Egypt&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The alleged mastermind behind the London bombings was reported captured in &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; last week. Police believe that a U.S. trained chemist, &lt;a href="w%3AMagdi%20Asdi%20el-Nashar"&gt;Magdi Asdi el-Nashar&lt;/a&gt;, 33, helped build the bombs that killed over 50 people. 

Mr. el-Nashar, who has a PhD from &lt;a href="w%3ALeeds%20University"&gt;Leeds University&lt;/a&gt;, left &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; two weeks before the bombings. After the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;London bombings&lt;/a&gt;, British authorities initiated a worldwide manhunt that found him in Cairo. State security officials reported they have begun questioning el-Nashar with British agents in attendance.

Mr. el-Nashar arrived in Britain in October 2000 to study for his doctorate, which he was awarded in May. A university spokesperson said he was doing "environmentally friendly research involving chemically inactive substances."

The Egyptian interior ministry has said "[Mr] el-Nashar denied having any relation with the latest events in London. He pointed out that all his belongings remained in his apartment in Britain."

Friends of Mr. el-Nashar said he “was well-liked and showed no interest in politics.” His friend, Kadhem Al-Rawi, a doctor in Islamic Principles at the European Institute of Human Sciences in &lt;a href="w%3AWales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; said "He had a great personality. You would never ever expect this kind of action from him. Impossible." This is a recurring theme heard from many of the suspected bombers, families and friends. Many believed the suspects had little or no motive to carry out the attacks.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ security correspondent, Gordon Corera, said it was believed that Mr. el-Nashar handed over keys to a house in &lt;a href="w%3ALeeds"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; that was used by the bombers. British police are searching a house in Leeds linked to Mr. el-Nashar, although he is not yet formally named a suspect. He told questioners that he was on holiday in Egypt and left all his belongings in his apartment, but his plans were to return to Britain. 

The alleged involvement in the attacks by Mr. el-Nashar is yet unclear. Police said they were hunting financiers, supporters and chemists who assembled the bomb used in the attacks. 

<h3>Explosives</h3>

A man injured in the bus bombing in &lt;a href="w%3ATavistock%20Square"&gt;Tavistock Square&lt;/a&gt; died in hospital on Thursday, bringing the number of confirmed victims to 51. Three of the bombers have also been confirmed dead, with the fourth also thought to have died.

Sources have told the BBC that explosives found in one of the homes is from ingredients available from high-street chemists. 

They were the same kind of explosive &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Reid%20%28terrorist%29"&gt;Richard Reid&lt;/a&gt; had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight in 2001.

Anti-terrorist agencies are worried other "educated amateurs" could try to make more of the explosive, as the risk of accidents in the manufacturing process is very high.

<h3>Al-Qaeda operative</h3>

A suspected &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; member may have entered Britain via a Channel port two weeks before the bombs, but was not kept under surveillance. The man apparently left Britain hours before the blasts.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Metropolitan Police commissioner &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Blair"&gt;Sir Ian Blair&lt;/a&gt; said there was nothing connecting the man to the plot, but added that investigators expected to find evidence linking al-Qaeda to the attacks. He said the bombers were only the "foot soldiers" of the operation and the mastermind was still being sought.

"What we've got to find is, who encouraged them, who trained them, and who's the chemist," he said.

He said police would also work with the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; community, which he said had been "close to denial" about extremist preachers, to defeat terrorism. "We will break this horror that has descended upon us," he said.

<h3>Suspects</h3>
The current suspects for carrying out the London bombings are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Mohammad Sidique Khan: Aged 30, from Beeston, Leeds, recently moved to Dewsbury, married with baby. ID found at Edgware Road blast site.

The race in the AL East is alive and well.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; mounted a comeback from an early 4-0 deficit to beat the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Red%20Sox"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;, 8-6, last night, and reduce the Sox' AL East division lead to a mere 1.5 games. The key was the Yankees' hot bats. The Bronx Bombers hit 4 homeruns in total, the last one a thunderous 2-run blast by &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Rodriguez"&gt;Alex Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; off converted Red Sox starter &lt;a href="w%3ACurt%20Schilling"&gt;Curt Schilling&lt;/a&gt;, who was in his first appearance as a relief pitcher after his rehab stint in the minors.

Boston jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead against Yankees starter &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Mussina"&gt;Mike Mussina&lt;/a&gt;, establishing the sort of lead that would usually cause the Yankees to fold during the first half of the season. However, the torrid hitting of the Yankee lineup over the last two weeks would not allow that. Mussina adjusted to the tight strike zone as the game progressed, allowing just one run over the next five innings, and the Yankees chipped away at the BoSox' lead. &lt;a href="w%3ABernie%20Williams"&gt;Bernie Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Giambi"&gt;Jason Giambi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Sheffield"&gt;Gary Sheffield&lt;/a&gt; all hit solo shots off Red Sox starter &lt;a href="w%3ABronson%20Arroyo"&gt;Bronson Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the sixth inning the score was tied, 5-5, and both starters were done for the day. The game would come down to relief pitching.

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Ortiz"&gt;David Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; put the Red Sox ahead in the bottom of the seventh, hitting a bases-empty home run off &lt;a href="w%3ATanyon%20Sturtze"&gt;Tanyon Sturtze&lt;/a&gt; to push the score to 6-5. The Yankees rebounded in the top half of the eighth when Ruben Sierra, pinch-hitting for rookie CF &lt;a href="w%3AMelky%20Cabrera"&gt;Melky Cabrera&lt;/a&gt;, connected for a double, tying the game at 6-all.

Schilling came on in the top of the ninth and promptly hung a 2-2 splitter over the plate for &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Sheffield"&gt;Gary Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;, who lined a double off the wall in left-center. Rodriguez was up next, and hit another splitter that never split. The two-run homer gave the Yankees their first lead of the game. Mariano Rivera came on in the bottom of the ninth and silenced the Red Sox bats by striking out the side to end the game, recording his 21st save.

Boston has lost three straight games and is now 10 games over .500 at 49-39. The Yankees (47-40) have won 8 of 9 games dating back to before the All-Star break and currently sit in 3rd place, half a game behind 2nd-place Baltimore.

♡❤♡Notes:♡❤♡ Rookie Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang, who has been one of the Yankees' most consistent performers, has been placed on the 15-day DL with a shoulder injury. It has been speculated that Wang, who tore his labrum while in the minors, may be out for the season. Wang was slated to start tonight's game, but will be replaced by Tim Redding as he waits for an appointment with Dr. James Andrews on Monday...Former Red Sox manager Joe Kerrigan has been signed by the Yankees as an advance scout. General manager Brian Cashman has said that Kerrigan will be used to analyze film of opponents, not as a coach.

&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; looks to launch it's second manned space mission in October, two years after it's first flight, a newspaper reported Friday. The government planned to launch a two-man crew into orbit in September or October on a five to six day flight. 

The Shenzhou VI capsule will "preferably be launched in early October," said Sun Weigang the director of the Space Department of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, said in the report in the China Daily newspaper. Chinese officials say to they plan to land an unmanned probe on the moon by 2010 and operate a space station.

Research by a team from Canada have published a report in the magazine ♡❤Science♡❤ stating that seabirds are the main carriers of pollution in coastal ponds in the Arctic.

They showed that local sources of pollution are rare, meaning that seabirds played a proportionally greater role in local pollution. They do not produce pollution themselves, rather, they carry in other forms of marine pollution.

The researchers found levels of DDT 60 times higher, 25 times more mercury, and 10 times higher hexachlorobenzene in ponds that seabirds frequented compared to nearby ponds birds did not use.

All the pollution was originally of human origin - industrial or agricultural.

University of California Berkeley scientists confirmed on Wednesday that a cluster of fossilized bones found in Silicon Valley are likely the remains of a &lt;a href="w%3Amammoth"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;.

The giant beast would have roamed the area between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago. A pair of elephant-like tusks, a huge pelvic bone and the animal's rib cage were found by an amateur naturalist while walking a dog along a canal near San Jose's Guadalupe River, near recent flood control dredging. 

It could be the remains of a Columbian mammoth, according to paleontologists who expect to study the site like an archeological "dig," with shovels, sieves and brushes, during the summer of 2005.

A new species of dolphin, the first to be identified these last three decades, has been discovered in Australian waters. 

It was thought that the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20snubfin%20dolphin"&gt;Australian snubfin dolphin&lt;/a&gt; was in fact an &lt;a href="w%3AIrrawady%20dolphin"&gt;Irrawady dolphin&lt;/a&gt; (usually found in Asia and Australia) but DNA tests prove that it is in fact a different species. Its scientific name is &lt;a href="w%3AOrcaella%20heinsohni"&gt;Orcaella heinsohni&lt;/a&gt;, honouring &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Heinsohn"&gt;George Heinsohn&lt;/a&gt;, an Australian biologist who worked at the &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Cook%20University"&gt;James Cook University&lt;/a&gt; on dolphins.

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/rn20030714.shtml"&gt;Novak story&lt;/a&gt; that sparked the contoversy was written on July 14, 2003. The ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/12139861.htm"&gt;Star Telegram&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that Rove talked to Novak on Tuesday July 8, 2003. A &lt;a href="http%3A//kalender-365.de/calendar.php%3Fyy%3D2003"&gt;perpetual calendar&lt;/a&gt; is useful to observe the date. Cooper called Rove 4 days after his talk with Novak. The date of the Rove-Cooper conversation must then have been July 12, 2003.

U.S. grand jury information "leaked" to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ revealed &lt;a href="w%3AKarl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt; spoke to two reporters, rather than the previously thought one reporter &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Cooper"&gt;Matthew Cooper&lt;/a&gt;. It was reported &lt;a href="http%3A//www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8577190/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ with the help of ♡❤MSNBC's "Today"♡❤ show the reporter &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Novak"&gt;Robert Novak&lt;/a&gt; was also spoken to, but without a single date to serve as a reference point. Therefore, a reader who wanted to create a timeline of events to discover the publication date of the Novak story that blew &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plames's&lt;/a&gt; cover is presented with the following puzzle (one date is provided by WN, the date of Wilson's Op-Ed piece):

<ul>
BULLET::::- Novak called Rove on a Tuesday, 6 days before he broke the story. During the Novak-Rove conversation, Novak asked whether Rove heard Plame was an agent. At that time, Rove said he believed that he might have heard the same... he wasn't sure if he did, and if he did, he couldn't remember who it was.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Novak's story containing the Plame "leak" breaks 6 days after the Rove conversation. Two anonymous &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; officials are its sources.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Rove's conversation with Cooper took place 5 days after Wilson's Op-Ed piece in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ ran on July 6, 2003. So Rove spoke with Cooper on July 11, 2003.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Rove's conversation with Cooper takes place 4 days after talking to Novak. So Rove spoke to Novak on July 7, 2003.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The Novak story broke 6 days after he spoke to Rove. So the Novak story broke on July 13, 2003.

A report published today by &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20for%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs"&gt;DEFRA&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ADepartments%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20Government"&gt;UK Government department&lt;/a&gt; finds that transporting food to and around the country has significant social and environmental costs. The report, carried out by external consultancy &lt;a href="w%3Ahttp%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEA%20Technology"&gt;AEA Technology&lt;/a&gt;, estimates these costs to have been £9 billion ($16 billion US) in 2002. The Government says it wants to work with the food industry to reduce social and environmental impacts by 20% by 2012.

The report set out to make an assessment of the impact of food miles and to develop a set of indicators that will show when progress has been made to reduce these negative impacts. The distance that food travels between producer and consumer (food miles) has increased over the past ten years. 

Increasing food miles has been seen as undesirable in and of itself but the report says that the situation is more complex and that the mode of transport has to be taken in to account. The increase in food miles between 1992 and 2002 was associated with increasing levels of congestion and increasing emissions of &lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; while emmissions of some local pollutants such as &lt;a href="w%3ASulfate"&gt;SOx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANOx"&gt;NOx&lt;/a&gt; have declined.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drink%20Federation"&gt;Food and Drink Federation&lt;/a&gt;, which speaks for food manufacturers, was concerned about the focus on food miles but welcomed the "acknowledgement that more local sourcing does not automatically reduce the environmental and social costs associated with food miles." The Federation went on to stress that "on imported ingredients, the usual mode of transport used by food manufacturers is by sea, which does not give rise to any significant impacts. Air transport is generally not used by food manufacturers."

Another industry group, the British Retail Consortium said that retailers would "welcome the opportunity to introduce further transport efficiencies into their operations - always working from the principle that making existing resources work harder makes both good environmental and commercial sense."

Environmental campaign group &lt;a href="w%3AFriends%20of%20the%20Earth"&gt;Friends of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; is worried that the UK Government will not take the firm action it believes is necessary in the light of the report. A statement from the group said "The Government must get tougher to reduce food miles. Unless it tackles this problem the impacts will become worse and Government targets to reduce carbon dioxide levels will be much harder to achieve."

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; representative &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Waxman"&gt;Henry Waxman&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;Cal&lt;/a&gt;) released on Friday a fact sheet from a "&lt;a href="http%3A//www.archives.gov/isoo/training/standard_form_312.html"&gt;briefing booklet&lt;/a&gt;" that Karl Rove received when he signed the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do%3FviewType%3DDETAIL%26amp%3BformId%3D03A78F16A522716785256A69004E23F6"&gt;classified information nondisclosure agreement (SF-312)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Order%2012958"&gt;Executive Order 12958&lt;/a&gt; requires that a person sign this standard form before being granted security clearance. The briefing booklet states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;♡❤Before confirming the accuracy of what appears in the public source, the signer of the SF 312 must confirm through an authorized official that the information has, in fact, been declassified. If it has not, confirmation of its accuracy is also an unauthorized disclosure.♡❤&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The nondisclosure agreement and the executive order require sanctions against security clearance holders who "knowingly, willfully, or ♡❤negligently♡❤" disclose classified information. The sanctions for such a breach include "reprimand, suspension without pay, removal, termination of classification authority, loss or denial of access to classified information, or other sanctions.

The agreement requires that violators be subject to appropriate sanctions, regardless of whether or not they knew they were leaking classified information:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Officers and employees of the United States Government ... shall be subject to appropriate sanctions if they knowingly, willfully, or negligently ... disclose to unauthorized persons information properly classified.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This information was provided to YubaNet by Representative Waxman, and discussed in detail &lt;a href="http%3A//www.yubanet.com/artman/publish/article_22864.shtml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

The case, however, is being tried under the 1982 &lt;a href="w%3A%20Intelligence%20Identities%20Protection%20Act"&gt;Intelligence Identities Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;. The strictest interpretation of the act limits breaking it to
reveal the identity of an undercover agent. There is only one publicly known conviction for the law. &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; employee Sharon Scranage, who pleaded guilty in 1985. She served 8 months out of a 5 year conviction for revealing to her boyfriend the names of other agents while stationed in &lt;a href="w%3AGhana"&gt;Ghana.&lt;/a&gt; 

<h3>Was Plame a covert agent?</h3>

The case is clouded by reckoning on the covert status of &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; when the leak occurred. &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Schumer"&gt;Charles E. Schumer&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="w%3AMew%20York"&gt;N.Y.&lt;/a&gt;) called for an &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; probe 10 days after the July 13, 2003 column by &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Novak"&gt;Robert Novak&lt;/a&gt; identified her as an agent. A &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; native and appointed special prosecutor, &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrik Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; took over the case 19 months ago. That the case continues today says something in itself.

Critics of the investigation believe the case is overblown because it was widely known in Washington social power circles that Plame worked for the CIA. 

A &lt;a href="w%3AMediaMatters"&gt;MediaMatters&lt;/a&gt; report on the widely publicized quote by &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20C.%20Wilson"&gt;Joseph Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, who said, "My wife was not a clandestine officer... ", was misconstrued by the press.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤BLITZER: But the other argument that's been made against you is that you've sought to capitalize on this extravaganza, having that photo shoot with your wife [in the January 2004 Vanity Fair magazine], who was a clandestine officer of the CIA, and that you've tried to enrich yourself writing this book and all of that.♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤What do you make of those accusations, which are serious accusations, as you know, that have been leveled against you?♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤WILSON: My wife was not a clandestine officer the day that Bob Novak blew her identity.♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤BLITZER: But she hadn't been a clandestine officer for some time before that?♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤WILSON: That's not anything that I can talk about. And, indeed, I'll go back to what I said earlier, the CIA believed that a possible crime had been committed, and that's why they referred it to the Justice Department.♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the full context of the above ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; Wolf Blitzer Reports♡❤ televised broadcast, Wilson was responding to mean that &lt;u&gt;after&lt;/u&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Novak"&gt;Robert Novak's&lt;/a&gt; column ran, his wife was no longer a clandestine officer. The &lt;a href="w%3AVanity%20Fair"&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt; coverage given Wilson with wife Plame was a result of the publicity that ensued from the column written by Novack. The photo shoots did not occur before the disclosure, they came in January 2004.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reported the Wilson-Blitzer interview as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤ ...CNN Thursday before the latest revelation, Wilson kept up his criticism of the White House, saying [White House senior adviser Karl] Rove's conduct was an "outrageous abuse of power ... certainly worthy of frog-marching out of the White House."♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤♡♡❤But at the same time, Wilson acknowledged his wife was no longer in an undercover job at the time Novak's column first identified her. "My wife was not a clandestine officer the day that Bob Novak blew her identity," he said.♡❤♡♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤Federal law prohobits goverment [sic] officials from divulging the identity...♡❤ 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Media outlets followed the ♡❤AP♡❤ lead with their own reporting that mirrored ♡❤AP♡❤ report.

NASA engineers announced on Friday that the ♡❤Discovery♡❤&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s launch is being put on hold indefinitely.

"We are going forward on a day by day basis," Space Shuttle Program Deputy Manager Wayne Hale said at a press conference this afternoon. "As soon as we fix the problem, we will be four days from launch. What is that date going to be? We don't know."

Launch controllers are still optimistic about a launch in the current window of opportunity, which lasts until the end of the month. Twelve teams of engineers are working across the US in order to resolve the &lt;a href="Shuttle%20launch%20called%20off%20due%20to%20faulty%20fuel%20tank%20sensor"&gt;problem with the fuel tank sensor&lt;/a&gt;.

The fuel tank sensor is vital as it shuts down the main engines when fuel is exhausted - if the engines run dry, the results could be disastrous.

When the huge main fuel tank was drained on Wednesday, the sensor continued to indicate "wet" instead of "dry", but in a series of later tests the sensor began performing properly.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Half-Blood%20Prince"&gt;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ by &lt;a href="w%3AJ.%20K.%20Rowling"&gt;J.K. Rowling&lt;/a&gt; was released today to hundreds of special midnight parties at bookstores. The book is expected to sell tens of thousands of copies in the first hour, and the waves of fans just keep on coming. As midnight spreads across the Atlantic and the North American continent, more and more stores will start selling.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Mail"&gt;Royal Mail&lt;/a&gt; UK postal service delivered four hundred tons of the pre-ordered books this morning.

In British Columbia, fourteen copies of the book were accidentally sold at a supermarket on the 7th of July, eight days before the book's official release date. This led publishers to obtain a court order from the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; Supreme Court stating that people who had received the books were forbidden from copying, selling, discussing, or reading the book.

In protest at the ruling, &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Stallman"&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;, an advocate of less-restrictive copyright law, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.stallman.org/harry-potter.html"&gt;called for a boycott of the books&lt;/a&gt; after the controversial Supreme Court ruling. He called anybody who "participated in requesting, issuing, enforcing, or trying to excuse" the injunction an "enemy of human rights in Canada."

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (G.T.A.) game series, based on the underworld, pushes social limits on violence and sexual content in the video gaming industry. The newer ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto%203"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 3&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ release sparked controversy when it came to light the plot was based on an unnamed character's mission to destroy and slaughter his way to the top of the local crime scene. Since that release, further games were developed: ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto%3A%20Vice%20City"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto%3A%20San%20Andreas"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

Thursday, according to a report filed by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gamespot.com/news/2005/07/14/news_6129040.html"&gt;Gamespot&lt;/a&gt;, congresswoman &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Rodham%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; called on the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Trade%20Commission"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FTC) to "take immediate action to determine the source of graphic pornographic and violent content appearing on the ♡❤Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas♡❤ video game." Clinton also wanted the FTC to determine if an "AO" rating would be more suitable for the game than current "M" rating.

Clinton said she would work quickly to create a bill for a federal law that would "put some teeth into video game ratings." The federal legislation by Clinton would follow similar state initiatives. California assemblymen &lt;a href="w%3ALeland%20Yee"&gt;Leland Yee&lt;/a&gt; introduced a bill in his state, as did Illinois Governor &lt;a href="w%3ARod%20Blagojevich"&gt;Rod Blagojevich&lt;/a&gt;. The purpose of the state and federal bills would be to "prohibit the sale of violent and sexually explicit video games to minors." The passage and enactment of the proposed bill by Clinton would make it a federal offence to sell video game content to persons under the age of the games's rating.

Like many ♡❤Grand Theft Auto♡❤ gamers, the &lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board"&gt;Entertainment Software Rating Board&lt;/a&gt;(ESRB) is cautious over Clinton legislative proposal. Patricia Vance, the president of ESRB, issued this statement: "We urge all parties not to rush to judgment until all of the relevant facts, some of which are highly technical and complicated, have been established. Any second guessing at this point would be premature and inappropriate as this investigation continues." Vance said amongst the ESRB's top interests were to protect children, to educate parents, and make sure parents make good decisions on what video games their children be allowed to play.

Jack Thompson, the subject of beefs with ♡❤Grand Theft Auto♡❤ in the past, is a Republican attorney from &lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;. Thompson sent out an email to major gaming outlets (&lt;a href="w%3AGameSpot"&gt;Gamespot&lt;/a&gt; for example). The letter at first stated "I, as a lifelong Republican, am going to thank Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton," and offered admiration for Clinton's campaign against violence and sexual content in video games. The email then went on to criticize Doug Lowenstein, who helps manage ESRB and is the president of the &lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Software%20Association"&gt;Entertainment Software Association&lt;/a&gt;. Thompson wrote, "Doug Lowenstein could have prevented what is going to happen today, but he preferred to shoot the messengers." Thompson also mentioned the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbine%20High%20School"&gt;Columbine High School massacre&lt;/a&gt;, and claimed it was the fault of the developers of games (specifically &lt;a href="w%3AId%20Software"&gt;id Software&lt;/a&gt;, the maker of &lt;a href="w%3ADoom"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;). He claims the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;U.S. Constitution&lt;/a&gt; first amendment right to freedom of speech in no way protects the gaming industry from censorship. 
Lowenstein issued the following statement regarding the current video game/&lt;a href="w%3AHot%20Coffee%20mod"&gt;Hot Coffee&lt;/a&gt; issue: "Retailers should not sell Mature games to minors, parents should watch what their kids watch, and parents should and can rely on the ESRB ratings to make the right choices for their families. We hope that... Senator Clinton will abandon the bill and work cooperatively with industry and others to ensure that parents take advantage of the effective tools on the market to regulate the games their kids play."

Although some of the statements mentioned are related to video games in general and not so much GTA, a majority of all of this recently publicity did indeed start with the ♡❤Hot Coffee mod♡❤ for Grand Theft Auto. ESRB has never been pressured any harder in the past than they are now, and &lt;a href="w%3ARockstar%20Games"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; still denies that they put the sex scenes in the game; although it has been recently demonstrated that Action Max-Replay (a cheat/feature-unlocking system for the Sony PlayStation 2) allows the user to play the "mini sex games" - the exact same thing the Hot Coffee mod unlocks for the PC version of GTA San Andreas.

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASuicide%20Bombing"&gt;suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; detonated herself Saturday aboard a minibus heading to Ladies beach in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKusadasi"&gt;Kuşadasi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAegean%20Sea"&gt;Aegean Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; resort town, killing at least four people, private NTV television said. Three of the victims were foreign tourists, a doctor who treated the casualties said. 

Three foreign tourists were among the dead and five foreign tourists were critically injured in the explosion, a doctor at Kuşadasi State Hospital said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The five injured tourists were transferred to Izmir for treatment, the doctor added. According to some sources, there are five injured &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; tourists.

NTV television said a female suicide bomber carried out the attack on the bus, which was heading to a nearby beach. Kurdish rebels in the past have used female suicide bombers.

The explosion ripped off the roof of the white minibus.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKurdish%20people"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; rebels have recently carried out bomb attacks in Aegean resort towns.

Earlier this month, a bomb hidden in a soda can wounded 21 people, including three foreign tourists, in the Aegean coastal town of Çeşme. On April 30, a bomb in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACassette%20deck"&gt;cassette player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; killed a police officer and left four others wounded in Kuşadasi.

A Kurdish &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aguerrilla"&gt;guerrilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; group that called itself the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan"&gt;Kurdistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Freedom Falcons Organization or TAK claimed credit for both attacks and vowed to maintain attacks against tourist areas.

<h1>Three British Army soldiers killed in Iraq</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Three%20British%20Army%20soldiers%20killed%20in%20Iraq&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The British &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence"&gt;MoD&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed in a statement that three &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Army"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; soldiers have been killed in a suspected roadside bomb in southern Iraq. Two others were wounded, though not life-threateningly. 

The three soldiers were from the &lt;a href="w%3AWarrior%20Tracked%20Armoured%20Vehicle"&gt;Warrior-equipped&lt;/a&gt; 1st Battalion, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Staffordshire%20Regiment"&gt;The Staffordshire Regiment&lt;/a&gt;. The regiment is stationed in &lt;a href="w%3ATidworth"&gt;Tidworth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWiltshire"&gt;Wiltshire&lt;/a&gt;. It arrived in Iraq in April as part of 12 Mechanised Brigade.

On 16 July, an MoD statement said that no further information would be disclosed until families had been informed. The following day, the MoD released the names of the three killed. They were: Second Lieutenant Richard Shearer, Private Leon Spicer, and Private Phillip Hewett. 

<h2>Roadside attack</h2>

The roadside attack took place in the early hours of 16 July when three armoured Land Rovers were patrolling through the Risala neighbourhood of &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Amarah"&gt;Al Amarah&lt;/a&gt;, capital of &lt;a href="w%3AMaysan"&gt;Maysan&lt;/a&gt; province. The attack brings the British forces death toll in Iraq to 92.

The Staffordshire Regiment is the lead component of Task Force Maysan, based in Camp Abu Naji, just outside Amarah. The Task Force has responsibility for the entire province, which is north of &lt;a href="w%3ABasra%20Governorate"&gt;Al Basrah&lt;/a&gt; province. 

Task Force Maysan has experienced previous attacks in the past few months. According to the MoD website, on 6 June Private Adam Mills of the Staffordshire Regiment discovered a roadside bomb which was subsequently made safe. 

<h2>Previous violence in Amarah</h2>

Amarah has a population of about 340,000 and has been the scene of previous violence against British forces. In May, two British soldiers were killed in the city. In 2004, it was the scene of fierce fighting between British forces and Iraqi insurgents, which led to the awarding of the &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Cross"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt; to Private &lt;a href="w%3AJohnson%20Beharry"&gt;Johnson Beharry&lt;/a&gt; of the 1st Battalion, &lt;a href="w%3APrincess%20of%20Wales%27s%20Royal%20Regiment"&gt;Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment&lt;/a&gt;

In Majar Al-Kabir, near Al Amarah, a patrol of six &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Military%20Police"&gt;Royal Military Police&lt;/a&gt; were surrounded and killed by an Iraqi mob on 24 June 2003.

The 16 July attack is the largest loss of life in a single day for the British Army since 4 November 2004, when 3 soldiers of the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Watch"&gt;Black Watch&lt;/a&gt; were killed in northern Iraq in a suicide car attack. The largest loss of life sustained by British forces as a whole took place on 30 January 2005, when a &lt;a href="RAF%20Hercules%20crashes%20north%20of%20Baghdad%20killing%20ten"&gt;C-130K transport crashed north of Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, killing nine &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Air%20Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/a&gt; and one Army personnel.

<h1>Utah bill requiring divine design education withdrawn by Senator Chris Buttars</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Utah%20bill%20requiring%20divine%20design%20education%20withdrawn%20by%20Senator%20Chris%20Buttars&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Utah Senator Chris Buttars has decided not to introduce a bill requiring the teaching of "&lt;a href="w%3Adivine%20design"&gt;divine design&lt;/a&gt;" in Utah schools, at least for this year. Buttars withdrew after State Board of Education director Patti Harrington assured him that Utah public school curriculum does not teach that man descended from apes. 

Buttars had hoped his divine design proposal would escape the controversy of &lt;a href="w%3Acreationism"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Aintelligent%20design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt;. "The only people who will be upset about this are &lt;a href="w%3Aatheist"&gt;atheist&lt;/a&gt;s," he stated on June 6 when he announced his intention to run the bill. 

Utah is home to the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20the%20Latter%20Day%20Saints"&gt;Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints&lt;/a&gt; also known as the Mormon Church. On the surface it would seem Utah would be a likely scene of intense religious pressure in public schools over the teaching of evolution. But unlike states with a strong Christian conservative presence, Utah's LDS leaders have avoided some of the more contentious separation state and church battles.

On the topic of divine design, official LDS church spokesmen have been largely silent at least in public. But with more than 90% of the legislature made up of members of the LDS faith, few in Utah would deny the influence of the church on public policy. 

Groups on both sides of the issue are gearing up for what many consider an inevitable fight. The &lt;a href="w%3AACLU"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt; of Utah has posted a paper on divine design on its web site (http://www.acluutah.org). The Eagle Forum which wields significant policital power in Utah has expressed its support for Buttars proposed legislation.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n poker player &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Hachem"&gt;Joseph Hachem&lt;/a&gt; outlasted nearly 6,000 other players and a final table that lasted until nearly 7:00 AM local time to win the 36th &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Series%20of%20Poker"&gt;World Series of Poker&lt;/a&gt; main event title. Hachem won a top prize of US$7.5 million.

On the sixth hand of heads-up play against &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Dannenman"&gt;Steve Dannenman&lt;/a&gt;, Hachem made a seven-high &lt;a href="w%3AStraight%20%28poker%29"&gt;straight&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AFlop%20%28poker%29"&gt;flop&lt;/a&gt;, which held up until the &lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20%28poker%29"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; to give him the win. Dannenman took home US$4.25 million for the second place finish.

He is also the first since Mortensen to win without qualifying through an Internet poker portal.

Notable finishers include &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; professional &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Black"&gt;Andrew Black&lt;/a&gt; in fifth place, American professional &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Matusow"&gt;Mike Matusow&lt;/a&gt; in ninth, American professional &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Ivey"&gt;Phil Ivey&lt;/a&gt; in 20th, and &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Raymer"&gt;Greg Raymer&lt;/a&gt; in 25th.

Oil giant &lt;a href="w%3AShell"&gt;Shell&lt;/a&gt; has sold all its retail and distribution operations in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; to a distribution and logistics firm called Topaz. The businesses, which are believed to have an annual turnover of over €1bn, include 35 local distribution depots, 6 oil importation facilities, 55 retail service stations and the supply of fuel to 105 independent service stations throughout Ireland.

Shell is retaining its interest in the Corrib Gas field in &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Mayo"&gt;County Mayo&lt;/a&gt; which it is currently developing. Shell has been known for some time to be anxious to exit the increasingly competitive Irish market. Since the arrivial of &lt;a href="w%3ATesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt; to the petrol retail market last year, a price war has raged in parts of the country. Althought Tesco only operates a limited number of stations in the republic, it has expressed a desire to expand throughout the country.

Ion Equity are the consortium behind the takeover which according to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Independent"&gt;Irish Independent&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is valued at over €100m. The business will be headed by former &lt;a href="w%3AEmo%20Oil"&gt;Emo Oil&lt;/a&gt; managing director Danny Murray.

At least 54 people died today when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a gas station near a mosque in Musayyib, about 60 km south of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i capital. Some 80 people are reported to have been injured. 

Witnesses said a fuel tanker was slowly approaching the pumps at the station when the attacker ran towards it and detonated explosives strapped to his body. Police said the resulting huge blast destroyed a nearby apartment complex and damaged the mosque and some small businesses.

The gas station was located near the city-center. Iraqi gas stations normally include a number of small businesses selling tea, soft drinks and snacks where crowds of people often gather.

Mussayib, a religiously mixed town, lies in an area named the "triangle of death", due to the large number of kidnappings and killings of &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; Muslims traveling between Baghdad and the Shiite holy cities of Karbala and Najaf.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; retail chain stores &lt;a href="w%3AKroger"&gt;Kroger’s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWalgreens"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; and five other food and drugstore chains have filed a lawsuit against the world’s largest credit card company, &lt;a href="w%3A%20VISA%20%28credit%20card%29"&gt;Visa International Inc&lt;/a&gt;. The federal lawsuit claims the company practices fee fixing on transactions, and with restricting competition among member banks.

The retail merchants claim that Visa acts in collusion with its member banks to fix transaction fees taken as a percentage of each retail sale. The suit was filed Thursday in the &lt;a href="w%3A%20United%20States%20district%20court"&gt;U.S. District Court&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Manhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, and seeks unspecified damages. 

Member banks, those banks that issue and process merchants’ Visa transactions, are unable to negotiate transaction fees directly with the merchant, and merchants are forced to accept Visa purchases regardless of the issuing bank. The complaint says, “The merchant restraints have resulted in exorbitant interchange fees that bear no relationship to the cost of the services being provided." 

Merchants see the rising use of card transactions and the effect it has on their bottom line. The &lt;a href="w%3Ainterchange%20fees"&gt;interchange fees&lt;/a&gt; are currently 1.75% from most banks, but on some cards it rose this year to 2.9%. The National Retail Federation said for 2004 that between &lt;a href="w%3AVISA_%28credit_card%29"&gt;Visa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMasterCard"&gt;MasterCard&lt;/a&gt;, they pulled in $17.4 billion, a surcharge borne by the consumer regardless of whether they pay by cash or plastic.

Retailers do not oppose transaction fees, but believe they should be based on market forces. They claim that technology has lowered the cost of processing the transactions, but the savings is not being passed along to them. There are currently four major credit card providers in the U.S.

♡❤Webpronews♡❤ writer John Smith cites this merchant quote: "The collective setting of interchange fees by Visa and its member banks constitutes horizontal price-fixing that leads to higher retail prices for our customers," said Paul Heldman, Kroger senior vice president and general counsel. "This hidden cost must be borne by all Kroger customers, whether they pay for their groceries with cash, by check or by debit or credit card. At a time when technology has made card authorization and processing faster, cheaper, safer and more efficient than ever, we believe that our customers should be receiving the benefit of declining interchange fees. Instead, Visa is using its extraordinary market power to profit at our customers' expense."

A small group of &lt;a href="w%3AConnecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; retailers filed a similar lawsuit last month naming along with Visa, &lt;a href="w%3AMasterCard"&gt;MasterCard&lt;/a&gt; and several other large banks. The suit was filed in Connecticut’s federal court. That suit also calls the fees “exorbitant”.

The Vice-President of Visa, Paul Cohen, said "It appears this is another in a series of attempts by some merchants to receive all the value of electronic payments, while shifting their normal costs of doing business onto consumers."

A General in the Chinese &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;People's Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; (PLA) and dean at the National Defense University in China commented to visiting Hong Kong reporters on Friday that the PLA might use nuclear weapons against the U.S., in a conflict over the Taiwan Strait. "If the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition onto the target zone on China's territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons," Maj. Gen. &lt;a href="w%3AZhu%20Chenghu"&gt;Zhu Chenghu&lt;/a&gt; said to the reporters of the Asian Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. "We Chinese will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all of the cities east of Xian [in central China]. Of course the Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds ... of cities will be destroyed by the Chinese."

U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called the remarks "highly irresponsible" and "unfortunate", and expressed the hope that they did not reflect the views of the Chinese government.

Echoing the official Xinhua News Agency, the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;'s Foreign Ministry officials said that Zhu was expressing personal views, and had warned the reporters accordingly, but stated that China would never tolerate "Taiwan independence". Reportedly, Maj. Gen. Zhu is not directly involved in the formulation of Chinese military strategy.

The U.S. may defend Taiwan under the &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20Relations%20Act"&gt;Taiwan Relations Act&lt;/a&gt; and is currently &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Taiwan's largest arms supplier&lt;/a&gt;.

The win Sunday by the Yankees at Fenway Park gives them 3 in a row in the 4 game series, and inches them closer to the top in baseball's American League East. Behind the pitching of newly-acquired Al Leiter, the 5-3 win over the Red Sox puts them a 1/2 game out of the top spot. A sweep by taking final game of the series will make them the leader in the tight American League East race.

The injury-laden Yankee pitching staff got a lift from Leiter's performance who went 6 1/3 innings, and allowed one run on three hits. The 39-year-old lefty came by way of trade with the Marlins to return to the pitching staff. Yankee manager Joe Torre said, "The one thing we knew about the start was that he wasn't going to come in here and be rattled or be nervous." 

In Saturday's game, Randy Johnson struck out 10 and Alex Rodriguez homered in a 6-run 3rd as the Yankees beat the Red Sox at Fenway Park , 7 - 4. Matt Clement was roughed up early, allowing six runs, five hits, and five walks over 2 and two-thirds innings. Johnny Damon extended his league-leading hitting streak to 28. The Red Sox had a chance to creep closer to the Yankees but a would-be 2 run shot off David Ortiz was caught.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Peer-to-peer%20file-sharing%20user%20numbers%20still%20growing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Statistics released by online media measurement company &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bigchampagne.com"&gt;BigChampagne&lt;/a&gt; indicate that the average number of simultaneous, individual connections to file sharing networks has increased to around 9 million by June, 2005. This contrasts dramatically with an August, 2003 figure of just under 4 million users. 

The eDonkey network is a good example of file-sharing platform that has seen strong growth. Today &lt;a href="w%3AeMule"&gt;eMule&lt;/a&gt;, which connects and transfer files via eDonkey, had user numbers of more than 9 million at one time. One year ago the total number of eMule users barely reached 3 million.

Online file sharing reportedly includes the widespread distribution of unauthorized &lt;a href="w%3Acopyright"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt;ed content and continues despite civil prosecution of both users and developers of file-sharing software in the United States as well as criminal prosecutions in Europe and Hong Kong. &lt;a href="w%3AGrokster"&gt;Grokster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStreamCast%20Networks"&gt;StreamCast Networks&lt;/a&gt; are two recent examples of companies targeted by legal prosecution in the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;.

The Court ruled last month that companies who provide file-sharing software with the specific intent that it be used to violate copyright laws are liable for the actions of those who use the service to download copyrighted files. 

The Court's decision was widely misreported by the news media to have found file-sharing software illegal. However, the Court's finding was much narrower, introducing a new and murky "intent" test for determining the culpability of the software provider. Specifically, the Court held that "one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties." 

Few noncommercial programmers on open-source projects appear ready to quit over the Court's ruling, but they do discourage piracy talk on open forums. File sharing networks that work under a loosely formed open-source programming project, such as &lt;a href="w%3AShareaza"&gt;Shareaza&lt;/a&gt;, could defy the definition of what is called a company.

San Marcos resident, Dave Newman, was swimming in the San Marcos river on the July 4th holiday weekend when he noticed that another man who had jumped into the river had failed to surface. Police arrived on the scene as Mr Newman attempted to rescue the man, Abed Duamni, a 35 year old from Houston. The officers instructed Mr Newman to swim to the nearest shore and get out of the water but he instead swam to the far shore with Mr Duamni. Upon his emergence from the river, Texas State University police arrested Mr Newman for interfering with public duties. Now free on $2000 bail Mr. Newman is set to appear in court next month.

UPDATE:

Texas State University Police have dropped charges against Dave Newman after his arrest July 3 for interference with public duties at an emergency water rescue scene at Spring Lake Dam on the San Marcos River.

University President Denise Trauth and San Marcos Mayor Susan Narvaiz released the following joint statement:

"Mr. Newman was arrested because of his refusal to comply first with pleas, then requests, and then orders to leave the river after his rescue of Mr. Duamni. However, Mr. Newman did perform a heroic act, and we believe the proper course of action is to drop the charges. We want to emphasize to the public that the area around the Spring Lake Dam can be dangerous. It claimed the life of a young man as recently as last April and it has been the site of six emergency water rescues since that time. We cannot overstate the importance of heeding the many warning signs posted in the area and using extreme caution when swimming there. We also want to re-emphasize to the public the importance of following the directives of police and fire and rescue personnel when they are on the scene of an emergency. We are forming a university-community committee immediately to explore steps we can take to make this swimming area safer for the public."

A British newspaper has revealed that Pakistan had warned British counter-terrorism experts in May 2005 about terrorist plans to bomb London in the 'early summer'.

The Pakistani interior minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAftab%20Sherpao"&gt;Aftab Sherpao&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Observer"&gt;The Observer&lt;/a&gt; that interrogations of a 25-year old Pakistani-born Briton believed to be a member of al-Qaeda had revealed a plot to 'bomb London pubs, restaurants and possibly railway stations' &lt;a href="http%3A//observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0%2C6903%2C1530365%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

On July 7, 55 people were killed and over 700 injured in a series of co-ordinated terrorist attacks on London transport, including underground railway stations. Senior British police officers denied receiving any warning before the attacks.

However, Mr Sherpao said that Pakistan intelligence had 'received information from a number of sources and passed it on to the British' in May. Pakistani sources claim that after the London attacks, British investigators have travelled to Pakistan to interview the terrorist supect.

The death toll from a suicide bomb attack in &lt;a href="w%3AMusayyib"&gt;Musayyib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; has risen to 98. A &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20bomber"&gt;suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt; attacked a fuel truck arriving at the gas station in the Iraqi town overnight on July 16, running up to the truck and detonating his explosives. The huge blast which followed killed many locals at a crowded vegetable market near the local &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27ite"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; mosque.

Early reports put the number of dead at between 50-60, but this has risen as the full scale of the carnage has become apparent. Hospital sources said they were treating 75 wounded, including 19 in a serious condition. The attack in Musayyib was the deadliest suicide attack since 125 people were killed in February in nearby &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Hilla"&gt;Al Hilla&lt;/a&gt;.

'This is a black day in the history of the town,' the Musayyib police chief, Yas Khudayr, said.

Musayyib lies south of Baghdad, in the center of a dangerous area known as the 'triangle of death', where patrolling US forces are subject to constant attack from &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20insurgency"&gt;Iraqi resistance&lt;/a&gt; forces.

Angry crowds protested on Sunday against the local authorities, which they blamed for not doing enough to prevent the attack. According to one protester, police had placed a ban on trucks entering the town, but had allowed the fuel tanker through.

During a parliamentary session in Baghdad, the government was blamed by politicians for the dire security situation. Calls were made for local militia to be formed to replace the police and soldiers who had failed to protect Iraqis.

&lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20FC"&gt;Chelsea FC&lt;/a&gt; had a bid of £20,000,000 for the England winger rejected on Friday after they finally made their interest in the player official.

&lt;a href="w%3AShaun%20Wright-Phillips"&gt;Shaun Wright-Phillips&lt;/a&gt; had declared on Friday he was happy to stay at &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20City%20FC"&gt;Manchester City FC&lt;/a&gt;, but 24 hours later he asked City to agree a fee with Chelsea so that he could move to Stamford Bridge.

Both sides have now thrashed out a fee for Wright-Phillips and the flying winger has now been given permission to open talks with Chelsea.

"As a result of Shaun's request to speak to Chelsea we have conducted a series of complex negotiations with Chelsea," City's communications chief, Paul Tyrrell.

"A fee for Shaun's transfer of £21,000,000 has been agreed and consequently we have granted his wish to talk to the other club."

Chelsea are hoping to tie up a deal with Wright-Phillips as soon as possible so that he can join them on their tour of the U.S.A next week.

<h1>Israeli PM assassin Yigal Amir on open-ended hunger strike</h1>
&lt;p&gt;♡❤♡, ♡❤♡ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AYigal%20Amir"&gt;Yigal Amir&lt;/a&gt;, the student who assassinated Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AYitzhak%20Rabin"&gt;Yitzhak Rabin&lt;/a&gt;, began a hunger strike on June 28th in protest against "the basic human rights abuse by Israel's prison authorities", as he describes it.
According to the prison service, he's not in a proper hunger strike because he drinks 5 liters of sweet raspberry-flavoured drink (otherwise known as "petel") every day.
Disputing that (according to updates from Larisa Trembovler journal) Yigal Amir in a phone conversation insists that it is a lie and he is not given anything near 5 liters of drinks a day.
Also regardless of prison service definitions he continues with the hunger strike.

The issue of contention is denial of recognition of his marriage to Larisa Trembovler by Israeli Prisons Service.

In January 2004, when news of the couple's intentions reached the press, Israel Prisons Service Commissioner Lieutenant General Ya'akov Ganot rejected Amir's request to marry in jail, even though by then the Prison Service had itself submitted a formal application for permission to hold the ceremony. Ganot even requested that the legal department be "prepared to defend the decision."

Two months ago, Amir and Trimbovler asked the Association for Civil Rights in Israel to represent them before the Prison Service, and present their desire to marry within the prison walls.

According to the Association, "♡❤The right to marry applies to prisoners as well; human rights also apply to Yigal Amir.♡❤" The association said that the couple performed the "marriage by messenger" for lack of alternatives "♡❤after they were deprived of their basic right to marry, as it is normally understood.♡❤"

The Special Tribunal set up to try &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; has made its first formal charge against him. 

Saddam and three others have been charged with the killings in &lt;a href="w%3ADujail"&gt;Dujail&lt;/a&gt;, the town in which the ex-president survived an assassination attempt in 1982. The charge is minor compared to other crimes Saddam is accused of committing; however he would still face the death penalty if he were to be convicted. The Tribunal is said to have picked this charge as it is one in which the investigation has progressed the most. 

Many &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqis&lt;/a&gt; would prefer a quick trial of the ex-president, and so the Special Tribunal has picked a charge they are confident they can convict on quickly. The date for the trial is set to be announced in the next few days. Iraqi law states that a trial can only begin 45 days after the charges have been made, and therefore the proceedings could start as early as September. 

Other than Saddam Hussein, his brother-in-law Barzan Ibrahim Al-Hassan, former vice-president &lt;a href="w%3ATaha%20Yasin%20Ramadan"&gt;Taha Yasin Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; and former top judge Awad Badar Al-Bender are also being charged in the Dujail case.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Transitional%20Government"&gt;Iraqi Government&lt;/a&gt; has said it plans to bring only 12 charges against the former leader, each of them carrying the death penalty, out of a possible 500 of which he is accused. The trial is expected to start as early as September.

Middle Eastern carrier &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Air"&gt;Gulf Air&lt;/a&gt; has announced it is to provide direct flights from &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; to its hub in &lt;a href="w%3AManama"&gt;Manama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; from December three times a week. This is the first ever scheduled long haul route from Ireland not to &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;.

Gulf Air, which is owned jointly by the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Sultanate of &lt;a href="w%3AOman"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; and the Emirate of &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Dhabi"&gt;Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt;, will commence service using a &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A330"&gt;Airbus A330&lt;/a&gt; on the 2nd December 2005.

Gulf Air is hoping travellers will use the service as a gateway to &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Oceania"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt;. Previously most travellers went via &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to reach destinations not served by a direct link.

An ♡❤Equatair♡❤ plane carrying 55 people crashed on Saturday soon after take-off near the capital of &lt;a href="w%3AEquatorial%20Guinea"&gt;Equatorial Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMalabo"&gt;Malabo&lt;/a&gt;. Witnesses told AFP the &lt;a href="w%3AAntonov"&gt;Antonov&lt;/a&gt; aircraft bound for &lt;a href="w%3ABata%2C%20Equatorial%20Guinea"&gt;Bata&lt;/a&gt; suddenly caught fire and crashed in a forest near Baney, a town some 19km from the capital. "♡❤No one survived -- the plane was destroyed,♡❤" said Alfonso Nsue Mokuy, the Information minister of E Guinea, after rescue teams arrived at the crash site on Sunday.

The old propeller-machine took off at about 10am local time (9am UTC) and disappeared from the radar soon after, officials said.

Flying in &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; is considerably more dangerous than in other parts of the world. While accounting for only 3% of worldwide air traffic, 27% of all fatal airplane crashes occur in Africa according to Dutch-based Aviation Safety Network. This is blamed on the chronic under-investment many airline companies on the continent suffer from.

Park guests, some of whom began queuing for entry around 3:00pm the previous day, packed into the park bringing it to full capacity before lunchtime.

&lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzanegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzanegger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJulie%20Andrews"&gt;Julie Andrews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AArt%20Linkletter"&gt;Art Linkletter&lt;/a&gt;, Diane Disney-Miller, Disney CEO &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Eisner"&gt;Michael Eisner&lt;/a&gt; and Disney CEO-elect, president and COO &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Iger"&gt;Bob Iger&lt;/a&gt; all joined in the festivities, with Disney-Miller, the eldest daughter of park founder &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt;, reading her father's original dedication at the precise time it was first read.

The park kicked off the official festivities on May 5 with the opening of the &lt;a href="w%3AHappiest%20Homecoming%20on%20Earth"&gt;Happiest Homecoming on Earth&lt;/a&gt;.

Sir &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Heath"&gt;Edward Heath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; from 1970-1974 and leader of the Conservative Party from 1965-1975, has died at his home in Salisbury just a week after his 89th birthday.

Heath implemented the &lt;a href="w%3ADecimal%20day"&gt;decimalization&lt;/a&gt; of the British coinage, led the United Kingdom into the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Economic%20Community"&gt;European Economic Community&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to end industrial unrest with the Industrial Relations Act, initiated a failed power-sharing government in &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, and, in order to cope with a coal strike on top of &lt;a href="w%3A1973%20oil%20crisis"&gt;the 1973 fuel crisis&lt;/a&gt;, instituted a three-day work week in the UK. 

Today he was eulogised by fellow politicians, including Baroness Margaret Thatcher, who succeeded Heath after he was ousted from the Conservative Party leadership in 1975. She said that with Heath's death Britain had lost a 'political giant'. There was also praise, from Heath's former political secretary Sir Douglas Hurd, for his contribution to the EEC. 

'He got us into the European Union,' Sir Hurd said. 'I mean that is a huge step, a very difficult one, which I doubt would have happened without his particular kind of thoroughness and determination. That was an amazing achievement.'&lt;a href="http%3A//www.voanews.com/english/2005-07-18-voa15.cfm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a statement describing Sir Heath as 'a man of great integrity and beliefs'.

Heath was offered the post of &lt;a href="w%3AAmbassador"&gt;Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 1979, but declined. He continued to represent the constituency of &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Bexley%20and%20Sidcup"&gt;Old Bexley and Sidcup&lt;/a&gt; as a backbench MP until his retirement in 2001. He was created a &lt;a href="w%3AKnight%20of%20the%20Garter"&gt;Knight of the Garter&lt;/a&gt; in 1992.

Six people were arrested in northern England today under immigration laws. The arrests were made in a suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ALeeds"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, where two of the suspected bombers of the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;London terrorist attacks&lt;/a&gt; lived. 

However the police say they are not linking the arrests with the London bombings. Early reports had suggested that the men had been arrested under anti-terrorism laws as part of the London bombing investigation, a statement on the West Yorkshire Police website said they were working closely with the Metropolitan Police as part of their enquiry, but at the current stage they were not linking the arrests with the recent incidents in London.

All six men remain in police custody and West Yorkshire Police have yet to release more details about the arrests.

A Hong Kong radio host Wong Yuk Man has been sacked last week. Wong hosted a radio program which had helped him become famous by criticizing the government and the pro-Beijing political party. Commercial Radio, a private radio station and Wong’s former employee said Wong was fired because he demanded a 5-days-per-week program which the station could not deliver. However, Wong said he was fired because commercial radio station feared that the government would refuse to renew their license because of his outspoken criticism against the government. The 5 days per week program which Wong hosted had been cancelled and Wong was reallocated to host a weekly program a couple of months ago after Chen King-Hon, another outspoken radio host of commercial radio who was the most popular host at the time, was sacked and his program cancelled.

Wong and Chen, and their former co-hosts had organized 5,000 fans to join their candle night rally in Central, protesting against the alleged collusion between the commercial radio station and the government and urged for freedom of speech in Hong Kong. Donald Tsang, Hong Kong new Chief Executive, who has just replaced the unpopular Tung Chee-Hwa a month ago who had failed to finish his second term due to the alleged health problem, was criticized for restricting the freedom of speech in Hong Kong. Tsang has not yet responded to their criticism.

The British tabloid &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Mirror"&gt;The Daily Mirror&lt;/a&gt; today suggested that the London bombers may not have planned to commit suicide, while a &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; spokesman said they have not definitely confirmed that the four men intended to die when they carried out the attacks.

The Daily Mirror claims that the bombers brought return rail tickets to &lt;a href="w%3ALuton"&gt;Luton&lt;/a&gt;, and that they purchased pay and display car park tickets before boarding the train at Luton Station. The tabloid paper also states how the bombers all had personal items on their person at the time of the attacks, such as wallets, driving licences and bank cards. It also states how they were carrying large rucksacks which could be easily dumped, instead of having the explosives strapped to their bodies, as would be expected of a suicide bomber. It also points to evidence from the bombers' families, where two of the men had pregnant wives.

From this evidence, the paper draws the conclusion that the four men were not told the bombs would detonate straight away, and that the men thought they would be able to escape unscathed. This was probably done to protect their master’s identity, the paper suggested, since there was a high probability the bombers would be caught had they lived.

In a ♡❤&lt;a href="Time%20%28magazine%29"&gt;TIME&lt;/a&gt; magazine♡❤ article, reporter &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Cooper%20%28American%20journalist%29"&gt;Matthew Cooper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; claimed he learned that Plame worked with the &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; through a conversation with &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt;. However, he denied that Rove directly named &lt;a href="Valerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt;. He also revealed that he discussed Plame with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Libby"&gt;Lewis Libby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the deputy Chief of Staff for the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Vice-President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;.

The revelation corroborates Rove's testimony to the grand jury, leaked to several news sources, that he learned of Plame's name from Robert Novak and another journalist (Rove testified that he cannot remember which one), and that he did tell Cooper in a later discussion that Joseph Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, though he testified he never mentioned Plame by name.

In a Sunday ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC%20Meet%20the%20Press"&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ broadcast, Cooper said he secured a more specific written waiver from two sources, Rove and Libby, which led him to reverse his earlier refusal to cooperate with the federal grand jury investigation into the CIA disclosure of Plame. This second waiver was signed only hours prior to the contempt of court proceedings that would have put him in jail, the fate of the ♡❤&lt;a href="New%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJudith%20Miller"&gt;Judith Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who refused to reveal her sources to the same court. He said during the broadcast there were other White House sources as well, but declined during the interview to disclose their names.

The waiver Cooper secured releases him from the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. He wrote a 1st person account of the conversation with Rove that was published Sunday on the ♡❤TIME Online Edition♡❤. In a marketing move made by ♡❤TIME♡❤, they turned the high interest in the story into an online money maker by charging $1.99 for access to the story. 6 print issues of the magazine come with the purchase.

An 11-year-old girl faces serious assault charges in California after casting a stone at a group of boys who were throwing water balloons at her. In April, Maribel Cuevas was apprehended by &lt;a href="w%3AFresno%2C%20California"&gt;Fresno&lt;/a&gt;, California police and spent five days in a detention center after throwing the object at the group of boys who bombarded her with water balloons as she walked down the sidewalk. A 9-year-old boy was hit with the stone, and suffered a wound to his head requiring medical assistance.

Since then, Cuevas has spent one month under house arrest pending court. Cuevas' lawyer, Richard Beshwate, told the BBC that "They [Fresno police] are treating her like a violent parole offender. It's not a felony, it's an 11-year-old acting like an 11-year-old."

Fresno Police Sergeant Anthony Martinez told reporters: "We responded. We determined a felony assault had taken place and the officers took the actions that were necessary." Cuevas is due back in court next month on felony assault charges.

The girl was placed in juvenile hall during her five-day detention, with only one 30-minute visit from her parents. She was then placed under a 30 day house arrest and required to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. The house arrest allowed the girl to attend school.

Maribel, who knows very little English, said that the boy initiated the conflict &amp;mdash; the boy also admitted as much.

The list, which includes Lionbridge (LIOX) and L-3/Titan (LLL) is based on the firm’s Human Delivered Service Company (HDSC) Index, a sophisticated assessment model that evaluates the business fundamentals, market strength, and service offerings of companies that depend on people to produce most of their revenue. The ranking of translation companies reflects recent industry mergers and acquisitions including Lionbridge’s acquisition of Bowne Global Solutions, a unit of Bowne &amp; Co, (BNE).

Common Sense Advisory also estimates the current worldwide translation and localization market at US$ 8.8 billion, reaching a total of US$ 12 billion in 2010. “This figure is particularly relevant at a time where the market seems to be entering a new wave of consolidation,” comments analyst Renato Beninatto.

Explains Common Sense Advisory founder and CEO, Donald A. DePalma, “Many language services companies want to get bigger. Our certification model lets us benchmark one company against comparable language services firms, against offshore providers providing a full range of engineering and localization offerings, and against the service firms that make up our own innovative HDSC Index. This information is valuable to any procurement department – not to mention to any LSP thinking about where it fits in the marketplace relative to its competitors.”

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.commonsenseadvisory.com/en/research/top_20.htm"&gt;Ranking of Top 20 Translation Companies&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free download.

On July 13, 21 &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese individuals sued &lt;a href="w%3AShintaro%20Ishihara"&gt;Shintaro Ishihara&lt;/a&gt;, the governor of &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, for defamation towards people who use the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20language"&gt;French language&lt;/a&gt;. Those 21 were French language teachers and Japanese researchers who taught French. In 2004, Ishihara said that no one can count in the French language. Ishihara was sued for 500,000 yen (approx. US $4,457) for each plaintiff, including Malik Berkane, a French private language school owner in Tokyo. In addition, the plaintiffs demanded that he make an apology.
On October 19, 2004, Ishihara said "French language is a language in which no one can count, therefore it seems to me reasonable that it is disqualified as an international language. People who are tied to the language have taken it upon themselves to oppose [me]. It is all ridiculous" in a speech Ishihara made at the inaugural celebrations of the "Tokyo U-Club". The Tokyo U-club was founded to support the foundation of &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%20Metropolitan%20University"&gt;Tokyo Metropolitan University&lt;/a&gt; (Japanese: 首都大学東京, ♡❤Shuto daigaku Tokyo♡❤), which was planned by Ishihara as replacement of universities run by the Tokyo metropolitan government including the same name in English (Japanese: 東京都立大学 ♡❤Tokyo Toritsu Daigaku♡❤).

On August 1, 2003, Ishihara issued his plan to found the new university. His plan had no relation to the restructuring plan of the former Tokyo Metropolitan University which had been on-going for years in cooperation with faculty and Tokyo prefectural government. In his new plan faculties of Humanities, Economics and Law would be drasticially changed and divided into newly organized faculties and departures. As for humanities, literature and language studies would be re-organized into language section and literature section, reduced in number of students, and undergraduate and graduate would be relocated into separate campuses. Quite a few members of the Faculty of Humanities opposed this idea strongly and called for opposition widely. As to that its all faculty issued the opposition on the consensus of all faculty on September 25, 2003. The department of French literature and language was a key group in the movment. Also in 2004, Professor Masato Goda, a teacher of French literature, resigned to express his opposition toward Ishihara's educational policy. 
Berkane said "I was very shocked when I heard that. Of course we can count numbers in French, and it is used as an official language in international organisations." "I have been in Japan for 23 years. I am sad that what I have taught in that time is denigrated." Berkane said that he had sent a memorandum to Ishihara in February to ask the governer to apologize but he had as yet received no reply from Ishihara.
On July 15, Ishihara again expressed his opinion that French was formerly a diplomatic lingua franca but due to its complexity it had been falling back. He mentioned that no student had registered in French language lessons at the newly founded Tokyo Metropolitan University. He also stated plaintiffs should have considered seriously if his criticism was appropriate or not.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZardad%20Faryadi%20Sarwar"&gt;Zardad Faryadi Sarwar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (also known as Zardad Khan and Commander Zardad), a warlord who controlled several checkpoints at the road between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJalalabad"&gt;Jalalabad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1990s, was convicted today of torture and hostage-taking. The Court at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Bailey"&gt;Old Bailey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; found that Zardad pursued a ♡❤reign of fear♡❤ along his checkpoints and ordered summary executions and torture of innocent civilians. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.

Zardad denied all charges throughout the trials, and claimed he had been set up by enemies in Afghanistan.

"I have never killed anybody and if anybody in the whole of Afghanistan can produce that evidence against me then I will accept that crime," he said.

The case is considered to be a landmark in international law. British law allows the prosecution of crimes like torture and hostage-taking in the UK even if no British citizen was involved and the incidents occurred overseas. "There are some crimes which are so heinous, such an affront to justice, that they can be tried in any country", Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith said.

Zardad fled to the UK in 1998 after he had fought both the Russians and the Taliban in Afghanistan's long civil war. He settled in a suburban London home and was first confronted by &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; Journalist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Simpson"&gt;John Simpson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2000. Simpson's report sparked a lengthy investigation that would eventually lead to British prosecutors travelling to Afghanistan and questioning Zardad's victims. A first trial began in 2004 but failed because the jury couldn't agree on a verdict.

The outer bands of the &lt;a href="w%3ASaffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale"&gt;Category 4&lt;/a&gt; storm &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Emily"&gt;Hurricane Emily&lt;/a&gt; started to affect &lt;a href="w%3AJamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; shortly before 8:00am Saturday. Increasing winds and rain swept the island nation throughout the afternoon as the eye of the storm passed 100 miles off the southern coast. Utility poles were downed and storm debris closed the seaside highway to the international airport. Other roads were reported closed as well. 

While islanders did not get through the two storms unscathed, and 4 people were left dead, the Land and Environment Minister Dean Peart told reporters, "Mercifully, Jamaica was spared the worst".

Buses were sent by officials to southern coastal areas to evacuate residents from the flood prone region, but most refused to leave and preferred to ride it out beside 8 foot waves that pounded areas of the coast line. Wind gusts of 155 &lt;a href="w%3AMiles%20per%20hour"&gt;mph&lt;/a&gt; doubled over palm trees in the capital city of &lt;a href="w%3AKingston%2C%20Jamaica"&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt;.

At a southern penninsula seaside fishing villiage, Port Royal residents boarded up and prepared for the worst again, as surfers gathered nearby to take on the challenge of 15 to 18 foot waves. "If I'm going to die, it's going to be right here," said a local resident Gordon Murphy, 39, with his 2-year-old son. "What's next?" he joked, "[Hurricane] Franklin?"

Many shops and businesses stayed open as long as they could, classifying it as another inconvenience despite its near Category 5 strength. Instead of the possible disaster that many prepared for, by late afternoon, Emily had all but disappeared. Light scattered showers in some areas of the island were the only remnant, as residents went about their lives after the second hurricane scare in as many weeks.

Supplies that many stocked for &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Dennis"&gt;Dennis&lt;/a&gt; and Emily may yet be put to use. Many wonder what storms are yet to come. Authorities say this will be one of the most active hurricane seasons in history. Emily was the strongest and earliest to form this year since records, dating back to 1860, have been kept.

Earlier, Emily stuck &lt;a href="w%3AGrenada"&gt;Grenada&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday with nearly a direct hit. A national disaster was called the day after its winds ravaged hundreds of homes and killed at least one man.

Winners of the UEFA Champions League first qualifying round will be known by July 20. Three games will be played tomorrow, and nine the following day.

<h2>July 19 games</h2>

Last year's Champions League winner, Liverpool, has the clearest chance of advancing to the second round, after beating the Welsh team with 3:0 in the first leg. FBK Kaunas is also expected to come out victorious, after winning 4 - 2 away. Havnar Bóltfelag would need to win with at least 3 goals difference, unless they score more then 4 goals, when they could get by with 2 goals advantage in the second leg.

A deadly forest fire in Spain's Guadalajara province has claimed the lives of at least 11 fire fighters. The fire began after a group of day trippers in Cueva de los Casares on Saturday left a barbeque unextinguished -- the day trippers have since confessed to causing the fire. At least 11,000 acres have been affected by the fire thus far.

The 11 firefighters, both men and women in their 20s, were trapped in their vehicle after a change in wind direction caused their vehicle to be encircled with flames. 

More than 150 firefighters have battled the blaze since Sunday. Water planes and helicopters from the region are assisting in the effort to extinguish the blaze; two French firefighting aircraft have been sent to augment Spanish forces.

Spain suffers on average 20,000 wild fires each year -- a heat wave and lack of rain have contributed to the tinder-box conditions which have exacerbated the fire season this year.

A report released on July 18 by &lt;a href="w%3AChatham%20House"&gt;Chatham House&lt;/a&gt; has claimed that the risk of &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt; has increased as a result of the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;2003 invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. It says that terrorist networks such as &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; have been strengthened, giving a boost to their "propaganda, recruitment and fundraising".

According to the press release, the report claims that there is "no doubt that the invasion of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; has imposed particular difficulties for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and for the wider coalition against terrorism".

"The UK is at particular risk because it is the closest ally of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and has closely supported the deployment of British troops in the military campaigns to topple the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and Saddam's regime in Iraq," it continued.

The report also criticised the UK governments lack of attention to &lt;a href="w%3Ainternational%20terrorism"&gt;international terrorism&lt;/a&gt;.

"As a result of giving lower priority to international terrorism, the British authorities did not fully appreciate the threat from Al-Qaeda. The failure to gain any warning from existing information of the 9/11 attacks on the United States was an intelligence
failure of the entire Western alliance, not only of the US intelligence community," the report said.

It also stated that countries such as the UK and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; are "at particular risk because [they are close allies] of the United States, has deployed armed forces in the military campaigns to topple the Taleban regime in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and has taken a leading role in international intelligence, police and judicial cooperation against Al-Qaeda".

Australian shadow foreign affairs spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the report proved Australia's support for the Iraqi invasion has placed Australia at greater risk. He said that it "turbo-charged" its profile as a potential terrorist target.

A number of governments have criticised the report. Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; is currently in Washington. He gave a joint press conference with &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;.

"I think that people who think that terrorists pick and choose discriminately don't understand how it works. The United States had done nothing on September 11 when it (the attack on America) was done. People who think they can make a separate peace with terrorists will find that it's like feeding an alligator, hoping it eats you last," Mr Rumsfeld said.

"No country can allow its foreign and defence policy to be malleable in the hands of terrorists," Mr Howard added.

Chatham House is a non-profit &lt;a href="w%3ANGO"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;. Its website describes it as "one of the world's leading organizations for the analysis of international issues". It was formerly known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs.

The report was funded by the &lt;a href="w%3AEconomic%20and%20Social%20Research%20Council"&gt;Economic and Social Research Council&lt;/a&gt;.

London Mayor Ken Livingstone has commented that the terrorist threat to the west results more generally from the fact that there has been "80 years of western intervention into predominantly Arab lands because of the western need for oil."

A report published by the Iraq Body Count project, a British &lt;a href="w%3ANGO"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;, says that 24,865 civilians have been killed in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in the two years following the start of the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;US-led invasion&lt;/a&gt; in March 2003. Seventy percent of the deaths occurred after the US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed "the end of major combat" on May 1 2003.

The study, compiled from more than 10,000 media reports, says that 37% (9,270) civilians have been killed by US-led forces. Half of all deaths (53%, 13,178) were caused by explosives, with 60% of those (7,961) being due to air-dropped bombs. Three-quarters of the deaths from air-dropped bombs were during the invasion before May 2003.

The report also states that 3,598 have been killed since May 2003 by non-Coalition bombing incidents, while 1,904 were killed by air-dropped bombs in the same period.

The study recorded that 82% of all deaths were adult males and 9% were adult women, although half of those killed by air-dropped bombs were children. In total, women and children accounted for about 18% of all civilian deaths.

Anti-occupation forces/insurgents accounted for 9% of the deaths, while criminal violence was blamed for 36%. The 28 page dossier also claimed that the situation in Iraq is getting worse. The fatalties in the second year after the invasion were twice as high as in the first year after the end of the war. At least 42,500 civilians were reported wounded.
More than a third of the report was based on the work of Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France Presse. Three-quarters of reports had at least one primary source, while 23% had two or more.

The Iraqi government disputed the figures. The Ministry of Health's figures recorded 6,629 deaths in the year leading up to April 2005, one-third of which were due to "terrorist incidents", with the remainder due to coalition forces. The Ministry of Interior, which also records deaths in the armed forces, reported 8,175 Iraqis were killed between July 2004 and May 2005.

Reuters noted that the figures apparently fail to note the number of people killed by suicide bombers in the last 18 months - with over 2,000 lives taken by car bombers, while the report claims that only 1,000 people have been killed by suicide bombers over 24 months. Reuters also pointed out that the report may underestimate deaths, as the media - the basis for the report - focuses mainly on Baghdad.

"The international forces try to avoid civilian casualties, whereas the terrorists target civilians and try to kill as many of them as they can," the government said in a statement
The US military also disputed the figures and said it is doing everything to avoid civilian casualties. "Since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom until now, we have categorically not targeted civilians", said Lieutenant Colonel Steve Boylan, a spokesman for the US military in Baghdad.

"The ever-mounting Iraqi death toll is the forgotten cost of the decision to go to war in Iraq. On average, 34 ordinary Iraqis have met violent deaths every day since the invasion of March 2003", said Professor John Sloboda, one of the authors of the report. He stressed that "neither the US nor the UK governments have begun to systematically measure the impact of their actions in terms of human lives destroyed."

The Iraqi Body Count group is based mainly in the Sheffield area of the United Kingdom. The co-founders are a human-rights campaigner, Hamit Dardagan, and Professor Sloboda, a psychologist at the University of Keele who is also a leading anti-war campaigner. The senior researcher is a retired librarian who last worked as the Head of Acquisitions in Keele University Library, and now runs an anti-war mailing list in the Sheffield area.

<h3>Other studies</h3>

There have been two other studies into the number of civilians killed in Iraq since March 2003.

The first to be published was a report in the British medical journal ♡❤The Lancet♡❤ in October 2004, stating that there had been 98,000 "excess deaths". The report was based on a questionnaire given to 998 households in 33 randomly-selected areas of Iraq, intended to be a representative sample. Of the total, 57,600 were given as being caused by accidents and disease, with the rest due to violence. The report had an extremely large margin of error - the 95% confidence interval (ie less than a 0.05% chance of being a fluke) range was from 8,000 up to 194,000.

The second report was the UN Development Program Iraq Living Conditions Survey, published in May 2005. This sampled 21,668 households in 2,200 areas, using similar selection and interpretation techniques as the Lancet study. This study recorded 24,000 "conflict-related deaths", with a 95% confidence interval of 18,000 to 29,000.

<h1>14,500 job cuts announced by Hewlett-Packard</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=14%2C500%20job%20cuts%20announced%20by%20Hewlett-Packard&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today the Hewlett-Packard Co. has announced that 10% or 14,500 of its full-time staff will be cut over the course of the next six quarters. HP CEO Mark Hurd, who took office about three months ago, has decided to simplify HP's operations by combining sales and marketing directly into business units. The job cuts are expected to save HP US$1.9 billion annually. These cuts are all part of HP's new restructuring plan, the savings from which will primarily be used to “offset market forces”, in other words, to strengthen HP's competitiveness in the market.

The job cuts come after prolonged analyst speculation that HP would be announcing between 10,000 and 25,000 losses. Few losses are expected in the areas of Sales or Research &amp; Development.

<h2>Reactions</h2>

The media in &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, where HP has over 4,000 employees across seven business units, has reacted cautiously to the announcement urging that more details should be awaited for before making any comments. The news however has made national headlines and workers are understandably anxious to find out more details.

Until a patch is issued, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ recommends that users close or block &lt;a href="w%3ATransmission%20Control%20Protocol"&gt;TCP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APort%20%28computing%29"&gt;port 3389&lt;/a&gt;, the port opened when the Remote Assistance service of its ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt; (OS) is enabled. The Remote Assistance feature is a service of the OS that allows Internet Technology administrators of corporate workgroups remote access to other desktops to perform maintenance and other configuration tasks from their own computer. It can also be used by on-line tech support sites. A support assistant can go into a user’s machine, if the service is enabled, and themself make changes directly to another person's computer to resolve an issue.

To initialize the remote assistance feature, the user of the helper computer must first make a request of the user of the target computer. Compliance must be granted by the user of the target machine, which then fully opens the communication port of the target machine to the helper computer. The operator of the helper computer then has control of target computer to make changes at will. The user of the target machine can watch in a separate window the actions of the helper, and either party to the session can end it at any time.

In a telephone conversation with a ♡❤Microsoft♡❤ representative Tuesday, it was learned that work to develop a security patch is underway, but when it will be available is unclear. It was cited that a patch must work consistently across multiple platform versions of the OS. 

The vulnerability, thought at first to affect only Windows XP SP2, is now believed to affect all current Windows editions, including Windows 2000, Windows XP SP1, Windows XP Professional x64, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 SP1, and Windows Server x64.

The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is not enabled by default, however if the service is enabled, a &lt;a href="w%3ADenial-of-service%20attack"&gt;Denial of Service attack&lt;/a&gt; could cause the OS to restart unexpectedly according to ♡❤Microsoft♡❤, or experience &lt;a href="w%3ABuffer%20overflow"&gt;buffer overflows&lt;/a&gt; according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASymantec"&gt;Symantec&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The RDP is enabled by default on Windows XP Media Center Edition.

♡❤Microsoft♡❤ suggests users block TCP port 3389 (the port used by RDP) on their firewall, or disable Terminal Services or Remote Desktop if not required by the user. The remote desktop connections could also be secured using either Internet Protocol Security or a virtual private network connection until a patch is ready.

To disable Remote Assistance on a Windows XP Edition, the steps are:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. click 'Start', right-click 'My Computer', select 'Properties'
BULLET::::2. select 'Remote' tab on top of the 'Systems Properties' window, clear checkbox that says "Allow Remote Assistance invitations to be sent from this computer."
BULLET::::3. click 'Apply' button

</ol>
The group, &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Storm%20Center"&gt;Internet Storm Center&lt;/a&gt;, detected spikes in scanning for port 3389 beginning July 6. Larger numbers of systems scanned were reported on July 13. Crackers may be scanning for vulnerable machines, the group said. 

"It's a kernel vulnerability," said VP of engineering for Symantec Alfred Huger, "so it will be difficult to exploit reliably. But he [the original discoverer] found the vulnerability with a commonly-used tool, so if he can find it, so can others. I don't think it will turn it into a large-scale worm, but then, some kernel vulnerabilities have ended up as just that, like the Witty worm."

A wet late Spring season's increase in rainfall helped duck populations rebound in the northern &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Plains"&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt; near the U.S.-Canadian border. A dry Winter and resulting low ground water levels threatened duck nesting grounds in the area.

Much to the relief of duck hunters, who feared a possible 2005 ban on duck hunting, the most-recent waterfowl survey released this week by the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service"&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt; showed duck populations in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Dakota"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; on the rebound.

This contrasted to a May survey that showed fewer ducks and waterfowl nesting areas in the state with the population of breeding ducks numbering 1.6 million, down from 1.7 million in 2004. The same May survey indicated that duck habitats, specifically ponds, had declined more than 35 percent from the historical average. 

However, late Spring rains reportedly improved wetland conditions and irrigated grasslands for grazing duck broods and re-nesting hens. The figures are used to set duck-hunting limits for the fall season, which begins in August. 

"I have observed many duck broods across eastern South Dakota in July, and grassland cover looks great statewide," Spencer Vaa, a waterfowl biologist with the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks said in an ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ report.

The Egyptian chemist arrested in &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; last week has no links with the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;London bombings&lt;/a&gt;, officials have said. The Egyptian interior ministry published a report which "made clear there was no link between &lt;a href="w%3AMagdi%20Asdi%20el-Nashar"&gt;Magdi Asdi el-Nashar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; or the bombings". Mr Nashar has still not been named a suspect by British police. 

Just after his arrest, the Egyptian interior minister said that reports linking Mr Nashar to al-Qaeda were "groundless" and based on a hasty conclusion. Mr Nashar has always denied being part of the London bombings; however he is reported to have told investigators that he helped arrange the rental of a flat for one of the bombers, Hasib Hussain. 

Mr Nashar has always maintained that he had intended to return to &lt;a href="w%3ALeeds"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; at the end of a holiday in &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, which began a week before the bombings.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; Majority Leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said it is unlikely that a new bill to reform immigration legislation will receive action by the legislative body this year. The bill, introduced yesterday by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Kyl"&gt;Jon Kyl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;AZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Cornyn"&gt;John Cornyn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (R,&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;TX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), would require immigrant workers to apply from their native countries for a visa to remain in the states. 

The number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is estimated to be in the range of 10 to 12 million.

The bill is in contrast to a different measure by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;MA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (R-AZ) submitted two months ago. That bill would create a visa category where temporary workers are not tied to any job in particular and would allow them to apply for permanent residence regardless of employment. The bill has republican co-sponsorship from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Kolbe"&gt;Jim Kolbe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="Jeff%20Flake"&gt;Jeff Flake&lt;/a&gt;, both from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where the porous US-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; border is an issue. 

The Kennedy-McCain bill allows illegal aliens already in the U.S. to petition the government to remain. A position that Kyl in effect calls the equivalent of granting "amnesty". Kennedy answered that criticism by saying, "The mass deportation of illegal immigrant persons as contemplated by the Cornyn-Kyl bill is not a realistic solution, and won't solve the security and economic problems we face."

The Kyl-Cornyn bill proposal is an attempt to tie immigrant status to U.S. employment. The legislation would create a guest worker program that would match immigrant workers with jobs mostly not wanted by American citizens. An immigrant worker would be given five years to come into compliance with an employment order. It calls for 10,000 federal agents, at a cost in the range of 2 to 5 billion, to audit employers who hire undocumented workers. Companies that break a proposed new law to monitor undocumented immigrants would be subject to penalties.

The bill drew criticism from immigration groups which include two leading Hispanic organizations because of the "mandatory departure" requirement. Immigrants who wait five years before leaving the U.S. would pay annual fines totaling $5,000 each year. Or, after making a return trip to their native country, they can again apply from there for a temporary job in the U.S. They would work for two years in the U.S., return home for a year, and then reapply for two more two-year work cycle. The maximum would be six years in the United States. In their home country, they could also apply for U.S. immigrant programs, including the "green card" that grants permanent residency. 
Kyl said he believes businesses will not object because his plan would make verifying legal workers easier by reducing the documentation required. The basics of the plan include: 

The bill also calls for replacing the practice currently in place in the U.S. of issuing paper Social Security cards with the issuance of a tamper-proof cards. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Security%20Administration"&gt;Social Security Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; identification card is treated by most states as no form of personal identification at all. A birth certificate is considered a primary form of identification, along with driver's licenses, passports and other official state or other territory photo-identification cards. The bill proposes that social security cards should be "machine readable" and a primary form of identification. 

A terrorism-driven drive to turn driver's licenses into a national ID card faces hurdles. &lt;a href="Peter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, treasurer of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, said he will not support national ID cards unless there is convincing evidence it fights terrorism.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has warned that 2.5 million people living in the African country of Niger are facing food shortages. Of those, about 800,000 are children.

Supplies of the staple foods - such as millet - have been low, forcing prices up. Drought and plagues of locust devastated crops across the Sahel region of Africa, and in Niger the effects have been compounded by years of economic decline.

More than a third of the countries districts face "critical" or "extremely critical" situations. While rainfall in the last few weeks has improved, seeds are in short supply after the earlier droughts.

The FAO launched an appeal to the world community for $4m of aid to combat the situation. So far, the only contributor has been Sweden, who donated $650,000 of seeds and animal fodder, which is currently being distributed to make the most of the current rains.

It is said by Oxfam that the neighbouring countries of Mali and Mauritania are also affected putting the total number of people at risk close to 5 million.

US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; today announced Justice &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20G.%20Roberts%20Jr."&gt;John G. Roberts Jr.&lt;/a&gt; as his pick to fill the Supreme Court void caused by the retirement of &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Justice Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;. Roberts is known as a strong conservative, but is nevertheless endorsed by many from both parties. At 50 years of age, if confirmed, he will be the youngest judge on the court, and is expected to be able to serve 30 years or more. He was appointed to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit"&gt;D.C. Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 by the President. 

Bush offered the nomination to Roberts during a phone call at 12:35 p.m. EDT today, with the intention to release the information to the public tonight, at a 9 p.m. EDT press conference. The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; had already revealed the president's pick at 7:45 p.m. EDT. Critics have already begun to voice complaints, including issues with &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;free speech&lt;/a&gt; and religious freedom, along with &lt;a href="w%3Areproductive%20rights"&gt;reproductive rights&lt;/a&gt;. Supporters see Roberts as a conservative who cut his teeth with Nixon and Reagan &amp;mdash; just the kind of nominee they were hoping for. 

In 1990, Roberts wrote a brief on &lt;a href="w%3ARoe%20v.%20Wade"&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/a&gt;, which stated, "The court's conclusion in Roe that there is a fundamental right to an &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; ... finds no support in the text, structure or history of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;." Though, during his confirmation hearings for the appellate court in 2003, Roberts stated that "Roe v. Wade is the settled law of the land... There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent."

The resolution comes in response to questions that have been raised about the handling of pre-war intelligence by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the planning and execution of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20war"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . “We would like to see a member of Congress look into whether or not the president committed impeachable offenses,” said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Bonifaz"&gt;John Bonifaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a constitutional lawyer. “We’ve been having that discussion with a number of offices.”

Rep. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;John Conyers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Mich.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Minority leader, recently met with John Bonifaz and representatives. But Conyers is reluctant to take such a bold step just yet. “My inclination at this time is not to do something like that,” Conyers said, although he noted that he wanted to press for an investigation in other ways, including sending committee investigators to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Earlier this month, Rep. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZoe%20Lofgren"&gt;Zoe Lofgren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;Calif.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) said at a forum held by Conyers “If you read the record of the writing of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Constitution"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ had a very particular meaning at the time of the drafting of the Constitution. It certainly didn’t mean lying about sex, but it might well mean lying to the Congress about a large public purpose such as Iraq.”, referring to Republican's filing of such a resolution in 1998 in an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AImpeachment%20of%20Bill%20Clinton"&gt;effort to remove Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from office.

Rep. Barbara Lee's resolution of inquiry is a less-drastic parliamentary maneuver that would ask the administration to provide more information related to the claims in classified British memos that suggest that pre-war intelligence in Iraq was "fixed" in order to justify the invasion. The Resolution of Inquiry is a privileged resolution, which means that if it is not acted on in 14 legislative days after it is introduced, the member of Congress who introduced it is entitled to request that it be brought to the House floor for a vote. The committee may take the matter up right away, and could vote it down before the August recess. If they do not, they will be required to take it up by September 16th.

<h1>British Army soldiers to be court martialled for war crimes</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20Army%20soldiers%20to%20be%20court%20martialled%20for%20war%20crimes&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Three &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Army"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; soldiers are to be court martialled for alleged war crimes in Iraq, United Kingdom Attorney General, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Goldsmith%2C%20Baron%20Goldsmith"&gt;Lord Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt;, announced yesterday in the House of Lords.

They are among eleven British soldiers charged with the ill treatment of two Iraqi civilians in separate incidents in September 2003. Seven, including the three accused of war crimes, have been charged with incidents that took place in September 2003. Four have been charged with the manslaughter of Ahmed Kareem in May 2003. They are alleged to have forced Mr Kareem &amp;mdash; who was detained as a suspected looter &amp;mdash; into the Shatt-al-Arab canal in Basra, where he subsequently drowned. 

The three &amp;mdash; Corporal Donald Payne, 34; Lance-Corporal Wayne Crowcroft, 21; and Private Darren Fallon, 22 &amp;mdash; have been charged under the International Criminal Court Act 2001, and will be tried domestically, along with the other eight, rather than by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hague"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt;.

They are from the 1st Battalion, &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Lancashire%20Regiment"&gt;Queen's Lancashire Regiment&lt;/a&gt; (QLR). The regiment has been at the centre of previous accusations of abuse in Iraq. The &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Mirror"&gt;Daily Mirror&lt;/a&gt; published in May 2004 photographs purporting to be of soldiers of the QLR abusing Iraqi prisoners. The photographs were later proven to have been fabricated, and the newspaper's editor, &lt;a href="w%3ALPiers%20Morgan"&gt;Piers Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, resigned.

<h2>Charges</h2>

Lance-Corporal Payne has been charged with manslaughter, inhuman treatment of persons, and perverting the course of justice. He is alleged to have killed Baha D'oud Salim Mousa, a 26-year-old hotel receptionist from Basra. Lance-Corporal Crowcroft and Private Fallon have also been charged with inhuman treatment of persons.
Sergeant Kelvin Stacey, 28, also of the QLR, is alleged to have assaulted an Iraqi detainee and now faces a charge of actual bodily harm. 

Colonel Jorge Mendonca, 41, the former commanding officer of the QLR; Major Michael Peebles, 34; and Warrant Officer Mark Davies, 36, both of the &lt;a href="w%3AIntelligence%20Corps"&gt;Intelligence Corps&lt;/a&gt;, have been charged with negligence of duty contrary to the Army Act 1955. 

All four charged with the manslaughter of Ahmed Kareem (as well as the alleged beating of other detainees) are from the &lt;a href="w%3AFoot%20Guards"&gt;Foot Guards&lt;/a&gt;, the British Army's élite infantry of the &lt;a href="w%3AHousehold%20Division"&gt;Household Division&lt;/a&gt;. They are: Sergeant Carle Selman, 38, then of the &lt;a href="w%3AColdstream%20Guards"&gt;Coldstream Guards&lt;/a&gt; (now with the &lt;a href="w%3AScots%20Guards"&gt;Scots Guards&lt;/a&gt;); Guardsmen Martin McGing, 21, of the &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Guards"&gt;Irish Guards&lt;/a&gt;; Guardsman Joseph McCleary, 23, of the Irish Guards; and an unnamed 21-year-old lance-corporal was later disclosed to be that of James Stephen Cooke, also of the Irish Guards.

<h2>Response</h2>

The Secretary of State for Defence, John Reid, responded to the charges in a statement. In it, Mr Reid said, "Today the independent Army Prosecuting Authority has brought charges under British military law that will be heard in a British Court-Martial. Anyone accused is innocent until proved guilty and it is for the Courts Martial to consider the evidence in any case and reach a verdict." 

In February, &lt;a href="British%20Iraq%20abuse%20case%20soldiers%20jailed"&gt;three British soldiers were jailed&lt;/a&gt; and dismissed from the army when they were found guilty of abusing Iraqis near Basra. The Chief of the General Staff, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Jackson"&gt;Sir Mike Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, condemned those convicted, and apologised to the victims and the people of Iraq.

Allowing the prosecution of British soldiers for war crimes has, however, been criticised by former chiefs of the defence staff. Just last week, some former chiefs in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20House%20of%20Lords"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt; said that prosecutions can be demoralising for the British Armed Forces, and can place the lives of soldiers at risk if the fear of prosecution prevents them from opening fire.

In May 2005, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Boyce"&gt;Lord Boyce&lt;/a&gt;, who held the post as an Admiral during the Iraq War, said in an interview with the British newspaper The Observer that he did not believe he had complete immunity from the International Criminal Court. 

In the interview, he said: "If my soldiers went to jail and I did, some other people would go with me."

After being asked whether Prime Minister Tony Blair and Lord Goldsmith would be with him if he was ever brought to account, Lord Boyce said: "Too bloody right!" 

The honorary Colonel-of-the-Regiment, Brigadier Geoffrey Sheldon, has said in a statement: "From the moment that Mr Mousa lost his life while in our custody, the regiment has made clear that this was an isolated, tragic incident which should never have happened, and which I and every member of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment bitterly regrets."

The brigadier did, however, state he found it "particularly difficult" to understand why charges had been brought against the former CO of the QLR, saying that: "It was Colonel Jorge Mendonca, then the commanding officer, who, as soon as he learned of Mr Musa's death, initiated the formal inquiry which has now resulted in these charges being brought."

Colonel Mendonca was awarded the &lt;a href="w%3ADistinguished%20Service%20Order"&gt;Distinguished Service Order&lt;/a&gt; (DSO) in Iraq, and was promoted to full colonel shortly afterwards. He is now on the Army's General Staff.

A multi-center &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; study of 748 patients, who were to undergo treatment for coronary artery disease, has found that &lt;a href="w%3Aprayer"&gt;prayer&lt;/a&gt; by Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and Buddhist groups had no measurable effects on the medical health of the study subjects. The prayers were conducted by established congregations and were held away from the hospitals.

The study, published in the 16 July 2005 issue of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lancet"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, found that the likelihood of an adverse cardiovascular event in hospital, re-admission or death within six months was unaffected by prayer.

None of the patients were told that they were prayed for, and none of the prayer groups knew who they prayed for. Nevertheless, 67% of the non-prayer group believed they were being prayed for - a potential placebo effect that may have hidden any small differences between the two groups.

The study also examined the effects of "music, imagery, and touch (MIT) therapy" before heart surgery. Practitioners qualified to Level 1 Healing Touch taught the patient relaxation techniques and played soothing music before applying 21 Healing Touch hand positions, over a 40 minute session. 

There was no significant change in the combined chance of an adverse cardiovascular event in hospital, re-admission or death within six months. However, while the set of patients was evenly split, only 7 patients who received MIT therapy died, and 20 patients who did not receive it died. The result is not highly significant due to the low overall number of people who died.

A number of studies has recently examined the possible effects of prayer, with mixed results. While some religious groups have hailed studies which found positive results &lt;a href="http%3A//www.godandscience.org/apologetics/smj1.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, skeptics have challenged the very notion of scientifically examining prayer &lt;a href="http%3A//www.skepdic.com/prayer.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and have described past studies as flawed or even fraudulent. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.csicop.org/si/2004-09/miracle-study.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

"The mechanisms through which distant intercessory prayer might convey healing benefit are unknown", the authors of the study explain. One hypothesis they propose for such effects are "non-local features of consciousness based theoretically around observations in &lt;a href="w%3Aquantum%20physics"&gt;quantum physics&lt;/a&gt;."

The study was conducted by a team of 16 researchers at Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), Duke University Medical Center, the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), and seven other academic medical institutions across the United States.

&lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3AHorst%20K%C3%B6hler"&gt;Horst Köhler&lt;/a&gt; announced today that he has dissolved the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABundestag"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ after a &lt;a href="w%3Amotion%20of%20confidence"&gt;motion of confidence&lt;/a&gt; by chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Schr%C3%B6der%20loses%20motion%20of%20confidence"&gt;deliberately failed&lt;/a&gt; on July 1st. He set the 18th of September 2005 as the date for &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20federal%20election%2C%202005"&gt;early elections to the Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;.

In a televised address Köhler stated that Germany is in a serious economic situation and that the country needs a stable government. He recalled the previous occasions when the Bundestag was dissolved and agreed with the chancellor that the loss of confidence was genuine and urged the citizens to vote.

The Speaker of the Bundestag, &lt;a href="w%3AWolfgang%20Thierse"&gt;Wolfgang Thierse&lt;/a&gt;, welcomed the decision and urged the parties to conduct fair campaigns.

Chancellor Schröder also paid his respect to Köhler, calling his decision ♡❤confident♡❤ and again expressed that he intents to resume the ♡❤good way♡❤ on which Germany is heading under his leadership.

The Chair of the conservative &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (CDU) and her party's candidate for chancellor, &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;, welcomed the call for early elections and wants to get Germany on ♡❤the right track♡❤ if her party gets to power in September.
The dissolving is the result of a long political muddle that began on May 22th when Schröder's &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (SPD) lost the most populous state of Germany, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Rhine-Westphalia"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;, to the CDU, the biggest opposition party. Minutes after the early projections were in, SPD chair &lt;a href="w%3AFranz%20M%C3%BCntefering"&gt;Franz Müntefering&lt;/a&gt; announced that his party would seek re-election in fall of 2005. However, the &lt;a href="w%3ABasic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany"&gt;Basic Law of Germany&lt;/a&gt; does not permit the self-dissolving of the Bundestag. The only way to achieve early elections is when the chancellor loses a motion of confidence. All major parties, including the opposition, support the call for early election. Polls also indicate that 75% of the population support going to the ballots in September. However, some MP's, most notably Werner Schulz of SPD's coalition partner, &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20%2790/The%20Greens"&gt;The Greens&lt;/a&gt;, say that the procedure was unconstitutional because the loss of confidence was orchestrated. They announced that they will sue against the dissolving before the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20Court%20of%20Germany"&gt;Constitutional Court of Germany&lt;/a&gt;.

Germany has been struggling with high unemployment for several years and the reforms Schröder introduced were criticized as being &lt;a href="w%3ANeo-Liberalism"&gt;neo-liberalistic&lt;/a&gt; by unions and also by members of his own party.

Current polls see the CDU at 44%, while the SPD can only expect 27%. The liberal &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Germany%29"&gt;FDP&lt;/a&gt;, CDU's possible coalition partner, can expect 7%, The Greens 8% and the &lt;a href="w%3ALeft%20Party%20%28Germany%29"&gt;Party of the Left&lt;/a&gt; (formerly PDS) 11%.

The governing SPD-Green coalition is faced with an overwhelming opposition majority in the &lt;a href="w%3ABundesrat%20of%20Germany"&gt;Bundesrat&lt;/a&gt;, the upper chamber, that is able to block most bills. Schröder claims that the CDU is engaging in a ♡❤policy of blockade♡❤ rendering him unable to make laws and implement policy changes while Angela Merkel, says that Schröder's government is simply ♡❤incapable to take action♡❤.

<h1>Press freedom groups condemn two-day radio station ban in Burundi</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Press%20freedom%20groups%20condemn%20two-day%20radio%20station%20ban%20in%20Burundi&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

One of &lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt;'s only independent radio stations, Radio Publique Africain, has been taken off air for two days. Last week the country's National Communications Council (CNC) ordered the radio station to stop broadcasting indefinitely, claiming that it had insulted them, and that coverage of recent elections had been biased.

RPA director Alexis Sinduhije said that the claims were unjust, and that the station had given every political party 20 minutes airtime a week during the elections.

But he reluctantly agreed to a two-day ban after mediation by a group of professional journalists and private broadcasters between RPA and the CNC.

Earlier this year, Radio Publique Africain was suspended for two days after being accused of breaking the country's press laws, including "offending public morals", by reporting on the rape of an eight-year-old girl and "deforming" the words of a politician. RPA observed the ban and was allowed to restart broadcasting afterwards.

The ban has been condemned by the international press freedom organisation the &lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20to%20Protect%20Journalists"&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;/a&gt;, who have called on the CNC to lift it "immediately and unconditionally"

A group of Burundian journalists overseas, the "Collectif des Professionnels des Médias de la Diaspora Burundaise" has also spoken out, in an open letter to the CNC, accusing it of being "a body of repression which uses disproportionate sanctions". 

Burundi's recent democratic elections were the first since the 1993 assassination of President Melchior &lt;a href="w%3ANdadaye"&gt;Ndadaye&lt;/a&gt; plunged the country into a vicious, ethnically-charged civil war. 

"&lt;a href="w%3APress%20freedom"&gt;Press freedom&lt;/a&gt; has been historically related to the emergence of democracy", the letter continues. "It is essential that the media, like other instruments of good governance, is protected". 

Radio Publique Africain was launched in early 2001, seeking to promote peace by hiring both &lt;a href="w%3AHutus"&gt;Hutus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATutsis"&gt;Tutsis&lt;/a&gt;, including ex-combatants, to work on the editorial team. The station's investigative reporting and grassroots approach to issues affecting ordinary Burundians quickly earned it the nickname "the People's Radio." 

"We ask the political leaders to answer their concerns: Why are people kept in prison without trial? Why has their land been taken away? Exposing the truth in this way has brought Hutu and Tutsi communities together and made it harder for politicians to manipulate the public", said RPA director Alexis Sinduhije after receiving a press freedom award last year. 

In October 2001 Sinduhije was arrested and beaten up after interviewing a South African peacekeeper against the wishes of the Burundian government. In February 2003 armed men broke into Sinduhije's house and murdered his security guard. In September of the same year Radio Publique Africain was taken off the air after broadcasting an interview with a rebel spokesperson. In a show of solidarity, other independent radio stations refused to broadcast any government news or statements until the ban on RPA was lifted. 

Burundi's independent media has become increasingly vocal and vibrant in recent years. The development of the internet has seen the appearance of a number of independent Burundian news websites based overseas, outside the control of Burundi's government and the CNC. When the radio journalist Etienne Ndikuriyo was arrested without charge earlier this year, the Burundian online media helped mobilise international opinion, and he was released eight days later.

&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Montgomery%20Doohan"&gt;James Montgomery Doohan&lt;/a&gt;, the Canadian actor best known for playing the role of ♡❤&lt;a href="Star%20Trek"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡s "&lt;a href="w%3AMontgomery%20Scott"&gt;Scotty&lt;/a&gt;" the engineer died Wednesday of &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; after a long battle with &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. He was 85 years old.

Now, Doohan's family is hoping to beam him up to the "Final Frontier" that Scotty loved so dearly. The actor had told relatives he wanted his ashes blasted into outer space, as was done for "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry. "He'll be there with his buddy, which is wonderful," said Doohan's agent and longtime friend, Steve Stevens.

At the time of his death, he was living in &lt;a href="w%3ARedmond%2C%20Washington"&gt;Redmond, Washington&lt;/a&gt; in the United States with his wife and their three young children. 

Doohan was born in &lt;a href="Vancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; and participated in &lt;a href="World%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; as a captain in the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Artillery"&gt;Royal Canadian Artillery&lt;/a&gt;. He lost the middle finger of his right hand at the Invasion of &lt;a href="w%3AJuno%20Beach"&gt;Juno Beach&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AD-Day"&gt;D-Day&lt;/a&gt;, a bloody scene immortalized in the 1998 &lt;a href="Steven%20Spielberg"&gt;Steven Spielberg&lt;/a&gt; film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASaving%20Private%20Ryan"&gt;Saving Private Ryan&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Doohan was among the film's greatest supporters, thanking the director for not sanitizing the gore of the actual event.
He started his acting career with a radio appearance at a CBC show and went on to act in several character roles. Doohan had already made a name for himself in the entertainment business as a featured voice actor in Canadian and U.S. radio dramas and motion picture voice-overs due to his knack for picking up linguistically perfect accents. His ability to affect a near-perfect Scottish accent made him a natural for the role of Scotty, according to producers at the time.

When he auditioned for what would become the role of his life in 1966, Star Trek creator &lt;a href="w%3AGene%20Roddenberry"&gt;Gene Roddenberry&lt;/a&gt; asked him which of the different accents Doohan mastered would best suit the role of Scotty. Doohan respond that he believed "all the world's best engineers have been Scottish". After the original Star Trek series had ended, Doohan found himself typecast and had difficulties getting other roles.

Doohan suffered from Parkinson's as well as Alzheimer's disease. In August last year he received a star on Hollywood's &lt;a href="w%3AWalk%20of%20fame"&gt;Walk of fame&lt;/a&gt;.

After &lt;a href="w%3ADeForest%20Kelley"&gt;DeForest Kelley&lt;/a&gt;, Doohan is the second actor of the original Star Trek cast to die.

He is survived by his wife Wende, with whom he had been married since 1975, and seven children.

An 18 year old &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; man guilty of rape escaped from the court of appeal in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASundsvall"&gt;Sundsvall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today, in a way described as chaotic.

According to the news agency &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATidningarnas%20Telegrambyr%C3%A5"&gt;TT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the man tried to escape from the custody of the staff of the treatment of offenders. His parents and some friends attacked the staff, and the 18-year-old and an additional 17-year-old managed to escape.

The parents have been arrested, but the young men are reported to be free as of this evening. Both men had been sentenced in the Sundsvall district court, the 18-year-old for rape.

A U.S. Army report finds stress is weighing heavily on Iraq War-era troops with 54 percent of soldiers rating their units' morale as low or very low. This is better than the comparable figure in a year-earlier Army survey. Reportedly, most bothersome to the soldiers was the length of their required stay in Iraq, which was at least 1 year.

Defense Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20H.%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald H. Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; said that the Army's 12-month requirement is linked to reorganization. "I've tried to get the Army to look at the length of tours and I think at some point down the road they will," Rumsfeld said.

With a stroke of the pen, Canadian Supreme Court Chief Justice &lt;a href="w%3ABeverley%20McLachlin"&gt;Beverley McLachlin&lt;/a&gt; signed into law Canada's controversial C-38 bill, which legalized &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; in the country. In doing so, Canada became the fourth nation in the world to grant full legal marriage rights to same-sex couples.

The signature came one day after Canada's Senate voted to adopt the bill Tuesday. The parliament's lower house voted to pass C-38 earlier this year. The law makes national same sex marriage rights that are already legalized in eight of the country's 10 provinces.

The other three countries that have similar laws are &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Netherlands"&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.

Winners of the first round of qualifications for the Champions League are now known. There are two more qualifying rounds before the competition is taken into group leagues.

One of two games taken into overtime was between Zrinjski and Dudelange (0 - 4, aggregate 1 - 4). In an exciting finish of game in Mostar, Dudelange managed to make up for 0 - 1 loss in Luxembourg when Thomas Gruszczynski scored the first goal of the game in 92', securing extra time. Joris Di Gregorio scored for Dudelange in 6' of extra time, and Gruszczynski sealed the fate of Zrinjski minutes later when he scored once again for 3 - 0. Gaël Hug scored the finishing goal when it was already all over.

Another surprise was Tirana's win at home over Slovenian Gorica. Gorica got into the second game with 2 - 0 advantage at home, but managed to make a complete turnaround and win 3 - 0 in Albania.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Software%20Ratings%20Board"&gt;Entertainment Software Ratings Board&lt;/a&gt; (ESRB) changed its content rating of the controversial ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Theft%20Auto%3A%20San%20Andreas"&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ video game from "Mature" to "Adults Only" on Wednesday. The ESRB change came after a investigation proved that sexual content in the game could be unlocked by anyone with the Windows version or with a modified console. 

Graphic sex scenes in the game can be revealed if a user downloads a patch from the internet of the "Hot Coffee modification" or enters codes into a 3rd party modifier such as the game shark. This opens up a locked mini-game that depicts characters as having sex. The secret code as well as the patch is widely available on the Internet such as gamer sites, MoFunZone.com and Gamespot. 

In response to this, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARockstar%20Games"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and its parent company ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATake-Two%20Interactive"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ stopped making the version of the game with the sexual content and plan to release a "Mature"-rated title in the fall with the "Hot Coffee" content removed. 

Game maker ♡❤Take-Two♡❤ says the 'game mod' is third-party software that violates the end-user license agreement of the company's intellectual property rights. Citing what the company calls standard industry practice to create content that never makes it into the final version of a game, the sex scenes included in the software, "were never intended to be found." 

After the rating change, stores such as &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATarget%20Corporation"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; pulled the game off their shelves under their policies not to sell "Adults Only"-rated games.

This controversy has lead to major debate between execs and politicians whether the video game industry should continue to judge itself or not. Many of the watchdog groups were unaware that content like this is usually "locked away" instead of being deleted.

&lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20bin%20Bakri%20Muhammad"&gt;Oma Bakri Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial Muslim &lt;a href="w%3Acleric"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt; living in Britain under political asylum since 1985, has said he does not believe the July 7th &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;London bombers&lt;/a&gt; were Muslims. 

He told BBC News that there was no evidence the four young Muslim men filmed at a station prior to the attacks were responsible for the bombs. He also condemned "any killing of innocent people here and abroad"

However he said he would not co-operate with police in the search for the bombers and other Muslim extremists, or even when he knew of an imminent terrorist attack.

"I believe co-operation with the British police would never ever prevent any action like this." He said.

Adding, "The youth will leave us. The youth will see us, at that time, the voice, the eyes and the ears of the British government."

"The way to earn the heart of the British youth is by the divine text, to say 'God say it and ... Mohammed say it, Do not attack the people you live among.' Not to tell them, 'Tony Blair say it, the law say it, don't do so.'" 

Oma Bakri Mohammed is facing deportation after partly blaming Britain itself for the attacks on London. He also blamed the UK government's "evil foreign policy and the war on terror" for pushing Muslims in "the wrong direction". He has lived in Britain for 20 years, and said he would not resist if he were to be imprisoned or deported.

The cleric also believes &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; does not allow Muslims to fight the people they lived side by side with. 
"To live among them, and sell with them and deal with them and trade with them and then fight them, that is completely not Islamic."

&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Tancredo"&gt;Representative Tom Tancredo&lt;/a&gt; (R-CO) has clarified his earlier statement that "you could take out their holy sites," in the event of a nuclear attack upon the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; by Islamic terrorists. Rep. Tancredo has refused to make any apologies, saying "When we bombed Hiroshima, when we bombed Dresden, we punished a lot of people who were not necessarily (guilty). Not every &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; was a member of the Nazi Party. You do things in war that are ugly." However, Tancredo emphasized that he was speaking hypothetically and not necessarily suggesting policy. 

The remarks, made in a July 15th radio interview, hosted by Pat Campbell of WFLA in &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, have drawn support from conservatives groups such as &lt;a href="w%3ANortheast%20Intelligence%20Network"&gt;Northeast Intelligence Network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Republic"&gt;Free Republic&lt;/a&gt;, and have offended the American &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; community.
In the interview, Tancredo discussed his request for information from the Justice Department regarding the claim of evangelical Christian journalist &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Farah"&gt;Joseph Farah&lt;/a&gt; that al-Qaida has smuggled multiple nuclear weapons into the U.S.

London &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; commissioner &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Blair"&gt;Sir Ian Blair&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that there have been three small explosions on tube trains at &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Street%20tube%20station"&gt;Warren Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOval%20tube%20station"&gt;Oval&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShepherd%27s%20Bush%20tube%20station%20%28Hammersmith%20and%20City%20Line%29"&gt;Shepherd's Bush&lt;/a&gt; stations, and another small explosion on a No. 26 bus on Hackney Road in &lt;a href="w%3ABethnal%20Green"&gt;Bethnal Green&lt;/a&gt;. 

The London Ambulance Service has not found any injured people, but one person has reported themselves to a local hospital. It is not yet known if this is connected with the blasts.
All the devices were "conventional" but possibly faulty, and contained no chemical or biological agents. Not all the bombs exploded fully; Bomb Squad officers are working on making them safe. There are no reports of the deaths of suspects who attempted to set the explosives off. 

<h2>Incidents</h2>

A spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AStagecoach%20London"&gt;Stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; said the driver of the number 26 bus travelling through &lt;a href="w%3AShoreditch"&gt;Shoreditch&lt;/a&gt; had heard a bang on upper deck, gone upstairs and seen the windows were blown out. The bus driver was very shaken but is said to be fine. Reports of the windows having been blown out have been denied by a police officer on the scene. "I have seen the bus. There were no windows blown out," the officer told Reuters.

One injury sustained at &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Street%20tube%20station"&gt;Warren Street&lt;/a&gt; tube station has been confirmed by authorities. There have been no other reports of injuries, and authorities are reporting no casualties.

At around 15:25, a man was arrested by armed police in &lt;a href="w%3AWhitehall"&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt;, which is cordoned off. A second man was arrested in the Whitehall area around 16:15, but Police have confirmed that this arrest is unconnected with the explosions.

Armed police were deployed at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20College%20Hospital"&gt;UCL Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, near Warren Street tube station, after reports of a suspect entering the hospital. There was speculation that one of the bombers may have been injured and sought treatment at the hospital. A Scotland Yard spokesman had said "We are dealing with an incident at University College Hospital and we have armed officers deployed there. We cannot go in any further detail at this stage." A UCL spokeswoman confirmed that an email had been sent to staff asking them to be on the lookout for the suspect. At 16:00 a spokesman for the Metropolitan police confirmed that the incident was over, but armed police returned to the hospital 30 minutes later to search the premises. Police have now also confirmed this is unrelated to the explosions.

<h2>Responses</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; has cancelled a visit to an east London school and a photocall with visiting Prime Minister John Howard of Australia, instead heading to a &lt;a href="w%3ACabinet%20Office%20Briefing%20Room%20A"&gt;COBRA&lt;/a&gt; committee emergency meeting. Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; is in London and is involved in discussions with Tony Blair as this unfolds.

In a public press conference, Blair said that "there appear to have been no casualties", and that he wanted people to "React calmly, and continue with our lives". John Howard also stated that Australia stood by Britain and that people should "beware the minds of terrorists."

Police initially advised against unnecessary travel in London, asking Londoners to keep travel to a minimum and avoid the public transport system. At 15:52 &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Ian%20Blair"&gt;Sir Ian Blair&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; has asked Londoners to return to their normal activities, including travel. He also stated that some public transport services are not yet functioning.

A release from &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; stated that there was no chemical agents found after checking the &lt;a href="w%3AOval%20tube%20station"&gt;Oval&lt;/a&gt;. Investigations at Shepherd's Bush station also confirmed no chemical agents.

<h2>Closures</h2>

The &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Line"&gt;Northern line&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AHammersmith%20and%20City%20Line"&gt;Hammersmith and City Line&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APiccadilly%20Line"&gt;Piccadilly Line&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ABakerloo%20line"&gt;Bakerloo Line&lt;/a&gt; have been suspended. &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Line"&gt;Victoria Line&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AWaterloo%20and%20City%20Line"&gt;Waterloo and City Line&lt;/a&gt; were suspended but reopened shortly after. &lt;a href="w%3AWhitehall"&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt; had been sealed off but reopened shortly after, only to be closed again after armed police surrounded and arrested a man outside the Ministry of Defence, however at a press conference at 17:45 Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said that this arrest was unconnected with the explosions.

<h2>Unconfirmed reports</h2>
Various news sites are reporting a minor explosion in a passenger's &lt;a href="w%3Abackpack"&gt;backpack&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; correspondent, claiming to have sources working in the London Underground, suggested the explosions were only &lt;a href="w%3Adetonator"&gt;detonators&lt;/a&gt; and that the bombs contained no explosives. It is also believed that reports of gunshots being heard at the stations are mistaken, passengers simply mistaking the sound of the detonators for the sound of gunshots.

A spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; has stated the nature of the incidents is unknown.

Eyewitness reports from &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Street%20tube%20station"&gt;Warren Street&lt;/a&gt; say that something happened towards the front of the train. The passengers all headed towards the back of the train. As the train pulled into the station somebody pulled the emergency alarm and all the passengers got off the train. There are reports of a 'burning rubber' smell from eyewitnesses.

25% of Shepherd's Bush / Uxbridge Road and all of Shepherd's Bush Green is sealed off.

Eyewitness report of "bang" in a carriage at &lt;a href="w%3AOval%20tube%20station"&gt;Oval&lt;/a&gt; station. No injuries. After being spotted the suspect fled the station, leaving the suspect package unexploded in a carriage. (BBC News 24)

&lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;London Police&lt;/a&gt; are not regarding this as a major incident yet. (BBC News 24)

&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Transport%20Police"&gt;British Transport Police&lt;/a&gt; report there has been one injury at Warren Street Station. No details as to the cause and nature of this injury are available, although BBC News are speculating that the injury is to the person who set off the device.

There are reports of problems sending text messages or making calls from mobiles phones on some networks. (O2 confirmed, Orange is fine, occasional text service but no calls on Vodafone) O2 provide communications services for emergency teams across the UK and have previously prioritized their network usage for this use.

The British Parliament approved the first stage of the new &lt;a href="w%3ACrossrail"&gt;Crossrail&lt;/a&gt; underground railroad through London as a £15 billion construction project earlier this month. Crossrail is the first major new train line to be built in London in decades. 

The rail line being implemented as a hybrid bill in Parliament. After a second reading in Parliament, it was voted upon and decided that the government will commit to the project so that the line will be built.

The next issue before Parliament of to ensure that the implementation of the bill so it is consistent with private interests of neighborhoods to be affected by Crossrail. This is when residents can petition Parliament to change the way the line is constructed.

As a result of construction of the Crossrail line, hundreds of homes will have new tunnels excavated beneath them. 

On contacting Crossrail, they have indicated approximately £50 will be offered to each landowner to buy all the land rights-of-way to build the train tunnel more than 9 meters below the residential buildings. The average value for properties in the affected areas is £350,000. 

Under UK compulsory purchase laws to be used in this bill, the residents are entitled to the difference in the value of the whole property with and without a tunnel under it. If the offer given by Crossrail is not accepted by any of the residents, the residents can take the case to the Land Tribunal, where the fair value will be established. 

This however, could be cost prohibitive. Crossrail does not indicate that it will attempt to assign a fair value in the original offer and instead is only going to offer around £50 per property in the hope that not many people take the matter to the Land Tribunal.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair has made a statement at 10 Downing Street saying that the explosions in London today were "to scare people and to frighten them, to make them anxious and worried".

He broke off his meeting with Australian Prime Minister John Howard to make the statement, with Howard alongside him.

Blair went on to say how the "police have done their very best, and the security services too, in the situation, and I think we have just got to react calmly and continue with our business as much as possible as normal".

London Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair also released a statement urging Londoners to "get moving again", stating that the sites of the four explosions were secure and the situation was under control.

Three tube lines remain closed: the Victoria, Northern and Hammersmith &amp; City Lines. The Bakerloo line is suspended between Paddington to Piccadilly Circus. Replacement shuttle bus services are running.

Police are appealing to anyone who may have photos or mobile phone images from any of the incident scenes, either at the time of the incident or shortly before, to send them online to: &lt;a href="http%3A//www.police.uk"&gt;www.police.uk&lt;/a&gt;.

A month after the &lt;a href="w%3ACook%20County%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Cook County&lt;/a&gt; Board of Commissioners unanimously voted to welcome the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AGay%20Games"&gt;Gay Games&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, the five Republicans on the board withdrew their names under pressure from conservative activists. Chicago is located in Cook County.

The Gay Games is an -style multi-day international sports competition targeted to &lt;a href="w%3ALGBT"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt; athletes.

Commissioners Gregg Goslin, Liz Gorman, Carl Hansen, Tony Peraica and Peter Silvestri, the only Republicans sitting on the Board of Commissioners withdrew their names from the proclamation. "I'm a pro-family kind of person and conservative on social issues. That's nothing against the gay and lesbian community, but it's nothing I want to advance as a cause celebre," Peraica told the ♡❤Chicago Sun-Times♡❤. In the same report, Gorman said that she doesn't support "special rights for any group."

An anti-gay rights lobbying group, the Illinois Family Institute (IFI), says it is trying to get Democrat commissioners to also withdraw their names from the official welcome. "There is a difference between tolerating and celebrating homosexuality," Peter LaBarera, a spokesman for the group said in an Associated Press interview. The IFI also expressed concern about taxpayer money being used to promote the event.

Although Gay Games spokeswoman Tracy Baim she said she was not surprised by the reversal of the five commissioners, Mike Quigley, a Democrat Cook County Commissioner said of the retraction of his colleagues, "It's a blinding bias and animosity that is overriding human interest, job creation, economic development and the whole spirit of athletic competition." Quigley was the sponsor of the proclamation and plans to play &lt;a href="w%3Aice%20hockey"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; in the games.

The 12 other commissioners who voted for the welcome proclamation maintained their support for the event, which is scheduled to run from July 15 to July 22, 2006 and projected to generate between $50 million and $80 million in tourist business to the city and county.

U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice ♡❤Source: Wikicommons♡❤&lt;/a&gt; has expressed her anger after a meeting with Sudanese President &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Hassan%20al-Bashir"&gt;Omar Hassan al-Bashir&lt;/a&gt;, during which her aides and staff were mistreated by Sudanese security agents. She demanded an official apology, which was given by the foreign minister by phone an hour after the official meeting.

James Wilkinson, Ms. Rice's communications director, was shoved against a wall by guards as he tried to enter the meeting. The meeting began with 10 minutes of silence due to the security disallowing the American translator entry. Later, Andrea Mitchell of NBC News interrupted the meeting to shout a question to al-Bashir, "Why should Americans believe your promises" in regards to Darfur, when "your government is still supporting the militias?" She was then dragged forcibly from the room by two Sudanese security members; al-Bashir did not acknowledge the question.

<h1>Chinese yuan revalued against dollar</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Chinese%20yuan%20revalued%20against%20dollar&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The government of &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has decided to stop its currency peg to the &lt;a href="U.S.%20dollar"&gt;U.S. dollar&lt;/a&gt;. The country will revalue its currency, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20yuan"&gt;yuan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , for the first time in a decade. This comes after international pressure from Western countries, especially from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The yuan will now be linked to a variety of different currencies.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Bank%20of%20China"&gt;People's Bank of China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has announced a 2.1% revaluation increase which will allow the yuan to fluctuate +/- 0.3 yuan in daily trading. This means, like other currencies, that closing prices one day become opening prices the next day.

<h3>U.S. pressure</h3>

The U.S. government has been pressuring China to revalue its currency since China joined the &lt;a href="WTO"&gt;WTO&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. said that China has kept the yuan up to 40% under its real value to increase exports, thus giving China an unfair advantage against western industrial competitors as well as industry in developing nations.

<h3>Prices will rise</h3>

Since the announcement the yuan has strengthened to 8.11 yuan to the US dollar instead of 8.28 as it has been for the last ten years. This means the yuan is more expensive and that Chinese goods will become more expensive in western countries. 

Economic growth in China might also slow down, but it has been soaring for the last several years. This could have serious consequences in China, but a People's Bank of China person has said that the exchange rate will be "basically stable".

China linked the yuan to the dollar in 1997 during the major economic crisis in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;. This has provided the stability which has allowed the Chinese economy to grow over the last ten years. This move will make China vulnerable to future financial fluctuations.

This move could also mean that the US dollar would fall if China switches from holding dollars to holding for example the euro or other strong currencies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20House%20votes%20to%20renew%20expiring%20Patriot%20Act&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; voted Thursday night to renew several provisions of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatriot%20Act"&gt;Patriot Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which was established after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The final vote was 257-171, this now makes 14 of the 16 original provisions of the Patriot Act permanent and will extend the other two for an additional 10 years.

The two provisions which were only extended for 10 years have been called unconstitutional by some civil liberties advocates as well as several law makers from both the right and left. They say that the provisions give law enforcement "sweeping powers" that could be abused. However, President Bush as well as several Republican and Democratic members of Congress say that the provisions have been used judiciously and provide key tools needed to fight terrorism.

House lawmakers widely viewed the uncontroversial provisions of the Patriot Act as breaking down "the wall" that was a barrier to communication and cooperation between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; agencies. The two provisions which received 10-year extensions were concerned with allowing roving wiretaps, and the other with allowing searches of library and medical records. In a pre-vote &lt;a href="http%3A//www.whitehouse.gov/ask/20050720.html"&gt;Q &amp; A&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. federal attorney Paul McNulty explained that a federal search in those intrusive situations require independent federal judge approval, which is granted under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Section 215.

The U.S. Senate's reauthorization of the Patriot Act has differences from the House version. Both bills head to conference committee to be combined into one cohesive law.

In a Wednesday morning address to a gathering at the Port of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called on congress for passage of the act: "The Patriot Act is expected to expire, but the terrorist threats will not expire. I expect, and the American people expect, the United States Congress and the United States Senate to renew the Patriot Act, without weakening our ability to fight terror, and they need to get that bill to my desk soon." The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asunset%20provision"&gt;sunset provision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the act is due take effect at the end of this year, in which case the act would expire.

<h1>Armed police shoot man dead on London Underground</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Armed%20police%20shoot%20man%20dead%20on%20London%20Underground&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Servizce"&gt;London Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed that &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Police%23Use%20of%20firearms"&gt;armed police officers&lt;/a&gt; shot and killed a man at &lt;a href="w%3AStockwell%20tube%20station"&gt;Stockwell Underground station&lt;/a&gt; just after 10 a.m. BST this morning. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Sir Ian Blair, the Commissioner of London Metropolitan, told a press conference this afternoon that the man was challenged by police officers (not in uniform) but refused to follow instructions. Some witnesses claim he did not appear to be carrying any arms, but wore a heavy coat that may have concealed a weapon. One passenger, Anthony Larkin, said the man appeared to be wearing a “bomb belt”. 

Mark Whitby, apparently the closest eye witness said; "He half-tripped, was half-pushed to the floor. The policeman nearest to me had the black automatic pistol in his left hand, he held it down to the guy and unloaded five shots into him."

Police have revealed that the shooting was connected with &lt;a href="Four%20small%20explosions%20strike%20London%27s%20transport%20system"&gt;yesterday's attempted attacks&lt;/a&gt;, but but have not confirmed him to be one of the four bombing suspects. Police sources have indicated that the man who was shot had been followed covertly, and after he was confronted he ran off and was followed on foot by up to twenty police from street level into the Underground station. 

London Underground suspended some services on the &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Line"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Line"&gt;Northern line&lt;/a&gt;s, citing a request by the police. The Northern line was then completely suspended for a short time mid-afternoon after a security alert at Mornington Crescent Station.

The London Ambulance Service have dispatched ambulances and the air ambulance to the scene. The Metropolitan Police have cordoned off a 200 &lt;a href="w%3AMetre"&gt;metre&lt;/a&gt; perimeter around the station.

<h2>Eyewitness accounts</h2>

Passenger Briony Coetsee said: "We were on the Tube and then we suddenly heard someone say 'get out, get out' and then we heard gunshots."

Mark Whitby, who was sitting just five metres from the incident, told BBC News: "I saw an Asian [of origin] guy run onto the train hotly pursued by three plain-clothes police officers. One of them was carrying a black handgun - it looked like an automatic - they pushed him to the floor, bundled on top of him and unloaded five shots into him. He was wearing a large coat, unusual for the time of year."

“As the man got on the train I looked at his face. He looked from left to right, but he basically looked like a cornered rabbit, like a cornered fox. He looked absolutely petrified. He sort of tripped but they were hotly pursuing him and couldn't have been more than two or three feet behind him at this time. He half-tripped, was half-pushed to the floor. The policeman nearest to me had the black automatic pistol in his left hand, he held it down to the guy and unloaded five shots into him. I didn’t see any guns or anything like that; I didn’t see him carrying anything. I didn’t even see a bag to be quite honest."

Reports from ITV News suggested that the person shot was another suicide bomber. Sky News (web) reported the same, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.sky.com/skynews/article/0%2C%2C30000-1189920%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
but later reported that "initial examinations [...] did not discover any explosives on the suspect." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.sky.com/skynews/article/0%2C%2C30000-1189947%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C22989-1704399%2C00.html"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; reported that police believed the man to be one of the would-be bombers who escaped after the 21 July attacks. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4706787.stm"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; reported that the man had been under surveillance as a result of CCTV footage from the 21 July crime scenes.

BBC in &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4703853.stm"&gt;London alerts: At-a-glance&lt;/a&gt; reports: Police say the man shot at Stockwell had been followed by surveillance officers because he had emerged from a house linked to the investigation into Thursday's blasts.

Passenger Anthony Larkin told BBC News the man appeared to be wearing a "bomb belt with wires coming out".

Around 10.15am UTC, armed police surrounded a Mosque in East London because of a bomb scare. A short time afterwards, this cordon was lifted.

A major Police Operation took place this afternoon in west &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The operation is centred around an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Cafe"&gt;Internet Cafe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; near Harrow Road. The &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reports that armed police and a police dog have been deployed.

Houst Monfaradi, a witness at the scene, said "There's what looks like a bomb disposal-type vehicle, armoured, and there's several armed officers around it," "From my window I can see 20 doors down what looks like a bomb disposal type vehicle, it's armoured and there are several armed officers around it...About half an hour ago police officers ran up my road telling everyone to get inside their houses...Anyone who even puts their head out, they scream 'get inside your house'...About 15 minutes ago I saw a little remote controlled vehicle...It went round to the left and then it disappeared from my view...It was followed by a couple of armed officers with shields."

A &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; man who allegedly clubbed to death an alligator he hooked while fishing, is under consideration by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; for destroying a “threatened species”. But according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service web page of delisted species on the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Endangered%20Species%20Act"&gt;Endangered Species Act&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3A%20American%20alligator"&gt;American alligator&lt;/a&gt; was removed from the list in 1987. The reason cited for its removal was the species had recovered.

Fisherman Max Belle reportedly used an oar to bring into submission the 44-inch-long, 9 pound creature when he brought it to the boat. Belle was fishing on the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Chesterfield%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Chesterfield County&lt;/a&gt; Falling Creek Reservoir, where the alligator was first sighted in May. 

An alligator is not a native species in the mid-Atlantic region of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, and it is thought that it was released by someone who once kept it as a pet.&lt;a href="w%3A%20United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; (USDA) employee attempts to capture and relocate it were unsuccessful. The native habitat of the alligator is in regions of the Southeast, starting from the Carolinas and moving southwards to Texas. 

The fisherman’s attorney, David P. Baugh, said area residents surrounding the reservoir are happy the alligator is gone. Referring to the support for Mr. Belle of reservoir neighbors, he said, "... next time they [USDA] will ask to hire Mr. Belle to come catch the alligator." His client received a court summons Thursday and is prepared to pay a $300 fine and $50 court costs if he is found guilty of the federal misdemeanor crime.

It took investigators two weeks to positively identify the toothy crocodile as an American alligator, (♡❤Alligator mississippiensis♡❤).

Administrators PriceWaterHouseCoopers (PWC) have announced that the British car company &lt;a href="w%3AMG%20Rover"&gt;MG Rover&lt;/a&gt; and its engine manufacturer Powertrain Ltd has been sold to &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href="w%3ANanjing%20Automobile"&gt;Nanjing Automobile&lt;/a&gt; for an unknown sum of money. The company beat bids from &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai%20Automotive"&gt;Shanghai Automotive&lt;/a&gt; (SAIC), despite being the smaller of the two.

MG Rover &lt;a href="Last%20British%20volume%20car%20manufacturer%20closes%20down"&gt;collapsed this Spring&lt;/a&gt;, after struggling to make a profit for several years.

SAIC had tried to buy only the engine plant and then transfer it to China, but in June Nanjing Automobile approached PWC with a combined bid for both the car manufacturing company and Powertrain. This Monday SAIC bid for both but the offer was inferior to Nanjing's.

Nanjing has indicated that it too will move the engine production plant to China, along with some car manufacturing. However it also intends to continue building cars in Britain, and establish an engineering research and design centre there in an effort to expand its sales globally. Nanjing intends to start hiring at once.

Beginning in 2006, all horses in the EU will be required to have passports, according to new rules from the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. Two thirds of all horses in Sweden are estimated to not have passports, Britta Lundström at the Swedish Ministry of Agriculture (Jordbruksverket) told news agency &lt;a href="w%3ATidningarnas%20Telegrambyr%C3%A5"&gt;TT&lt;/a&gt;.

If the owner of a horse doesn't get a passport for their animal before the end of the year, they will be breaking the law. The Ministry of Agriculture has had problems reaching horse owners who don't read horse magazines. Because of this, the ministry is planning a campaign this autumn.

The passport contains information on the owner, the race and number. A photograph isn't mandatory but a description of the horse's appearance is required.

A small single-engine &lt;a href="w%3Aultralight"&gt;ultralight&lt;/a&gt; aircraft has crashed on a lawn between the &lt;a href="w%3AReichstag%20%28building%29"&gt;Reichstag building&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of the German parliament, and the Bundeskanzleramt, the seat of the chancellor, in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. The aircraft crashed at approximately 2000CET. Amateur footage aired by the &lt;a href="w%3AARD%20%28TV%29"&gt;ARD&lt;/a&gt; shows the plane rapidly descending before crashing on the lawn and bursting into flames. Witnesses at the scene were inconclusive about the heading of the plane. Some stated that it was targeting the Reichstag while others said that the pilot tried to steer away from it. He was killed in the crash. People near the scene attempted to fight the fire with hand-held extinguishers, however the aircraft was mostly destroyed by the time the emergency services arrived.

The German authorities have ruled out terrorism. Police are saying that the pilot's wife has been missing since Monday and they had suspected that he might have something to do with the disappearance. It is possible that he might have committed suicide to avoid prosecution.

Just after 6pm BST police arrested a man at the &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%20Snow%20Hill%20Station"&gt;Snow Hill rail station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%2C%20England"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act. The station was evacuated and cordoned off because of two suspicious suitcases found at the station. The suitcases were examined and later found not to contain explosives. The BBC reports that the man who was arrested will not be facing charges.

Snow Hill station re-opened at around 8pm BST.

A bomb exploded on a busy, restaurant lined road, just 2 hours after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice left Beirut today, wounding at least twelve people.

Rice had made a surprise visit to pledge her support for Lebanon after the &lt;a href="Syria%20begins%20withdrawing%20troops%20from%20Lebanon"&gt;Syrian troop pull-out&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.

The blast went off at about 10 p.m. in front of a restaurant on Monot Street and damaged three cars, a security official told The Associated Press.

The bomb is believed to have been placed either under or inside a parked car on a sideroad close to the privately run Saint Joseph University on the edge of Christian east Beirut. LBC Television initially said that 6 people had been injured, mostly by flying glass and that the car belonged to local resident Joseph Nadim. The estimate on the number of injured has since risen to 12.

The attack was a "message" to the new government, announced this week and dominated by anti-Syrian ministers, said Tourism Minister Joseph Sarkis. He said the blast aimed to shake security and scare off the thousands of tourists, mainly from oil-rich Gulf countries, who spend summer vacations in Lebanon.

"It is a message against the government, against national reconciliation and national unity," Sarkis told the Dubai-based Al-Arabiya satellite channel.

<h1>Many dead in Egyptian resort blasts</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Many%20dead%20in%20Egyptian%20resort%20blasts&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A string of at least three explosions in &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian resort towns in the &lt;a href="w%3ASinai"&gt;Sinai&lt;/a&gt; early Saturday morning has left at least 88 people dead and over 200 more wounded.

One blast occurred at 1am in &lt;a href="w%3ASharm%20el-Sheikh"&gt;Sharm el-Sheikh&lt;/a&gt;, apparently in the market area, and two others about 15 minutes later in Naama Bay, a nearby resort. The explosions reportedly occurred outside hotels. A witness told the AP that the four-star hotel ♡❤Ghazala Gardens♡❤ has "completely burned down".

In October of last year, 34 people were killed in explosions in &lt;a href="w%3ATaba%20%28Egypt%29"&gt;Taba&lt;/a&gt; and Ras Shitan, nearby resort areas popular with &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i tourists. Due to this, officials blamed those attacks on violence related to the &lt;a href="Israeli-Palestinian%20conflict"&gt;Israeli-Palestinian conflict&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Casualty reports</h3>

So far the local police have confirmed that at least 88 people have been killed and between 120 and 200 were wounded. Reuters news agency quotes doctors at the scene saying many of the injured are in critical condition. Reuters also indicates that the explosions may have been caused by car-bombs.

Most of the casualties are Egyptians, there are &lt;a href="UK"&gt;Britons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spaniards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czechs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Qatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;is, and &lt;a href="Kuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;is.

<h3>Responsibility</h3>

A group calling itself ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20Yusuf%20Azzam"&gt;Abdullah Azzam&lt;/a&gt; Brigades♡❤ has claimed responsibility for the attacks. On a website the group stated that "holy warriors targeted the Ghazala Gardens hotel and the Old Market in Sharm el-Sheikh" and claimed it has ties to &lt;a href="Al-Qaida"&gt;Al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;. The authenticity of this statement has not been verified.

<h3>Reactions</h3>

In a televised statement Egyptian President &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Hosni Mubarak&lt;/a&gt; said that the terrorists will only make his country "more determined to pursue terrorism and dig it out by the roots". He added that "we will not give in to its blackmail, or seek a truce".
Egyptian Interior Minister Habib al-Adli called the attacks an "ugly act of terrorism".

U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; condemned the attacks saying that the "United States stands with our friend and ally Egypt. Together we will confront and defeat this scourge that knows no boundaries and respects no creed."

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, and the Palestinian Authority have also condemned the blasts.

The British Foreign Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;, also condemned the attacks. While being questioned about who was responsible for the bombings, Mr Straw said: "Almost certainly they are evil people who will claim &amp;mdash; wrongly &amp;mdash; to have done this in the name of &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;."

Danish minister of Foreign Affairs &lt;a href="w%3APer%20Stig%20M%C3%B8ller"&gt;Per Stig Møller&lt;/a&gt; says: "I condemn, in the strongest possible ways, the terror attacks in Sharm el-Sheikh, that yet again target defenseless and innocent people. This can in no way be justified. My deepest sympathies to the wounded, the families and the people of Egypt."

In a telegram to the Egyptian President this morning, Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, offered her condolences to the "brother nation of Egypt" on the death of, and injury to, a large number of Egyptian and foreign nationals during the bombings in Sharm al-Sheikh last night. She prayed for patience for the families of those killed and quick recovery for those injured. Mrs. Rajavi underscored, "Islamic fundamentalism and the terrorism emanating from it constitute the biggest threat to world peace and security. The heart of this ominous phenomenon is beating in Iran under the mullahs' regime, the leading sponsor of terrorism in the world today." She expressed hope that with the overthrow of the inhuman regime and the establishment of democracy in Iran, the world would see the eradication of the ideology of hate and violence, falsely propagated under the name of Islam, the great religion of compassion, friendship and tolerance. It is worthy of note that on Wednesday, the daily Kayhan, the mouthpiece of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, brazenly boasted, "Iran has an incalculable capacity to destabilize the entire Middle East. Given the circumstance, this destabilization could include a wide range of activities from limited local clashes to plunging the entire region into chaos and clashes."

Long John Baldry, English-born &lt;a href="w%3Ablues"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; legend, passed away at the Vancouver General Hospital, &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, Thursday evening after fighting a severe chest infection for the past four months. 

Baldry was considered an innovator and inspiration in blues music in the 1950s and 60s and is credited with inspiring other music legends such as &lt;a href="w%3AElton%20John"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARod%20Stewart"&gt;Rod Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Clapton"&gt;Eric Clapton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Rolling%20Stones"&gt;The Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt;.

Baldry was born in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Haddon"&gt;East Haddon&lt;/a&gt;, England, &lt;a href="1941-01-12"&gt;1941-01-12&lt;/a&gt; and grew to the imposing height of 6 feet 7 inches (2 metres) which gave him his nickname "Long John". He began playing folk and jazz music as a teenager in the 1950s but his deep voice resonated with the blues. Eric Clapton credits seeing Baldry play as an inspiration for him to play the blues himself. In the early 1960s Baldry sang with &lt;a href="w%3AAlexis%20Korner"&gt;Alexis Korner&lt;/a&gt;'s influential band, Blues Incorporated, and then went on to lead a series of bands himself and featured many new musicians who would go onto superstardom, including Rod Stewart, &lt;a href="w%3AMick%20Jagger"&gt;Mick Jagger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Watts"&gt;Charlie Watts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Bruce"&gt;Jack Bruce&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Page"&gt;Jimmy Page&lt;/a&gt;.

He befriended &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20McCartney"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt; while playing at the Cavern in Liverpool and performed on &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Beatles"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;' internationally televised special ♡❤Around the Beatles♡❤ in 1964. 

In 1966, Baldry adopted Bluesology for his back-up band, after seeing "promise" in the young keyboard player, Reginald Dwight. In 1968, Dwight adopted the name Elton John, taking the name John in tribute to Baldry.

In 1978, he moved to the United States, spending time in New York and Los Angeles, before moving on to Vancouver permanently about 1980 and becoming a Canadian citizen.

Baldry has released over 40 albums and, in the last twenty years, done much voice-over work in Canada for commercials and animations including &lt;a href="w%3AReBoot"&gt;ReBoot&lt;/a&gt; and narrating the Disney production, ♡❤The Original Story Of Winnie-The-Pooh♡❤, which earned him a 1998 Grammy ♡❤spoken word album for children♡❤ nomination.

Before his illness, it had been anticipated that Baldry would be touring in the autumn in support of new recordings produced by Rod Stewart and Elton John to be released this September.

International controversy erupted after ian officials executed two gay teenagers who were originally reported to be convicted of homosexuality, however later reports released by the Iranian government after international furor claimed the conviction was for the rape of a 13-year-old boy. The two were hanged July 19.

Only the age of one of the two executed teens was officially released to the public. He was 18 year old Ayaz Marhoni. The other, Mahmoud Asgari, according to the Iranian Student's News Agency (ISNA) was aged 17, but other news agencies have reported the teenager's age as 16. In the original report by the ISNA it was said that the two were found having sex together when they were both 16. It also reported that they were held and beaten for fourteen months before the execution. 

The UK-based gay rights group, &lt;a href="w%3AOutrage%21"&gt;Outrage!&lt;/a&gt; claims the report issued later by the government of Iran is a "smokescreen" to justify killing homosexuals. And one media outlet, Direland, has blasted the media holdings of Rupert Murdoch that includes Fox News Channel and The Times newspaper for publishing the subsequent Iranian government issued allegation of rape as matter of fact without mention of the previous stories before international condemnation bearing no such accusations.

According to Iranian newspapers, the two boys were given 228 lashes for their other convictions of theft, disrupting public order and public drinking before they were hanged in Edalat (♡❤"Justice" in English♡❤) Square in the Iranian city of &lt;a href="w%3AMashhad"&gt;Mashhad&lt;/a&gt;. The executioners, fearing reprisals, wore masks and anti-riot forces were mobilized to prevent outbreaks of public protests. 

Photos of the execution released by Iranian Students News Agency showed the two teens crying in the truck driving them to the gallows in Justice Square, located in the northeastern region of the country.

Iran has been under fire by international human rights groups for executing teenagers in the past, including the 2004 execution of Atefeh Rajabi, a 16-year-old girl convicted of having sex before marriage. Medical reports, not allowed in the court, had stated that she was mentally ill.

Like many other &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; countries, Iran enforces the religious &lt;a href="w%3Asharia"&gt;sharia&lt;/a&gt; law, which allows for the execution of children, including girls aged nine or older and boys 15 and older. 

Iranian officials have complained that the media has emphasized the teens' ages. Deputy Ali Asgari said, "Whatever sentence is decreed by an Islamic penal system must be approved, unless proven otherwise... Instead of paying tribute to the action of the judiciary, the media are mentioning the age of the hanged criminals and creating a commotion that harms the interests of the state... Even if certain websites made a reference to their age, journalists should not pursue this. These individuals were corrupt. Their sentence was carried out with the approval of the judiciary and it served them right."

Both teens were convicted by Court No. 19 under sharia law. The teens are identified only as "M.A." and "A.M." Those found having homosexual sex in Iran may face death by either hanging, stoning, cutting in half by a sword, or dropping from a tall building or cliff.

An ISNA report said the couple acknowledged having sexual relations with each other but said they were unaware of laws against homosexuality.

<h3>Controversy over subsequent rape allegations</h3>

Another report, by ♡❤Iran In Focus,♡❤ claimed that the two were hanged not for gay sex, but rather for sexually assaulting a thirteen year old boy at knife point. Neither the original ♡❤Iranian Student's News Agency♡❤ nor an additional report from the ♡❤National Council of Resistance of Iran♡❤ had this allegation, said the United Kingdom based ♡❤Outrage♡❤. ♡❤Direland Press♡❤ has noted that the accusation of rape in reports came days after international outrage and detailed reports by other Iranian news agencies. They suggest the recent report is a ploy of the Iranian government to justify its actions.

"The allegation of sexual assault may either be a trumped-up charge to undermine public sympathy for the youths -- a frequent tactic by the Islamist regime in Iran -- or it may be that the 13-year-old was a willing participant but that Iranian law ... deems that no person of that age is capable of sexual consent and that therefore any sexual contact is automatically deemed in law to be a sex assault," said OutRage!'s Peter Tatchell.

"This is just the latest barbarity by the Islamo-fascists in Iran," Tatchell remarked. "The entire country is a gigantic prison, with Islamic rule sustained by detention without trial, torture and state-sanctioned murder."

<h3>Poor track record with human rights groups</h3>

Tatchell told reporters that according to Iranian human rights activists, more than 4,000 lesbians and gay men have been executed in Iran since the ayatollahs seized power in 1979. He said an estimated 100,000 Iranians have been executed in Iran since that time.

Reports also indicated that three other gay Iranian teenagers are reportedly being hunted by police, but they are said to have gone into hiding.

OutRage! requested the international community see Iran "as a pariah state" and to "break off diplomatic relations, impose trade sanctions, and give practical support to the democratic and left opposition inside Iran."

The United Kingdom has a policy of constructive engagement with Iran, as does France and Germany, primarily directed at the resolution of the Iranian nuclear crisis.

European Union officials have been holding a human rights dialogue with Tehran, but last year the report by Human Rights Watch said that violations had increased since 2000.

In the Unites States, the &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Campaign"&gt;Human Rights Campaign&lt;/a&gt; has called for U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to condemn the executions.

Democrats on Saturday turned over their radio broadcast to a former CIA agent and Republican, Larry Johnson, who accused President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; of flip-flopping on his pledge to fire anybody on his staff involved with the &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; leak.

Johnson, a participant in yesterday's Democratic hearing on &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Capitol"&gt;Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt;, said "We deserve people who work in the White House who are committed to protecting classified information, telling the truth to the American people, and living by example to the idea that a country at war with Islamic extremists cannot focus its efforts on attacking other American citizens who simply tried to tell the truth."

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; Democrats held a highly partisan hearing Friday where four retired &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; intelligence officials aired views that were critical of the Plame leak itself, and then critical of Bush administration and Republican efforts to minimize damage caused by the controversy.
Former &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; case officer, Jim Marcinkowski, testified that the current administration policy of setting a criminal standard for dismissal was too high, and that Bush should take action on those persons involved. "Each time the political machine made up of prime-time patriots and partisan ninnies display their ignorance by deriding Valerie Plame as a mere paper-pusher, or belittling the varying degrees of cover used to protect our officers, or continuing to play partisan politics with our national security, it's a disservice to this country," he said.

The hearing was not an official proceeding of &lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;. Democratic lawmakers organized it after Republican leaders in congressional committees with jurisdiction in these matters rejected their request for a legislative oversight hearing. Representative &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Waxman"&gt;Henry Waxman&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;CA&lt;/a&gt;), the ranking minority member of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20U.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20Government%20Reform"&gt;House Committee on Government Reform&lt;/a&gt;, said "A special standard seems to apply to Karl Rove: There will be no questions asked, and no accountability."

Meanwhile, a Vermont native Dennis Morrisseau, 62, plans a Republican run for a soon to be vacated seat in the House of Representatives. &lt;a href="w%3ABernie%20Sanders"&gt;Bernard Sanders&lt;/a&gt; (I-&lt;a href="w%3AVermont"&gt;Vt&lt;/a&gt;) will leave the post in his run for a Senate seat. Central to Morrisseau's bid is his pledge to bring articles of impeachment against George W. Bush.

The police statement said &lt;blockquote&gt; "We are now satisfied that he was not connected with the incidents of Thursday 21st July 2005. For somebody to lose their life in such circumstances is a tragedy and one that the Metropolitan Police Service regrets."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The man was followed when he left a flat that had been under surveillence. He did not obey instructions from police (not in uniform) as he ran onto a Tube train at the station. &lt;a href="Armed%20police%20shoot%20man%20dead%20on%20London%20Underground%23Eyewitness%20accounts"&gt;Eyewitnesses&lt;/a&gt; said he "was wearing a large coat, unusual for the time of year", but didn't seem to have "any guns or anything like that; I didn't see him carrying anything. I didn't even see a bag to be quite honest."

Mark Whitby, apparently the closest eye witness said; "He half-tripped, was half-pushed to the floor. The policeman nearest to me had the black automatic pistol in his left hand, he held it down to the guy and unloaded five shots into him."

The shooting is being investigated by the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan Police Service&lt;/a&gt;'s Directorate of Professional Standards and the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which investigates all fatal police shootings.

Home Secretary Charles Clarke described the shooting of Mr Menezes as an "absolute tragedy" before going on to say "I hope [the family] understand the police were trying to do their very best under very difficult circumstances."

Alex Pereira, a cousin of Mr Menezes, also living in the UK, was interviewed by the BBC and said "Apologies are not enough. I believe my cousin's death was result of police incompetence." He also stated that he believed his cousin had been "a victim of government's mistakes".

<h2>Brazilian government reaction</h2>

The Brazilian Government "look forward to receiving the necessary explanation from the British authorities on the circumstances which led to this tragedy" and have dispatched their foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3ACelso%20Amorim"&gt;Celso Amorim&lt;/a&gt; to London in order to get an explanation from the British Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr Amorim said "The Brazilian government and the public are shocked and perplexed that a peaceful and innocent person should have been killed." Going on to say "Brazil is totally in solidarity with Britain in the fight against terror but people should be cautious to avoid the loss of innocent life."

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft Corporation&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the official name of the next version of its Windows operating system will be "&lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Vista"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt;". The system was formerly referred to by the codename “&lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Longhorn"&gt;Longhorn&lt;/a&gt;.”
Brad Goldberg, the general manager of Windows product development, said the new name is aimed at "communicating the idea of clarity." Microsoft has said that this new version will include better graphics and security.

Windows Vista is scheduled to launch in the second half of 2006; this will make five years after the launch of Windows XP, the longest interim yet between releases of Windows. 
Additional details on Windows Vista will be released at a developer's conference in September. Beta testing of the software targeted at developers and IT professionals will begin on August 3.

NASA has announced that the Space Shuttle ♡❤Discovery♡❤ is due to blast off on Tuesday 26 July at 10.39 am EDT.

The news that the 43 hour countdown will be restarted on Saturday comes after the successful resolution of the problems that forced the &lt;a href="Shuttle%20launch%20called%20off%20due%20to%20faulty%20fuel%20tank%20sensor"&gt;aborting of the previous launch attempt&lt;/a&gt;.

The countdown includes 28 hours of scheduled "hold time" bringing the total time period up to Tuesday.

The launch had been scrubbed previously due to a faulty main fuel tank sensor which was sufferring from electromagnetic interference. Engineers fixed the problem by improving the electrical grounding of the system to reduce interference.

NASA's Centennial Challenges program has announced its latest prize contest, the Astronaut Glove Challenge. The competition, a collaboration between NASA and the non-profit Volanz Aerospace, will be held in late 2006 and will award $250K to the team which produces the best-performing glove within contest parameters. 

The basic idea was originally proposed last year on Rand Simberg's Transterrestrial Musings to improve on current gloves, which have difficulties with remaining flexible while maintaining constant internal pressure. 

Previously-announced competitions include prizes for superstrong tethers, beaming power, and extracting oxygen from lunar regolith. These are all part of a large recently-announced program, which will potentially include 'an eight-figure prize for the first privately developed robotic moon lander.'

After the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (NYSE) completes its acquisition of Chicago-based electronic trading company, &lt;a href="w%3AArchipelago%20Holdings"&gt;Archipelago Holdings&lt;/a&gt; within the next 12 months, the impact will also be felt in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt; as the future of the 123-year-old &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Exchange"&gt;Pacific Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (PCX) becomes murky.

This stems from a deal struck in January of this year, before the NYSE merger, when Archipelago struck a deal worth $83 million to take over operations of the San Francisco stock exchange and its 260 employees. All PCX operations are scheduled to be under Archipelago control by the end of September. Archipelago had planned to maintain the San Francisco operations.

As details were released Thursday of the April NYSE-Archipelago merger to the &lt;a href="w%3ASecurities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, all Archipelago functions are to be folded into NYSE operations, including the PCX stock and options trading business. The report did not state whether or not the San Francisco employees would be kept after the merger is complete.

Started in 1882 at the San Francisco Stock Market, the Pacific Exchange, along with other regional stock exchanges, has suffered as customers shifted to electronic trading, which bypassed the need for stock exchange services in many instances.

A new explosive detonated on Sunday near the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Egyptian%20pyramids"&gt;Pyramids&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Giza"&gt;Giza&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; police said. It was reportedly carried by a man from a tourist bazaar. The man allegedly was carrying the bomb in a sack. It might accidentally have exploded in the area of Kufr Tuhurmus. No other injuries were reported except to the bomber himself, Sami Gamal Ahmad, who was too badly injured to be questioned. The man may have been taking the explosive to the tourist area of Kerdassa, where souvenir shops are located in a bazaar near the pyramids, said an official.

Egyptian security forces have detained 70 suspects in a sweep to find the perpetrators in Saturday's early morning bombings that killed 88 and left hundreds injured.

The police investigation of the bombings has targeted a smaller number of people than the October 2004 roundup that followed attacks in the Sinai resorts of &lt;a href="w%3ATabas"&gt;Tabas&lt;/a&gt; and Ras Shitan. 3,000 people were detained for questioning in those bombings. According to &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACTV"&gt;CTV&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, 200 of those people are believed to still be in custody.

A massive manhunt was undertaken in the &lt;a href="w%3ASinai%20Peninsula"&gt;Sinai Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; to identity whether it was foreigners who executed the attack. One security official speaking on the condition of anonymity told an ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A%20Al%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter that the bombers "did not appear to be locals." But the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that &lt;a href="w%3ABedouin"&gt;Bedouin&lt;/a&gt; leaders were arriving at the local police headquarters, possibly over concerns that many of the suspects picked up in the prior bombing in the region were, by human rights group accounts, Bedouin.

Among the dead, officials said victims included &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n, &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;is, &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Qatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;is, &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, and native Egyptians. Sixty were identified as Egyptians, and at least eight were foreigners.

&lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3A%20Abdullah%20Ahmad%20Badawi"&gt;Abdullah Ahmad Badawi&lt;/a&gt; said, "The whole world is getting very disturbed. The frequency [of attacks] seems to be mounting." Badawi chairs the 57-nation &lt;a href="w%3A%20Organization%20of%20the%20Islamic%20Conference"&gt;Organization of the Islamic Conference&lt;/a&gt;.
Resort hotels are being abandoned by tourists. At the nearest international airport, hundreds are reported trying to get flights out.

Three bombs erupted in the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Sea"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt; resort of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Sharm%20el-Sheikh"&gt;Sharm el-Sheikh&lt;/a&gt; just after 1am. At the Ghazala Gardens hotel, work is underway to clear the destroyed reception lobby where emergency teams have gavin up the search for survivors. A car with 660 pounds of explosives drove into the hotel's driveway and detonated in an apparent suicide attack. 

The day of the bombings is marked as an Egyptian national holiday that commemorates the bloodless coup by a group of army officers that brought them to power after deposing &lt;a href="w%3AFarouk%20of%20Egypt"&gt;King Farouk&lt;/a&gt; in 1952. Egypt has been the victim of 15 tourist attacks since October 1992.

Around four hundred people demonstrated in &lt;a href="w%3ABaku"&gt;Baku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAzerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday, demanding that parliamentary elections to be held on November 6 be free and fair. The National Democratic Party led the rally, and other opposition parties and groups including Citizen Solidarity, Liberal Democratic Party, Free Azerbaijan, Salvation and Progress participated. The rally was sanctioned by the Baku government.

Demonstrators requested from &lt;a href="w%3AIlham%20Aliyev"&gt;Ilham Aliyev&lt;/a&gt;, President of Azerbaijan, the protection of gatherings, citizens' will and an equal chance for all candidates in the elections. They also demanded removing obstacles in development of Azerbaijani's independent media, and the return of political emigrants.

In response to another major &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANicobar%20Islands"&gt;Nicobar Islands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , about 690 miles southwest of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;), government agencies briefly issued official &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; warnings. However, it was later determined that the earthquake, although strong, was of a type which does not commonly spawn large tsunamis.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Earthquake%20Information%20Center"&gt;National Earthquake Information Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reported that the earthquake occurred at 15:42:05 (UTC) on Sunday, July 24, 2005, and registered as a magnitude 7.2 earthquake. Its location is &lt;a href="http%3A//maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3D7.926%25C2%25B0N%2C%2B92.146%25C2%25B0E%26amp%3Bll%3D13.496473%2C92.109375%26amp%3Bspn%3D25.039205%2C42.916992%26amp%3Bt%3Dh%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;7.926°N, 92.146°E&lt;/a&gt;

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Meteorological%20Agency"&gt;Japan Meteorological Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reported at 16:11 UTC that an earthquake had occurred at 15:42 UTC near the Indo-Chinese Peninsula (8.7°N, 92.1°E). The scale of this earthquake was estimated by JMA to be 7.3 on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20scale"&gt;Richter scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and its seismic center near the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean.

"There is a possibility of a destructive local tsunami in the Indian Ocean," said the JPA, when it issued its warning. But that possibility did not come to fruition.

This was made clear in a report from the U.S. National Earthquake Information Center, which said in a bulletin that "No tsunami threat exists to coastlines in the Pacific, however earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within a few hundred kilometers of the earthquake epicenter. As the center does not have sea level gauges outside the Pacific, they will not be able to detect or measure a tsunami if one occurs. It can be assumed the danger has passed if no tsunami waves are observed near the epicenter within an hour of the earthquake."

The US Geological Survey's Waverly Person told the BBC that the event was "unlikely to spark a tsunami".

The Thai TV station MCOT was reporting at around 1:00 (local time, UTC+7) that everything was under control and there has been no confusion; in Phuket and Trang provinces, the sea level was reported to be at normal levels at that time. At 1:25 (local time), the Thai National Disaster Warning Center cleared the tsunami warning nationwide.

The top federal administrator of the Nicobar Islands, Ram Kapse, told Reuters news agency that there had been no reports of casualties or damage from any of the inhabited islands.

United States sportsman &lt;a href="w%3ALance%20Armstrong"&gt;Lance Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; today won the international cycling competition &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;. This is the seventh consecutive win for Armstrong. It is also his last, as Armstrong announced prior to the race that he will be retiring from professional cycling after the competition.

The last leg was an 89.8-mile strecth from &lt;a href="w%3ACorbeil-Essonnes"&gt;Corbeil-Essonnes&lt;/a&gt; to Paris' famed &lt;a href="w%3AChamps-Elysees"&gt;Champs-Elysees&lt;/a&gt;. But poor weather conditions affected the finale.

The official race time clock was stopped when the riders reached the Champs Elysee due to rain making the famous cobble stones slippery. However, the rain stopped and the stones dried during the eight final laps of the famous road, and time-bonuses were awarded for the stage win. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAlexandre%20Vinokourov"&gt;Alexandre Vinokourov&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, riding for T-Mobile, won the stage after his break-away from the field 1,500m out could not be reeled in by the peloton, relegating the sprinters to lower placings. The 20s time bonus moved Vinokurov to fifth overall in the race.

As Armstrong was presented the final Yellow Jersey, he was quoted in the press as saying in a mixture of French and English, "♡❤Vive le Tour♡❤, forever." The winning Yellow Jersey is awarded to the cyclist who had the best overall performance throughout the tour's circuit.

After the awards ceremony, Armstrong discussed what comes next in his life, mentioning that defeating cancer by raising awareness and funds is his new goal.

"We know how to train and prepare for the Tour," he says. "If we win, it is a success. Cancer is not and will not be that way. It is a different kind of fight. It's not something that lasts three weeks.

"Along the way there will be victories and defeats. There are going to be survivors and people who aren't going to make it. My goal and my responsibility is to make sure that we don't forget ... how devastating cancer has been. I can help change that."

"I sit here as a person who considers myself totally cured," he says. "But one of those people who was along the side of the road over the last three weeks might have breast cancer and might die in three months.

"How can they not be cured? The illness is complicated; there are hundreds of different illnesses and cell types, little bastards inside who don't agree with what we throw at them, who don't want to die."

Armstrong has been a member of the President's Cancer Panel since 2002. He feels that his role is to get the funds to keep that research alive, saying that "we have the smartest people in the world" already working on cures.

"Funding is tough to come by these days," he says. "The biggest downside to a war in Iraq is what you could do with that money. What does a war in Iraq cost a week? A billion? Maybe a billion a day? The budget for the National Cancer Institute is four billion. That has to change. It needs to become a priority again.

"Polls say people are much more afraid of cancer than of a plane flying into their house or a bomb or any other form of terrorism. It is a priority for the American public."
