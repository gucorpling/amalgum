<h1>Court photos show FLDS leader Warren Jeffs with child brides</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Court%20photos%20show%20FLDS%20leader%20Warren%20Jeffs%20with%20child%20brides&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The photos were entered into evidence as part of the case in &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Green%20County"&gt;Tom Green County&lt;/a&gt; District Court. Officials claim there is a "pervasive pattern" of underage girls forced into marriage with older men. The photos show Warren Jeffs kissing and hugging young girls, and attorneys for Texas &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20Protective%20Services"&gt;Child Protective Services&lt;/a&gt; claim that one of the girls shown in the photos is a 12-year old "bride". The photos are dated from July 2006 and January 2005.
The State of Texas is seeking custody of a baby boy born to Louisa Bradshaw and her "husband" Dan Jessop. According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADeseret%20News"&gt;Deseret News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Jessop was asked if he thought the photos of Jeffs and the girls was evidence of &lt;a href="w%3ASexual%20abuse"&gt;sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt;, to which he responded, "I do not consider a girl kissing a man sex abuse." Child Protective Services lawyers told the court that the photos show Jeffs kissing the girls similar to "how a husband kisses a wife". 
♡❤Deseret News♡❤ reported that Protective Services lawyers did not say how the images of Jeffs were obtained, but said that the photos illustrate a culture of &lt;a href="w%3AAbuse"&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt; at the compound. According to &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, information revealed in court shows that one of the girls in the photos is an aunt to the children involved in the Texas custody hearing and lived on the YFZ Ranch. CNN reports that the girl's birth date was given as July 1994 and she is 13 years old. She was taken into state custody by Texas officials along with other children in April.

&lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; reported that an alleged child bride shown in the photographs was set to give testimony in court, but state attorneys and FLDS representatives came to a resolution and agreed that Protective Services would retain custody of Louisa Bradshaw's baby. The baby was born in Texas state custody. Bradshaw was initially taken into custody as well because authorities thought she was under age, but it has since been revealed that she is over the age of 18. According to ♡❤ABC News♡❤ Bradshaw will remain with her baby in a shelter. Protective Services said that Bradshaw and Jessop lived in the same building as the 12-year old girl shown in the photographs with Jeffs. 

Jeffs is seen in one set of photos from January 26, 2005 labeled "First anniversary" with a girl called "Loretta". In another set dated July 27, 2005, Jeffs is shown with a girl referred to as "Merrianne". Child Protective Services officials said that they have evidence that "Merrianne" was 12 years old when she was married to Jeffs at the YFZ compound. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Vancouver%20Sun"&gt;The Vancouver Sun&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that, per a family member, "Loretta" was no older than 12 when she was married. Portions from the set of photos were displayed at media sites including ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARadar%20Online"&gt;Radar Online&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, CNN, &lt;a href="w%3AFOX%20News"&gt;FOX News&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Nine%20News"&gt;National Nine News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ABC News, and the website &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Smoking%20Gun"&gt;The Smoking Gun&lt;/a&gt; made three of the court exhibits available for viewing.
In a statement made Tuesday to CNN, &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/a&gt; attorney and spokesman for FLDS families Rod Parker said the photos were an effort by Child Protective Services to "get publicity" and "paint everybody with the same brush". "What I'm saying is, that isn't fair, and each parent of each family is entitled to stand on its own. And these photos have no ties to this particular family in a way that's relevant to these proceedings," said Parker.
"I'm sure law enforcement in several states will take a look to see what more can be done," said &lt;a href="w%3AUtah%20Attorney%20General"&gt;Utah Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;'s Office Paul Murphy in a statement to ABC News. Murphy said that investigators may look further into the photographs to determine if evidence shows the girls were abused, and if so where, before charges could be brought. "Everyone who saw those photos did a complete gasp. I think they're shocking," he said.

In a ruling made last week in a case involving 38 FLDS mothers and 124 children, the Texas 3rd District Court of Appeals said that the state did not have the right to remove those children from the compound. The &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Courts%20of%20Appeals"&gt;appeals court&lt;/a&gt; said that Child Protective Services was unable to prove that the children in the compound were at risk of immediate physical harm. Texas law states that "a danger to the physical health or safety of the child which was caused by an act or failure to act of the person entitled to possession and for the child to remain in the home is contrary to the welfare of the child" must be shown in order to remove that child from the home. 

&lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Department%20of%20Family%20and%20Protective%20Services"&gt;Texas Department of Family and Protective Services&lt;/a&gt; filed court papers Wednesday asserting that FLDS families may flee the state if they are reunited with their children after the Texas appeals court ruling. Protective Services officials are worried that if the families leave the court's jurisdiction, children could be at risk of abuse. In response, attorneys for mothers of the children in custody filed a counter-motion. The mothers claim that the children are under "continuing, irreparable harm every day that they are separated from their parents".

Warren Jeffs was convicted in September 2007 of two counts of being an accomplice to rape related to a 2001 wedding he arranged between a 14-year old girl and her 19-year old cousin. He was sentenced to two consecutive five-year prison sentences in &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, and faces an impending trial in &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; on eight charges including sexual conduct with a minor, &lt;a href="w%3Aincest"&gt;incest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aconspiracy"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;.

The FLDS group has approximately 10,000 members total, and was founded in the 1930s. It split from the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; (LDS Church) after the LDS Church abandoned the practice of &lt;a href="w%3Apolygamy"&gt;polygamy&lt;/a&gt; in 1890.

The first ever live advert to be shown on British television was Broadcast today on &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt; at 19:10 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;. The advert, created by car manufacturer &lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;, showed people jumping from the sky and forming the individual letters of the word ♡❤HONDA♡❤ as a group while falling. The image on the left shows the letter 'O' being formed in this way.

The sales director at Channel Four commented on the advert: "This concept breaks the boundaries of the 'perceived' confines of TV advertising, which is something Channel 4 is striving to do."

Before being shown, the advert was promoted on Channel 4. Directly before it, an announcer explained the event, saying why Channel 4 believed it to be a groundbreaking innovation.

Honda aimed to link the new advert with its new slogan, "If it's difficult it's worth doing."

The advert was broadcast from &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, where it was 21:10 at the time of filming.

On Thursday, May 22, &lt;a href="w%3AX%20%28U.S.%20band%29"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; played at the &lt;a href="w%3ATheater%20of%20the%20Living%20Arts"&gt;Theater of the Living Arts&lt;/a&gt; (TLA) in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ was there for the concert.

The band stopped in Philadelphia as part of their "13 x 31 Anniversary Tour," marking the bands 31st anniversary. The performance was the first since the bands last visit on their "As the World Burns Tour" in 2006, and featured the original line-up of &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Doe%20%28musician%29"&gt;John Doe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AExene%20Cervenka"&gt;Exene Cervenka&lt;/a&gt;, Billy Zoom, and &lt;a href="w%3AD.%20J.%20Bonebrake"&gt;D.J. Bonebrake&lt;/a&gt;.

Having not released an album of new work since 1993's &lt;a href="w%3Ahey%20Zeus%21"&gt;hey Zeus!&lt;/a&gt;, the tour is an opportunity for one of &lt;a href="w%3APunk%20rock%23North%20America"&gt;punk rock&lt;/a&gt;'s seminal bands to connect with their fans. The band played a strong set of material from their first four albums, all recorded during the years of 1980 - 1983.

No material from their last two studio albums was played, with some citing the strong preferences of guitarist &lt;a href="w%3ABilly%20Zoom"&gt;Billy Zoom&lt;/a&gt; for the earlier work. X came on stage around 10:30 pm and played until close to midnight. Their full-throttle set started with "&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20%28X%20album%29"&gt;Your Phone's Off the Hook, But You’re Not&lt;/a&gt;," and didn’t slow down after that, although slowing down might be hard seeing as the set was classic punk – high energy songs full of angst and anger. This was moderated though by Doe’s on-going comments to the audience and Zoom's mugging. Exene, dressed in an oversize black dress seemed subdued and her vocals seemed quieter than usual – though her off-key harmonizing with Does’ vocals was true to the song's original recordings. During the second encore they were joined by Rachel Nagy who provided additional vocals. That encore was delayed by Zoom, who was in the audience seemingly determined to meet every woman in the audience.

While X has not produced an album of new material in 21 years, the band did visit recently as their alter-ego, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Knitters"&gt;The Knitters&lt;/a&gt;. Each of the members of the band has kept busy. Doe has released several solo albums and tours regularly and acts on television; Cervenka fronts the band, the Original Sinners, as well as spoken word performances; Zoom works as an album producer for other bands, and designs his own line of amps and guitars; while Bonebrake works with the Bonebrake Syncopators and Orchestra Superstring.

The opening act for X was the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Cobras"&gt;Detroit Cobras&lt;/a&gt;. The Cobras, fronted by singer Nagy and guitarist Mary Ramirez, provided an energetic opening for the headliners. The word for the night was fun as the members of X spent a good deal of time watching the opening act from the sides of the stage, with Zoom flirting with guitarist Ramirez and coming out on stage to wrestle with her. The Cobras returned the favor by dancing on stage during the last third of X's set.

On this tour, X has donated sets of tickets to the non-profit Sweet Relief Musicians Fund to provide assistance to all types of career musicians who are struggling to make ends meet while facing illness, disability, or age-related problems.

In May 2008, the candidates of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;United States presidential election&lt;/a&gt; campaigned and faced questions on as wide ranging issues as &lt;a href="w%3Aassassination"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHitler"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; and the death of one's political career. The month more clearly showed who the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate would be, and potentially narrowed the field for the Vice-Presidential race in the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;. A third-party candidate also emerged who could potentially change the outcome of the election. 
<dl>
BULLET::::- Democrats
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; won the Kentucky and West Virginia Primaries by a wide margin and narrowly won in Indiana despite calls from prominent Democrats for her to drop out of the race after heavy losses in the North Carolina and Oregon primaries.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;'s victories in North Carolina and Oregon propelled him to large leads in the delegate count, and he picked up new &lt;a href="w%3Asuperdelegates"&gt;superdelegates&lt;/a&gt; at a higher rate than Hillary Clinton, including the endorsement of former candidate &lt;a href="John%20Edwards"&gt;John Edwards&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the press including &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Stephanopoulos"&gt;George Stephanopoulos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Russert"&gt;Tim Russert&lt;/a&gt; declared Obama as the Democratic candidate with Russert asserting "We now know who the Democratic nominee's going to be, and no one's going to dispute it."
BULLET::::- Hillary Clinton continued her push to count the delegates from Florida and Michigan where she won, but whose votes were not being counted because of the state's breach of DNC rules by holding the primaries too early. Barack Obama was not on the ballots when these states held their primaries.
BULLET::::- A series of &lt;a href="wiktionary%3Agaffe"&gt;gaffes&lt;/a&gt; by the candidates included Barack Obama stating that he had visited 57 states, and Hillary Clinton declaring that anything could happen in the election in June stating "We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California". The former, persuaded columnist &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Malkin"&gt;Michelle Malkin&lt;/a&gt; to publish an article "Gaffe machine" that chronicled campaign gaffes made by Obama as a candidate. The latter, was perceived by some as alluding to the possibility that Obama could be assassinated as &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kennedy"&gt;Robert Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; in 1968.

<dl>
BULLET::::- Republicans

</dl>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Presumptive nominee &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; attacked Barack Obama over his comments that compared the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; to the threat of &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, describing the latter as a "tiny" threat. McCain stated that Obama had exhibited "inexperience and reckless judgment" in his assessment. Obama responded by stating "that the Soviet Union had the ability to destroy the world several times over, had satellites spanning the globe, had huge masses of conventional military power, all directed at destroying us." The back and forth followed a debate between &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; and Obama over Bush's assessment that Obama's position to talk to Iran was representative of appeasement.
BULLET::::- Media reports surfaced of McCain supporter and preacher &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hagee"&gt;John Hagee&lt;/a&gt;'s comments from 2007 that "the force and fear of Hitler's Nazis drove the Jewish people back to the only home God ever intended for the Jews to have: &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;." McCain immediately rejected the endorsement of Hagee after hearing reports of the comments.
BULLET::::- John McCain's search for a running mate continued as the senator invited three candidates to his ranch in Arizona. McCain invited former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;, Florida governor &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Crist"&gt;Charlie Crist&lt;/a&gt;, and the youngest governor in the nation, Indian-American &lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Jindal"&gt;Bobby Jindal&lt;/a&gt; of Louisiana. The invitations led to speculation that the McCain campaign had narrowed the vice-presidential nomination search to the three.
BULLET::::- Third Parties
BULLET::::- At the &lt;a href="w%3ALibertarian%20Party"&gt;Libertarian Party&lt;/a&gt; convention, former GOP Congressman &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Barr"&gt;Bob Barr&lt;/a&gt; was nominated as the party's presidential nominee on its sixth ballot. &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Allyn%20Root"&gt;Wayne Allyn Root&lt;/a&gt; was named his running mate. Barr had entered the race two weeks prior to the nomination and was considered to be a possible spoiler for the Republicans in November because of Barr's conservative positions.
BULLET::::- Also at the Libertarian Party convention, former Democratic Senator &lt;a href="Mike%20Gravel"&gt;Mike Gravel&lt;/a&gt; ended his political career after losing on the fourth ballot. He stated, "From 15 years old to now, my political career is over, and it's no big deal. I'm a writer, I'm a lecturer, I'm going to push the issues of freedom and liberty. I'm going to push those issues until the day I die."

&lt;a href="w%3AF.C.%20Internazionale%20Milano"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that they have fired Head Coach Roberto Mancini after Club Owner &lt;a href="w%3AMassimo%20Moratti"&gt;Massimo Moratti&lt;/a&gt; held a meeting with Mancini. Inter Milan reached the UEFA Champions League last 16, the Italian Cup final and won &lt;a href="w%3ASerie%20A"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; (Italian Championship). Mancini had won 3 consecutive Serie A titles with Inter while they nearly lost this season's title on the final day having let slip an 11-point lead in February.

A club statement on their website said, "FC Internazionale have informed Roberto Mancini that he has been sacked as coach, in particular because of the comments made by the coach at the end of the Inter-Liverpool match."

Romour speculations have indicated that former Chelsea F.C. Manager &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Mourinho"&gt;José Mourinho&lt;/a&gt; is the prime candidate to take over Inter Milan. &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sun"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;, who is located in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, has claimed that Mourinho "has handed a transfer dossier to Moratti identifying England midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Lampard"&gt;Frank Lampard&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; defender &lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Carvalho"&gt;Ricardo Carvalho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Ivory%20Coast"&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/a&gt; striker &lt;a href="w%3ADidier%20Drogba"&gt;Didier Drogba&lt;/a&gt;."

<h1>Ban on cluster bombs adopted by 111 countries</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ban%20on%20cluster%20bombs%20adopted%20by%20111%20countries&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today, representatives of 111 countries have adopted a formal ban on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acluster%20bombs"&gt;cluster bombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The ban is to be signed and ratified by each country during December 2-3 in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, the country that initiated the discussions on the ban.

Following almost two weeks of negotiations, the ban was agreed upon at a ceremony held in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. Signatories will be required to completely get rid of cluster bomb stockpiles within eight years.

Cluster bombs are characterized by the small "bomblets" that they release while falling. Many are opposed to this type of munition because the "bomblets" spread over a large area, meaning that they can easily injure or kill innocent civilians even when aimed at a specific enemy target.

Despite &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.N.%20Secretary-General"&gt;Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; voicing his hopes that all nations would agree to the ban, many countries have boycotted the ban, including the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. Military analyst Marc Garlasco of the organization &lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; noted that these nations will be less likely to use the munitions due to the stigma that will be attached to them.

While widely celebrated, some criticize the pact for not being strong enough in its implications. For example, signatories will still be allowed to cooperate on military operations with non-signatories.

The ban will go into effect in mid-2009.

<h2>Monarchy abolished in Nepal</h2>
The Nepalese Constituent Assembly, elected on April 10, in Nepal recently voted to abolish its monarchy, with a large majority supporting the vote in parliament. "The Nepalese people have been freed from centuries of feudal tradition and the doors have now opened for a radical social and economic transformation," said a government spokesperson, commenting on the decision.

The former king, Gyanendra of Nepal, has been given two weeks to leave his palace. Authorities say that he will be forced out if he fails to leave during that period of time.

The Nepalese president, also commented on the move: "Today is the day when my dreams have been realized and similarly the dreams of the nation have perhaps also been realized."

Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said that by supporting the switch to a republic, the Nepalese people have "clearly spoken for peace and change."

<h2>UK study highlights child abuse by humanitarian workers</h2>
A study by the non-profit organisation Save the Children UK claims that a number of aid workers and peacekeepers from organisations such as the United Nations and Save the Children itself have engaged in sexual abuse of children in the course of their humanitarian efforts. The study also says that many of these incidents remain unreported, and those involved often go unpunished.

The study was based on field data from Sudan, Ivory Coast and Haiti, where they held focus groups followed by in-depth interviews. In 20 of the 38 focus groups, United Nations representatives were the main perpetrators of sexual abuse, possibly due to the larger number of peacekeepers than aid workers, but 23 organisations were identified as being involved across the three countries.

While 14 and 15 year olds were the most common victims, the study found cases of abuse in children as young as 6. Most offenders were men, and most of the victims were girls. One 14-year-old boy who works in a peacekeeping camp on the Ivory Coast told the study that "[o]ften it will be between eight and 10 men who will share two or three girls".

An "overwhelming" majority of those interviewed said they would never report a case of abuse, and did not know of anyone who had reported a case, despite more than half knowing of incidents of sexual abuse, and many knowing of 10 or more. The study reported that unless this silence was dealt with, any attempts to eliminate the abuse would be "fundamentally flawed".

<h2>Two MBTA Green Line trains collide in Newton, Massachusetts</h2>
Two Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Green Line trains have collided in Newton. Both trains consisted of two cars, one of which rear-ended the other causing major damage on both trains, multiple injuries and trapped the operator of one of the two trains, 24 year-old Terrese Edmonds, who subsequently died. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board is underway.

The crash happened yesterday around 6 p.m. EDT between the Waban and Woodland Green Line stations on the Green Line's D Branch. One train was stopped at a red signal waiting to enter to Woodland when it was struck from behind by the second train.

This is one of several accidents the MBTA has experienced recently. Exactly two weeks ago, a trolley on the B Branch derailed and caught fire, and Tuesday, a fire broke out between Park Street and Downtown Crossing on the MBTA's Red Line.

<h2>First fertilised fish fossil found</h2>
A 375 million-year old fossilised umbilical cord could cause scientists to completely rethink the current theories of the evolution of vertebrate sexual reproduction, a team of Australian scientists say.

The fossil of a placoderm, a class of prehistoric fish known as the "dinosaur of the seas", dates back to the Devonian period, and is the earliest known case of a vertebrate that gave birth to live young. It is also the only fossilised umbilical cord ever to be found.

Dr. John Long, Museum Victoria's head of sciences and the leader of the team examining the fossils, says the find "changes our understanding of the evolution of vertebrates".

According to the research team, this discovery pushes the known development of viviparity (animals giving birth to live young) back 200 million years, and also marks the earliest known development of internal fertilisation, a feature now found in sharks and rays.

German-born Finland striker Mikael Forssell has signed a 3 year contract with Hannover 96 on a free transfer from Birmingham City. Birmingham City were relegated from the FA Premier League earlier this month. 

Birmingham Head Coach Alex McLeish believes that, despite the transfer of Forssell to Hannover 96, his squad will have enough goalscoring to challenge for an immediate return to the FA Premier League for the 2009-10 season.

For Forssell, The transfer ends an association with English football which lasted 10 years. He has played at Chelsea F.C., Crystal Palace and Birmingham City over that time.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; comedian &lt;a href="w%3AHarvey%20Korman"&gt;Harvey Korman&lt;/a&gt; has died at the age of 81, according to a statement released by his family.

"Everything he did on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Carol%20Burnett%20Show"&gt;The Carol Burnett Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, especially the Mother Marcus character, was a special favorite.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="human%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href="w%3ALiberty%20%28pressure%20group%29"&gt;Liberty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20Edinburgh%20Council"&gt;City of Edinburgh Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; have weighed in on the right of critics to call &lt;a href="Scientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; a "cult" at peaceful protests. After a 15-year-old boy refused to remove a sign calling Scientology a "cult" at a May 10 protest in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20London%20Police"&gt;City of London Police&lt;/a&gt; confiscated his sign and issued him a court summons. On May 23 the &lt;a href="w%3ACrown%20Prosecution%20Service"&gt;Crown Prosecution Service&lt;/a&gt; stated that there would be no prosecution of the boy. Liberty is investigating the actions of the City of London Police, and told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Wednesday that they may decide to lodge a complaint with the &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Police%20Complaints%20Commission"&gt;Independent Police Complaints Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The City Council of &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; released a statement earlier this week saying they had no objections to the word "cult" being used on signs at anti-Scientology protests.

Individuals from the group &lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt; have held monthly international protests against the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; since February, as part of the anti-Scientology movement &lt;a href="w%3AProject%20Chanology"&gt;Project Chanology&lt;/a&gt;. The Project Chanology movement began when the Church of Scientology attempted to get a leaked Scientology promotional video featuring &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Cruise"&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; removed from websites &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGawker.com"&gt;Gawker.com&lt;/a&gt;. 

Members of Anonymous were motivated by the actions of the Church of Scientology, and bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10, March 15, April 12, and most recently May 10. Localized protests have also been held in various cities in between the international protests.
The May 10 London protest took place near &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral"&gt;St Paul's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;'s headquarters on &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Victoria%20Street%2C%20London"&gt;Queen Victoria Street&lt;/a&gt;. The 15-year-old boy's poster read: "Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult". City of London Police approached the boy at the May 10 protest and cited section five of the &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Order%20Act%201986"&gt;Public Order Act 1986&lt;/a&gt;, which deals with "&lt;a href="w%3AHarassment%2C%20alarm%20or%20distress"&gt;harassment, alarm or distress&lt;/a&gt;". In response, the boy cited a 1984 judgment given by Mr. Justice Latey in the Family Division of the &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;High Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ACourts%20of%20England%20and%20Wales"&gt;Her Majesty's Courts of Justice of England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;, in which Latey called Scientology a "cult" and said it was "corrupt, sinister and dangerous". 

In the actual 1984 judgment made by Judge Latey, he stated: "Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious. [...] In my judgement it is corrupt, sinister and dangerous. [...] It is dangerous because it is out to capture people, especially children and impressionable young people, and indoctrinate and brainwash them so that they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from ordinary thought, living and relationships with others." The boy told fellow protesters he was not going to take the sign down, saying: "If I don't take the word 'cult' down, here [holding up his sign], I will be either, I think, most likely arrested or [given] a summons. I am going to fight this and not take it down because I believe in freedom of speech, besides which I'm only fifteen."

When the boy refused to take his sign down, City of London Police removed it, cited him with a court summons and informed him that the matter would be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. The boy was the only protester who did not comply with the police requests to remove signs which referred to Scientology as a "cult". According to ♡❤The Guardian♡❤, a CPS spokesman stated that: "In consultation with the City of London police, we were asked whether the sign, which read 'Scientology is not a religion it is a dangerous cult', was abusive or insulting. Our advice is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness, as opposed to criticism, neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression. No action will be taken against the individual."

"The CPS review of the case includes advice on what action or behaviour at a demonstration might be considered to be threatening, abusive or insulting. The force's policing of future demonstrations will reflect this advice," said a spokeswoman for the City of London Police in a statement in ♡❤The Guardian♡❤. 
&lt;a href="w%3AShami%20Chakrabarti"&gt;Shami Chakrabarti&lt;/a&gt;, director of Liberty, voiced concerns about the actions of the City of London Police, as did James Welch, legal director of Liberty. Liberty represented the 15-year-old boy to the City of London Police. Chakrabarti told ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ Wednesday that Liberty is looking into the matter and may file a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission if it is determined that the City of London Police has a policy on appropriate wording on protest signs which relate specifically to anti-Scientology protests. &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;Freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt; campaigners may also call for a judicial review of the legality of the protest guidelines of the City of London Police.

"Curtailing people's freedom of speech is a very serious issue and it's important to know whether this is part of the force's policy or a decision relating specifically to the Church of Scientology. There is the possibility of a complaint to the IPCC or a judicial review," said Chakrabarti in a statement Wednesday in ♡❤The Guardian♡❤. "Some people are very easily intimidated and will be put off exercising their right to free speech by the thought that they may face court action over it. We have to defend that right and show how wrong the police were in issuing this summons."
Protesters in Scotland that routinely gather to protest against the Church of Scientology outside the Scientology centre in South Bridge, Edinburgh contacted the City of Edinburgh Council in order to get the Council's input on using the word "cult" on signs at anti-Scientology protests. 
In a statement in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Scotsman"&gt;The Scotsman&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Tuesday, an Edinburgh County official said: "I understand that some of the signs you use may display the word 'cult' and there is no objection to this." ♡❤The Scotsman♡❤ reported that a representative for the &lt;a href="w%3ALothian%20and%20Borders%20Police"&gt;Lothian and Borders Police&lt;/a&gt; said that the Scotland police force had "no issue" with the use of the word "cult" in a peaceful protest. A representative for Liberty spoke positively of the position taken by the City of Edinburgh Council. "The leadership shown by the City of Edinburgh Council's decision to protect free speech is a positive step," said Liberty media director Jen Corlew in a statement Tuesday in ♡❤The Scotsman♡❤.

The City of London Police has faced controversy in the past for its close association with the Church of Scientology. When the City of London Scientology building opened in 2006, City of London Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley praised Scientology in an appearance as guest speaker at the building's opening ceremony. Ken Stewart, another of the City of London's chief superintendents, has also appeared in a video praising Scientology. According to ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ over 20 officers for the City of London Police have accepted gifts from the Church of Scientology including tickets to film premieres, lunches and concerts at police premises. 

Unlike the City of London Police, the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan Police Service&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="w%3Aterritorial%20police%20force"&gt;territorial police force&lt;/a&gt; responsible for &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20London"&gt;Greater London&lt;/a&gt; excluding the &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20London"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt;) has not raised an issue with protesters using placards with similar wording at protests against Scientology, according to ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ and ♡❤Londonist♡❤.
&lt;a href="Film"&gt;Film&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="television"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; actor &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Beghe"&gt;Jason Beghe&lt;/a&gt; visited a protest organized by members of Project Chanology on Thursday in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. Beghe joined Scientology in 1994, and gave &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1 million to the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Church of Scientology&lt;/a&gt; over the course of his membership with the organization. He told Roger Friedman of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFOX%20News"&gt;FOX News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that Scientology head &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miscavige"&gt;David Miscavige&lt;/a&gt; called him "the poster boy for Scientology". Beghe appeared in promotional videos for Scientology in 2005. In April 2008 he left Scientology, and contacted Scientology critic &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Heldal-Lund"&gt;Andreas Heldal-Lund&lt;/a&gt;, who put him in touch with another critic &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Bunker"&gt;Mark Bunker&lt;/a&gt;. Bunker arranged an interview with Beghe, which was uploaded to Bunker's YouTube account on April 7. The posted video is a 3-minute portion of a larger 3-hour interview with Beghe about his criticism of Scientology. In the video Beghe states: "Scientology is destructive and a rip-off. ... It’s very, very dangerous for your spiritual, psychological, mental, emotional health and evolution."

Beghe participated in the May 10 international protests against the Church of Scientology, attending the protest in Los Angeles. He met with fellow Scientology critic and former Scientologist &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Wollersheim"&gt;Lawrence Wollersheim&lt;/a&gt; and spoke with members of Project Chanology.

Approximately 50 people attended the Thursday protest outside the Church of Scientology of New York building on East 46th Street in New York City. Beghe met with individuals from the group Anonymous and expressed support for what they were doing. "What you guys are doing means so much to me, and so much to these people ... It just kills me. It makes me want to cry. You don’t know what kind of good you’re doing," said Beghe to the protesters.
After meeting with the protesters, Beghe walked across the street to the Church of Scientology building but was blocked from entering by three men standing outside the building. Beghe told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Village%20Voice"&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that he believes these individuals were not Scientologists but hired private security guards. He said to the guards "I paid a million dollars, and I want to go in," but was told to go back across the street. When he rejoined the protesters on the other side of the street he called the Church of Scientology asking to speak to the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, John Carmichael, but said "they hung up". According to a blog post at ♡❤The Village Voice♡❤ website, Carmichael was caught on video at an anti-Scientology protest held in New York City on Monday telling a protester: "Let me tell you this: I smell pussy," and then addressed an individual protester and said: "You in particular." According to ♡❤The Village Voice♡❤ blog post, the incident occurred after protesters prevented Carmichael from capturing images of them and identifying them, by shining a flashlight at his camera.

Each of the Project Chanology international protests against Scientology has had a theme: the February protest called attention to the birthday of &lt;a href="w%3ALisa%20McPherson"&gt;Lisa McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, who died under controversial circumstances while under the care of Scientology, the March protest was arranged to take place two days after Scientology founder &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;'s birthday, the April protest highlighted the Church of Scientology's &lt;a href="w%3ADisconnection"&gt;disconnection policy&lt;/a&gt;, and the May protest highlighted the Scientology practice of "&lt;a href="w%3AFair%20Game%20%28Scientology%29"&gt;Fair Game&lt;/a&gt;" and took place one day after the anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADianetics%3A%20The%20Modern%20Science%20of%20Mental%20Health"&gt;Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Another international protest is planned for June 14, and will highlight the Church of Scientology's elite "&lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Org"&gt;Sea Organization&lt;/a&gt;" or "Sea Org".

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (UNFPA) organization &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Population%20Fund"&gt;United Nations Population Fund&lt;/a&gt; emphasized the importance of &lt;a href="w%3AWomen%27s%20health"&gt;women's health&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; at the 4th &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%20International%20Conference%20on%20African%20Development"&gt;Tokyo International Conference on African Development&lt;/a&gt; (TICAD IV). Priorities of the conference include &lt;a href="w%3AEconomy"&gt;economic&lt;/a&gt; growth, &lt;a href="w%3APeace"&gt;peace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADemocracy"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;. The three-day conference which ended Friday included representatives from over 80 countries.
At the conference in &lt;a href="w%3AYokohama%2C%20Japan"&gt;Yokohama, Japan&lt;/a&gt;, over 40 heads of State agreed on health priorities adopted at the end of the three-day summit. The theme of the conference was "Towards a vibrant Africa: A continent of hope and opportunity", and approximately 86 countries were represented, as well as international organizations. The Yokohama Action Plan prioritizes universal access to reproductive health services and an increase in the number of African women who give birth with skilled assistance.

&lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Japan"&gt;Prime Minister of Japan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AYasuo%20Fukuda"&gt;Yasuo Fukuda&lt;/a&gt; announced steps which would be taken by his country to further health conditions in Africa, including: increasing funding to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Global%20Fund%20to%20Fight%20AIDS%2C%20Tuberculosis%20and%20Malaria"&gt;The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria&lt;/a&gt;, training 100,000 African health workers, and doubling the country's bilateral development assistance to Africa by 2012. "In the future, Africa will become a powerful engine driving the growth of the world," said Mr. Fukuda at the start of the conference.

The Prime Minister said Japan would offer up to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;4 billion in loans to African countries to go towards agriculture and infrastructure. He announced the formation of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation Facility for African Investment, which will provide $2.5 billion in financial assistance.
United Nations Deputy Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3AAsha-Rose%20Migiro"&gt;Asha-Rose Migiro&lt;/a&gt; cited priority 5 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - preventing women's deaths during pregnancy and childbirth as a serious challenge. "Reducing maternal mortality lies at the heart of implementation to achieve all the other goals," said Migiro.
UNFPA Executive Director &lt;a href="w%3AThoraya%20Obaid"&gt;Thoraya Ahmed Obaid&lt;/a&gt; told conference participants that women's health in Africa should be made a priority. "Of all the Millennium Development Goals, goal number five - preventing women's deaths during pregnancy and childbirth - is generating the least resources and lagging the furthest behind. And African women are paying the price," she said. Obaid urged world leaders "to make the health of women a political and development priority".

TICAD holds summits every five years, and is a joint program between Japan and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Development%20Programme"&gt;United Nations Development Programme&lt;/a&gt;. Japan will report the conference results at the &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;Group of Eight&lt;/a&gt; (G8) meeting in Tokyo in July, which will be chaired by Prime Minister Fukuda.

&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;♡❤Discovery♡❤&lt;/a&gt; has successfully launched from &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center%20Launch%20Complex%2039"&gt;Launch Complex 39A&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, beginning mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-124"&gt;STS-124&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Discovery♡❤ will deliver the main pressurised module of the &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20Experiment%20Module"&gt;Japanese Experiment Module&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. Lift-off occurred at 21:02:12 GMT this evening, with the ascent to an initial sub-orbital trajectory lasting approximately eight and a half minutes. Orbital insertion occurred shortly afterwards, with a circularisation burn which concluded at 21:42 GMT.

This is the third &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20program"&gt;Space Shuttle mission&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. STS-124 is the second of three missions to assemble the Japanese Experiment Module, also known as Kibo. The JEM Pressurised Module (JEM PM or JPM) is the largest laboratory module of the International Space Station, and one of the largest payloads ever launched by the Space Shuttle. The main Japanese robot arm, or RMS, will also be launched on this mission. ♡❤Discovery's♡❤ mission is scheduled to last for fourteen days, however it can be extended by two days if necessary. Three spacewalks, or EVAs, are planned to be conducted.
STS-124 has a crew of seven &lt;a href="w%3Aastronaut"&gt;astronaut&lt;/a&gt;s; Mission Commander , Pilot , Mission specialists , , and , and &lt;a href="w%3AExpedition%2017"&gt;Expedition 17&lt;/a&gt; crewmember &lt;a href="w%3AGregory%20Chamitoff"&gt;Gregory Chamitoff&lt;/a&gt;. All crewmembers are &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;, except Hoshide, who is &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese. The astronauts were awoken at 11:30 GMT on launch day, and began preparations for their launch. This is the first spaceflight for Ham, Nyberg, Garan, Hoshide and Chamitoff, the second for Fossum, and the third for Kelly. The launch coincides with Kelly's father's birthday.

Preparations for launch had been underway for several months. The External Tank arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in late March. Following tests in a checkout cell, it was mated with two solid rocket boosters which had been assembled on a &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20Launch%20Platform"&gt;Mobile Launch Platform&lt;/a&gt;. Discovery was then rolled from the Orbiter Processing Facility to the &lt;a href="w%3AVehicle%20Assembly%20Building"&gt;Vehicle Assembly Building&lt;/a&gt; for mating with the External Tank and boosters. Rollover occurred in late April, and was followed by rollout to the launch pad about a week later.
The Kibo pressurised module arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in May 2003 by ship. It was then moved to the Space Station Processing Facility. Electrical interface tests with the &lt;a href="w%3AHarmony%20node"&gt;Harmony node&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in August 2003. At the end of April 2008, the module was placed in a transportation canister, and moved to the launch pad. The payload arrived at the launch pad about a week ahead of the Shuttle. Once ♡❤Discovery♡❤ arrived at the launch pad, the module was placed into ♡❤Discovery's♡❤ payload bay. Owing to the size of the payload, there was no room in ♡❤Discovery's♡❤♡ payload bay for the &lt;a href="w%3AOrbiter%20Boom%20Sensor%20System"&gt;Orbiter Boom Sensor System&lt;/a&gt; (OBSS), a safety device used primarily to inspect the Shuttle Orbiter's heat shield. As a result of this, &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Endeavour"&gt;♡❤Endeavour♡❤&lt;/a&gt; left its OBSS at the International Space Station, during the last Shuttle Mission, &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-123"&gt;STS-123&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Discovery's♡❤ crew will collect this during an EVA.

Fueling of ♡❤Discovery's♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20External%20Tank"&gt;External Tank&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for launch began at 11:50 GMT. By 12:50, it had been confirmed that initial tests on Engine Cutoff (ECO) sensors in the External Tank had been conducted successfully. ECO sensor failures had caused a number of delays to recent Shuttle launch attempts, and STS-124 is the first mission to use a modified tank, which is intended to eliminate such faults. At the time at which tanking began, weather forecasters predicted an 80 percent chance of acceptable conditions at the scheduled launch time. Fuelling was completed, and topping up of cryogenic propellant began, at 15:36. In addition to the ECO sensor modifications, this was the first mission to use an External Tank manufactured after the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster"&gt;♡❤Columbia♡❤ accident&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, and therefore the first tank to have all safety enhancements built into it, rather than retrofitted.
The terminal countdown resumed after a planned hold at T-3 hours, at 17:07 GMT. Crew walkout from the Operations and Checkout building at the Kennedy Space Center occurred at 17:12. Following walkout, the crew boarded a bus known as the "astrovan", which was used to transport them to the launch pad. The crew arrived at the launch pad at 17:31, and began boarding ♡❤Discovery♡❤ at 17:38. As Mission Commander, Mark Kelly was the first to board the orbiter. He was followed by Chamitoff at 17:42, Ham at 17:52, Fossum at 17:55, Nyberg at 18:08 and Hoshide at 18:11. Ron Garan was the last to board the orbiter at 18:21. Pad technicians known as the closeout crew, assisted the astronauts with boarding the Shuttle, and getting strapped in. The pad technicians were cleared to close the orbiter's access hatch at 19:02 GMT, and the hatch door was closed two minutes later at 19:04. Sealing the hatch was completed at 19:54.

A scheduled ten-minute hold at T-20 minutes began at 19:47 GMT. During this hold, the closeout crew put thermal insulation plugs into screwholes on the orbiter's hatch, removed protective covers, and disassembled the white room, a collapsible structure at the end of the crew access arm which is used to access the spacecraft. The countdown resumed at 19:57. At that time, no problems were being worked.
The final built in hold, at T-9 minutes and lasting for 45 minutes and 12 seconds, began at 20:08. During this hold, flight controllers set the exact launch time to be 21:02:12 GMT, and confirmed that the launch window would end at 21:08:59 GMT. The countdown was set to resume at 20:53:12. Shortly before the end of the hold, the launch director described conditions as a "gorgeous day to launch", and wished the crew "good luck and Godspeed". Mark Kelly thanked him, and replied "whilst we tend to live for today, Discovery, with Kibo, will certainly deliver hope for tomorrow". Countdown resumed on time at the end of the hold, and the automated Ground Launch Sequencer was initiated.

When giving clearance to retract the Orbiter Access arm from the Shuttle, seven minutes before launch, the Orbiter Test Conductor wished the crew "best of luck delivering JEM to the International Space Station". Four minutes before launch, the engines were purged of gasses, and tests of the flight control surfaces began. Liquid hydrogen tanks were pressurised shortly after at T-3 minutes, and the fuel vent cap was retracted. Two minutes before lift-off, the crew were instructed to close and lock their visors, and the liquid oxygen tank was pressurised. At T-50 seconds, the orbiter switched to internal power, and the Shuttle's flight computers took over control of the countdown at T-31 seconds.
Launch occurred on schedule at 21:02:12 GMT. The &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Solid%20Rocket%20Booster"&gt;Solid Rocket Boosters&lt;/a&gt; separated about 120 seconds into the flight, and around eight and a half minutes after launch, the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Main%20Engine"&gt;Main Engines&lt;/a&gt; (SSMEs) shut down, and the External Tank was jettisoned. At this time, ♡❤Discovery♡❤ was on a 65km x 217km x 51.6° &lt;a href="w%3Asub-orbital"&gt;sub-orbital&lt;/a&gt; trajectory. Orbital insertion followed about thirty minutes later, with a firing of ♡❤Discovery's♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3AOrbital%20Maneuvering%20System"&gt;OMS&lt;/a&gt; engines. This burn started at 21:39 GMT, and ended at 21:42, lasting two minutes and 44 seconds.

At the time of launch, the International Space Station was flying over the Atlantic Ocean, South-East of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Following launch, a fault was detected with the backup electrical system controlling the left OMS engine gimbal actuator. As it was a backup, flight controllers predicted that it would have no effect on the mission, and all scheduled burns will go ahead. The fault was later traced to the failure of both transducers in the unit, and it was reported that the problem was probably due to an equipment malfunction as opposed to a faulty sensor. When asked about the faulty actuator, NASA Administrator &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Griffin"&gt;Mike Griffin&lt;/a&gt; stated that at the "worst case it would be a loss of redundancy but we will still be able to use that system". ♡❤Discovery's♡❤ payload bay doors were opened at 22:35 GMT. At 23:09, the crew were cleared to begin on-orbit operations.

Processing and countdown progressed smoothly, and were described by ♡❤Discovery's♡❤ processing and launch flow director, Stephanie Stilson, as being "a very clean flow". Mission Commander Mark Kelly remarked that there had been a "historic low on spacecraft issues". Around four hours prior to launch, Stilson remarked that there had been 73 anomalies detected so far. The smallest number of anomalies during the countdown for a previous mission was 76, for &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-103"&gt;STS-103&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AMoron%20AFB"&gt;Moron AFB&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; was considered the primary &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20abort%20modes"&gt;transoceanic abort landing&lt;/a&gt; (TAL) site, should an engine failure, or other major problem have occurred during early ascent. &lt;a href="w%3AIstres"&gt;Istres&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; was considered the backup TAL site. The weather at both of these sites was good, however no abort was required during the launch.

This is the 123 Space Shuttle mission, and the 35 to be flown by ♡❤Discovery♡❤. Ten further missions are planned, including two contingency logistics flights, prior to the Shuttle's retirement in 2010. Discovery is assigned to three of these missions. It is next scheduled to fly in early 2009, on mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-119"&gt;STS-119&lt;/a&gt;. The next Space Shuttle mission will be conducted by &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;♡❤Atlantis♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which will fly &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-125"&gt;STS-125&lt;/a&gt;, the final mission to service the &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;. This is the fourth manned, and 27 orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;.

At a press conference following launch, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; Administrator &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Griffin"&gt;Mike Griffin&lt;/a&gt; stated that it was "a huge day for the space station partnership", and that the International Space Station was "a place in orbit where we can learn to live and work in space". He congratulated &lt;a href="w%3AJAXA"&gt;JAXA&lt;/a&gt; on the launch of the Japanese Experiment Module, saying that "Japan has now built a first class laboratory...which is capable of supporting humans in space", and that "with this step Japan has shown itself to be capable of performing at the highest levels of space exploration". Griffin also stated the STS-124 is "an essential step" in the Space Station programme. When asked by a reporter how he felt about recent NASA successes, including the STS-124 launch, and the landing of the &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; probe on &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; last Sunday, he joked that it felt "so great that not even having to do a press conference, two press conferences in a week can ruin it". When asked about the difficulty of what NASA was doing, he remarked that flight controllers "make it look easy", but "it is so far from being easy that I could talk until 6am tomorrow, and I wouldn't touch on how difficult it is".

NASA Associate Administrator for Space Operations &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Gerstenmaier"&gt;Bill Gerstenmaier&lt;/a&gt; said that it was "a great day for the launch", and described STS-124 as a "pretty challenging mission". Gerstenmair stated that five foam debris impacts had been identified during ascent, but that NASA "don't consider this a big deal, they were all late". When asked what he meant by 'late', he explained that after 123 seconds into the flight, pieces of falling foam debris "can't build up enough velocity to hit the orbiter, or if they hit the orbiter they will just bounce off" He went on to say that "things look really well and look really good", and that NASA have "no concern" about foam, "It's not an issue to us".

Launch Integration manager &lt;a href="w%3ALeRoy%20Cain"&gt;LeRoy Cain&lt;/a&gt; described it as a "flawless countdown and a flawless launch". He said that STS-124 is "a big milestone for us", and went on to explain that "this is the most important mission we have going right now". He also stated that the "tank's performance looks really good". 

Launch Director Mike Linebach stated that it was a "Fantastic launch", that was tying for the lowest faults during a countdown, with 74 issues reported. Stephanie Stilson has previously stated that the record was 76 issues, so it is unclear whether STS-124 has set a new record, or is tying with the previous record. Linebach went on to describe the launch as "outstanding".

Keiji Tachikawa, the President of &lt;a href="w%3AJAXA"&gt;JAXA&lt;/a&gt; said that he "was very delighted to see the Shuttle ♡❤Discovery♡❤ successfully launched". He stated that the Kibo module would "significantly enhance the capability to perform experiments in orbit", and that experiments conducted aboard the Space Station, and the Kibo module, would lead to "better daily lives for the people of our planet". He also expressed his "profound appreciation to NASA, and all international and domestic organisations" involved in the launch, explaining that the mission is "very significant to Japan".

&lt;a href="FIFA"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;, the world's governing body for &lt;a href="football%20%28soccer%29"&gt;football (soccer)&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; are set to collide over the controversial 6+5 Rule.

The problem is that FIFA wants to limit the number of foreign players in the starting 11 to a maximum 5 players per side while the European Union allows free movement of workers making FIFA's 6+5 Rule illegal within the European Union.

Despite the legal issue about the 6+5 Rule within the European Union, FIFA President &lt;a href="Sepp%20Blatter"&gt;Sepp Blatter&lt;/a&gt; presented the 6+5 Rule to FIFA Congress where the member national associations of FIFA would vote on examining the issue further.

The FA in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was quoted on their website saying, "At today's meeting of the FIFA Congress in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , The FA voted in favour of further exploration of the "6+5" rule proposed by FIFA President Sepp Blatter." The FA further said, "The resolution, adopted overwhelmingly by the Congress, requested that the FIFA and UEFA Presidents work with key figures within the world of sport to examine how the proposal might work within the limits of the law."

The FA, the national association for England, indicated that having more "high-quality English players" is an "absolute priority."

A reservation of the FA is the legality of the 6+5 Rule but they "welcome further exploration of its legality."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="Real%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; Goalkeeper, Iker Casillas, has also indicated to be in favour of FIFA's 6+5 Rule stating, it would be "exceptional" for players developed for "Homegrown player."

On May 8, the European Union voted against the 6+5 Rule and have indicated that they will take legal action against any national association within the European Union that introduces FIFA's 6+5 Rule.

Depending if and how fast FIFA gets their way, the 6+5 rule can be implemented as soon as 2012 with smaller variations leading the way to 2012.

The Telegraph took a look at the last Day of the FA Premier League to see how clubs matched up with the 6+5 Rule. The table below shows 2 sets of results.

According to the Telegraph, British players might be exempted from the rule meaning that English teams might not be penalized for fielding Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish players. The same would apply for teams in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The remains of 170 &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n troops who died in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Fromelles"&gt;Battle of Fromelles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been found in a mass grave outside of the town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFromelles"&gt;Fromelles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. A dig is underway to recover the remains and identify the soldiers. It is slated to take two weeks.

The graves contain a total of around 400 &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; troops. Discussion on what to do with the British remains is still ongoing.

Early ground studies raised the possibility that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aunexploded%20ordnance"&gt;unexploded ordnance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could be buried at the site, prompting the use of metal detectors to probe for potential hazards. So far, only metal studs, buttons and belt buckles have been found.

Tim Whitford, who is overseeing the dig, said "If the blokes are recovered we'd like to see every effort made to see them identified and I would like to see them given a dignified military funeral. Those are honours they have deserved for over 90 years."

Fought during July 19-20, 1916, the Battle of Fromelles was a complete disaster for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAllies%20of%20World%20War%20I"&gt;Allies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; achieving a decisive victory and the Australians sustaining over 5,000 casualties in less than a day. Following the battle, the Germans dug eight 40-meter long pits to bury the dead Allied soldiers. Five of the eight pits are thought to contain Australian soldiers, while the other three appear to contain battlefield debris.

The eruption of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACerro%20Azul%20%28Ecuador%20volcano%29"&gt;Cerro Azul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsabella%20Island"&gt;Isabella Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the main island in the &lt;a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands"&gt;Galápagos&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, is not directly threatening either the famous &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or the human population of the island, unlike in the 1998 eruption.

The latest eruption began Thursday, 29 May, and includes lava flows. &lt;a href="Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reports that after Galápagos Park rangers flew over the mountain, they released a statement saying that the lava is flowing away from both the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Villamil"&gt;Puerto Villamil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; settlement and the region where the tortoises are ranging. 

"There is no threat to the local human population ... nor for the tortoise population because lava rivers are flowing in the opposite direction," the statement read.
Up to four lava flows have been sighted, and "have consumed a lot of vegetation," said Park official Oscar Carvajal to local station Radio Quito. Ecuador's Geophysics Institute reported a small amount of ash from the 1,690 m mountain.

During the last major eruption of Cerro Azul in 1998, some tortoises were airlifted away from the fire and lava, but others were burned in the natural disaster. Volcanic activity within the island group is high, and the island of Isabella is itself formed by six shield volcanoes, with five of the six still being active.

The Galápagos &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Aarchipelago"&gt;archipelago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lies 525 nautical miles west of the mainland of Ecuador in the &lt;a href="Pacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, directly on the equator.

Seventeen people have been arrested after a party, attended by hundreds of people, took place on the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; to mark the last day that drinking alcohol was legal while travelling on the Tube.
The new ban prevents people from consuming, or carrying any alcoholic drinks while travelling on the London Underground. The restriction was announced by &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Johnson"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt; soon after he became the new mayor of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

Local police have said that the party, which was intended to just be an enjoyable evening, finished with an "unfortunate" ending. Several tube stations were shut due to the disruption caused by the large number of people; Liverpool Street, Euston, Euston Square, Aldgate, Gloucester Road and Baker Street were closed. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has reported that some of the tube trains may have been damaged, despite a heavy police presence.

Jeroen Weimar, from Transport for London commented on the incidents."We are encouraging our passengers to show a bit more respect and to be more considerate and involve other peoples' views and other passengers views as they make their journeys," he commented. "And clearly drinking alcohol can create a culture whereby people feel it's okay to do that sort of thing, it's okay to get more drunk when you're travelling."

The search warrant was filed in &lt;a href="w%3AMohave%20County%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Mohave County&lt;/a&gt; Superior Court in &lt;a href="w%3AKingman%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Kingman&lt;/a&gt;, Arizona. Jeffs is alleged to have sexually assaulted one of the 12-year-old girls after their July 2006 "spiritual" marriage, and is also alleged to have married a 14-year-old girl in January 2004 who gave birth to a child in October 2005. Police say the girl was believed to be about 15 at the time of conception by Jeffs. 
Texas officials are investigating Jeffs for crimes of sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual assault and prohibited sexual assault. The search warrant alleges: "Warren Jeffs sexually assaulted a 12-year-old child ... on or about July 27, 2006, in Schleicher County, Texas," according to a copy of the warrant obtained by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADeseret%20News"&gt;Deseret News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. "Based on all of the above, affiant believes that Warren Jeffs has committed the felony offense of sexual assault of a child," wrote Kingman, Arizona police officer Dennis Gilbert in the search warrant. Law enforcement officials say that another marriage took place on April 16, 2005 between Jeffs and a 12-year-old girl. 
Jeffs is alleged to have "married" the children at the FLDS compound in &lt;a href="w%3AEldorado%2C%20Texas"&gt;Eldorado&lt;/a&gt;, Texas. Marital records known in the FLDS as "bishop's records" allegedly document a January 18, 2004 marriage between Jeffs and a 14-year-old girl. The documents were obtained when Texas authorities conducted a search of the FLDS compound in Texas, the &lt;a href="w%3AYFZ%20Ranch"&gt;Yearning for Zion Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, on April 3. According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Worth%20Star%20Telegram"&gt;Fort Worth Star Telegram&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ the warrant also alleges that Jeffs married a 14-year-old girl at the YFZ compound on July 22, 2004.

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas%20Review"&gt;Las Vegas Review&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the DNA samples were taken from Jeffs on Thursday afternoon via a cotton swab of the mouth. Kingman police detectives took the sample after Texas authorities asked for help in their investigation of Jeffs. Kingman police executed the search warrant and affidavit of probable cause, and authorities from the Texas Attorney General's office left Thursday with the samples.
"Our investigator was out there yesterday collecting the DNA sample after getting the search warrant signed," said Texas Attorney General's office spokesman Jerry Strickland in a statement Friday to the AP.

In a statement Saturday in the ♡❤Deseret News♡❤, Rod Parker, a &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/a&gt; attorney and FLDS spokesman questioned what evidence law enforcement possessed which could show possible criminal actions by Jeffs. "The question is, do they have any evidence of sexual activity with minors and Warren Jeffs? I don't know if they do or not. I don't see how DNA, by itself, proves that one way or another."
Photos of Jeffs pictured with underage child brides were shown in court last week in an FLDS custody case in Texas. The photos show Warren Jeffs kissing and hugging young girls, and attorneys for Texas Child Protective Services claim that one of the girls shown in the photos is a 12-year-old "bride". The photos are dated from July 2006 and January 2005. 

Jeffs is seen in one set of photos from January 26, 2005 labeled "First anniversary" with a girl called "Loretta". In another set dated July 27, 2005, Jeffs is shown with a girl referred to as "Merrianne". Child Protective Services officials said that they have evidence that "Merrianne" was 12 years old when she was married to Jeffs at the YFZ compound. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Vancouver%20Sun"&gt;The Vancouver Sun&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that, per a family member, "Loretta" was no older than 12 when she was married. 

The investigation into alleged abuses committed by Jeffs is separate from the custody case involving the FLDS in Texas. &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Texas Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; upheld the decision of the appellate court to overturn a lower court ruling which led to the removal of over 400 children from the FLDS compound by Texas authorities in early April. The appellate court had said that &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20Protective%20Services"&gt;Child Protective Services&lt;/a&gt; did not show that the children faced an immediate danger if they were not removed.

Attorneys for CPS had asserted that DNA tests required to confirm parentage were still pending and that parents could take their children back from Texas jurisdiction if they regained custody. The appellate court justices stated that child welfare officials can take other actions to protect the children if necessary, and that the district judge in the case could still place restrictions on the parents and children to assure that they would not flee the state. Texas District Judge Barbara ruled Friday that the 38 mothers involved in the legal complaint which went to the appellate court must first sign an agreement drafted by child welfare officials and the FLDS attorneys before their children are returned to them.

Warren Jeffs was convicted in September 2007 of two counts of being an accomplice to rape related to a 2001 wedding he arranged between a 14-year old girl and her 19-year old cousin. He was sentenced to two consecutive five-year prison sentences in &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, and faces an impending trial in Arizona on eight charges including sexual conduct with a minor, &lt;a href="w%3Aincest"&gt;incest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aconspiracy"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;. After his convictions in Utah he was turned over to Arizona authorities to await trial there. He faces charges in Arizona of five counts of sexual conduct with a minor, four counts of incest and one count of conspiracy to commit sexual conduct with a minor.

The FLDS group has approximately 10,000 members total, and was founded in the 1930s. It split from the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; (LDS Church) after the LDS Church abandoned the practice of &lt;a href="w%3Apolygamy"&gt;polygamy&lt;/a&gt; in 1890.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; agency the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) has called for a ban on &lt;a href="w%3ATobacco"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; advertising and promotion in order to protect the &lt;a href="world"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;'s children. The news release from the WHO came on Friday, one day before the annual &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20No%20Tobacco%20Day"&gt;World No Tobacco Day&lt;/a&gt; held each year on May 31.
This year's World No Tobacco Day focuses on highlighting the practices of tobacco companies in their efforts to promote their products to young people. According to a WHO press release, studies show that young people are more likely to start smoking if exposed to tobacco advertising. The WHO notes that only five percent of the world population "is covered by comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship". 

"The WHO appeals to member states and policy-makers to require by law a comprehensive ban on all forms of advertising, promotion, and sponsorship of tobacco products," said WHO Regional Director for &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; Luis Sambo, in a statement released Saturday in &lt;a href="w%3AKampala"&gt;Kampala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;.
"In order to survive, the tobacco industry needs to replace those who quit or die with new young consumers," said WHO Director-General Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Chan"&gt;Margaret Chan&lt;/a&gt;. "A ban on all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship is a powerful tool we can use to protect the world’s youth."

The WHO said that tobacco companies are specifically targeting the half billion youth in the &lt;a href="w%3AAsia%20Pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt; region by tying smoking to the idea of a flashy lifestyle. The agency said the tobacco industry attempts to take advantage of children's susceptibility to advertising and marketing.

According to the WHO most people take up smoking before they reach age 18, and almost twenty-five percent of smokers worldwide are under the age of 10. The agency said that a survey of 13 to 15 year-olds found that fifty-five percent had seen &lt;a href="w%3ACigarette"&gt;cigarette&lt;/a&gt; ads on billboards in the prior month, and twenty-percent owned something with a cigarette company's logo.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt;, in the last ten years female and adolescent smoking in &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; has tripled. Russia does not have many anti-smoking laws. ♡❤BBC News♡❤ compared this to &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, where smoking levels are at their lowest in 40 years and the country has very restrictive laws on smoking advertising.
"The tobacco industry employs predatory marketing strategies to get young people hooked to their addictive drug. But comprehensive advertising bans do work, reducing tobacco consumption by up to 16% in countries that have already taken this legislative step," said Dr. Douglas Bettcher, Director of WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative. 

A report by the WHO on tobacco use stated that approximately two thirds of the planet's smokers reside in 10 countries including &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported that companies &lt;a href="w%3APhilip%20Morris"&gt;Philip Morris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20Tobacco"&gt;Imperial Tobacco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20American%20Tobacco"&gt;British American Tobacco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Tobacco"&gt;Japan Tobacco&lt;/a&gt; are among the world's largest producers of cigarettes.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Los Angeles County Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; responded to a fully involved structure fire on the back lot of &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20City%20Studios"&gt;Universal City Studios&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20City%2C%20California"&gt;Universal City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; which occurred shortly after dawn. Reports indicate a fire and a explosion occurred around 4:45 local time. 

The fire continues to burn in the Universal Studios backlot, which is adjacent to the Universal Studios theme park. 

The "New York Street" sound stage was completely destroyed and the Courthouse Square backlot from , an exhibit on the movie , the video vault, and a ride known as the "Cyclone" were damaged. County fire inspector Daryl Jacobs said at least three blocks of movie façades may have been destroyed.

More than 400 firefighters responded to the three-alarm fire, with helicopters dropping water on the blaze in an attempt to contain it. Three firefighters suffered minor burns, one reportedly from smoke exhaustion. No other injuries have been reported. Several urban search and rescue teams were dispatched to the area.

Daryl Jacobs said that the firefighters ran out of water at least twice while battling the flames. "There was an issue with water, but that has been rectified," Jacobs said. "They are shuttling water in." He also said firefighters encountered explosions from propane tanks as they entered the backlot.

County fire captain Frank Reynoso said the cause of the fire is still unknown. "It will be a while before we have it under control," Reynoso said.

The &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20MTV%20Movie%20Awards"&gt;2008 MTV Movie Awards&lt;/a&gt;, which are scheduled to be broadcast live from the studio theme park Sunday afternoon, will go on as planned, according to an MTV representative. The theme park's opening time has been moved back to noon local time, said a Los Angeles city councilman.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; all-business class airline &lt;a href="w%3ASilverjet"&gt;Silverjet&lt;/a&gt; has ceased operations and entered administration. The airline operated out of &lt;a href="w%3ALuton%20Airport"&gt;Luton Airport&lt;/a&gt; running services to &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;.

Passengers booked with Silverjet have been told to claim refunds from their credit card issuer or travel agent. The UK &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Aviation%20Authority"&gt;Civil Aviation Authority&lt;/a&gt; estimates that 7,000 UK travellers could be affected by the collapse.

The airline, which had hoped to secure an emergency &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;5 million loan from &lt;a href="w%3AViceroy%20Holdings"&gt;Viceroy Holdings&lt;/a&gt;, was formed at the start of last year. It has now been put up for sale by administrator Begbies Traynor. It is thought that &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;ern company Viceroy may put in an offer, as might a group of former Silverjet managers who recently left the company. Included in the administration deal are Silverjet's subsidiaries Silverjet Aviation Limited, Skylease Limited and Sky People Limited, all of which are wholly owned by Silverjet.

Silverjet shares are suspended from trading at the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and it is feared that shareholders may receive nothing from their investments.

Silverjet is the latest all-business class airline to collapse recently. &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; rivals &lt;a href="w%3AMaxjet"&gt;Maxjet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEos%20Airlines"&gt;Eos Airlines&lt;/a&gt; have both been forced out of business by high fuel costs, driven by the rapidly increasing price of crude oil. Silverjet's last flight left Dubai for Luton on Friday.

<h1>NASA says Phoenix spacecraft may have landed on ice</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%20says%20Phoenix%20spacecraft%20may%20have%20landed%20on%20ice&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, new images received from the &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; lander on &lt;a href="Mars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; shows a possible layer of ice on its landing site. Scientists received the images on Friday May 30 from the craft's robotic arm camera. The image was taken on the fifth Martian day, or &lt;a href="w%3ATimekeeping%20on%20Mars"&gt;Sol&lt;/a&gt; 5.

Scientists say that as Phoenix landed, the exhaust from its thrusters cleared away a three to four inch layer of Martian soil which exposed a flat layer of a white substance, that NASA says could be ice. The image shows the white layer which is shiny and smooth.

"It's the consensus of all of us that we have found ice. We were expecting to find ice within two to six inches of the surface. The thrusters have excavated two to six inches and, sure enough, we see something that looks like ice. It's not impossible that it's something else, but our leading interpretation is ice," said top Phoenix investigator at the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Arizona"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Tucson"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt; Peter Smith.

One exposed edge of the underlying material was seen in Sol 4 images, but the newer image reveals a greater extent of it. The abundance of excavated smooth and level surfaces adds evidence to a hypothesis that the underlying material is an ice table covered by a thin blanket of soil. Tests will be performed on the soil and surrounding area to determine exactly what the substance is.

"We could very well be seeing rock, or we could be seeing exposed ice in the retrorocket blast zone. We'll test the two ideas by getting more data," stated Ray Arvidson, one of the mission investigators.

Phoenix is searching for evidence of water and microbial life on Mars. Its mission is to determine Mars's ability or inability to host life and hold water. The Phoenix lander uses a robotic arm to dig through the protective top soil layer to the alleged water ice below and ultimately bring both soil and water ice to the lander platform for sophisticated scientific analysis.

Presidential candidate &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; withdrew from his church of twenty years, where his affiliation had become a political issue following a revelation of controversial comments made by former pastor &lt;a href="w%3AJeremiah%20Wright"&gt;Jeremiah Wright&lt;/a&gt;. His exit from the church's congregation came as media reports revealed that guest speaker of the church and Catholic priest Reverend &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Pfleger"&gt;Michael Pfleger&lt;/a&gt; went on a tirade on the pulpit declaring that &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; believed she was entitled to the 
Democratic presidential nomination because she is white.

Obama had been criticized since March 2008 when media reports showed his longtime pastor declaring on the Sunday following the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt; that the violence was a result of America's support of "state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans." Many more were appalled when Wright declared "God damn America" in a later sermon. 

The pastor had an impact on Obama earlier in his life, and was once described as his spiritual guide. He married Obama and his wife &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Obama"&gt;Michelle&lt;/a&gt;, and baptized their two children. It was Wright's sermon that influenced Obama to write his biographical book ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Audacity%20of%20Hope"&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Obama remained a member of the church following the reports but separated himself from the comments in a speech on race entitled ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AA%20More%20Perfect%20Union%20%28speech%29"&gt;A More Perfect Union&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ delivered on March 18, 2008.

Despite the speech, polls early in May revealed that Obama's favorability fell from 50 to 45% because of Wright's comments. Wright had resigned his post yet the criticism remained. The final piece in Obama's eventual exit from the church came when Reverend Pfleger, a friend of Obama, mocked Hillary Clinton during a sermon stating, "'I’m &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt;’s wife, I’m white and this is mine'...And then out of nowhere came, 'Hey, I'm Barack Obama,' and she said, 'Oh, damn! Where did you come from? I'm white! I'm entitled! There's a black man stealing my show!'" 

In his announcement that he was leaving the church, Obama remarked, "I make this decision with sadness...This is where I found &lt;a href="w%3AJesus%20Christ"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;, where we were married, where our children were baptized. We are proud of the extraordinary works of that church...I’m not denouncing the church, and I’m not interested in people who want me to denounce the church."

A military transport helicopter carrying a crew of four and ten injured &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Sichuan%20earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; survivors has crashed in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, it was reported by state news agency . There are no indications on what casualties if any occurred as a result.

The helicopter was carrying the injured out of &lt;a href="w%3ALi%20county"&gt;Li county&lt;/a&gt;, after having brought in disease control experts. The rotorcraft then lost contact with Air Traffic Control. A &lt;a href="w%3Asearch%20and%20rescue"&gt;search and rescue&lt;/a&gt; operation has been ordered by President &lt;a href="w%3AHu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt;.

The day before, the death toll from the disaster was confirmed to have reached 68,977 with another 17,974 missing. Engineers are now working to drain a number of lakes formed by the earthquake, amid fears they could flood. The crash was reported to highlight ongoing difficulties responding to the quake.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGianluca%20Zambrotta"&gt;Gianluca Zambrotta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; returns to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASerie%20A"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after agreeing to a contract with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAC%20Milan"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He played for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Barcelona"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the past 2 seasons after &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJuventus%20FC"&gt;Juventus FC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were demoted after their part of the 2006 Serie A scandal.

According to ESPNSoccernet, AC Milan were looking to bring in Zambrotta for a while.

Zambrotta will miss out on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChampions%20League"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; football for at least 1 season because AC Milan finished in 5 place in Serie A while Barcelona will be in UEFA Champions League in the 3 qualifying round.

No transfer fee or length of contract was announced.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20United%20States"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has reached a deal to seat primary delegates from &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Democratic%20National%20Convention"&gt;Democratic National Convention&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; this August. The Democrats will seat all of the pledged delegates from both of the states, but will give each delegate only a half a vote. &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, who won the majority of the delegates in both of these states, will receive an additional 87 votes at the convention while &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; will net 63 more votes. Despite Senator Clinton's gains, Senator Obama still has 176 more pledged delegates supporting him.
Partisanship surrounded the decision. Advocates for Senator Clinton pushed for the inclusion of the delegates from both Florida and Michigan without condition, while Obama's supporters advocated splitting the delegates. In the end, neither side had all of their wishes fulfilled.

The Democratic leadership attempted to use the compromise to bring the party together. Party Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Dean"&gt;Howard Dean&lt;/a&gt; opened the meeting of the Rules Committee that determined the delegate allotment by asking Democrats to look beyond the primary and towards the November general election. "This is not about Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton," said Dean, "This is about our country. This is about restoring America to its greatness, to restoring our moral authority and to healing America at home."

The robotic arm scoop on the &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; lander on &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20%28planet%29"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; has made its first impression on the red planet, leaving behind a mark that resembles a human footprint. It began its first dig on Saturday, May 31, and the camera on board the arm caught an image.

"This first touch allows us to utilize the Robotic Arm accurately. We are in a good situation for the upcoming sample acquisition and transfer," stated Phoenix's surface mission manager from &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, David Spencer.

Scientists named the initial impression ♡❤Yeti♡❤ in an area they describe as 'The King of Hearts'. NASA has decided to name the various tasks and operations performed by Phoenix after fairy tale and mythological characters.

On Friday May 30, 2008, the same camera captured images of what appears to be ice under the lander. Scientists, who named the exposed area ♡❤Snow Queen♡❤, say that as Phoenix landed the exhaust from its thrusters cleared away a three- to four-inch layer of Martian soil which exposed a flat layer of a white substance that NASA says could be ice. The image shows the white layer which is shiny and smooth. Scientists expect to find more of the alleged ice when Phoenix begins its digging mission not far from the initial test dig.

"What we see in the images is in agreement with the notion that it may be ice, and we suspect we will see the same thing in the digging area," stated Uwe Keller, Robotic Arm Camera lead scientist for Phoenix.

Phoenix is searching for evidence of water and microbial life on Mars. Its mission is to determine Mars's ability or inability to host life and hold water. The Phoenix lander uses a robotic arm to dig through the protective top soil layer to the alleged water ice below and ultimately bring both soil and water ice to the lander platform for sophisticated scientific analysis.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AForest%20Glen%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Forest Glen, Queensland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Overnight rain following rain earlier in the week has caused the grounds at Sunshine Coast Grammar School to flood. The school has been closed and any students who showed up were sent home.

There is the possibility that senior classes will not go ahead tomorrow, as much of the lower floor of the resource center has been flooded.

The school was closed early and staff sent home due to &lt;a href="w%3AWorkplace%20Health%20and%20Safety"&gt;workplace health and safety&lt;/a&gt; issues and the lack of accessibility to other parts of the Sunshine Coast.

No major incidents have been reported, although one car was caught in a creek at the school, the driver having not seen the edge of the road due to the creek running quickly over it. It was towed out safely.

The more than 460 allegedly abused children were taken into state custody last month after officials say they received a call from a distressed 16-year old girl. The children were found in a 1700-acre compound belonging to the FLDS. It is now believed that the original phone call was actually a hoax.
The decision follows an &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Courts%20of%20Appeals"&gt;appeals court&lt;/a&gt; ruling that Texas &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20Protective%20Services"&gt;Child Protective Services&lt;/a&gt; (CPS) should not have taken the children from the FLDS.

Recently the CPS in Texas filed papers on this issue, saying that the families may choose to flee Texas if they are reunited per the appeals courts ruling. If the families were to do that, they would then be outside the court's jurisdiction, putting the children at risk of abuse.

The CPS in Texas released a statement regarding the court ruling: "We are disappointed, but we understand and respect the court's decision and will take immediate steps to comply. Child Protective Services has one purpose in this case - to protect the children. Our goal is to reunite families whenever we can do so and make sure the children will be safe. We will continue to prepare for the prompt and orderly reunification of these children with their families. We also will work with the district court to ensure the safety of the children and that all of our actions conform with the decision of the Texas Supreme Court."

Today, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; underwent surgery for a brain tumor at &lt;a href="w%3ADuke_University_Medical_Center%23Duke_University_Hospital"&gt;Duke University Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy, 76, was diagnosed with &lt;a href="w%3Aglioma"&gt;malignant glioma&lt;/a&gt;, a common but dangerous form of cancer, after suffering a seizure on May 17.

Kennedy has met repeatedly with friend and medical advisor Dr. Lawrence C. Horowitz to plan a course of treatment. The first, of the major phases of that treatment has now been completed, and it is expected that &lt;a href="w%3Achemotherapy"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aradiation%20therapy"&gt;radiotherapy&lt;/a&gt; will follow.

"I am pleased to report that Senator Kennedy's surgery was successful and accomplished our goals," said Dr. Allan Friedman, the chief of neurosurgery at Duke, who performed the surgery. "After a brief recuperation, he will begin targeted radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital and chemotherapy treatment," Friedman added.

In talks with the press, the senator has focused on his future beyond surgery. In a prepared statement issued by his office, Kennedy stated, "after completing treatment, I look forward to returning to the United States Senate and to doing everything I can to help elect &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; as our next president."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
12 firefighters in &lt;a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; have been taken to the hospital where they are being treated for smoke and chemical inhalation after a massive fire broke out at a warehouse on Buffalo's west side, early Monday morning. At least three fire companies started battling the blaze, which engulfed the entire warehouse, sending a plume of smoke into the air which could be seen for several miles, at one point darkening the sky. All 12 firefighters are being treated at Erie County Medical Center, but their conditions are not known. At least 80 firefighters were reported to be on scene along with a total of nine of the 19 fire companies in Buffalo. Firefighters were still on scene as of 9:15 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;) today, nearly 24 hours after the fire started.

The fire started at the ♡❤Leisure Living Pool Supplies♡❤ warehouse at 1130 Niagara street between West Ferry and Albany streets behind the &lt;a href="w%3ARich%20Products"&gt;Rich Products&lt;/a&gt; building at around 10:30 a.m. Monday and was not brought under control until 6:30 a.m. today. The warehouse is three floors tall. Firefighters had the fire under control just before 12:00 p.m. Monday, but wind off &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Erie"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; reignited the fire at around 3:00 p.m. At around 7:00 p.m., most of the blaze was under control, but smoke could still be seen coming from the building. All employees from both Rich's and the chemical company have been sent home for the day and made it out safely. The building is owned by ♡❤PoolSupplies.com♡❤ which is a division of ♡❤Leisure Living♡❤, selling supplies, recreation and chemicals for swimming pools. ♡❤Leisure Living♡❤ is a company of ♡❤Island Pools♡❤. 
At 9:00 p.m., firefighters reported that most of the fire was contained under the collapsed portions of the building, but around 10:00 p.m. firefighters reported that more thick black smoke started to rise from the building. Black smoke usually indicates burning, whereas white smoke often indicates water putting out a fire. Firefighters are using a helicopter, courtesy of the &lt;a href="w%3AErie%20County%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Erie County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff's Department, that is equipped with infrared cameras in order to see the areas of the building which still contain a significant amount of heat or fire.

After having fought the fire for over 24 hours, fire officials stated that the fire was mostly extinguished and ordered fire companies to start shutting down the hoses and pack up their equipment. Just before 1:00 p.m. the fire command post stated that fire investigators were on scene and that "they can call us (firefighters) back if they need anything."

Officials have urged all residents near the blaze to stay indoors and to shut all windows and doors due to the smoke which has been blowing close to the ground. At least one civilian who was inside a park at the foot of Ferry was also taken to the hospital for smoke and chemical inhalation. Officials were able to evacuate the park and no other injuries were reported. At one point, the sun was blocked by the black smoke rising from the building.

"The fire reignited again sometime this afternoon. It appears it reignited due to the earlier collapse of the roof and the winds off the lake. Right now, one thing fire officials would like to get out and stress is anyone in and around the Niagara and Ferry area, if you could please go indoors, and shut your doors," stated Michael DeGeorge, a spokesman for the Buffalo Police Department, to reporters. DeGeorge also stated that no residents have been evacuated.

The northbound lane of the I-190 expressway, which lies just to the west of the warehouse, was closed at the Porter Street exit at the &lt;a href="w%3APeace%20Bridge"&gt;Peace Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to the exit leading to the 198 expressway for several hours. At 11:15 p.m., firefighters stated they would begin to reopen the lane. Niagara street from Albany to West Ferry reopened to normal traffic in the late morning hours of Tuesday.

Throughout Monday afternoon and early evening, employees of ♡❤Marco's Restaurant♡❤ on Niagara and Albany were providing ice and beverages to firefighters and police officers who were on scene. Temperatures were quite warm, in the upper 70's (F), with winds gusting to nearly 15-20 MPH, coming out of the southwest. Although the wind assisted in reigniting the fire, it also assisted firefighters by quickly clearing the area of smoke.

The warehouse is a storage and distribution facility for pool chemicals, especially &lt;a href="w%3Achlorine"&gt;chlorine&lt;/a&gt;. Chemical drops could be felt flying through the air, which also had the smell of bleach. According to a source who spoke to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ on condition of anonymity, the warehouse contained over &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollars"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$8 million in supplies and chemicals.

Earlier tests performed on the air by firefighters and &lt;a href="w%3ADangerous%20goods"&gt;Haz-mat&lt;/a&gt; officials had shown that the smoke and fumes rising from the fire are not dangerous or toxic. Further tests were performed, but those results are not yet known and officials don't believe there was any danger to the air. Officials will testing the water runoff from fire hoses to make sure that it is not contaminated as it is emptying into the &lt;a href="w%3ANiagara%20River"&gt;Niagara River&lt;/a&gt;. The warehouse is located just down stream from a drinking water pumping station with several more scattered along the River from Buffalo to &lt;a href="w%3ANiagara%20Falls%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Niagara Falls&lt;/a&gt;.

The cause of the fire is not known and is under investigation. Last year, on May 14, 2007, at least five buildings that were part of a warehouse complex about 1/3 of a mile from ♡❤Leisure♡❤ caught fire, and required nearly 130 firefighters to battle the blaze. Smoke from that fire was seen over 40 miles away.

Pittsburgh denied the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Red%20Wings"&gt;Detroit Red Wings&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Cup"&gt;Stanley Cup&lt;/a&gt; on Monday as it won 4-3 in overtime on Monday's Game 5 of North America's premiere ice hockey championship.

<h3>Game synopsis</h3>

The use of a 25-second clip from &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Lennon"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt;'s song ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AImagine%20%28song%29"&gt;Imagine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in a film critical of the Theory of &lt;a href="w%3AEvolution"&gt;Evolution&lt;/a&gt; has been deemed likely to be defensible under a &lt;a href="w%3AFair%20use"&gt;fair use doctrine&lt;/a&gt; by U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein.

The film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AExpelled%3A%20No%20Intelligence%20Allowed"&gt;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, produced by Premise Media and starring comedian &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Stein"&gt;Ben Stein&lt;/a&gt;, uses the clip to represent "the most popular and persuasive embodiment of this viewpoint that the world is better off without religion", according to Premise representative Anthony Falzone at a hearing last month. In the song, Lennon proposes the hypothetical "Imagine there's no heaven ... and no religion too".

On April 23, 2008, Lennon's widow, &lt;a href="w%3AYoko%20Ono"&gt;Yoko Ono&lt;/a&gt;, along with his sons Julian and Sean, and music producer EMI Blackwood, Inc., filed suit against Premise Media seeking damages for alleged copyright infringement, as the song had not been licensed to appear in the film. On May 19, a preliminary injunction was issued, preventing distribution of the film. On June 2, Judge Stein of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York"&gt;United States District Court for the Southern District of New York&lt;/a&gt; ruled that the fair use defense would likely succeed if it went to court, and lifted the injunction. In his judgement, he wrote that "the fair use of a copyrighted work for the purposes of criticism and commentary is not an infringement of copyright".

♡❤Expelled♡❤ is a documentary that claims that &lt;a href="w%3AIntelligent%20Design"&gt;Intelligent Design&lt;/a&gt; proponents are being suppressed by the majority of the scientific community. It has received criticism from many scientists and film critics, and has also faced copyright claims over animated sequences that resemble the short animation &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Inner%20Life%20of%20the%20Cell"&gt;The Inner Life of the Cell&lt;/a&gt;, produced by XVIVO and &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;.

In a statement Ono commented that "it is a pity that this decision weakens the rights of all copyright owners". She plans to appeal the decision.

&lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; has reportedly achieved enough &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20United%20States"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination to become the Presidential candidate to face Republican Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; in the November 2008 United States elections. Obama will be the first black candidate ever to stand for the United States presidency with the backing of a major political party. 

&lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign has denied reports that she will concede the Democratic Party of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; primary campaign to Barack Obama during a speech tonight in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ first reported that two campaign officials stated she would announce her concession tonight. In a statement to the press, Clinton's campaign commented in two sentences: "The AP story is incorrect. Senator Clinton will not concede the nomination this evening."

Interviewed on &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; today, Clinton's campaign manager &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20McAuliffe"&gt;Terry McAuliffe&lt;/a&gt; called reports of concession "100 percent incorrect," but stated on &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤Today♡❤ that once Obama reached the crucial delegate count of 2,118, Clinton would congratulate him and "call him the nominee". She also told NBC that, "until someone has that magic number, we're going to continue to fight for literally those 17.5 million people."

On Monday, former President Bill Clinton was quoted as saying that "this may be the last day I'm ever involved in a campaign of this kind. I thought I was out of politics, till Hillary decided to run. But it has been one of the greatest honors of my life to be able to go around and campaign for her for president." President Clinton's aides later downplayed the statement.

The decision not to terminate Clinton's campaign officially was observed to give her a bargaining and leverage tool with Obama on various matters, up to and including the possibility of Clinton being Obama's vice presidential candidate. Speaking on conditions of anonymity, a Clinton campaign official stated that all Clinton campaign staff would be paid through June 15.

Called the "Comeback Girl" for her ability to come from behind to win states when the primary campaign showed Obama beginning to take both delegate and popularity leads, Clinton had campaigned late into Monday night for the chance of still taking a final come-from-behind victory in the final two primary elections. But today, Obama took the nomination ahead of the time frame analysts had predicted.

The Barack Obama campaign website has reported that there are 31.5 more delegates required before Obama receives the nomination. 

A news report released by the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Globe"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; has claimed that the Clinton Campaign is indicating that "she [Clinton] will gracefully exit the stage and won't take her fight to the convention." Sources close to Clinton hinted that if asked, she would be willing to serve as Obama's running mate.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; branch of &lt;a href="human%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; organization &lt;a href="w%3AReprieve%20%28organisation%29"&gt;Reprieve&lt;/a&gt; has accused the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; of using naval military ships to detain in secret and interrogate alleged terror suspects. The United States swiftly denied the allegations. &lt;a href="w%3AClive%20Stafford%20Smith"&gt;Clive Stafford Smith&lt;/a&gt;, founder and director of Reprieve, said, "the U.S. administration chooses ships to try to keep their misconduct as far as possible from the prying eyes of the media and lawyers." 

According to Reprieve, prisoners such as the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt;, and the American &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Walker%20Lindh"&gt;John Walker Lindh&lt;/a&gt; were imprisoned on naval ships stationed off the coasts of both &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADiego%20Garcia"&gt;Diego Garcia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Reprieve also noted that "prisoners have been interrogated under torturous conditions before being rendered to other, often undisclosed locations."

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Navy"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;, some ships have been used for short term prisoner housing, but denied they were prisons. "We do not operate detention facilities on board Navy ships. Department of Defense detention facilities are in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay." said Navy Commander &lt;a href="w%3AJeffrey%20D.%20Gordon"&gt;Jeffrey D. Gordon&lt;/a&gt; from the Pentagon. Gordon did acknowledge that it was a matter of public record that some individuals had been put onto the ships in question "for a few days", in what he labelled the 'initial days of detention'.

Among the United States ships named by Reprieve as having served as prison ships were the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Peleliu%20%28LHA-5%29"&gt;USS Peleliu&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Bataan%20%28LHD-5%29"&gt;USS Bataan&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are &lt;a href="w%3AAmphibious%20assault%20ship"&gt;amphibious assault ships&lt;/a&gt;. Also named was the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Ashland%20%28LSD-48%29"&gt;USS Ashland&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ADock%20landing%20ship"&gt;dock landing ship&lt;/a&gt;. Reprieve stated that its assessment was based on evidence from sources in the U.S. military, the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; and from testimony received from former detainees at the U.S. prison camps in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%2C%20Cuba"&gt;Guantanamo Bay, Cuba&lt;/a&gt;.

On Monday, Reprieve said it would publish details of its research later this year, in a full report on the alleged activities of the U.S. military. The organization went on to claim that the United States was imprisoning as many as 26,000 foreign detainees in secret prison facilities, including land-based prisons. Gordon was quoted as calling Reprieve's comments "inaccurate and misleading."

According to the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (AP), 2008 &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Democratic presidential candidate &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; has told lawmakers in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; that she is "open to being &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt;'s vice presidential candidate".

Earlier, the AP reported that Clinton would concede her race for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tonight during a speech in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , something her campaign denied.

"The AP story is incorrect. Senator Clinton will not concede the nomination this evening," said Clinton campaign officials in a statement to the press.

The report comes from New York lawmakers who participated in a conference call with Clinton. Nydia Velazquez, a New York lawmaker, stated to Clinton that she should seek being the running mate for Obama because it would win him more votes from the Hispanic and African American populations in November.

"I am open to it [being vice presidential candidate] if it would help the party's prospects in November," stated Clinton, speaking in a conference call with other politicians.

Yesterday, federal agents, assisted by local police, raided the businesses, homes, and offices of &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Colacurcio%2C%20Sr."&gt;Frank Colacurcio Sr.&lt;/a&gt;, and his son, Frank Junior in &lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Northwest"&gt;Pacific Northwest&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 50 years after federal authorities first labeled Colacurcio Sr. as an organized crime figure, they allege the 90-year-old strip club magnate and convicted racketeer is still active in violating the law. Local police with federal authorities enacted their raids in three separate counties along &lt;a href="w%3APuget%20Sound"&gt;Puget Sound&lt;/a&gt;. Local police have described it as the most significant probe into organized crime in &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%2C%20Washington"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt;'s history. The Colacurcios face allegations that include evidence of &lt;a href="w%3Aprostitution"&gt;prostitution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Amoney%20laundering"&gt;money laundering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Amail%20fraud"&gt;mail fraud&lt;/a&gt;. 

According to Robbie Burroughs of the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (FBI), court documents have named the clubs "Rick's" in Seattle, "Sugar's" in &lt;a href="w%3AShoreline%2C%20Washington"&gt;Shoreline&lt;/a&gt;, "Fox's" in &lt;a href="w%3AParkland%2C%20Washington"&gt;Parkland&lt;/a&gt;, and "Honey's" in &lt;a href="w%3AEverett%2C%20Washington"&gt;Everett&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the businesses "Talents West" talent agency and "Accurate Bookkeeping" in Seattle. The Colacurcios themselves were named as subjects of the investigation and raids. The Federal government additionally enacted a restraining order, unusually, as evidence in similar investigations is normally not made public prior to any indictments being issued. The restraining order, which can only be contested for ten days, bars the Colacurcios or their agents from selling, reducing the value of, or transferring three strip clubs, Rick's, Sugar's, and Honey's, or the related hiring and bookkeeping offices.

Seattle U.S. Attorney Jeff Sullivan has stated he plans to pursue the forfeiture of all the properties and businesses under the federal &lt;a href="w%3ARacketeer%20Influenced%20and%20Corrupt%20Organizations%20Act"&gt;Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act&lt;/a&gt; (RICO). "For far too long, the Colacurcios' organization has made big money operating their clubs as fronts for prostitution," he said. "The Colacurcios have designed the clubs, the payment methods and the policies that encourage prostitution and to ensure they are the ones getting rich off these illegal sex acts."

As of June 3, neither the Colacurcios nor their attorneys had spoken with the media or in public about the raids and investigation.

The Colacurcios have a long history involving law enforcement. Frank Sr. was convicted in the 1940s for having sexual relations with a 16-year old girl. In 1957, a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; hearing on organized crime identified him as a racketeer. In 1971 he was convicted on the federal level of running a bingo racket, and received a three year sentence. In the mid-70s, he served two years in custody for a tax evasion that was overturned in an appeal. In 1981, he received a conviction for tax fraud from skimming profits on a night club, and in 1991 he and his son, Frank Jr., were convicted of a similar crime for clubs they ran in &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;.

In January 2008, they both plead guilty for their role in Seattle's &lt;a href="w%3AStrippergate%20%28Seattle%29"&gt;"Strippergate"&lt;/a&gt; campaign-financing scandal which erupted in 2003. The scandal involved funnelling illegal campaign finances through various associates to the re-election campaigns of various &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20City%20Council"&gt;Seattle City Council&lt;/a&gt; members, before a zoning election for a club they owned. The event is what led to the current raids and investigations.

<h1>Denmark blames al-Qaeda for embassy bombing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Denmark%20blames%20al-Qaeda%20for%20embassy%20bombing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Monday, June 2, the &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; embassy in &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, was attacked with a car bomb. The bomb went off in the parking lot of the embassy at around 12:10 pm (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B5"&gt;UTC+5&lt;/a&gt;), killing at least six and wounding at least 30 others. One Danish citizen was killed.

"I think we can say with a reasonable degree of confidence that it was a suicide attack," said &lt;a href="w%3ATariq%20Pervez"&gt;Tariq Pervez&lt;/a&gt;, the director-general of the Pakistani &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Investigation%20Agency"&gt;Federal Investigation Agency&lt;/a&gt; (FIA).

The bomb forced the closure of the Danish embassy, as well as those of &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, which were nearby.
While no group has claimed responsibility, the Danish national security intelligence agency &lt;a href="w%3APolitiets%20Efterretningstjeneste"&gt;PET&lt;/a&gt; has concluded that &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; was behind the attack. "Extremists can be inspired by the attack in Pakistan," said PET's director, Jakob Scharf in a statement.

"We are just trying to find any clue, any evidence," Pakistani investigator Muhammad Mustafa said to the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. "You know yesterday it was panic here. Usually we miss important things in panic."

"Samples have been sent to the laboratory to determine what type of explosive was used," said Mohammad Ashraf Shah, who is in charge of the investigation. Investigators have found that the car with the bomb was a &lt;a href="w%3AToyota%20Corolla"&gt;Toyota Corolla&lt;/a&gt;, which bore diplomatic &lt;a href="w%3Avehicle%20registration%20plate"&gt;license plates&lt;/a&gt;.

"One can of course only condemn it, it's terrible that terrorists commit such acts," said &lt;a href="w%3APer%20Stig%20M%C3%B8ller"&gt;Per Stig Møller&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Minister%20of%20Denmark"&gt;Foreign Minister of Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="w%3ATV%202%20%28Denmark%29"&gt;TV 2&lt;/a&gt; television.

"It was to be expected that they would do something," said Ikram Sehgal to &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, referring to &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;'s recent video encouraging attacks against Denmark over the &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy&lt;/a&gt;.

"I urge and incite every Muslim who can harm Denmark to do so in support of the prophet, God's peace and prayers be upon him, and in defense of his honorable stature," Ayman al-Zawahri said in a video which became public on April 21.

"This attack was not linked to any event in the country or the region, rather it was part of widespread outrage throughout the Islamic world against publishing blasphemous caricatures," a local official told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Times%20%28Pakistan%29"&gt;Daily Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, adding that it would not affect Pakistani negotiations with &lt;a href="Pakistani%20Taliban"&gt;"local" Taliban&lt;/a&gt;, which is considered separate from the &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

England and Australia are set to showdown for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Other interested countries are China, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Qatar and Russia. FIFA President has encourage Spain to bid for the 2018 World Cup. The final decision to decide the host nation(s) will be in 2011.

There will be stiff competition from Australia and England. Football Federation Australia Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Lowy"&gt;Frank Lowy&lt;/a&gt; made it clear how his country definitely intends to make a bid with a strong attempt to win the right to host the event in 2018 while FIFA Vice President &lt;a href="w%3AAustin%20%26quot%3BJack%26quot%3B%20Warner"&gt;Jack Warner&lt;/a&gt; has backed England for 2018.

Jack Warner has supported the United States for 2022 FIFA World Cup damaging their chances for 2018. Also hindering the American bid is the fact that United States Soccer Federation is still considering their options. CONCACAF President Jack Warner was quoted as saying, "My message to the USA -- and they don't have to listen -- is to try to make a deal for 2022, and I'm quite sure that would have universal support," Warner went on to further say, "The kind of discussion I would have between England and the U.S. is, 'Will you support me in 2022?"

There has been no public support for China, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Qatar and Russia.

Doctors performing a &lt;a href="w%3ACaesarian%20section"&gt;Caesarian&lt;/a&gt; delivery in a &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; hospital were stunned to discover a rare &lt;a href="w%3AOvary"&gt;ovarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEctopic%20pregnancy"&gt;ectopic pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;. According to Robin Cahill, general manager of the Darwin Private Hospital, ovarian pregnancies occur in only 1 in every 40,000 fertilisations.
An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg implants in a woman's body in a location other than the uterus. The most common place for an ectopic pregnancy to occur is the &lt;a href="w%3AFallopian%20tubes"&gt;Fallopian tubes&lt;/a&gt;, accounting for roughly 95% of all ectopic pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancies are generally discovered early, especially as they tend to cause bleeding in the mother, and tend to miscarry or be terminated due to the health risks they pose.

The mother, Meera Thangarajah, however, suffered no complications during her pregnancy, and an ultrasound performed mid-way through the pregnancy did not discover the complication. The hospital's obstetrician Andrew Miller says that having an ovarian pregnancy survive to full-term is "unheard of". The British &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20College%20of%20Obstetricians%20and%20Gynaecologists"&gt;Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists&lt;/a&gt; agrees, with a representative saying the odds of a successful ovarian pregnancy are "no more than one in a million", taking into account both the difficulty of bringing such a pregnancy to term and the tendency for the pregnancy to be terminated when it is discovered early.

The baby, a girl, was named Durga, a Hindu name meaning "goddess", and weighed 6 pounds 3 ounces (2.8 kg). The father, Ravi Thangarajah, says that doctors told him he was "one of the luckiest men in the world".

A pipeline rupture and fire at &lt;a href="w%3AApache%20Corporation"&gt;Apache Corporation&lt;/a&gt;'s Varanus Island facility in &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has reduced the supply of &lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; to Western Australia by 30%. 153 employees have been evacuated and 13 employees remain on the island to monitor the situation.

Steven Farris, Apache's president and CEO said "No one was injured, all personnel are safe, and the rupture and fire appear to be contained on the island...At this time, we cannot estimate when throughput will be resumed." The facility was producing approximately 330 million cubic feet(MMcf) of natural gas and 8,000 &lt;a href="w%3ABarrel%20%28volume%29"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3Acrude%20oil"&gt;crude oil&lt;/a&gt; per day, this has been reduced to 200 MMcf and 5,000 barrels per day.

Western Australian Minister for Energy Fran Logan said that residential supplies were unlikely to be affected but has called on Western Australians to conserve the use of natural gas. Minister Logan said that Apache supplies primarily large volume users like &lt;a href="w%3AAlinta%20Gas"&gt;Alinta Gas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlcoa"&gt;Alcoa&lt;/a&gt;, and the major industrial users will be hit the hardest. The aluminum refineries owned by Alcoa, which are dependent on natural gas, have switched to diesel to maintain production. 

Apache representatives, including its managing director Tim Wall and fire experts from &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, are heading to the site to extinguish the fire and assess the damage. Wall said during a news conference in &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; today that a small fire on a vent had already been extinguished. Apache has invoked a clause in its supply contracts to remove liability for unavoidable catastrophes that prevent them from fulfilling obligations under the contract.

&lt;a href="w%3AAgata%20Mr%C3%B3z"&gt;Agata Mróz&lt;/a&gt;, who together with &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;'s national team won the &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an women's volleyball championships in 2003 and 2005, died on June 4 in a &lt;a href="w%3AWroc%C5%82aw"&gt;Wrocław&lt;/a&gt; hospital just two weeks after a bone marrow transplant intended to treat her progressing &lt;a href="w%3Aacute%20myeloid%20leukemia"&gt;acute myeloid leukemia&lt;/a&gt;. She had &lt;a href="w%3Amyelodysplastic%20syndrome"&gt;myelodysplastic syndrome&lt;/a&gt; since childhood.

Polish fans dubbed the national team on which Mróz played the "Golden Girls", both due to their looks and their successes in international competitions.

Her club career had been equally successful, with two Polish and one Spanish championships under her belt.

She gave birth to a daughter two months before her death.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Control and Disciplinary Body has decided that &lt;a href="FC%20Porto"&gt;FC Porto&lt;/a&gt; will not participate in next season's &lt;a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; after its bribery scandal.

UEFA said on their website, "The UEFA Control &amp; Disciplinary Body considered that the offences related to the judgement in &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; corresponded with "an activity aimed at arranging or influencing the outcome of a match," as stated in Article 1.04 (d), and that the condition set out in this provision would therefore not be met by Porto. The decision is open to appeal within three days of the sending of the decision."

FC Porto were also deducted 6 points and received a fine of &lt;a href="euro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;150,000 by the disciplinary committee of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProfessional%20Portuguese%20Football%20League"&gt;Professional Portuguese Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the same incidents.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Flugtag"&gt;Red Bull Flugtag&lt;/a&gt;, an event that is hosted by 55 cities around the world, today returned to &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AHyde%20Park%2C%20London"&gt;Hyde Park&lt;/a&gt; for the second time in the event's history. Wikinews was at the waterside of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Serpentine"&gt;The Serpentine&lt;/a&gt; to report on the events of the day.

<h2>Flugtag Information</h2>

The ticket-only event was last held in London in 2003. This year, 41 teams of inventors will be hoping to scoop one of the prizes on offer, with first prize being a choice of a full set of flying lessons (for one person), a group day out in an aerobatic aeroplane, or &lt;a href="w%3APound%20%28currency%29"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;5,000 (~$10,000 &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;), along with the title of Red Bull Flugtag Champions 2008. Second prize is a choice of gliding lessons for the whole team, or £2,500 (~$5,000 USD). Third prize is a tandem parachute jump for the whole team, or £1,000 (~$2,000 USD).

The teams are required to launch their inventions - some of which are as wacky as a giant &lt;a href="w%3ATrifle"&gt;Trifle&lt;/a&gt; or an aerodynamic toilet - from a 6 &lt;a href="w%3Ametre"&gt;metre&lt;/a&gt; ramp into The Serpentine. The teams are scored based on their distance flown, level of creativity, and entertainment value of their on-ramp pre-flight performance. The judges for this years' competition include ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStrictly%20Come%20Dancing"&gt;Strictly Come Dancing&lt;/a&gt;♡❤’s Craig Revel-Horwood, &lt;a href="w%3Amodel%20%28person%29"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJodie%20Kidd"&gt;Jodie Kidd&lt;/a&gt;, BBC &lt;a href="w%3AFame%20Academy"&gt;Fame Academy&lt;/a&gt; judge &lt;a href="w%3ACarrie%20Grant"&gt;Carrie Grant&lt;/a&gt;, and Red Bull Flugtag London 2003 winner Tim Simpson.

<h2>The Day</h2>

<h3>Report</h3>
♡❤♡♡❤11:00am♡❤♡♡❤
On arrival at the Media Area, with the judges in tow, competitors are preparing for their plunges! The weather is beautiful, and the public have turned out in force for the event. A large ramp dominates one end of the Serpentine, with large screens dotted around the venue.

♡❤♡♡❤11:40am♡❤♡♡❤
The days entertainment has now begun, the large screens now filled with documentaries on the teams, hosts chatting, and team interviews live from the ground. The atmosphere is charged - people are ready for the day, which has turned out beautifully, sunshine with a cool breeze.

♡❤♡♡❤1:00pm♡❤♡♡❤
The first team, the Loo-ny Tunes, are on the ramp, performing their opening performance. Wikinews has a correspondent on The Serpentine to take photographs from a head-on angle, and a correspondent in the media area to bring updates as they happen - watch this space!

♡❤♡♡❤1:05pm♡❤♡♡❤
The Red Bull Flugtag 2008 has officially launched! The first team is ready on the ramp, giant screens displaying camera shots around Hyde Park - the emcees are on the ramp getting the crowd revved up for what promises to be a fantastic day of entertainment and humour. The judges are taking their positions in the pontoons - details of them are above!

♡❤♡♡❤3:00pm♡❤♡♡❤
After a good number of teams, the cloud has started to come in and the weather is getting colder - but that hasn't stopped 80,000 people turning out to watch these truly entertaining performances and nosedives! The scoring system has changed - please see the updated scoreboard below!

We have been treated to some sychronised swimming - undeterred by the building rain and the freezing cold of the Serpentine. The judges are currently showing off their bribes - including balloon sculptures, t-shirts, and alcohol!

♡❤♡♡❤4:00pm♡❤♡♡❤
As the next team plunges off the ramp, doing a backflip as they go, and with angels falling into the Serpentine, we reach the halfway point. The rain is holding off for now, although a cold breeze has come along. Wikinews is stationed inside the Media Area on the South bank of the Serpentine, with a perfect view of the ramp and a reply screen next to us - and we have a photographer out and around the site. More photos will be available after the event - as our bandwidth is limited here.

♡❤♡♡❤4:30pm♡❤♡♡❤
We have just had the longest distance flown today by The Cullinan Bird, gaining the maximum 30 points for distance (15 metres, however the glider flew much further than that).

♡❤♡♡❤5:05pm♡❤♡♡❤
The show is currently on hold due to a problem in the lake - they are unable to retrieve one of the flying machines. We are being treated to a kite show with music - and the crowd has a chance to use the extensive on-site facilities!

♡❤♡♡❤6:15pm♡❤♡♡❤
As the last competitors start plunging off the ramp, it's time for Wikinews to leave the scene! Below are the final scores that we caught with 5 competitors left to take the dive.

Bayern Munich have signed former Germany International Goalkeeper Hans-Jörg Butt to a 2 year contract. Butt played in Portugal last season for Benfica. The deal means Bayern Munich have successfully completed their search for a new back-up goalkeeper for new Number One Goalkeeper Michael Rensing.

Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said, "We’re very pleased with this transfer, as Hans-Jörg Butt’s international experience fits our requirements exactly." Rummenigge went on to further say, "We want Hans-Jörg Butt to support the development of our young goalkeeper Michael Rensing, and he’s looking forward to this task at Bayern Munich."

Hans-Jörg Butt contested the 2001-02 Champions League final with Bayer Leverkusen where they fell 2-1 to Real Madrid.

<h3>Police: Theft of railway track could have cause crash</h3>

Police have claimed that the theft of 171 tonnes of railway tacks from a train line between London and Wales could have resulted in a serious crash. “A piece of railtrack could have struck a passing train and caused a serious rail crash, but fortunately this did not happen,” said the local police, in a statement. Anthony Porretta recently pleaded guilty of the theft at &lt;a href="w%3ABristol%20Crown%20Court"&gt;Bristol Crown Court&lt;/a&gt;.

On May 27, 2008, in &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, a woman stole two 14-&lt;a href="w%3Akarat"&gt;karat&lt;/a&gt; gold bracelets from a &lt;a href="w%3Apawn%20shop"&gt;pawn shop&lt;/a&gt; by swallowing them, as shown by a surveillance tape. The bracelets were worth &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;2000 each according to the pawn shop.

The clerk noticed the bracelets were missing minutes after she had swallowed them and asked the woman for an explanation. She responded, "You can search me." The bracelets were not found. It was only clear who the thief was after the shop reviewed the surveillance footage.

Norma Porchas-Robles, 41, who had been a regular customer at the shop for over four years, has been charged with retail theft and will appear in court June 19. The pawn shop, however, must continue to do business with her, as she had pawned several items which have not yet been sold.

Public interest groups complained in November 2007 to the FCC that Comcast had specifically targeted customers using applications that made use of the &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; system, a popular form of file sharing. &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Press%20%28organization%29"&gt;Free Press&lt;/a&gt;, an advocacy group that pushes for better oversight of cable operators such as Comcast, stated that Comcast practices were discriminatory towards users of the legal technology. "The cable companies see a hammer hovering above their heads and are scrambling to find ways to reduce the appearance of wrongdoing," said &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Scott"&gt;Ben Scott&lt;/a&gt;, head of the group.

According to Roger Entner, a senior vice president from Nielsen IAG, as little as 5 percent of all Internet users may consume as much as 50 percent of all the bandwidth on the Internet. "This is the politically correct version of doing what Comcast had been doing before, though it takes the &lt;a href="w%3ABandwidth%20%28computing%29"&gt;occasional&lt;/a&gt; [peer-to-peer] user off the hook," Entner said. Sena Fitzmaurice, a Comcast spokesperson, said, "This says we won't be looking at what type of traffic that there is, even though we still need to manage the network."

Comcast's tests are expected to begin in &lt;a href="w%3AChambersburg%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Chambersburg, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWarrenton%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Warrenton, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.

While Comcast will attempt to throttle the speed of all its high-volume users, Time Warner Cable intends to use a different method. They will meter and bill clients, charging more money for faster speeds and larger amounts of transmitted data, functioning more like a traditional public utility, such as an electric company or cell phone service. Their metered billing test will begin on June 5 in &lt;a href="w%3ABeaumont%2C%20Texas"&gt;Beaumont, Texas&lt;/a&gt; for newly enrolled customers. "Instead of raising prices across the board, consumers who are excessive users would pay," said Alex Dudley, a Time Warner Cable spokesman. "It is clearly the fairest way to fund the investment that is going to be required to support that use."

An &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; report that Time Warner Cable will bill customers between $29.95 to $54.90USD per month has been confirmed by the cable operator, with clients charged an extra $1 for each &lt;a href="w%3Agigabyte"&gt;gigabyte&lt;/a&gt; (GB) by which they exceed their purchased plan. Art Brodsky, communications director of &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Knowledge"&gt;Public Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, a consumer advocacy group in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, has expressed concerns about the Time Warner Cable plan. Time Warner Cable's most expensive offering, $54.90, comes with 15 megabits-per-second of data transfer speed and a 40 gigabyte limit on total data transfer.

"An HD (&lt;a href="w%3AHigh-definition%20video"&gt;high-definition&lt;/a&gt;) movie is 8GB or so, three movies is more than half your allowance for a month, and heaven knows what else you might want to watch," Brodsky says. "This is not a relieving congestion scheme as much as it is a rationing scheme. All it does is protect an inadequate infrastructure from the cable company."

The &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Red%20Wings"&gt;Detroit Red Wings&lt;/a&gt; won their 11th &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Cup"&gt;Stanley Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (NHL) history on Wednesday. The Red Wings won the sixth game of the championship finals by a 3-2 score against the &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AMellon%20Arena"&gt;Mellon Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AConn%20Smythe%20Trophy"&gt;Conn Smythe Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, an individual player award, was presented to &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Zetterberg"&gt;Henrik Zetterberg&lt;/a&gt;.

Pittsburgh last won the Stanley Cup in 1992 and was seeking its third Cup in the playoffs. The Stanley Cup is the most prominent contest in North American &lt;a href="w%3AIce%20hockey"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Game synopsis</h3>

Detroit's &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Rafalski"&gt;Brian Rafalski&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal in the first period. The Red Wings increased their lead with another goal in the second period by &lt;a href="w%3AValtteri%20Filppula"&gt;Valtteri Filppula&lt;/a&gt;. Pittsburgh's &lt;a href="w%3AEvgeni%20Malkin"&gt;Evgeni Malkin&lt;/a&gt; scored Pittsburgh's first goal of the game, also in the second period.

In the third period, &lt;a href="w%3AHenrik%20Zetterberg"&gt;Henrik Zetterberg&lt;/a&gt; earned Detroit's third goal of the game. In the final two minutes, Pittsburgh's &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Gonchar"&gt;Sergei Gonchar&lt;/a&gt; reduced Detroit's lead to 3-2, but the Penguins could not force a tie at the end.

On June 4, a report published by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) showed that in the past 16 years high school students have become less likely to engage in health risk-related behaviors such as having sex and taking drugs. However, the CDC found that &lt;a href="w%3AHispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans"&gt;Hispanic&lt;/a&gt; students were less likely to have reduced risky behavior when compared to &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20American"&gt;White&lt;/a&gt; students in several key areas.

The National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is run by the CDC every two years, and is an anonymous, self-administered survey of students in grades 9 to 12. In the 2007 YRBS, over 14,000 students were surveyed from across 44 U.S. states, 5 territories, and several individual school districts. The combined statistics used results from 39 states and 22 large urban school districts.

The survey showed that males were more likely than females to engage in most behaviors involving violence or risk of unintentional injury, including driving while drinking &lt;a href="w%3Aalcohol"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, carrying a weapon, and being involved in a physical fight, although females were more likely to have contemplated or attempted suicide. Males were also more likely to have smoked &lt;a href="w%3Atobacco"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ACannabis%20%28drug%29"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;, engaged in &lt;a href="w%3Abinge%20drinking"&gt;heavy drinking&lt;/a&gt;, or engaged in sexual intercourse, while females were more likely to have fasted for 24 hours or more, vomited or taken &lt;a href="w%3Alaxative"&gt;laxative&lt;/a&gt;s in order to lose weight.

While the proportions of White and Black students who had ever had sexual intercourse, and who had had sex with four or more partners in their lifetimes, all dropped over the period 1991-2007, there was no change in either of these statistics for the Hispanic population. Compared to their counterparts in the 1990s however, Hispanic students in 2007 were found to be more likely to have used a condom during their most recent sexual intercourse, and less likely to have consumed drugs such as cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana.

Hispanic students were more likely than White or Black students to go without food for 24 hours to lose weight, to take drugs such as heroin or cocaine, to drink alcohol on school property, and to have avoided school on occasion because of safety concerns.

In comparison with previous YRBS results, the survey found that the percentage of students who had ever had sexual intercourse decreased from 54.1% in 1991 to 47.8% in 2007, with a comparable decrease in the percentage who had had four or more sexual partners, from 18.7% to 14.9%. Decreases were also found in the percentage of students who had attempted suicide, who rode in a car with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and who had smoked marijuana in the past month, but an increase in the percentage who had avoided school on occasion because of safety concerns (from 4.4% in 1993 to 5.5% in 2007).

"We are pleased that more high school students today are doing things that will help them stay healthy and avoiding things that put their health in danger. Unfortunately we are not seeing that same progress among Hispanic teens for certain risk factors," said Howell Wechsler, Ed.D., MPH, director of CDC’s Division of Adolescent and School Health.

<h1>Japan's Supreme Court invalidates distinctions on nationality</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Japan%27s%20Supreme%20Court%20invalidates%20distinctions%20on%20nationality&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20Japan"&gt;Supreme Court of Japan&lt;/a&gt; ruled on Wednesday that a condition imposed by an Act for acquiring Japanese nationality is unconstitutional, and confirmed the nationality of the plaintiffs. Each of the ten plaintiffs is a child who was born to a Filipino mother and later acknowledged by a Japanese father. They filed claims for Japanese nationality between 2003 and 2005, but the government turned down because the parents were not legally married in each case. 

According to Japan's Act on nationality, a non-Japanese child (under 20) who was after its birth legitimated by marriage and acknowledgment can acquire Japanese nationality by filing notification, with some requirements which the plaintiffs had already fulfilled. 

The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the condition '&lt;a href="w%3ALegitimacy%20%28law%29"&gt;legitimated&lt;/a&gt; by marriage' results in unreasonable distinctions to violate Article 14 of the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Japan"&gt;Constitution of Japan&lt;/a&gt;, which guarantees equality under the law. The Supreme Court left effective the rest of this provision and accepted the plaintiffs' claims for Japanese nationality. The judgment pointed out recent changes in people's notions in Japan as to family life or parent-child relationship, and also referred to two conventions which Japan has ratified. 

There are estimated to be tens of thousands of children in similar situations in Japan and a considerable number overseas. 

Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura on Wednesday made a comment about the judgment at a press conference. Machimura said, "This judgment, saying violation of Constitution, weighs so much. As a government, we should take it gravely, and we want to examine its content in detail and consider how to react." He added, "I have an impression, just hearing of it, that it's a reasonable judgment. Equality under the law is an important point of view." 

The ten plaintiffs filed their appeals through lawyers after Tokyo High Court dismissed their claims in February, 2007. 

Wednesday's judgment was a major opinion of ten among fifteen judges. The five dissenting thought more highly of the legislative power of the &lt;a href="w%3ADiet%20of%20Japan"&gt;Diet&lt;/a&gt;. (See the table below.) 

The judgment is to say: 

One judge in the majority, who supported the conclusion, shared a view with the five dissenting: the distinction as to legitimacy is caused by non-existence of due legislation. This judge concluded that the Judiciary can remedy the lack, because it doesn't betray the will of the Legislation of the Diet as to this Act. 

Two dissenting judges of the five concluded that these distinctions are unconstitutional, but correction of it depends, in principle, on legislative measures by the Diet. 

The other opinion of three dissenting judges is contrary to the major opinion. They argued, for example,

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANambour%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Nambour, Queensland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Reigning Sunshine Coast Schoolboys Premier 1st XV champions have squeezed past Nambour Christian College seven points to five at the Nambour Rugby Club on Wednesday. They had qualified for the semi finals prior to the round.

The match was moved from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20the%20Sunshine%20Coast"&gt;University&lt;/a&gt; due to the recent wet weather causing the ground to be water logged.

Grammar scored a converted try half way through the first half. Seven - nil. It remained that way at half time.

Ten minutes in the second, Nambour were able to score out wide but failed to convert. Seven - five. They fought hard in the next ten, but failed to capitalise on opportunities they created and Grammar mistakes. Nambour did not get another such opportunity after that.
Grammar now play minor premiers &lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20Creek%20State%20High%20School"&gt;Mountain Creek State High School&lt;/a&gt; in a rematch of their 2007 semi final, while &lt;a href="w%3ASiena%20Catholic%20College"&gt;Siena Catholic College&lt;/a&gt; will host &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Flinders%20Anglican%20College"&gt;Matthew Flinders Anglican College&lt;/a&gt; in the other semi.

Several news organizations have reported that Hillary Clinton will suspend her campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination on Saturday.

In an email sent to Clinton supporters, she said that she would like to "extend my congratulations to Senator Obama."

This announcement made by the Clinton team comes as Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, says that he is 'honored' to be the nominee in the election.

<h2>US and UK diplomats detained in Zimbabwe</h2>
United States and United Kingdom diplomatic staff were detained in Zimbabwe, according to US ambassador James D. McGee. They have now been released, say spokespeople from both the British and American embassies.

Ambassador McGee spoke in an interview on CNN: "Police put up a roadblock, stopped the vehicles, slashed the tires, reached in and grabbed telephones from my personnel, and the war veterans threatened to burn the vehicles with my people inside unless they got out and accompanied police to a station nearby."

The ambassador said that the incident was a serious breach of diplomatic protocols. "We do believe this is coming directly from the top," he added.

A driver working for the US embassy was beaten up by the veterans, who are often used by the ZANU-PF (the ruling political party) to intimidate political opponents. They were also used as shock troops in the government's ouster of white farm owners.

Zimbabwe's Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga told the press that the diplomats were detained because they had tried to flee a roadblock and had refused to comply with police. He also refuted the claims that an embassy employee was beaten and that tires were slashed.

Just yesterday, police temporarily detained opposistion leader Morgan Tsvangirai (MDC), who is running against President Robert Mugabe in a run-off election on June 27.

Tsvangirai resumed his campaign today. "Our resolve for a new beginning, and a new Zimbabwe remains unshaken," he said.

<h2>Indian 'guru' faces charges of fraud, drugs and rape</h2>
A spiritual guru known as "Swami Amritachaitanya" is being held in Kerala, India on charges of fraud, rape and possession of narcotic drugs. Swami Amritachaitanya, whose real name is Santosh Madhavan, was arrested by Interpol in March on criminal charges in a police raid at his 16-suite ashram in Kochi, India following multiple police complaints against him. Indians living in Bahrain have recently come forward and filed a case against Madhavan in India on allegations of fraudulent practices related to his supposed charity activities.

"Twenty of us have e-mailed a complaint to the Inspector General and Commissioner of Ernakulam police as well as Kerala Home Minister," said complainant Jaya Kumar in a statement to the Gulf Daily News. Ernakulam is a district in the state of Kerala in India. "He was very convincing about his charity activities as well as the resort," said Kumar, a purchasing officer at a company in Bahrain.

Police began an investigation into Madhavan in April after a woman filed a complaint alleging he had promised to start a business with her after a meeting in Dubai, but she said he disappeared after she gave him the money.

<h2>NHL: Detroit wins the 2008 Stanley Cup</h2>

While nearly all coverage of the &lt;a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Presidential election&lt;/a&gt; has focused on the Democratic and Republican candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third-party candidates.

The opening day of COMPUTEX 2008, e21FORUM was held at the Taipei International Convention Center on June 3 to forecast the future of &lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20communication%20technology"&gt;ICT&lt;/a&gt; industry world-wide. To connect with the topic of "&lt;a href="w%3AWiMAX"&gt;WiMAX&lt;/a&gt;" mainly promoted by Taipei Computer Association, e21MagicMedia, convener of e21FORUM, entitled the forum topic as "Leading to a Bright Future with Technology".

Since the e21FORUM was initially held from 2001, the dialogue between &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; became a key topic in this event. This year, executives from Microsoft and Intel confronted here again.

In the opening keynote, &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20Maloney%20%28technology%29"&gt;Sean M. Maloney&lt;/a&gt;, Executive Vice President of Intel Corporation, started his speech to forecast the future of WiMAX. "WiMAX will become a must-have trend. When it matured[sic], it will bring on the utilization percentages on mobile devices like &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20Internet%20Device%20%28Intel%29"&gt;MID&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUMPC"&gt;UMPC&lt;/a&gt;." stated Maloney. In addition, he also demonstrated the application of &lt;a href="w%3ASolid-state%20drive"&gt;SSD&lt;/a&gt; by shocking and stunning its device to prove its sustainability and damage-proof in front of forum participants.

On the other hand, Microsoft participated in the COMPUTEX 2008 entitled "It's better with Windows" to demonstrate the advantages of &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; with "Trusted", "Familiar", and "Compatible". In the second keynote, Steven Guggenheimer, Vice President of Microsoft Global OEM Department, explained the opportunities which &lt;a href="w%3AOriginal%20equipment%20manufacturer"&gt;OEMs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOriginal%20design%20manufacturer"&gt;ODMs&lt;/a&gt; can provide to elevate users' experiences by optimizing Microsoft Windows to the best performance.

Finally in the executive panel, &lt;a href="w%3ADigiTimes"&gt;DigiTimes&lt;/a&gt; and experts from ICT industry in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; forecast the future of WiMAX. Executives coordinately commented that the basic infrastructure will be a critical factor when developing the WiMAX applications in Taiwan.

Taiwan Electromagnetic Radiation Hazard Protection and Control Association (TEPCA), an environmental organization set to promote environmental hazard warnings on &lt;a href="w%3Aelectromagnetic%20radiation"&gt;electromagnetic radiation&lt;/a&gt;, protested over the potential health impact of electromagnetic radiation as &lt;a href="w%3AMa%20Ying-jeou"&gt;Ying-jeou Ma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;President of the Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, visited this show on the 2nd Day of 2008 WiMAX Expo Taipei (June 3).

"Base stations of WiMAX are unnecessary in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;! The governmental people didn't care about the living and health of the public!" strongly stated Jiau-hua Chen, Chairman of TEPCA during the protest.

The on-site rate of electromagnetic radiation was firmly higher than the international standards as some experts examined at the showground, according to the Taiwan Hakka Television. In addition, the TEPCA strongly appealed the governments and organizers to announce the place of base stations for health and safety issue.

As a result of the protest, not only the information security, but also environmentalists disputed the future of WiMAX.

To challenge the possibility of &lt;a href="w%3AWiMAX"&gt;WiMAX&lt;/a&gt; connection on high speed rails, &lt;a href="w%3AIndustrial%20Technology%20Research%20Institute"&gt;Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20High%20Speed%20Rail"&gt;Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC)&lt;/a&gt; started an experiment on Mobile WiMAX technology for the THSR. It's the first-ever WiMAX experiment on high speed rails in the world. Industrial companies including Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Broadband Platform Inc., &lt;a href="w%3ANippon%20Telegraph%20and%20Telephone"&gt;Nippon Telegraph and Telephone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACorning%20Incorporated"&gt;Corning Incorporated&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AZyXEL"&gt;ZyXEL&lt;/a&gt; are confirmed to provide solutions in this first-ever experiment.

"THSR is a must-have transportation way for the public besides of inter-city buses and railways in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;." stated THSRC. "There are three critical difficulties that this experiment should be overcome: 'Speed of the THSR', 'Base station construction inside the rails', and the most important one - 'Internet connection on tunnels'." stated ITRI.

"If this [difficult] experiment can be succeeded, Taiwan will become the first nation to provide the Internet connection on high speed rails in the world." said by Moses Yen, Director of Exhibition Department of &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;Taiwan External Trade Development Council&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; national team's right winger &lt;a href="w%3AJakub%20B%C5%82aszczykowski"&gt;Jakub Błaszczykowski&lt;/a&gt; was ruled out of the &lt;a href="Euro%202008"&gt;Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; soccer championships late on &lt;a href="w%3AJune%205"&gt;June 5&lt;/a&gt;, less than three days before Poland is to take on &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; in its tournament opener. Błaszczykowski, who in his club career plays for &lt;a href="w%3ABorussia%20Dortmund"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt;, renewed a hamstring strain he suffered in mid-season. 

His withdrawal leaves Poland's coach &lt;a href="w%3ALeo%20Beenhakker"&gt;Leo Beenhakker&lt;/a&gt; with a serious selection headache to solve. So far he has not said how he would patch the resulting hole in his right wing.

<h3>Five scuba divers missing near Indonesia</h3>
Five European scuba divers remain missing after being swept away by a huge wave off the coast of Indonesia. The divers are from the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. They have been missing for over 24 hours.

The divers were last seen in &lt;a href="w%3AKomodo%20National%20Park"&gt;Komodo National Park&lt;/a&gt;, in an area known for being quite dangerous. The national park is very popular within the diving community. 

The rescue attempt has had no success, partly due to the lack of fuel that is available for the search aircraft. The navy has also joined the search.

<h3>Climate bill blocked by US Senate</h3>
The &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt; today blocked a bill which required the US to reduce its level of carbon emissions. This failure in the Senate is partly due to the fact that many politicians believed that passing the bill would result in higher energy prices. Despite the failure in the Senate, both US presidential candidates, &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, supported the bill.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones"&gt;Dow Jones&lt;/a&gt; industrials lost more than 400 points on the day today after news of record high oil prices and an increase in unemployment.

Friday's nearly &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;11 per barrel increase in the July contract for crude oil on the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mercantile%20Exchange"&gt;New York Mercantile Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (NYMEX) is the largest singe-day increase in oil price history. The July contract hit $139.12, breaking the previous record. The July contract settled at $138.54, also a new record. The previous record for the July contract was $135.09 and was set on May 22. Trading in the July contract terminates on June 20.

Stephen Schork, an oil industry analyst and editor of the "Schork Report," said, "The bulls are running rampant and the bears have panicked...It's pure hysteria, absolute panic."

&lt;a href="w%3AMorgan%20Stanley"&gt;Morgan Stanley&lt;/a&gt; oil analyst, Ole Slorer, released a report this morning saying that he expected a "short-term spike in oil prices," as high as $150 a barrel by mid-July.

Adding to the concerns of oil traders was a statement by Deputy Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AShaul%20Mofaz"&gt;Shaul Mofaz&lt;/a&gt; told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AYediot%20Ahronot"&gt;Yediot Ahronot&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the most widely circulated paper in &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; that "If Iran continues its program to develop nuclear weapons, we will attack it." Mofaz is considered a candidate as the next &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Israel"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;.

The average price for regular unleaded gasoline has already passed the $4 a gallon mark in 12 states, as well as in Washington, D.C., according to &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican_Automobile_Association"&gt;AAA&lt;/a&gt;.

Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited_States_Department_of_Labor"&gt;Labor Department&lt;/a&gt; reported Friday that the unemployment rate rose to 5.5% last month. This was an increase from the 5% rate in April, and was the biggest monthly jump in more than two decades. Wall Street had only predicted an uptick to 5.1% for the month. 

According to the Labor Department, 49,000 jobs were lost in May, adding to four straight month of job losses.

The Dow was not the only stock that fell today, the &lt;a href="w%3AS%2526P_500"&gt;Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index&lt;/a&gt; lost 43.37, or 3.09 percent, and the &lt;a href="w%3ANasdaq"&gt;Nasdaq composite index&lt;/a&gt; fell 75.38, or 2.96 percent.

Also today, the American &lt;a href="w%3Aunited%20states%20dollar"&gt;dollar&lt;/a&gt; declined against other major currencies, including the &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>US B-2 bomber crash in Guam caused by moisture on sensors</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20B-2%20bomber%20crash%20in%20Guam%20caused%20by%20moisture%20on%20sensors&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The final report into the crash of a &lt;a href="w%3AB-2%20Spirit"&gt;B-2 Spirit&lt;/a&gt; bomber belonging to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; (USAF) in &lt;a href="Guam"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt; has determined that the crash was caused by moisture on sensors which caused the jet to receive inaccurate data. It was the first loss of a B-2, which costs &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1.4 billion.

The aircraft, belonging to USAF's 509th Air Wing and carrying the name ♡❤Spirit of Kansas♡❤, was attempting takeoff from &lt;a href="w%3AAndersen%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Andersen Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; on February 23 this year when the crash occurred. Moisture in three of the 24 air pressure sensors caused the sensors, all on the port side, to feed back inaccurate data to the flight computer.

The aircraft crew believed the bomber had reached the takeoff speed of 140 knots when in reality it was traveling ten knots slower and rotated for takeoff. The malfunction also meant that the sensors showed the plane to be in a nose down position, causing it to command a high level of pitch, around 30 degrees. This, combined with the low takeoff speed, caused the aircraft to &lt;a href="w%3AAerodynamic%20stall"&gt;stall&lt;/a&gt; and veer to the left.

Major Ryan Link and Captain Justin Grieve, who were piloting, ejected as the left wingtip struck the ground. They were injured, with Grieve suffering &lt;a href="w%3Acompression%20fracture"&gt;compression fractures&lt;/a&gt; to his spine, but survived. The wreckage came to rest to the runway's left.

The report also noted that more effective communications could have prevented the crash. The vulnerability of the sensors to moisture was first detected by aircrews and maintenance staff in 2006, at which time it was discovered that turning on the 500 degree &lt;a href="w%3APitot-static%20system"&gt;pitot&lt;/a&gt; heat prior to sensor calibration would evaporate the water and cause a return to normal readings. However, this was never formally noted and so the pilots of the aircraft were unaware of the potential problem or its solution.

They were also unaware that, at an earlier time at the same base, another B-2's takeoff roll was aborted at 70 knots due to abnormal indications. After inspection by maintenance personnel, it was determined that moisture in the sensor system was to blame. After turning on the pitot heat the aircraft took off without incident.

<h1>Wikinews interviews manager of site 'Lose The Game'</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikinews%20interviews%20manager%20of%20site%20%27Lose%20The%20Game%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Jonty Haywood is responsible for the entire site Lose The Game at losethegame.com; a site dedicated to informing the masses about a game called "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Game%20%28mind%20game%29"&gt;The Game&lt;/a&gt;" which Haywood says is widely spreading and popular game. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤♡ &lt;a href="Gabriel%20Pollard"&gt;Gabriel Pollard&lt;/a&gt; talked to Haywood via email while constantly losing The Game.

The rules of The Game are simple and easy enough to remember with only three basic rules. While there are variations of the rules spread across Internet just as The Game itself has spread, Haywood plays by these rules:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. Rule 1: You are playing The Game.
BULLET::::2. Rule 2: Whenever you think about The Game, you lose.
BULLET::::3. Rule 3: Loss must be announced.

</ol>
One variation of the rules is including a grace period where a player has a certain amount of time in which to forget about The Game ranging from mere minutes to half an hour. However, Haywood says that a grace period is unnecessary.

Haywood says many people are playing The Game which takes advantage of the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Bear%20Phenomenon"&gt;White Bear Phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;. The Cornwall, United Kingdom-resident has experienced people playing The Game on his worldwide travels, he has even experienced an American announcing loss at a cinema in Bangkok, Thailand.

"When I first went to university in Cambridge, a year after hearing about The Game in Cornwall, many people already knew about The Game, especially people from London."

"The number of active players is certainly in the millions, if not tens of millions," Haywood says, based on the fact that he has had 500,000 unique hits to his website, "50,000 members of the biggest Game Facebook group." Newspaper articles, radio mentions and webcomics featuring The Game are more reasons for the assertions of its popularity Haywood says.

"In my experience The Game spreads among a group of friends, eventually reaching the Internet and makes it to a new group of friends, etc.

"In addition, many people play actively by trying to make lots of other people lose The Game, often by initiating new players."

Even though many people play The Game, its history cannot be accurately retold. Haywood first heard of the game in 2001 and while there are some Internet posts relating to The Game that date back to 2002, one person from London with claims to being the maker of The Game says he made it in 1996 with the "aim of annoying as many people as possible." Haywood says this London-origin story is the only claim that has "any kind of evidence". But he does say that he prefers to think that someone "discovered" The Game, and not invented it. "It’s always been there, just waiting for someone to realise that they are playing, and hence lose."

Despite running a popular site about The Game - which has something "big" coming up and will be announced in the next few weeks - Haywood himself gets annoyed and irritated at The Game "all the time" and his losses range anywhere from days at a time to mere hours in between losses depending on the social situation. The Game is still fun to play however, he says, because of the distress you can cause on other people. "Although you can’t be aware that you are winning The Game, it is still fun when your friends lose before you, or more than you. Even more fun is when they lose because of something you previously set-up, or an association you tried to make them make.

"I think it’s a much more interesting game than it may first appear. It’s also very abstract and a little thought-provoking, and it’s good to see lots of young people enjoying it."

And for those who wish to lose less often, Haywood has some "strategies". "One involves trying to feel very annoyed after losing, with the hope that you will subconsciously learn not to lose like this. The other is to hit yourself when you lose, with a similar purpose," he says. "Unfortunately, almost every strategy we have tried so far has backfired spectacularly."

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australian&lt;/a&gt; Master Builders Association (MBA) yesterday demanded the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGovernment%20of%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Carpenter Government&lt;/a&gt; call an emergency cabinet meeting to avoid a "state of emergency" over the energy crisis gripping WA. A MBA spokesperson said that hundreds of workers have already been stood down, many without pay, and that the cost of building material is soaring.

The Minister for Energy, Fran Logan has admitted that the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANatural%20Gas"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt; shortage caused by Tuesday's fire is damaging the economy as mining, manufacturing and construction industries wind back operations. Western Australia's two major brick producing companies have shut operations and Wesbeam's $A100 million Neerabup pine production facility has been closed, their 130 employees have been stood down.

Wesbeam chief executive James Malone said, "It's an industrial tsunami in my view. It's a little ripple that has very quickly had a huge multiplying effect on the whole community".

Michael McLean, Master Building Association director said "It's a worst-nightmare scenario, and not one we could have imagined in our wildest dreams," building supplies are expected to start running out by the middle of next week. 

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3APremier%20of%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAlan%20Carpenter"&gt;Carpenter&lt;/a&gt; has announced a meeting of ministers and industry representatives to take place on Sunday to discuss solutions to the growing crisis. Tim Wall, managing director of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AApache%20Corporation"&gt;Apache Corporation&lt;/a&gt; has said Apache is conducting a worldwide search for the parts need to repair the pipeline.

Major mining companies and Apache partners &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABHP%20Billiton"&gt;BHP Billiton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ARio%20Tinto%20Group"&gt;Rio Tinto&lt;/a&gt; have already reported they are suffering with the loss of gas supply; the Chamber of Minerals and Energy has talked down the effect saying that they don't expect the crisis to take the heat off the booming mining industry.
Opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ATroy%20Buswell"&gt;Troy Buswell&lt;/a&gt; has describe the performance of Fran Logan as "absolutely dismal" noting that Mr Logan had experienced a similar incident in January this year, when a fire at &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWoodside%20Petroluem"&gt;Woodsides&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AKarratha%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Karratha&lt;/a&gt; operations had a similar effect.

&lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n politicians met at the 2008 &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Economic%20Forum"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; on Africa, where they discussed a variety of issues, including the current situation in &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASimba%20Makoni"&gt;Simba Makoni&lt;/a&gt;, a former finance minister in Zimbabwe, said the chance of a free election in Zimbabwe was low: “Conditions have been created in the country as a whole, but particularly in the rural areas, where there is no prospect of any semblance of a free and fair election.”

The Secretary General of the main opposition party in Zimbabwe, the &lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20for%20Democratic%20Change"&gt;Movement for Democratic Change&lt;/a&gt;, also criticized the upcoming elections, saying that they were “merely legitimizing the &lt;a href="w%3Akleptocracy"&gt;kleptocracy&lt;/a&gt;.”

He continued his speech to the forum. "The regime is increasing the decibels of insanity. At every level it is telling the international community in a loud and clear voice that it is not prepared to play by the rules, it is not prepared to listen to logic, and most importantly it is not prepared to listen to democracy and the voice of its people.”

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Star"&gt;Daily Star&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a &lt;a href="w%3Atabloid%20newspaper"&gt;tabloid newspaper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, has paid an undisclosed amount of &lt;a href="w%3Alibel"&gt;libel&lt;/a&gt; damages to &lt;a href="w%3AOzzy%20Osbourne"&gt;Ozzy Osbourne&lt;/a&gt; stemming from an inaccurate representation of his appearance at the &lt;a href="w%3ABrit%20Awards"&gt;Brit Awards&lt;/a&gt;.

Osbourne, famous for both his solo &lt;a href="w%3Arock%20music"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; career and fronting the &lt;a href="w%3Aheavy%20metal"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sabbath"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt;, was hosting the show alongside wife &lt;a href="w%3ASharon%20Osbourne"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and children &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Osbourne"&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKelly%20Osbourne"&gt;Kelly&lt;/a&gt;. In an ensuing ♡❤Star♡❤ article titled "Ozzy Freak Show", the 59-year old was portrayed as suffering from health problems that rendered his ability to host the show questionable.

The article claimed that he had collapsed twice before the show began, prompting the show's organisers to enter emergency talks debating whether Osbourne was fit to continue as planned or instead should be withdrawn and hospitalised. It also reported that the singer had used an electric buggy to move around behind the scenes and had been designated a place to sit in case he felt tired. All of these allegations were found to be false.

At the settlement in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%27s%20High%20Court"&gt;London's High Court&lt;/a&gt;, at which the Osbournes were not present, Kate Wilson, representing &lt;a href="w%3AExpress%20Newspapers"&gt;Express Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;, apologised for the article and accepted that it should never have been published. Express Newspapers owns the ♡❤Daily Star♡❤.

Osbourne says that the money will go to his wife's charity, the &lt;a href="w%3ASharon%20Osbourne%20Colon%20Cancer%20Program"&gt;Sharon Osbourne Colon Cancer Program&lt;/a&gt;.

Three workers have died after an explosion and fire at a &lt;a href="w%3AReliance%20Industries"&gt;Reliance Industries&lt;/a&gt; petrochemical plant in &lt;a href="w%3ANagothana"&gt;Nagothana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaharashtra"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.

The fire broke out shortly after 11 a.m. in one of the facility's two &lt;a href="w%3Alinear%20low%20density%20poly-ethylene"&gt;linear low density poly-ethylene&lt;/a&gt; (LLDPE) units. The unit, which has a 60,000 tonne per anum (TPA) capacity, had been shut down 24 hours before the accident for maintenance. Several people were injured as well as the three who were killed.

There are four production units at the plant, including another LLDPE unit with a 100,000 TPA capacity. None of these were affected by the fire, which was extuinguished within minutes without material loss, and production and supply of goods will not be affected.

An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the accident.

Trevor Wilkinson, who founded the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; performance car manufacturer &lt;a href="w%3ATVR"&gt;TVR&lt;/a&gt; has died at his home in &lt;a href="w%3AMinorca"&gt;Minorca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. He was 85.

Wilkinson, from &lt;a href="w%3ABlackpool"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt;, left education at 14, getting an apprenticeship at a local garage. In 1946 he bought a local wheelwright's business, which he renamed Trevcar Motors, which sold and repaired cars, as well as undertaking light engineering work.

He built his first car the following year. It was a two-seater based on an &lt;a href="w%3AAlvis%20Firebird"&gt;Alvis Firebird&lt;/a&gt; chassis for his own use. He then formed TVR Engineering, the name derived from his own - TreVoR. The first TVR was unveiled in 1949. It was a two-seater with an alloy body and a multi-tubular steel chassis.

The first production TVR was initially called simply the 'Mark I', but became known as the &lt;a href="w%3ATVR%20Grantura"&gt;Grantura&lt;/a&gt;. This M-type glass fibre bodied car was to remain in production, in a modified form, until 1980, when it was replaced by the &lt;a href="w%3ATVR%20Tasmin"&gt;Tasmin&lt;/a&gt;, which had an angular wedge design.

Wilkinson himself left TVR in 1962 to form another engineering business, which specialised in glass fibre construction. He moved to Minorca after retiring.

The TVR Car Club website announced yesterday that he had died in Spain. The news was confirmed by a spokeswoman for Minorca's Mateu Orfila Hospital. According to the TVR Car Club's site "He was aware of the serious nature of his final illness but, according to a friend, took it in stoical fashion that was typical of the man."

Kivimetsän Druidi‏ is a &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; female-fronted band formed in 2002 whose music is a &lt;a href="w%3Afusion%20genre"&gt;fusion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3Asymphonic%20metal"&gt;symphonic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Afantasy%20metal"&gt;fantasy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Afolk%20metal"&gt;folk metal&lt;/a&gt;, which the band's website dubs 'Rock 'N' Troll'.

Brothers Joni and Antti Koskinen formed the band in &lt;a href="w%3AKouvola"&gt;Kouvola&lt;/a&gt; with Joni playing guitar and &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20growl"&gt;growling&lt;/a&gt; while Antti played keyboard and sings backing vocals. They joined up with a female lead vocalist, lead and bass guitarists and a drummer. The brothers write the songs between them, with Antti doing the main body and Joni writing the lyrics.

Together the band recorded and released three demos and an EP, all released independently, across 2002-6. Across October and November 2007 they gained international attention by supporting well-known Finnish folk metal band &lt;a href="w%3AKorpiklaani"&gt;Korpiklaani&lt;/a&gt; across a large &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an tour.

On June 6 this year Kivimetsän Druidi‏ was announced to have been signed to &lt;a href="w%3ACentury%20Media%20Records"&gt;Century Media Records&lt;/a&gt; in a global deal. The band have now entered Noice Camp studio in &lt;a href="w%3ATurku"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt; to record their debut, with a planned release date in October. This summer the only performances will be at a handful of festivals while the band works on their new album, but after that is released a major tour will follow to support it. The band say they are "extremely pleased" with the deal.

Wikinews was able to discuss these events and what the future holds for the band with the Koskinen brothers and female vocalist Leeni-Maria Hovila, who also writes the vocal melodies in an exclusive interview, which is published below for the first time.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%27s%20Phoenix%20spacecraft%20having%20trouble%20analyzing%20soil%20samples&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has stated that the &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20%28planet%29"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Phoenix lander&lt;/a&gt; is having trouble analyzing soil samples that its robotic arm is collecting. According to NASA, the soil appears to be too clodded to pass through screens on the way to Phoenix's &lt;a href="w%3AThermal%20and%20Evolved%20Gas%20Analyzer"&gt;Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer&lt;/a&gt; (TEGA).

Images taken by the lander's camera shows that the robotic arm has dumped a large portion of soil over the TEGA, but it failed to register any soil which might have passed through the screens leading into the analyzer. The screen is designed to let through particles up to one-millimeter (0.04 inch) across while keeping out larger particles, in order to prevent clogging a funnel pathway to a tiny oven inside. An infrared beam crossing the pathway checks whether particles are entering the instrument and breaking the beam. It is now believed that the particles are either too large to pass through the screen, or the soil is too clumpy.

"I think it's the cloddiness of the soil and not having enough fine granular material. In the future, we may prepare the soil by pushing down on the surface with the arm before scooping up the material to break it up, then sprinkle a smaller amount over the door," said Ray Arvidson of &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20University"&gt;Washington University&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. Arvidson is the Phoenix team's science lead researcher for Saturday and digging czar for Phoenix's mission.

NASA also plans to use a shaker inside the TEGA to shake any material or samples longer than previously planned in an attempt to break up the larger particles and clumps. Phoenix already utilized this method on Friday June 6, shaking the soil for five minutes before dumping it onto the screen. NASA plans to tell Phoenix to shake the material a little longer in order for the soil to be tested.

While scientists ponder ways to fix the issue, TEGA will not be analyzing any samples. Instead Phoenix is expected to have completed tasks today such as horizontally extending a trench where the lander dug two practice scoops earlier this week, and taking additional images of a small pile of soil that was scooped up and dropped onto the surface during the second of those practice digs.

Seminars and forums always played key roles to forecast the future of ICT industry worldwide after the COMPUTEX became more and more critical for businesspeople. Not only e21FORUM, the DRAMeXchange Compuforum was progressively respected by &lt;a href="w%3ADynamic%20random%20access%20memory"&gt;DRAM&lt;/a&gt; industry since 2006.

Since the mobile devices have become popular in the presence, the supply of DRAM modules is still inadequate to meet the demand. "The abandonment of 12-inch &lt;a href="w%3ASemiconductor%20fabrication%20plant"&gt;fabs&lt;/a&gt; and the suspension of 8-inch fabs are considered critical issues in this incident. If the &lt;a href="China"&gt;Mainland China&lt;/a&gt; wants to enlarge its market stably, the supply chain and costs of material should be cautioned." stated DRAMeXchange Technology.

Mass storage devices with high capacity often linked with enterprises. With innovations of &lt;a href="w%3Ainformation%20technology"&gt;information technology&lt;/a&gt;, capacity of USB flash drives and mobile drives are larger and larger. "Capacity, costs of production, prices, and efficiency on writing and reading are critical factors to determine an user on choosing &lt;a href="w%3Asolid-state%20drive"&gt;SSDs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHard%20disk%20drive"&gt;hard disks&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="w%3Aflash%20drive"&gt;flash drives&lt;/a&gt;." stated &lt;a href="w%3AHitachi%20Global%20Storage%20Technologies"&gt;Hitach Corp.&lt;/a&gt;. "The market shares on storage will transform from enterprises to digital storage with a significant grown-up of Internet users within four years." stated &lt;a href="w%3ASeagate%20Technology"&gt;Seagate Technology&lt;/a&gt;.

South Africa scored four tries to defeat current &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Nations"&gt;Six Nations&lt;/a&gt; champion Wales. &lt;a href="w%3AConrad%20Jantjes"&gt;Conrad Jantjes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20de%20Villers"&gt;Jean de Villers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Spies"&gt;Pierre Spies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APercy%20Montgomery"&gt;Percy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; all scored tries, Montgomery having been substituted on in the second half.

Stephen Jones converted a try for Wales, while &lt;a href="w%3AButch%20James"&gt;Butch James&lt;/a&gt; converted all of South Africa's. After &lt;a href="w%3ACJ%20van%20der%20Linde"&gt;CJ van der Linde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Hibbard"&gt;Richard Hibbard&lt;/a&gt; got into a fight, both men were sent off.

Wales captain Ryan Jones later explained his team's defeat. "We made too many mistakes. South Africa capitalized whenever we lost possession, but we have no excuses," he said.

New Zealand has not lost to Ireland for 103 years, with one draw being the closest Ireland have come to a victory.

The score was tied at 11-11 with 20 minutes remaining in what was New Zealand's first match since exiting the &lt;a href="w%3ARugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. However, New Zealand's All Blacks were able to break through Ireland's defences to score a victory.

Conditions at Westpac were unusually bitter for the match. "I don't know if I've played in much colder than that," said Irish captain &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20O%27Driscoll"&gt;Brian O'Driscoll&lt;/a&gt;, and similar thoughts were echoed from All Black counterpart &lt;a href="w%3ARichie%20McCaw"&gt;Richie McCaw&lt;/a&gt;. "It's probably the coldest game I've ever played in. I've never got cold out on the field but after half-time I was shivering. It was nasty."

New Zealand centre &lt;a href="w%3AConrad%20Smith"&gt;Conrad Smith&lt;/a&gt; commented that "There was one point there are the end when one of the Irishmen went down that both teams were running around in circles doing their own thing (to keep warm). I just looked around and thought 'this is stupid'."

&lt;a href="w%3AGraham%20Henry"&gt;Graham Henry&lt;/a&gt;, All Black coach, said that he felt the match had been "a lottery."

&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Patterson"&gt;Chris Patterson&lt;/a&gt; scored three penalties in the first half, but an &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Tejeda"&gt;Alvaro Tejeda&lt;/a&gt; try on his debut left Argentina's Pumas 10-9 at the end of the first half.

The final points were also for Argentina, with &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Irish"&gt;London Irish&lt;/a&gt; centre &lt;a href="w%3AGonzalo%20Tiesi"&gt;Gonzalo Tiesi&lt;/a&gt; scoring a try in injury time.

The teams will play a second test at &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; next weekend.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS), an &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20Magnitude%20Scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; of 6.1 has struck &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; was recorded 20 miles away from the city of &lt;a href="w%3APatras"&gt;Patras&lt;/a&gt;, and 125 miles away from &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, the Greek capital. The earthquake occurred soon after 12:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; today, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AAthens%20Geodynamic%20Institute"&gt;Athens Geodynamic Institute&lt;/a&gt;. The USGS originally reported the quake as a magnitude 6.5.

There have been reports of at least two people killed and 37 injured. There has also been damage to property and mobile phone networks which are being overloaded. There are also reports of families trapped inside the rubble of homes and businesses.

The control tower at &lt;a href="w%3AAndravida"&gt;Andravida&lt;/a&gt; airport is reported to have sustained serious damage and has been abandoned. Many buildings and homes are said to be severely damaged or collapsed.

The tremors from the earthquake were noticeable in large parts of Greece, including &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, but the shaking could be felt as far away as &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.

A nationwide mobilisation of civil defence and fire brigade units commenced after the natural disaster. 
Finally, schools were also ordered closed on Monday in the affected areas.

<h1>Eight dead and two missing after cargo ship fire in Kaliningrad, Russia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Eight%20dead%20and%20two%20missing%20after%20cargo%20ship%20fire%20in%20Kaliningrad%2C%20Russia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Eight people are dead and two more are missing and presumed dead after an explosion and fire on a cargo ship undergoing repairs at a naval dockyard in &lt;a href="w%3AKaliningrad"&gt;Kaliningrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3Acontainer%20ship"&gt;container ship&lt;/a&gt; MV ♡❤Yenisey♡❤ was the scene of an explosion while in drydock at about 3:00 p.m. Moscow time (11:00 GMT). Ten people were missing after the explosion. It was confirmed today that the eighth body has been recovered, and the remaining two are thought to be dead as well. Three more were injured.

Captain 1st Rank Igor Dygalo, acting as a navy spokesperson, said "Each family of the victims of the fire on the ♡❤Yenisey♡❤ civilian vessel will be paid more than a million &lt;a href="w%3Aruble"&gt;ruble&lt;/a&gt;s." This makes their compensation roughly equivalent to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;43,000.

Dygolo said that the dockyard, in the closed military town of &lt;a href="w%3ABaltiysk"&gt;Baltiysk&lt;/a&gt;, near Kaliningrad, had been leased to the ♡❤Yenisey♡❤♡s &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Petersburg"&gt;St Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; owner, a private company, who were conducting the work themselves. He said an investigation has been launched by the navy led by top admiral &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Vysotsky%20%28Admiral%29"&gt;Vladimir Vysotsky&lt;/a&gt;.

Vysotski himself has indicated that serious safety legislation breaches concerning welding regulations by both the vessel's owner and the naval dockyard's bosses. He did not go into details, but ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARIA%20Novosti"&gt;RIA Novosti&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ claimed that a source at the dockyard said a gas burner applied to the roof of a fuel tank to heat and therefore loosen its bolts had triggered the disaster.

Today is an official day of mourning for &lt;a href="w%3AKaliningrad%20Region"&gt;Kaliningrad Region&lt;/a&gt; to mark the deaths.

&lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Pole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AFederation%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Formula%20One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Grand Prix du Canada&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ACircuit%20Gilles%20Villeneuve"&gt;Circuit Gilles Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIle%20Notre%20Dame"&gt;Ile Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. He and his teammate &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt; made a double for &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt; team for the first time in history of this sport.

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Sauber"&gt;Peter Sauber&lt;/a&gt; first started building sport cars in &lt;a href="w%3A1970"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt;. His team made it's Formula-1 debut in &lt;a href="w%3A1993%20Formula%20One%20season"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;. The team was handed over to BMW after &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Formula%20One%20season"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; and now it's &lt;a href="w%3Ateam%20principal"&gt;team principal&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Theissen"&gt;Mario Theissen&lt;/a&gt;.

Nick Heidfeld also came second in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;previous year race&lt;/a&gt; won by &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;. It was a race when &lt;a href="Lewis%20Hamilton%20wins%202007%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Kubica suffered a violent crash&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Coulthard"&gt;David Coulthard&lt;/a&gt; was the best of &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;-engined cars finishing third for &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt;.

The race was thrilled after &lt;a href="w%3AAdrian%20Sutil"&gt;Adrian Sutil&lt;/a&gt; suffered his &lt;a href="w%3AForce%20India"&gt;Force India&lt;/a&gt; car failure and caused a &lt;a href="w%3Asafety%20car"&gt;safety car&lt;/a&gt; to appear. This happened right before the scheduled first pit-stops and 5 drivers who were in the lead rushed to refuel themselves after the pit lane became open. Still, the pit lane exit remained closed and Robert Kubica with &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Ferrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;) stopped in front of the red sign. But &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; did not. He crashed hard into the back of Räikkönen and jammed the exit for the drivers behind. This cleared the cards for BMW team to win the race.

The pace car also gave the lucky chance for &lt;a href="w%3AToyota%20F1"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; drivers, who were not very competitive in qualifying on Saturday, starting 11th and 14th. &lt;a href="w%3ATimo%20Glock"&gt;Timo Glock&lt;/a&gt; made up 4th after holding &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; (Ferrari) pushed him from behind. &lt;a href="w%3AJarno%20Trulli"&gt;Jarno Trulli&lt;/a&gt; could also finished in front of Massa, but Timo braked hard on his teammate and Jarno was forced to let Massa pass him.

&lt;a href="w%3ARubens%20Barrichello"&gt;Rubens Barrichello&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Racing%20F1"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;) finished 7th. &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;) pushed hard on &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASebastian%20Vettel"&gt;Sebastian Vettel&lt;/a&gt; but German kept his position and scored 1 point for &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Toro%20Rosso"&gt;Toro Rosso&lt;/a&gt;.

It should be noted that Kubica won the race after he finished second in the &lt;a href="Lewis%20Hamilton%20wins%202008%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;previous Monaco GP&lt;/a&gt; won by Hamilton. Kubica now leads the drivers' championship with 42 points, chased by Hamilton and Massa with 38 points both, Räikkönen with 35 points and Heidfeld with 28. BMW Sauber now stayed close to Ferrari in constructors' standings with 70 points, gap of 3 to Ferrari. Team McLaren is now a distant third with 53 points.

A lively shopping district was suddenly struck by an indiscriminate murder spree on a Sunday afternoon. A young man attacked a crowd with a rented truck, and then stabbed people with a dagger, around 12:35 JST (3:35 UTC) on Sunday in the Akihabara district of &lt;a href="w%3AChiyoda%20Ward"&gt;Chiyoda Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. The suspect, identified as Tomohiro Katō, aged 25, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Seven people were killed, and ten injured. 

The injured people include pedestrians, a 53-year-old policeman, and a taxi driver, 54, who is believed to have left his taxi in order to help a pedestrian hit by the truck. About 17 ambulances came to the scene. NHK reports that medical teams trained for disasters joined the rescue. 

The dead are six men aged between 19 and 74 and a 21-year-old woman; each was identified by police. 

The truck, traveling on Kanda Myōjin-dōri (Kanda Myōjin Avenue), ran into the crowd at a crossing on Chūō-dōri (Chūō Avenue), which is a vehicle-free road every Sunday. After entering the crowd, the truck continued moving for about 30 meters. The suspect then exited the truck and began stabbing people. According to a witness, the suspect, upon being pursued by police, ran south on Chūō-dōri and was cornered in a narrow alley. The suspect dropped his knife after the police officer drew his gun, and was overpowered by the officer and several bystanders. 

The suspect has been quoted as confessing to police, "I came to Akihabara to kill people. I'm tired of the world. Anyone was OK. Today I came alone." The suspect, a native of Aomori City, lived and worked as a dispatched temporary employee in Shizuoka Prefecture. After being held at the Manseibashi Police Station, he was sent on Tuesday to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office. 

At the scene, a table covered with a white cloth was set for memorial flowers and other offerings on the morning of Monday, June 9. As acquaintances of the dead and passersby visited, the table soon filled—almost flooded—with flowers, drink bottles, pictures, and folded paper cranes. 

The incident occurred on the same date with the 2001 &lt;a href="w%3AOsaka%20school%20massacre"&gt;Osaka school massacre&lt;/a&gt;, in which eight elementary school students were killed. 

NHK reported the incident as confirmed within 45 minutes, interrupting a news channel program for one minute. Some newspapers created special issues to report the incident as June 8 was a Sunday and also a press holiday, many newspapers in Japan were not scheduled for delivery on that evening or the following morning. 

The Akihabara district is famous for its Electric Town with wholesalers and retailers of video games or electric gadgets such as PC parts, televisions and kitchen appliances. It has also become famous for distinctive trends in cultures created or supported by the youth.

Local residents, business owners, and government officials from Chiyoda Ward assembled for an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss whether the practice of maintaining the vehicle-free area on Sundays ought to be continued. The Tokyo Metropolitan Public Safety Commission is also expected to discuss the issue.

A &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20March%203B"&gt;Long March 3B&lt;/a&gt; carrier rocket has launched the &lt;a href="w%3AChinasat"&gt;Chinasat-9&lt;/a&gt; satellite. The rocket lifted off from pad 2 at the &lt;a href="w%3AXichang%20Satellite%20Launch%20Centre"&gt;Xichang Satellite Launch Centre&lt;/a&gt; at 12:15 &lt;a href="w%3AGMT"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon. Chinasat-9, also known as Zhongxing-9 and ZX-9, is a &lt;a href="w%3Acommunications%20satellite"&gt;communications satellite&lt;/a&gt;, which will initially be used to relay coverage of the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Olympic%20Games"&gt;2008 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;. The launch was conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Great%20Wall%20Industrial%20Corporation"&gt;China Great Wall Industrial Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.

Around twenty minutes after the rocket lifted off, the satellite separated from the third stage, into a &lt;a href="w%3Ageosynchronous%20transfer%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous transfer orbit&lt;/a&gt;. It will raise itself into a &lt;a href="w%3Ageosynchronous%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous orbit&lt;/a&gt;, around 35,000 kilometres above the equator, by means of its onboard S-400 apogee motor. Chinasat-9 was constructed by &lt;a href="w%3AThales%20Alenia%20Space"&gt;Thales Alenia Space&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;a href="w%3ASpacebus"&gt;Spacebus-4000C2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asatellite%20bus"&gt;satellite bus&lt;/a&gt;. It is equipped with 22 &lt;a href="w%3AJ%20band"&gt;J-band&lt;/a&gt; (IEEE Ku-band) &lt;a href="w%3Atransponder"&gt;transponder&lt;/a&gt;s, and will be operated by the &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Telecommunications%20Broadcast%20Satellite%20Corporation"&gt;China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corporation&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Ministry%20of%20Post%20and%20Telecommunications"&gt;China Ministry of Post and Telecommunications&lt;/a&gt;.

Chinasat-9 is the last of a number of communications satellites which have been launched by China over the last few years to boost capacity for the Olympic Games, including the Sinosat-2 spacecraft, which was lost after it failed to deploy its solar panels subsequent to its launch in late 2006. One more satellite, Echostar-CBM was scheduled to be launched, however this was cancelled due to performance issues. The Olympic Games will take place in August.

This is the 3 orbital launch that China has conducted so far &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;, and the 28 orbital launch of the year in total. The next Chinese launch is believed to be scheduled for August, when a &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20March%202C"&gt;Long March 2C&lt;/a&gt; will launch a pair of remote sensing satellites.

14 or 15 homeless advocates who had been blocking an intersection in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%2C%20Washington"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; were arrested by police. The protest was in response to street sweeps that have been aimed at removing homeless camps.

The protesters, members of an organization called "Real Change", were taken peacefully to a bus after ignoring two police warnings to leave the area. They were then taken to the West Precinct station for processing, with the possibility of facing pedestrian interference charges.

The group had been camping overnight in front of the City Hall Plaza with the message that the city needs shelters for the homeless instead of simply running them out of camps. The city says that it gives residents warning and offers of social services before removing these camps due to health and safety issues.

&lt;a href="Apple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt; today launched a &lt;a href="w%3A3G"&gt;3G&lt;/a&gt; version of its &lt;a href="w%3AiPhone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; device. &lt;a href="Steve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;, the Apple Chief Executive Officer, announced the development at a developers' conference, where he promoted the iPhone by saying that, “just one year after launching the iPhone, we’re launching the new iPhone 3G that is twice as fast at half the price.”

Apple has claimed that the 3G iPhone will provide internet access at double the speed of the internet access provided by the previous versions.

The price for the iPhone has also been reduced to $199 in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, with prices in other countries equal or below that of within the US.

For several months there has been speculation among Apple fans about the launch of a 3G iPhone.

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; are engaged in a war of words following comments made by &lt;a href="w%3AShaul%20Mofaz"&gt;Shaul Mofaz&lt;/a&gt;, Israel's Transportation Minister, stating that his country will "attack Iran" if Iran does not stop building up its nuclear program.

On Friday, June 6 in an interview with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AYedioth%20Ahronoth"&gt;Yedioth Ahronoth&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, an Israeli newspaper, Mofaz was quoted: "Attacking Iran, in order to stop its nuclear plans, will be unavoidable. If Iran continues its plan to develop nuclear weapons, we will attack it. The window of opportunity has closed. The sanctions are not effective. There will be no choice but to attack Iran to stop its nuclear program."

Iran has responded to Mofaz's statements saying that Israel would suffer a "painful response" if it attacks.

"If somebody wants to do such a foolish job, the response will be very painful," said &lt;a href="w%3AMostafa%20Mohammad-Najjar"&gt;Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar&lt;/a&gt;, Iran's Defense Minister, to reporters. "Ever since it lost to &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;, Israel has been suffering from psychological problems, which is why its people make foolish remarks every now and again," he added. 

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is committed to diplomacy regarding Iran's nuclear program and has urged Israel to also use diplomacy.

"We are trying to solve this diplomatically," said &lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt;, the current Press Secretary for the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. She also added that the U.S. "would never take any options off the table."

Israel's Prime Minister, &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;, has not commented on the remarks made by Mofaz, but he states that while sanctions are a positive measure, "much more needs to be done to pressure the regime in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; to cease its aggressive nuclear program."

Iran began researching nuclear energy in the 1950s; the country has continuously stated that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

At least 145 people in around 16 states have been infected with the bacteria known as &lt;a href="w%3ASalmonella"&gt;Salmonella&lt;/a&gt; Saintpaul. The sandwiches affected are the premium chicken sandwiches and the &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20N%27%20Tasty"&gt;Big N' Tasty&lt;/a&gt; burger. 

Raw cherry tomatoes and grape tomatoes don't present a problem, the FDA says. McDonald's said it will continue to serve grape tomatoes in its premium salads.

Composed by &lt;a href="w%3ADolores%20Claman"&gt;Dolores Claman&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤The Hockey Theme♡❤ was the theme song of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHockey%20Night%20in%20Canada"&gt;Hockey Night in Canada&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, one of the most popular Canadian television programs, since 1968.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;'s (CBC) latest license to broadcast ♡❤The Hockey Theme♡❤ had expired at the conclusion of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007-08%20NHL%20season"&gt;latest NHL season&lt;/a&gt;. On June 6, negotiations between Claman and CBC broke down, with the CBC announcing that a deal could not be reached. The CBC offered to resume negotiation with a mediator today. However, by mid-afternoon today, Claman's representatives announced that they had sold the rights to CTV.

CTV will use this song in its broadcasts of &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (NHL) games on &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sports%20Network"&gt;The Sports Network&lt;/a&gt; (TSN) and &lt;a href="w%3AR%C3%A9seau%20des%20sports"&gt;Réseau des sports&lt;/a&gt; (RDS), as well as during the &lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;2010 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Akihabara helpers should take a medical checkup, police say</h3>

The police announced on Monday that one person may have hepatitis B among those involved in Sunday's Akihabara rampage in Tokyo. 

Anyone who might have had contact with blood from the rampage (e.g. who helped to care, rescue, carry a victim) should undergo a checkup to examine the infection, as soon as possible.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Department%20of%20Energy"&gt;US Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt; yesterday unveiled the &lt;a href="w%3AIBM%20Roadrunner"&gt;IBM Roadrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the world's fastest computer. The computer, which is designed to conduct virtual tests for nuclear weapons, is able to carry out 1,000 trillion (or 1 quadrillion) calculations in one second.

The machine cost &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;100 million to build and works at twice the speed of &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Gene"&gt;Blue Gene&lt;/a&gt;, which is now the world's second fastest computer.

“Roadrunner will not only play a key role in maintaining the U.S. nuclear deterrent, it will also contribute to solving our global energy challenges, and open new windows of knowledge in the basic scientific research fields,” said Samuel Bodman, the US secretary of energy.

Roadrunner, which was produced by the US Government in collaboration with &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, can be found at the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory"&gt;Los Alamos National Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.

A plane arriving in &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;'s capital, &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;, burst into flames after veering off the runway during a thunderstorm. Around 100 passengers and crew are feared dead.

The jetliner is said to have careened off of the runway in the process of landing. The Sudanese head of police, Mohammad Najib, cited a crash landing due to bad weather as the cause of the accident. Najib said that the plane split in two and burst into flames.

The plane was carrying approximately 203 passengers and 14 crew from Amman, &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. Sudanese officials have said it was a &lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20Airways"&gt;Sudan Airways&lt;/a&gt; flight (SD 109) from the Jordanian capital Amman via Damascus, &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;. It had previously been diverted to &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Sudan"&gt;Port Sudan&lt;/a&gt; due to heavy rain in Khartoum.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGamma-ray%20Large%20Area%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; (GLAST) satellite has been launched aboard a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Launch%20Alliance"&gt;United Launch Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20II"&gt;Delta II&lt;/a&gt; Heavy carrier rocket. Lift-off occurred from &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2017"&gt;Launch Complex 17B&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station"&gt;Cape Canaveral Air Force Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, at 16:05 GMT. Spacecraft separation occurred about 75 minutes after launch, just before 17:20 GMT. The launch was reported to have been successful.
The Delta II rocket flew in the 7920H configuration, with nine &lt;a href="w%3AGraphite-Epoxy%20Motor"&gt;GEM-46&lt;/a&gt; solid rocket motors, and no third stage. This is the fifth flight of a Delta II Heavy, which differs from the standard Delta II in that it has more powerful solid rocket motors, originally developed for the &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20III"&gt;Delta III&lt;/a&gt;. At 4627 kg (10201 lbs), GLAST is the heaviest payload ever launched by a Delta II. It will operate in a &lt;a href="w%3Alow%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;low Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 550 kilometres above the Earth's surface.

GLAST will be used to study &lt;a href="w%3Agamma%20rays"&gt;gamma rays&lt;/a&gt; emitted from &lt;a href="w%3Asupermassive%20black%20hole"&gt;supermassive black hole&lt;/a&gt;s in other galaxies, and &lt;a href="w%3Apulsars"&gt;pulsars&lt;/a&gt; in our own galaxy. It is a replacement for the &lt;a href="w%3ACompton%20Gamma%20Ray%20Observatory"&gt;Compton Gamma Ray Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, which operated between April 1991 and June 2000. It will be used by scientists in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The spacecraft will be operated by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; space agency, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy"&gt;United States Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt; is also involved in the mission.

This is the 29 orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the second to be conducted by a Delta II. The next Delta II launch will occur in just over a week, when a lighter configuration 7420 rocket will be used to place the &lt;a href="w%3AJason-2"&gt;Jason-2&lt;/a&gt; satellite into orbit. In total, this is the 136 launch of a Delta II, the 134 successful Delta II launch, and the 81 consecutive success.

2008 The 2nd-annual Google Developer Day started its tournament in Pasifico &lt;a href="w%3AYokohama"&gt;Yokohama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; as its first stage. According to &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, this programmer-based event is similar to &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20I/O"&gt;Google I/O&lt;/a&gt;, the largest programming event which is only available in &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; and held earlier on May 28 &amp; 29 in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;.

Takuya Oikawa, Software Engineer of Google Japan, analyzed the future trend on programming and redefined the "3C". "There are three key features to drive on the next generation programming, that is, 'Client' [user-oriented], 'Connectivity', and '&lt;a href="w%3ACloud%20Computing"&gt;Cloud Computing&lt;/a&gt;'," stated Oikawa.

Fumitoshi Ukai, the Software Engineer of Google Japan, has pointed out the importance of Google App Engine, and performed a SWOT analysis using the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Sichuan%20earthquake"&gt;Sichuan earthquake&lt;/a&gt; as an example, and said: "The failure or success of Cloud Computing will be determined by three critical factors - ability of offline computing, language support, and quotas of databases."

After the Japan Stage, 2008 Google Developer Day will be held in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; during the month of June. The Europe Tour of Google Developer Day will kick off from &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; on September 16.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Phoenix Lander&lt;/a&gt; has begun to cook a scoop full of &lt;a href="Mars"&gt;Martian&lt;/a&gt; soil. For reasons unknown to scientists, and after several seemingly unsuccessful attempts to break up the soil, a large amount was discovered to have passed through a screen leading to an on board oven.

"We have an oven full. It took 10 seconds to fill the oven. The ground moved," said Phoenix co-investigator Bill Boynton, a researcher at the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Arizona"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="Tucson"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.

The lander's Robotic Arm delivered a partial scoopful of clumpy soil from a trench informally called "Baby Bear" to the number 4 oven on its &lt;a href="w%3AThermal%20and%20Evolved%20Gas%20Analyzer"&gt;TEGA&lt;/a&gt; (Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer) last Friday, June 6. NASA observed the method and reported that no soil had passed through the screens over the TEGA. The screen is to prevent larger bits of soil from clogging the narrow port to each oven so that fine particles fill the oven cavity, which is no wider than a pencil lead. The oven's goal is to vaporize any ice or water that may be present in the soil. Minerals may also burn off and scientists say that vapors from anything that evaporates or vaporizes will be tested and analyzed.

After some debate, NASA decided to 'shake' the soil in hopes that it would break up the larger particles. To much disappointment after six tries using this method, only a few particles got through the screen. Scientists then ordered one last shake of the soil "in the off chance we might get lucky," stated Boynton.

After a few days of troubleshooting, NASA looked back at the soil and discovered that, for an unknown reason, a large amount of soil had fallen through the screen and was ready for inspection by the TEGA. Boynton states that it is possible that the oven might have filled because of the cumulative effects of all the shaking, or because of changes in the soil's cohesiveness as it sat for days on the top of the screen.

"There's something very unusual about this soil, from a place on Mars we've never been before. We're interested in learning what sort of chemical and mineral activity has caused the particles to clump and stick together," Boynton commented.

Phoenix was originally ordered to put off using its TEGA until scientists came up with a solution to the clodded soil. It had been rescheduled to take readings of the Martian climate such as temperature and wind speed, and also to analyze a soil sample using the optical microscope, or MECA (Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer) on June 12. Scientists say that those tasks are still scheduled to take place. Pictures and results from that sample are expected to arrive on Thursday June 12, while the oven samples will take a few days to analyze.

"The dirt finally did start to flow and we actually got a full oven, so that problem is now behind us. We're hopeful that some time in the next few days we'll close the oven and begin the analysis process," added Boynton.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
At least two homes have been evacuated, and 14 or more are on standby to evacuate in &lt;a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; after a very large three-story building partially collapsed on the city's West Side.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Buffalo Fire Department&lt;/a&gt;, the number four side of an old horse stable at 428 Jersey Street off of Richmond Avenue collapsed from the roof line half way down the side. Material from the building fell into the yards of at least three neighbouring houses. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.

"[The building] is well worth the designation" as a historical landmark, states Tim Tielman of the Buffalo Preservation Board. Tielman states that he will likely bring the incident before the Board as early as Thursday, June 12 to discuss the issue.

"We don't want to demolish it until it is talked about and we consider options," added Tielman.

So far there are no reports of injuries. Firefighters plan on getting an aerial shot to determine if the building is in danger of totally collapsing. A detail will remain on scene until at least Thursday afternoon. 

The building was first owned by a company called ♡❤White Bros.♡❤ and was used as a stable for a farm which once covered the land around the building for several blocks. Servants and workers of the farm were housed inside resident quarters situated at the rear of the building.

The building, the current owner of which is not known, covers nearly a half block. Much of the building's sides are home to vines, and a variety of gardens are planted along the perimeter of the building. Residents state that they will be "very disappointed" to see the building be demolished.

Repairs on the building were ongoing. The building is believed to have been built in the mid-1800's.

&lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; all but secured a spot on the quarter-finals of the &lt;a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008"&gt;UEFA Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, defeating the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czechs&lt;/a&gt; 3-1. This is the team's second consecutive victory in the championship. 

Portugal took an early lead in minute eight when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADeco"&gt;Deco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored after two attempts. The score was equalled by the Czechs in minute 17 when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALibor%20Sionko"&gt;Sionko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; headed in from a corner. Portugal then retook the lead when &lt;a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo"&gt;Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; low-drived the ball into the goal after a pass from Deco. Regulation time ended, and three minutes were added, giving the Czechs a chance to equal the score, but all hope was lost when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Quaresma"&gt;Quaresma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored one minute later, after receiving a pass from Ronaldo. 

Portugal, as the winner of Group A, will kick off the knockout stage by playing the runner up from Group B in the quarter-finals on June 19.

A major storm suspected to be a &lt;a href="w%3Atornado"&gt;tornado&lt;/a&gt; has reportedly killed four &lt;a href="w%3ABoy%20Scouts"&gt;Boy Scouts&lt;/a&gt; camping at the &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Sioux%20Scout%20Ranch"&gt;Little Sioux Scout Ranch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Sioux%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Little Sioux, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly ninety-five Scouts aged thirteen to eighteen and twenty-five adult staff members were believed to be camping at the time the alarm was raised. Most of the scouts were from Omaha-Metro Area, including &lt;a href="w%3AOmaha%2C%20Nebraska"&gt;Omaha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABellevue%2C%20Nebraska"&gt;Bellevue, Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20Bluffs%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Council Bluffs, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that the scouts had as little as twelve minutes to seek shelter from the time the alarm began to the time the storm hit. Early reports stated that thirty to forty scouts had been injured, that number was later reduced to twenty. 

A spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3ABoy%20Scouts%20of%20America"&gt;Boy Scouts of America&lt;/a&gt;'s Mid American Council, the region in which the camp was situated, has stated that the storm activated sirens but she couldn't confirm whether the scouts were staying in tents or buildings.

The Scouts were participating in a training exercise at the 1,800 acre ranch roughly 40 miles northeast of Omaha. Julie Tack, a spokesperson for Iowa Homeland Security, stated that the camp was littered with debris and downed tree branches after being struck by a tornado at or around 7:00 PM Central Daylight Time. Tack went on to say that a search and rescue team had been deployed to the area. 

Camp counselors have stated that they were aware of the possibilities that storm was coming and they had heard the tornado sirens going off. There was no underground shelter for the scouts, however they had shelters designated and emergency plans had been discussed the first day of camp. Officials said most of the boys were on a hike when storms moved in.

A camp staff member said that many scouts were injured when a fireplace in one of the shelters collapsed. Most of the injured scouts were treated at hospitals in Sioux City and &lt;a href="w%3AMissouri%20Valley%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Missouri Valley, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;. Six scouts were brought to the Missouri Valley hospital, most treated for minor injuries and broken bones. One scout suffered a broken hip and was transferred to Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha. 

Mercy Medical Center, in &lt;a href="w%3ASioux%20City%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Sioux City&lt;/a&gt;, have reported two patients arriving by helicopter at 8:13 PM with a third arriving by ambulance. A fourth patient arrived later, again by helicopter. A spokesman for the hospital said the victims are all juveniles and all have serious injuries. Mercy does not expect to receive more camp victims. The names of the victims have not been released.

Officials from the &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20Defense%20Military"&gt;Romanian Defense Military&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that one of their &lt;a href="w%3AMiG-21"&gt;MiG-21&lt;/a&gt; Lancer fighter planes was struck by four &lt;a href="w%3AUnidentified%20Flying%20Objects"&gt;Unidentified Flying Objects&lt;/a&gt; on October 31, 2007, which shattered the plane's cockpit. The military also released a video captured by the plane's on-board camera as it was flying above &lt;a href="Transylvania"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;.

The recording shows solid bodies, which authorities are working to determine the identity of. Officials have already been able to determine the bodies were not birds or pieces of another plane, a meteorite or ice. Rocket launches and ground artillery shots were also ruled out as possible explanations for the incident.

The pilot, Marin Mitrica, was injured slightly but managed to safely land the plane. The investigation was passed to the &lt;a href="w%3ASecurity%20Committee%20of%20European%20Air%20Forces"&gt;Security Committee of European Air Forces&lt;/a&gt;.

A similar incident happened in the United States in 1948. &lt;a href="w%3AMantell%20UFO%20Incident"&gt;Captain Mantell&lt;/a&gt;, of the Kentucky Air National Guard, was sent to intercept a UFO that was in US airspace, and allegedly, he was shot down by the UFO. Further investigations revealed that he was unfamiliar with the F-51 (P-51 fighter plane of World War II era).

Scientists from the Northern &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n region &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; have said that the population of &lt;a href="w%3Acane%20toads"&gt;cane toads&lt;/a&gt; could be limited by scaring them. The toads are non-native, imported invasive pests in the parts of Australia they inhabit.

The scientists have reported that scared tadpoles will transform into toads prematurely, leaving them undersized and weak. The intimidation has been found by putting a squashed, dead tadpole into a pool and observing that some of the chemical signals given off by the corpse scare tadpoles already in the pool. The result is the early metamorphosis, and a weaker population of cane toads.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20Rapids%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Cedar Rapids, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 

In the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20River"&gt;Cedar River&lt;/a&gt; continues to break records today as it floods Cedar Rapids, &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;. The river is approaching its expected crest of over 30 feet, over 18 feet over flood stage and more than ten feet over the previous record high. 

The downtown area is underwater, as well as several residential neighborhoods against the river. 

All road bridges over the river in the area except for the &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%20380%20%28Iowa%29"&gt;Interstate 380&lt;/a&gt; bridge are closed and covered with water, and one of the two railroad bridges has swept away. For a short time, the &lt;a href="w%3ALinn%20County%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Linn County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff's Department had closed I-380 to allow emergency services to use it, but later re-opened it, allowing traffic in the rightmost lane.

The river is expected to crest around 7:00 a.m. Friday morning (June 13).

&lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; salvaged a draw from their group game against &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; after referee &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Webb"&gt;Howard Webb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; awarded a controversial penalty in injury time, which &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIvica%20Vasti%C4%87"&gt;Vastić&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; duefully converted, becoming the &lt;a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008"&gt;European Championships&lt;/a&gt;' oldest ever scorer, at the age of 39. 

Austria had several clear chances early in the match, Harnik failed to score when put through one-on-one with the outrushing Polish goalkeeper Boruc in the 11th minute. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Guerreiro"&gt;Guerreiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored in the 30th minute for Poland, despite suspicions that he tapped in Saganowski's cross from an off-side position. Austria pushed for an equaliser in the second half but were held steadfastly by the Polish defence, including some stunning saves from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArtur%20Boruc"&gt;Artur Boruc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In the third minute of injury time referee Howard Webb awarded a penalty to Austria after sighting shirt holding in the penalty-area, which Vastić scored in a dramatic finale.

Austria will face &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; in a must-win match on Match Day 10 (June 16, 2008), and will be without &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASebastian%20Proedl"&gt;Sebastian Proedl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who will be suspended, having collected 2 yellow cards in both his appearances so far. Poland will face &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, and also must win to qualify for the Quarter-Finals.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAriane%205"&gt;Ariane 5ECA&lt;/a&gt; rocket has successfully placed two &lt;a href="w%3Acommunications%20satellite"&gt;communications satellite&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href="w%3AGeosynchronous%20transfer%20orbit"&gt;Geosynchronous transfer orbit&lt;/a&gt;. Liftoff, from &lt;a href="w%3AELA-3"&gt;ELA-3&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AGuiana%20Space%20Centre"&gt;Guiana Space Centre&lt;/a&gt; occurred at 22:05:02 &lt;a href="w%3AGMT"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt; this evening. The satellites launched were &lt;a href="w%3ASkynet%205C"&gt;Skynet 5C&lt;/a&gt;, which will be used to relay secure communications for the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; armed forces, and &lt;a href="w%3ATurksat%203A"&gt;Turksat 3A&lt;/a&gt;, which will be used for commercial communications. &lt;a href="w%3AParadigm%20Secure%20Communications"&gt;Paradigm Secure Communications&lt;/a&gt; will operate Skynet 5C on behalf of Britain's &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kindgom%29"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;, whilst Turksat 3A will be operated by &lt;a href="w%3ATurksat"&gt;Turksat&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation based in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.

The launch was conducted by &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href="w%3AArianespace"&gt;Arianespace&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally scheduled to occur in May, but was delayed when an incorrect guidance programme was found to have been installed on the rocket. It is believed that several commands intended for use by the Ariane 5ES, a variant of the Ariane 5 used to launch spacecraft such as the &lt;a href="w%3AAutomated%20Transfer%20Vehicle"&gt;Automated Transfer Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, had been installed by mistake. 

Skynet 5C and Turksat 3A separated from the carrier rocket 26 and 31 minutes after launch respectively, into a &lt;a href="w%3AGeosynchronous%20transfer%20orbit"&gt;Geosynchronous transfer orbit&lt;/a&gt;. They will perform burns of onboard engines to raise the perigees of their orbits, and inject into &lt;a href="w%3AGeosynchronous%20orbits"&gt;Geosynchronous orbits&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 35,000 kilometres above the equator. Turksat 3A, which was constructed by &lt;a href="w%3AThales%20Alenia%20Space"&gt;Thales Alenia Space&lt;/a&gt;, will be positioned at a longitude of 42°E, where it will replace the older &lt;a href="w%3ATurksat%201C"&gt;Turksat 1C&lt;/a&gt; satellite. Skynet 5C, which was originally constructed as a backup spacecraft, will be placed at 17.8°W. It was built by &lt;a href="w%3AEADS%20Astrium"&gt;EADS Astrium&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the 30 orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the third to be conducted by an Ariane 5 rocket. Overall, it is the 39 flight of an Ariane 5, and the 14 flight of the ECA variant. It is also the 25 successful launch of an Ariane rocket. The flight designation for the launch was V184, and the serial number of the rocket used was 540. The next Ariane 5 launch will occur in early July, with the &lt;a href="w%3ABadr%206"&gt;Badr 6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AProtoStar-1"&gt;ProtoStar-1&lt;/a&gt; satellites.

Speaking before launch, Arianespace Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Yves%20Le%20Gall"&gt;Jean-Yves Le Gall&lt;/a&gt; described the mission as a "very important launch for us". Following launch, he said that he was "very happy to share this success with you", and that Arianespace could make a "guarantee to Europe's governments of their assured access to space". He commented on the fact that this was Arianespace's 25 consecutive successful launch, saying that this achievement "truly demands respect".

Patrick Wood, the Skynet 5C programme director at Paradigm Secure Communications described the launch as "another great achievement, and another major milestone", and that "we are extremely proud of it". 
Jean-Marie Robert, the manager of satellite programmes at Thales Alenia Space said that his company was "proud to have contributed" to the Turksat programme. &lt;a href="w%3ABinali%20Yildirim"&gt;Binali Yildirim&lt;/a&gt;, Turkey's Minister of Transportation, made a speech via telephone, thanking Arianespace for the launch.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Reports say that a large three-story stable which partially collapsed in Buffalo, New York on June 11, and caused as many as five home to be evacuated, is likely to be demolished.

During the early afternoon hours on June 11, the Buffalo Fire Department was called to 428 Jersey Avenue after residents called 911 stating that part of the building had collapsed. Material from the building fell into the yards of at least three neighboring houses. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.

The city's preservation board held an emergency meeting today to discuss the issue. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that the owner of the building, Bob Freudenheim, gave the city permission to demolish the building because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim was part-owner of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and was also an advocate to stop the ♡❤Elmwood Village Hotel♡❤ from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ extensively covered. He also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built.

Freudenheim has been facing housing violations due to the poor conditions of the building.

"We had a letter of violation against him. He was supposed to have started work to stabilize the brick this Monday. We all hope this building could be saved. But we've got five houses evacuated and we cannot tolerate any further delay. We've got to get people back into their homes in a safe condition," said Richard Tobe, Commissioner of the city's Permit and Inspection Services.

Demolition on the building is expected to begin next week, but area residents are not happy and say they will fight to keep the building in place.

"They're going to have to trash our backyard to do it. So I hope they have to have our permission, because we're not going to give it lightly. I'm sure it's the biggest and architecturally significant livery stable still standing. I can't see any reason to take it down just because of one hole," stated Joe Murray, a resident on Richmond and Jersey who lives behind the collapsed portion of the building.

Mike Lombardo, the Commissioner for the Buffalo Fire Department, believes that the building was built in 1812 or 1814, making it nearly 200 years old. It is one of only three stables still standing in the city.

If the building is to be demolished, Freudenheim will end up paying the city nearly &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollars"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$300,000 to get the job done.

<h1>Security tightened at Singapore courts after two attempts to escape</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Security%20tightened%20at%20Singapore%20courts%20after%20two%20attempts%20to%20escape&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Following a failed escape attempt on Wednesday at the detention facilities of the &lt;a href="w%3ASubordinate%20Courts%20of%20Singapore"&gt;Subordinate Courts of Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, security has been increased. 

At 1:45 a.m., Jamaluddin Salam, 32, and Salman Abu Samah, 28, tried to escape from the basement lock-up by requesting water. An officer opened the cell gate to fulfill the request, which is a breach of procedure; he should have merely passed water through a hole in the cell door. The prisoners took advantage of the open gate and overpowered the officer, violently punching and kicking him to the ground before heading to the gates at the lock-up's exit, pressing a buzzer to inform the officer at the control room to unlock the gates. The officer did not check the security camera monitor to see who was at the gates before unlocking it, constituting another breach of procedure.

Following their successful exit from the lock-up, the duo used the lift just past the exit gates to reach the fourth floor of the facility, forcing open a locked door and going down a stairwell to reach the ground floor. 

Within 10 minutes of the escape, the duo was spotted at the ground floor. The alarm was raised and officers were deployed to seal off all exits. Near the facility's main entrance, Salman tripped and was quickly subdued. Jamaluddin made his way to the back entrance, but found it locked. He then doubled back to the front and dashed out of the facility. An officer tripped him with his baton about 100m outside of the facility.

The attempted escape came barely four months after terrorist-fugitive &lt;a href="w%3AMas%20Selamat%20Kastari"&gt;Mas Selamat Kastari&lt;/a&gt; fled the &lt;a href="w%3AWhitley%20Road%20Detention%20Centre"&gt;Whitley Road Detention Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Failure to observe procedures on the part of his minders was also a reason for that escape.

The two men were brought from &lt;a href="w%3AQueenstown%20Remand%20Prison"&gt;Queenstown Remand Prison&lt;/a&gt; to the Subordinate Courts for bail purposes. Jamaluddin was facing six counts of robbery with hurt and drug charges, while Salman had three charges of robbery with hurt. Both cases are unrelated. Bail was set at $30,000 for Jamaluddin and $20,000 for Salman.

Police revealed yesterday that Jamaluddin and Salman were not the only inmates in the cell. It has not been revealed how many inmates were in the cell but it is known that they stayed put during the escape attempt.

In a statement, police said they have been upgrading the lock-up area since 2003, adding extra security grilles and enhancing the &lt;a href="w%3ACCTV"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt; system.

A security audit of all lock-ups was conducted in March. The following month, a working group was set-up to look specifically into the security of the Subordinate Courts lock-up facilities.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACriminal%20Investigation%20Department"&gt;Criminal Investigation Department&lt;/a&gt; (CID) is now investigating the circumstances of the attempted escape to see if any officers were negligent.

Due to the escape attempt, security at the facility has been tightened to prevent a similar incident from happening. New security measures include an extra lock fixed onto the lock-up exit gates so that another officer will need to check who is leaving the area when it is unlocked. The elevator has also been secured and can only be activated with a key.

Jamaluddian and Salman are now likely to face a barrage of charges including vandalism, police battery and escaping from legal custody.

<h1>2008 Taste of Taiwan Cuisine: A complex to redefine Taiwan's MICE industry</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2008%20Taste%20of%20Taiwan%20Cuisine%3A%20A%20complex%20to%20redefine%20Taiwan%27s%20MICE%20industry&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Ever since the Taste of Taiwan Cuisine, a complex to promote the MICE (&lt;a href="w%3Ameeting"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Atravel"&gt;incentive travel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aconference"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Aexhibition"&gt;exhibition&lt;/a&gt;) and cultural industries in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; exclusively in June, made its initiation at 2006, the tourism ratio from foreigners were progressively increased in this complex event.

To bring up the MICE industry, &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;Taiwan External Trade Development Council&lt;/a&gt; (TAITRA), the event organizer, arranged several key events including &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20Trade%20Shows"&gt;Taipei Trade Shows&lt;/a&gt;, travel packages, views, and conferences for international businesspeople. This effectively redefined the MICE industry in Taiwan during the event.

<h3>Trade show &amp; conferences: Where buyers discussed from.</h3>

As the 2008 WiMAX Expo Taipei and COMPUTEX Taipei jointly showcased in the &lt;a href="Taipei%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;Taipei World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; Hall 1 - 3, Taipei International Convention Center, and &lt;a href="TWTC%20Nangang"&gt;TWTC Nangang&lt;/a&gt;, the potential of &lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20communication%20technology"&gt;ICT&lt;/a&gt; industry in Taiwan were demonstrated to drive more discussions between international businesspeople during the show hours and conferences.

Products related to current incidents including energy-efficiency, environmental-friendly, and low-prices were highly respected from industrial businesspeople. In addition to several forums and seminars, topical issues including environment and energy-saving were also mentioned during the shows.

Apart from seminars and trade shows, since the TWTC Nangang was launched on March 13, the venue brought opportunities for several industries. As the government claimed to promote the MICE industry positively, Taiwan will keep its stable position on international sourcing center in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; with more trade shows expanded to TWTC Nangang.

<h3>Culture: Its potential were, but figure?</h3>

Culinary, historical ancestry, natural views, and country images, are key factors to demonstrate the culture of a nation. Different from them, the creativity and innovations showcased another style in its [cultural] industry.

A good example was the organization of three theme shows for food and packaging industries - "Food Taipei", "Foodtech Taipei", and "Taipei Pack", a collective with different cultures from twenty-seven countries including &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Fiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, and six nations from &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;.

Not only the shows, the TAITRA also provided several special coupon cards for international businesspeople to discount in several local department stores, hotels, tourism views, and gourmet stores to rise up the tourism industry.

Although the tourism industry was firmly prosper as trade shows went smoothly, but when a great shows took place at Taipei World Trade Center, it still exposed a major problem on transportation although Walter Yeh, Vice President of TAITRA, ever emphasized to improve this critical issue in a press conference.

A final report by the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AAviation%20Accident%20Investigation%20Branch"&gt;Aviation Accident Investigation Branch&lt;/a&gt; (AAIB) has found that a &lt;a href="w%3ALOT%20Polish%20Airlines"&gt;LOT Polish Airlines&lt;/a&gt; airliner became lost over &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; airspace due to &lt;a href="w%3Apilot%20error"&gt;pilot error&lt;/a&gt;. After a navigational system failed due to a mistake entering the jet's position the plane struggled to return to &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Heathrow%20Airport"&gt;London Heathrow&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Traffic%20Control"&gt;Air Traffic Control&lt;/a&gt;'s guidance as the &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; pilots struggled to understand &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;.

LOT Flight 282, a &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737&lt;/a&gt;, was carrying 89 passengers bound for &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, but ran into trouble immediately after takeoff because the co-pilot entered an Easterly longitude instead of a Westerly one. The error occurred because Heathrow is just to the West of the nearby &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Meridian%20Line"&gt;Prime Meridian Line&lt;/a&gt;.

The navigational equipment was unable to function properly and shut down as a result, forcing the pilots to rely on ATC instructions. The pilot-in-command handled radio communications while the co-pilot flew the aircraft. However, the aircraft wandered lost around the surrounding airspace for the next 27 minutes because the pilots had such a poor grasp of English.

The pilots, who still had some standby instruments functioning, were unable to follow the instructions and several times the aircraft was turned in the exact opposite direction to that commanded by ATC. A full transcript of communications between the plane and the controllers shows at one point ATC was forced to ask "At what heading do you think you are flying at the moment?"
The jet also forced another aircraft to take evasive action after triggering a &lt;a href="w%3AShort%20Term%20Conflict%20Alert"&gt;Short Term Conflict Alert&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the emergency, the crew finally made visual contact with the runway at Heathrow and landed safely.

The pilots had no idea what caused the instrument failure and suggested it may be &lt;a href="w%3Amobile%20phones%20on%20aircraft"&gt;mobile phone interference&lt;/a&gt; but testing revealed no anomalies with the aircraft systems. The report found that "A fairly simple error...went undetected and led to a serious incident."

It went on to say that "An incident like this demonstrates how reliant pilots have become on the &lt;a href="w%3AFlight%20Management%20System"&gt;Flight Management System&lt;/a&gt;." The FMS is a central semi-automated control system that handles navigation and positioning, amongst other duties.

The report also says that the close proximity of all London's airports to the Meridian Line "can lead crews to make such co-ordinate entry errors of this nature," and that as LOT rarely uses airports to the West of the line they will usually only deal with Easterly co-ordinates. 

Criticism is also levelled at ATC, who the report says should have been quicker to realise the serious nature of the problems on board the aircraft. The entity running the control tower says they intend to use this incident for training purposes.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20News"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Washington bureau chief, senior vice president and the moderator of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMeet%20the%20Press"&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Russert"&gt;Tim Russert&lt;/a&gt; has died today after a sudden heart attack at ♡❤NBC♡❤♡s Washington news bureau. He was rushed to Sibley Memorial Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, where resuscitation efforts failed.

Russert was recording voiceovers for ♡❤Meet the Press♡❤ when he collapsed. Russert and his family had recently returned from Italy after celebrating his son Luke's graduation from &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20College"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt;. He is survived by his wife &lt;a href="w%3AMaureen%20Orth"&gt;Maureen Orth&lt;/a&gt;, son Luke, and father, who he knew fondly as "Big Russ", as illustrated in his best selling book, "Big Russ and Me."

A &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; native, Russert graduated from John Carroll University and Cleveland-Marshall College of Law before entering politics. He was also a member of the bar in New York and Washington, D.C. 

Russert entered politics as former New York Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Cuomo"&gt;Mario Cuomo&lt;/a&gt;'s press secretary and was the chief of staff to former Senator &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Patrick%20Moynihan"&gt;Daniel Patrick Moynihan&lt;/a&gt;. Russert joined ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20News"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in 1984, directed broadcasts of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AToday%20%28show%29"&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ program, and went on to lead ♡❤NBC News♡❤ broadcasts from South America, Australia and China in 1986 and 1987. 

He took over the role as ♡❤Meet the Press♡❤, a &lt;a href="w%3ASunday%20morning%20talk%20shows"&gt;Sunday morning talk show&lt;/a&gt;, in 1991. His 16 1/2 years as moderator exceeded those of other hosts of the sixty year old public affairs show. His tenure in the position extended over the terms of three different U.S. presidents, George H. W. Bush, &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Magazine"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ named him one of the world's one-hundred most influential people in 2008.

Russert was a very meritorious journalist, winning an &lt;a href="w%3AEmmy%20Award"&gt;Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt; for his coverage of the funeral of President Ronald Reagan. A very decorated journalist, Russert received forty-eight honorary doctorates and was a member of the Broadcasting &amp; Cable Hall of Fame.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n airline &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Blue"&gt;Virgin Blue&lt;/a&gt; plans to increase its fares, making for an average additional &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;5-10 charge to most airfares. The airline will also cease its &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AProsperine%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Prosperine&lt;/a&gt; route in July 2008 and &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; route in August 2008 in order to cut costs due to the airline's rising fuel bill.

Virgin Blue's fuel costs have risen above A$500 million, which is up 21 per cent as compared to the last financial year. The cut backs will also see 4 of the airline's aircraft removed from its fleet and an immediate wage freeze to all management staff.

Virgin Blue CEO Brett Godfrey said that the move was part of a A$50 million package of cost savings and capacity cuts.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that, in a surprising turn of events, the city of &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, has ordered and begun an emergency demolition on a three story 19th century stable which partially collapsed on Wednesday June 11 causing at least five homes to be evacuated. Residents are not happy, and despite the short notice of the demolition, nearly 30 people showed up to protest it. Demolition was not supposed to begin until Monday June 16.

At about 2:30 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;) on June 13, demolition crew arrived at the stable located at 428 Jersey Avenue and began to unload heavy equipment which will be used to demolish the building. This came as a surprise to residents, as demolition was not supposed to start until Monday June 16.

During the early afternoon hours on June 11, the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Buffalo Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; was called to scene after residents called &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt; stating that part of the building had collapsed. Material from the building fell into the yards of at least three neighboring houses. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.

At about 3:30 p.m. crews began to demolish a small portion of the stable located behind Joe Murray's home, a resident who lives behind a portion of the building on Jersey and Richmond avenues. While demolition was taking place, the section collapsed into Murray's backyard, prompting a call to police. Some residents who own home surrounding the building were inside Murray's house holding a neighborhood meeting when demolition began. No one was injured when the section collapsed.

"[The building] can come down any minute," stated Donna Berry of the Buffalo Police Department who also added that when police arrived on scene, they immediately put a stop to demolition, fearing the safety of surrounding residents and pedestrians.

"So many [of the] people [living around the building] are at risk, it makes me want to cry," added Berry.

Police, local politicians and area residents are concerned that demolition crews and the city are not taking the proper precautions to ensure the safety of residents during demolition.

"[There is] no protection for neighbors. [This is] appalling and beyond negligence," stated Tim Tielman, Executive Director of the Campaign for Buffalo who was referring to the negligence of the demolition crew.

"[In order to stop demolition] citizens must demonstrate direct harm to themselves," added Tielman.

The city's preservation board held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue. Wikinews has learned that the owner of the building, Bob Freudenheim, gave the city permission to demolish the building because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim was part-owner of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and was also an advocate to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered. He also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built.

Tielman states that he was in contact with Freudenheim this morning. Tielman states that Freudenheim "is not spending a dime" to have the building renovated. Tielman states that Freudenheim has offered to sell the building to any interested party for only one &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US dollar&lt;/a&gt;, but that he "flip flops [his decision] constantly," sometimes wanting hundreds of thousands of dollars for the building. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has attempted to contact Freudenheim, but so far has been unsuccessful.

City building inspectors were also on scene evaluating the building and ensuring the safety of residents. Donald Grezebielucina states that "some people are on notice to vacate their properties", but also stated that no other precautions were being taken other than placing "tires and scaffolding" onto the side of 430 Jersey, which sits less than eight feet from the buildings East side.

"The gas has been shut off in case we lost the building, so there would be no explosions or anything like that. It's so unstable, the structural integrity is gone. The chemical composite of the trusses has changed dramatically and dry rotted. There are three vehicles in the basement which totally disappeared," stated Grezebielucina to the press while protesters yelled "save our building, save our neighborhood."

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has also learned that local residents have consulted a lawyer regarding the issue, and hope to petition the New York State Supreme court to issue an injunction to stop demolition. They states that Freudenheim should be "100% responsible" for his actions, and many are afraid that once the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished. Freudenheim is facing housing violations for neglecting the building. Though residents are fighting, Tielman states that "an injunction is unlikely."

"We had a letter of violation against him. He was supposed to have started work to stabilize the brick this Monday. We all hope this building could be saved. But we've got five houses evacuated and we cannot tolerate any further delay. We've got to get people back into their homes in a safe condition," said Richard Tobe, Commissioner of the city's Permit and Inspection Services.

Demolition is set to resume at 8:00 a.m.in the morning of Saturday June 14.

Mike Lombardo, the Commissioner for the Buffalo Fire Department, believes that the building was built in 1812 or 1814, making it nearly 200 years old. It is one of only three stables still standing in the city.

&lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; and cash on delivery policy was blocked on Friday by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Competition%20and%20Consumer%20Commission"&gt;Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&lt;/a&gt; (ACCC) after it released a draft ruling citing that it was an "anti-competitive effect" and calling on eBay to postpone its policy which is due to take effect next week.

ACCC's final ruling is still pending however it is unusual for the ACCC to reverse draft rulings once issued.

In a statement eBay said that it was "disappointed" by the ruling and that "eBay believes the consumer benefits of this initiative are worth fighting for on behalf of its buyers which will ultimately benefit sellers."

&lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2080%20in%20Iowa"&gt;Interstate 80&lt;/a&gt; is closed in &lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20County%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Cedar County, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, east of the &lt;a href="w%3AIowa%20City%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Iowa City&lt;/a&gt; area, due to flooding from the &lt;a href="w%3AIowa%20River"&gt;Iowa River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACoralville%20Lake"&gt;Coralville Lake&lt;/a&gt;. The flooding that has devastated cities in eastern Iowa has travelled downstream and is now threatening Iowa City and &lt;a href="w%3ACoralville%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Coralville&lt;/a&gt;, both of which have issued evacuations for low-lying areas. Flooding on the &lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20River%20%28Iowa%29"&gt;Cedar River&lt;/a&gt; earlier filled &lt;a href="w%3AWaterloo%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Waterloo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20Falls%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Cedar Falls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20Rapids%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Cedar Rapids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, with record-breaking water levels. 

Interstate 80 is closed between mile markers 266 and 267, with a 281-mile long detour to get around it: Eastbound through traffic must leave I-80 at &lt;a href="w%3ADes%20Moines%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Des Moines&lt;/a&gt; and travel north along &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2035"&gt;Interstate 35&lt;/a&gt; then east to &lt;a href="w%3ADubuque%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Dubuque&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Route%2020"&gt;U.S. Route 20&lt;/a&gt;, where it can move south along &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Route%2061"&gt;U.S. Route 61&lt;/a&gt; to return to Interstate 80 at the &lt;a href="w%3AQuad%20Cities"&gt;Quad Cities&lt;/a&gt;, with westbound through traffic following the opposite route. Local traffic is being allowed, since this shuts off a 150-mile stretch of highway.

&lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%20380%20%28Iowa%29"&gt;Interstate 380&lt;/a&gt; has also been closed, between mile markers 4 and 10, due to flooding from the Iowa River and Lake Coralville. This, combined with the flooding of the bridges across the Cedar River at Cedar Rapids, effectively cuts Cedar Rapids off from Iowa City; the only way between the two cities, normally 30 miles apart, is a 281-mile long detour that takes drivers through Des Moines.

The Cedar River at Cedar Rapids crested today at a record-breaking 31.1 feet, nearly 20 feet above flood stage. The Iowa River is expected to crest at Iowa City at 33 feet, 11 feet over flood stage and 4.5 feet over the record, on the morning of June 17.

<h1>Foam manufacturer settles for US$25 million over Station nightclub fire</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Foam%20manufacturer%20settles%20for%20US%2425%20million%20over%20Station%20nightclub%20fire&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Sealed Air Corporation, a packaging company based in &lt;a href="w%3AElmwood%20Park"&gt;Elmwood Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to settle legal action over &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Station%20nightclub%20fire"&gt;the Station nightclub fire&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ARhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; in February 2003. The disaster killed 100 people with more than twice as many injured and this settlement is one of a series over the blaze.

The fire was triggered by pyrotechnics in use by &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20White"&gt;Great White&lt;/a&gt; who were performing at the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Warwick"&gt;West Warwick&lt;/a&gt; venue at the time. They ignited flammable soundproofing foam on the walls.

The latest settlement brings the total amount of settlements to $148.815 million, although all of these settlements are still tentative and subject to approval by families and a judge. Other companies that have already settled include Clear Channel Broadcasting, whose rock radio station was the show's promoter, &lt;a href="w%3AAnheuser-Busch"&gt;Anheuser-Busch&lt;/a&gt; Inc., The Home Depot Inc., a pyrotechnics manufacturer and several other foam companies.

Others still defending in the case, which names dozens of groups and individuals, include Rhode Island state, the fire inspector that did not enforce regulations at the club, and American Foam Corporation, who sold more foam to the Derderian brothers. 

The Derderians bought the club in 2000, whereas the foam allegedly manufactured by Sealed Air was installed in 1996. Sealed Air deny any wrongdoing, saying it was never proven that they indeed manufactured the foam and that the foam was being misused as soundproofing in any event.

Regardless of the origin of the foam, it was argued that it burned too easily and produced toxic fumes when it did.

The criminal case around the fire was resolved in 2006, with the Derderians and Great White tour manager Daniel Biechele - who ignited the pyrotechnics - charged with &lt;a href="w%3Ainvoluntary%20manslaughter"&gt;involuntary manslaughter&lt;/a&gt;. The Derderians pleaded &lt;a href="w%3Ano%20contest"&gt;no contest&lt;/a&gt; and Biechele pleaded guilty.

Biechele was released on parole and Michael Derderian is due for parole next year. His brother was sentenced only to probation and community service.

Sealed Air's insurance will pay the settlement.

<h3>Opposition leader in Zimbabwe arrested again</h3>

Morgan Tsvangirai has been arrested again according to his party, the &lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20for%20Democratic%20Change"&gt;Movement for Democratic Change.&lt;/a&gt;. The police detention of Tsvangirai and 11 co-workers occurred in Shurugwi, but all were released after three hours. In the past week, the MDC leader was arrested four times as Zimbabwe approaches the June 27 secondary elections to determine if he, or incumbent President &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt; will receive a clear majority of votes.

<h3>R. Kelly found not guilty on charges of child pornography</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3AR.%20Kelly"&gt;R. Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, a popular American &lt;a href="w%3AR%26amp%3BB"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; musician has been found not guilty on all 14 charges involving a videotape of him having sex with a minor. Both Kelly and the girl who was alleged to be his partner both denied they were participants in the video recording. Had the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;-based trial jury convicted the singer, he could have faced a 15-year prison term.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABristol%2C%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Bristol, United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The most complete dinosaur to be found in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has recently been put on public display. The &lt;a href="w%3Ascelidosaurus"&gt;scelidosaurus&lt;/a&gt; dinosaur was discovered on the Dorset coast, from which it was moved to &lt;a href="w%3ABristol%20City%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery"&gt;Bristol City Museum &amp; Art Gallery&lt;/a&gt; for public display. The director of Geology for the museum said, before the display was opened to the public, that "this is certainly a coup for Bristol." He then said that the museum was "pleased to have these outstanding specimens, [as] they are the best-preserved dinosaur remains ever found in England."

Large numbers of people have visited the museum in the last few days to see the dinosaur, which is believed to have died in a flood. The remains of the dinosaur's final meal are visible near the neck of the animal.

The children of the dinosaur were also recovered in Dorset, and they have been included in the display at the &lt;a href="Bristol%20"&gt;Bristol &lt;/a&gt; museum. 

The scelidosaurus was a &lt;a href="w%3Aherbivorous"&gt;herbivorous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Adinosaur"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt; that lived in the &lt;a href="w%3AJurassic"&gt;Jurassic&lt;/a&gt; period, almost 200 million years ago.

<h1>Temporary restraining order stops demolition of partially collapsed building in Buffalo, New York</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Temporary%20restraining%20order%20stops%20demolition%20of%20partially%20collapsed%20building%20in%20Buffalo%2C%20New%20York&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
In an exclusive report, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that a restraining order won by area residents has temporarily stopped the emergency demolition of a three story building which partially collapsed on Wednesday, June 11, 2008 in &lt;a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;. The collapse caused at least 15 homes surrounding the property to be evacuated

During the early afternoon hours on June 11, the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Buffalo Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; was called to scene at 428 Jersey Avenue after residents called &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt; stating that part of a building had collapsed. A large portion of a former livery and stable had collapsed into the yards of at least four houses that surround the stable. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.

According to ♡❤savethelivery.com♡❤, a website set up and dedicated to "saving part of this historic structure", the restraining order was granted on Saturday, forcing demolition crews to halt their work. The site also states that court papers will be filed on Monday in an attempt to hold the owner Bob Freudenheim responsible for the damage done to the building, and surrounding properties. The site states that Freudenheim has neglected the building for "the last twenty years."

"We are an outraged and responsibly concerned group of neighbors and citizens who have rallied to oppose the impending demolition of the historic White Brothers Livery and Boarding Stable at 428 Jersey Street, just west of Richmond Avenue," says the site's mission statement. They seek to evaluate all options to saving the building before demolishing it, find immediate support to stop any further collapse, hold Freudenheim personally responsible for "endangering the public safety, and compensation of the city and neighbors for expenses incurred by being displaced from their homes." They also want the city to personally inspect any and all properties he owns and for him to surrender the stable to an interested party who would restore it.
Freudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built.

According to city officials, Freudenheim is facing housing violations for neglecting the building. Residents state that Freudenheim should be "100% responsible" for his actions, and many are afraid that once the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished.

Although a restraining order is in place, residents still fear that demolition crews will attempt to continue demolition. As a result, police have a permanent detail on location to make sure everyone including both protesters and residents, follow the law.

A rally is planned to take place today at 1:00 p.m. for anyone interested in saving the building.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Government&lt;/a&gt; is to lobby Asian counties to reduce fuel subsidies and price caps in a bid to lower fuel prices, which the Government argues that fuel subsidies are artificially inflating fuel prices across the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Pacific"&gt;Asia-Pacific&lt;/a&gt; region.

&lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20Resources%20and%20Energy%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Resources and Energy Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Ferguson"&gt;Martin Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; said that the &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Rudd Government&lt;/a&gt; does not want to be critical of countries which have used the subsidies to help promote development, however he said that "the challenge of dealing with energy subsidies in our region is a serious one".

Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Robb"&gt;Andrew Robb&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News%20Australia"&gt;Sky News Australia&lt;/a&gt; that "it was a bit presumptuous of Australia to be lecturing Asian countries". 

"The best thing for us is to look at our own affairs in the first instance, that way you then have some credibility in lecturing others".

People in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; yesterday were surprised to see hundreds of cyclists in varying degrees of nakedness riding through the city as the annual London Naked Bike Ride took place, one of many other rides as part of &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Naked%20Bike%20Ride"&gt;World Naked Bike Ride&lt;/a&gt;. The ride was intended to protest against oil dependency and celebrate cycling and the human body.

The ride took a route past many well known landmarks in London, starting from &lt;a href="w%3AHyde%20Park%20Corner"&gt;Hyde Park Corner&lt;/a&gt; then going via locations including &lt;a href="w%3ATrafalgar%20Square"&gt;Trafalgar Square&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AHouses%20of%20Parliament"&gt;Houses of Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Eye"&gt;London Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACovent%20Garden"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20Street"&gt;Oxford Street&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; embassy and returning to Hyde Park Corner, finishing at the &lt;a href="w%3AWellington%20Arch"&gt;Wellington Arch&lt;/a&gt;.

Described as a &lt;a href="w%3Aclothing-optional%20bike%20ride"&gt;clothing-optional bike ride&lt;/a&gt;, participants ranged from being fully clothed to &lt;a href="w%3Afull%20nudity"&gt;full nudity&lt;/a&gt; and were of a broad range of ages and ethnicities. Nudity is encouraged but is not mandatory. 

Whilst &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20nudity"&gt;public nudity&lt;/a&gt; in itself isn't illegal in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aindecent%20exposure"&gt;indecent exposure&lt;/a&gt; is an offence where the person exposes their &lt;a href="w%3Agenitals"&gt;genitals&lt;/a&gt; and "intends that someone will see them and be caused alarm or distress" and as such participants were unlikely to be at risk of &lt;a href="w%3Aarrest"&gt;arrest&lt;/a&gt;. Police officers riding bikes worked to facilitate the passage of the cyclists through the city whilst minimising disruption.

Over 50 people have been confirmed dead and at least one million people have fled from their homes as a result of heavy flooding across much of southern &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

In the &lt;a href="w%3AGuangdong"&gt;Guangdong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJiangxi"&gt;Jiangxi&lt;/a&gt; provinces alone, at least 6,000 homes have been submerged and destroyed by the flood.

Further rainfall is expected to occur throughout the next ten days.

The &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Meteorological%20Administration"&gt;China Meteorological Administration&lt;/a&gt; (CMA) has issued a warning on the situation. "Faced with the increasingly severe rain and flood situation, at 16 o’clock of June 12, Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters of Guangxi urgently started level 2 flood control emergency response and required the relevant departments and places to prepare immediately so as to ensure the work of flood control and drought relief," the CMA said in a statement released on Friday.

Different from the past three years, 2008 the 4th-annual Taipei 101 Run Up was held earlier in the top half of 2008 today (June 15). Approximately 2,500 people, world-class runners, corporate teams and individual people, participated in the challenge to climb 2046 steps (390 meters height), 91 floors at this race. Chinese Taipei Road Running Association (CTRRA), the race organizer, set up the "&lt;a href="w%3AChampionChip"&gt;ChampionChip&lt;/a&gt;" timing system and recruited several local volunteers for the floor service from vast industries.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; cyclist &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Crake"&gt;Paul Crake&lt;/a&gt; was paralyzed from a spinal injury, suffered in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, and &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; runner &lt;a href="w%3Ade%3AAndrea%20Mayr"&gt;Andrea Mayr&lt;/a&gt; wasn't able to retain her title in this race, the state of Elite Group became more and more uncertain although several international media focused on competitions between &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; runner &lt;a href="w%3Ait%3AMarco%20De%20Gasperi"&gt;Marco De Gasperi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; runner &lt;a href="w%3Ade%3AThomas%20Dold"&gt;Thomas Dold&lt;/a&gt;.

Finally, Thomas Dold defeated Marco De Gasperi by 46 seconds with a time of 10 min and 53 seconds in the Men's Elite Group, Taiwanese runner Jenny Hsiao-yu Li got her first title in Women's Elite Group with a time of 14 min and 53 seconds, and Taipei City Fire Department still retained their title in Enterprise Group in this race.

After the race, Jenny Li spoke to media about this race: "The re-arrangement of the race must be a critical factor to cause the actual strengths of elite runners changed rapidly. Not only did I, but some of [elite] runners also regressed on their score." In addition, Stephen M. Young, Director of the Taipei office of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Institute%20in%20Taiwan"&gt;American Institute in Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, also commented this race to media: "When participating in this race, a regular mental condition should be developed. Don't think too much! Just do the best. If fully prepared, a great result will be accomplished."

<h1>Nepal's royal palace now a public museum</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Nepal%27s%20royal%20palace%20now%20a%20public%20museum&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANarayanhity%20Royal%20Palace"&gt;Narayanhity Royal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, home to &lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;'s kings for over a century, was today converted into a public museum, further signifying the country's recent transition from a &lt;a href="w%3Amonarchy"&gt;monarchy&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="w%3Arepublic"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;. 

At a brief ceremony, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGirija%20Prasad%20Koirala"&gt;Girija Prasad Koirala&lt;/a&gt; hoisted the &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Nepal"&gt;national flag&lt;/a&gt; where previously only the royal flag had flown, and unveiled a plaque reading "Narayanhity National Museum". Proclaiming the museum as belonging to the people, Koirala said, "Today the son of a common people has hoisted the country's flag in this palace. Now Nepal has entered a new era."

Nepal's deposed king &lt;a href="w%3AGyanendra"&gt;Gyanendra&lt;/a&gt; vacated the palace on Wednesday, after the newly elected Constituent Assembly voted to abolish the 239-year-old monarchy on May 28. He then moved to Nagarjuna Palace, a summer home on the outskirts of the capital &lt;a href="w%3AKathmandu"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt;, where he is now living as a civilian. However, this home is only a temporary one, and he will soon be asked by the government to leave it as well.
Prime Minister Koirala said he was glad the transition occurred peacefully. "The world's eyes are on Nepal for the unique example it created of proclaiming a republic without any bloodshed," he said. He also thanked the former king for "understanding the desire and expectation of the people by voluntarily moving out to live an exile-like life." Koirala also addressed the need to focus on more pressing issues, such as drafting a new constitution and choosing a new federal structure.

The process began around two years ago, when a national uprising forced the king to relinquish the absolute power he had installed and to reinstate the parliament. In late 2007, the parliament agreed to declare Nepal a republic, which was to be implemented after the April 2008 elections. The &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Nepal%20%28Maoist%29"&gt;Maoists&lt;/a&gt;, who had been fighting against the monarchy for over 10 years, won the majority of seats, and the monarchy was officially ended in an overwhelming vote.

Despite the ceremony, Narayanhity National Museum is not yet open to the public. Nepali home minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula said, "After proper preparation, the palace will be opened to the public in two to three months." There are some differing opinions of what to do with the museum; Nepal's national library wants the museum to include a national archives of important documents, while others want to develop the museum into a major tourist attraction.

Officials say the museum will likely include the king's crown, sceptre, and royal throne, as well as a 1939 &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt; given to Gyanendra's grandfather by &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Hitler"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;. "The car will be a major attraction there,", said Govinda Kusum, a senior Home Ministry official. &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Tribhuvan"&gt;King Tribhuvan&lt;/a&gt; used to ride the Mercedes when there were no other cars in the country, and it currently lies on the palace grounds, after an engineering college in Kathmandu said they didn't have enough money to restore it.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Residents in &lt;a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; fear that demolishing a nearly 200-year-old livery and stable which partially collapsed on Wednesday June 11, could cause an environmental hazard.
♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that according property records with the city, the stable was converted into a gasoline station and auto repair shop in 1950, and is designated as a body shop. During that time at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property. Two are listed as 550 square feet while the other two are 2,000 square feet. All of the tanks are designated as a TK4, which &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; State says is used for "below ground horizontal bulk fuel storage." The cost of installing a tank of that nature according to the state, at that time, included the tank itself, "excavation and backfill," but did not include "the piping, ballast, or hold-down slab orring."

Property reports give the tanks a 'construction code' of a "C - Average", meaning the tanks were not designed to last for a significant period of time. That rating has residents concerned that the tanks could pose an environmental hazard if they are not properly taken care of.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has not been able to determine if the tanks have been removed or if they were emptied when the gas station closed sometime in the 1980's. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has also contacted the city of Buffalo for a comment regarding the tanks, but has yet to receive a response.

The building was scheduled for emergency demolition on Thursday June 12, but was stopped by police after residents raised concerns for the safety of those living around the building. According to New York law, since the city ordered the demolition, they are required to perform an 'Environmental Impact Assessment' or SEQR when a project or demolition has the possibility of posing an environmental hazard.

According to New York law, a SEQR should be performed "to incorporate the consideration of environmental factors into the existing planning, review and decision-making processes of state, regional and local government agencies at the earliest possible time. To accomplish this goal, SEQR requires that all agencies determine whether the actions they directly undertake, fund or approve may have a significant impact on the environment, and, if it is determined that the action may have a significant adverse impact, prepare or request an environmental impact statement."

The law states, "SEQR requires the sponsoring or approving governmental body to identify and mitigate the significant environmental impacts of the activity it is proposing or permitting." It also states that it is the duty of the governmental body in charge of a project to enforce the laws of the SEQR. It also states that agencies must give "appropriate weight with social and economic considerations" when undergoing major projects.

The law also allows citizens to enforce the regulation stating, "citizens or groups who can demonstrate that they may be harmed by this failure [SEQR], may take legal action against the agency" or governmental body behind such a project. The court system in New York has been known to "consistently" rule in favor of plaintiffs who file lawsuits against agencies who do not perform a SEQR.

Residents won a restraining order to stop demolition after State Supreme Court Justice Judge John. F. O’Donnell signed a temporary injunction. Residents are concerned demolition crews moved too fast, and are not doing enough to protect them and their surrounding properties. They are also concerned that the city did not consider all the options or risks before ordering the building to be demolished.

On June 15, Judge Jerome C. Gorski ruled that the city can resume demolition, but "on a limited basis" only to remove fallen rubble that landed on properties, and to remove any loose bricks or material from the building, but not below its truss line. Because of the risk of further collapse, the workers are ordered "to use only hand tools." to remove the loose material and debris. Residents are attempting to save portions of the building's side walls and its facade. The demolition crew began to remove some materials, as ordered by the court on Tuesday, June 17.

Judge Gorski also ordered that the plaintiffs present their case in front the State's Supreme Court in &lt;a href="w%3ARochester%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Rochester&lt;/a&gt;. The hearing took place on Monday morning on June 16 at 10:00 a.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;), and the case is currently "being discussed," said an anonymous source close to the lawsuit to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.

Bob Freudenheim is the building's owner who has housing violations against him for neglecting the building. Residents state that Freudenheim should be "100% responsible" for his actions, and many are afraid that once the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWGRZ"&gt;WGRZ&lt;/a&gt; Channel 2 News,♡❤ in the past three months, Freudenheim has received at least five housing code violations from the city. ♡❤WGRZ♡❤ states that the orders, which they obtained, were to fix the building "to a safe condition."

Freudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built.

Freudenheim has not released a statement, and ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has not been able to contact him regarding the issue.

The "2008 Research @ Intel Day" showcased conceptual innovations in the fields of visual computing, wireless, health care, environment, and life sciences.

Last Wednesday, &lt;a href="Intel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; said it is investing some of its $6 billion research budget in the &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20History%20Museum"&gt;Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20View%2C%20California"&gt;Mountain View, California&lt;/a&gt;.

Technology related to mobile computing, green technology, WiMAX and wireless networking, solutions for healthcare with SHIMMER and BioMOBIUS technology, an intelligent identification robot named "BarKeep", and Platform Power Management, were showcased there.

In the keynote address, &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Rattner"&gt;Justin Rattner&lt;/a&gt;, Intel Senior Fellow and Corporate Vice President and director of Intel's Corporate Technology Group, introduced the history of &lt;a href="w%3Amicroprocessor"&gt;microprocessor&lt;/a&gt;s and said: "Parallel Computing will be a critical factor on programming for the best experience to users."

The gas crisis in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; continues to deepen with more businesses standing people down without pay. Businesses have been instructed to turn off non-essential items including limiting the number of lifts and reduced lighting; domestic customers are also urged to reduce energy use. 

In the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAustralian%20Government"&gt;Federal parliament&lt;/a&gt; today Resources Minister &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMartin%20Ferguson"&gt;Martin Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; raised the prospect of activating the ♡❤Liquid Fuel Emergency Act♡❤. "During such a situation, I can control the production, transfer and stock levels of crude and liquid fuel...While I sincerely hope that this will not be required, the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act provides authority for the Australian Government to prepare for and manage a national liquid fuel supply emergency," he said.

Western Australian Premier &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAlan%20Carpenter"&gt;Alan Carpenter&lt;/a&gt; called on all Western Australians to reduce energy usage, saying that the situation could be managed with on going co-operation, while reassuring everyone that the crisis will be short, with the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AApache%20Corporation"&gt;Apache Corporation&lt;/a&gt; expected to begin partial operations in two months. Supplies were interrupted after a fire at Apache's &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AVanarus%20Island"&gt;Vanarus Island&lt;/a&gt; refinery, which supplied 30% of the state's &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANatural%20Gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; requirements.

An &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAlinta%20Gas"&gt;Alinta&lt;/a&gt; spokesman has said that with the expected cold weather during the next week demand will put further pressure on supplies, advising that it is critical that all consumers limit energy usage.

Alinta requests that residential customers;
<ul>
BULLET::::- use only essential heating and limit it to one room
BULLET::::- turn down hot water system by 10 degrees
BULLET::::- reduce shower times
BULLET::::- wash in cold water.

</ul>
While suggesting small businesses;
<ul>
BULLET::::- shift production schedules
BULLET::::- bring forward maintenance and shut down schedules
BULLET::::- turn off equipment not essential to the business.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that &lt;a href="w%3AEli%C3%A1n%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20affair"&gt;Elián González&lt;/a&gt; was among the 18,000 youths who joined Cuba's Young Communist Union on Saturday. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJuventud%20Rebelde%20%28newspaper%29"&gt;Juventud Rebelde&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the communist youth newspaper, quoted González as saying that he will never let down ex-president &lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; and his brother, &lt;a href="Raul%20Castro"&gt;Raul Castro&lt;/a&gt;.

An international custody battle centering around González became the focus of much media attention eight years ago. The boy had survived a boating accident when he and his mother fled &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; to go to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. His mother did not survive the accident. 

Elián González turns 15 in December.

A &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAviator"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; has safely ejected from his &lt;a href="w%3ABAE%20Harrier%20II"&gt;Harrier GR7 aircraft&lt;/a&gt; moments before it crashed in a field near the small village of &lt;a href="w%3AAshwell%2C%20Rutland"&gt;Ashwell&lt;/a&gt; in the county of &lt;a href="w%3ARutland"&gt;Rutland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The crash occurred at about 1350 &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Summer%20Time"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; today. 

The pilot was taken by &lt;a href="w%3Aair%20ambulance"&gt;air ambulance&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Medical%20Centre"&gt;Queen's Medical Centre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANottingham"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt; for treatment for spinal injuries. 

Local resident Vic Harrison spoke to the BBC about the incident: "I thought he didn't stand a chance, but I looked up and saw the parachute of the pilot. I really thought he had hit the houses. It was a narrow miss - it must have been just 400 yards from our house. It has been an exceptionally lucky escape."

The plane, from the nearby &lt;a href="w%3ARAF%20Cottesmore"&gt;RAF Cottesmore&lt;/a&gt; airbase, was on a training mission and is said not to have been carrying any weapons.

<h1>Study raises health concerns about shower curtains</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Study%20raises%20health%20concerns%20about%20shower%20curtains&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Environmental%20Law%20Assocation"&gt;Canadian Environmental Law Assocation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; organization &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Defence"&gt;Environmental Defence&lt;/a&gt; jointly conducted a study that was released to the public on Thursday, saying that chemicals released by new &lt;a href="w%3Avinyl"&gt;vinyl&lt;/a&gt; curtains may pose a significant health risk.

The study noted that many shower curtains contain more than 100 &lt;a href="w%3Avolatile%20organic%20compounds"&gt;volatile organic compounds&lt;/a&gt; (VOCs), &lt;a href="w%3Aphthalates"&gt;phthalates&lt;/a&gt; and organotins, some of which may be released into the air when first taken from a package. These chemicals, responsible for the characteristic smell of new vinyl, may cause damage to kidneys, the liver and the central nervous systems, respiratory problems, nausea, headaches and loss off coordination, according to the report.

These vinyl curtains are also said to contain traces of metals like lead, cadmium and mercury.

Jennifer Foulds of Environmental Defence advises consumers to seek alternatives to new vinyl products such as shower curtains and table cloths. Older products are thought to be safe, as they have already released most of the allegedly dangerous chemicals.

Critics of the study have called it "fear-mongering", and some health professionals agree that the risk is being overblown. Warren Foster, a professor in the obstetrics and gynecology department at &lt;a href="w%3AMcMaster%20University"&gt;McMaster University&lt;/a&gt; in Hamilton, &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; points out that, "the difference between hazard and risk is great, and without knowing the actual human exposure, it's premature to make any judgement."

Foster further commented that the study was not performed in a rigorous manner by not having controls or random sampling.

Five brands of shower curtain were examined in the study; they were purchased from &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; stores including &lt;a href="w%3ABed%20Bath%20%26amp%3B%20Beyond"&gt;Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKmart"&gt;Kmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASears%2C%20Roebuck%20and%20Company"&gt;Sears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATarget%20Corporation"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt;. Curtains of the same brand are also available in major Canadian stores.

Marion Axmith, director general of the Vinyl Council of Canada calls the report a "blatant attempt to manipulate consumers and retailers into thinking shower curtains pose a danger, and they don't." She noted that, "as far as we know, nobody's ever been harmed by a shower curtain."

Vinyl has long been a point of dispute between environmentalists and those in the chemical industry. A chemical used to make vinyl is known to be a risk for liver and other cancers for chemical plant workers, and the phthalates in vinyl products have been linked to interference with normal male hormone production.

<h1>News briefs:June 16, 2008</h1>
<h2>Scores dead, thousands flee as flooding spreads across southern China</h2>
Over 50 people have been confirmed dead and at least one million people have fled from their homes as a result of heavy flooding across much of southern China.

In the Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces alone, at least 6,000 homes have been submerged and destroyed by the flood.

Further rainfall is expected to occur throughout the next ten days.

<h2>RAF Harrier jet crashes in Rutland, England, pilot survives</h2>
A Royal Navy pilot has safely ejected from his Harrier GR7 aircraft moments before it crashed in a field near the small village of Ashwell in England. The crash occurred at about 1350 BST today.

The pilot was taken by air ambulance to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham for treatment for spinal injuries.

Local resident Vic Harrison spoke to the BBC about the incident: "I thought he didn't stand a chance, but I looked up and saw the parachute of the pilot. I really thought he had hit the houses. It was a narrow miss - it must have been just 400 yards from our house. It has been an exceptionally lucky escape."

The plane, from the nearby RAF Cottesmore airbase, was on a training mission and is said not to have been carrying any weapons.

<h2>Senior intelligence official suspended after leaving top secret files on train</h2>
A senior intelligence official in the United Kingdom has been suspended from his job pending an investigation into top secret documents that were left on a commuter train on Tuesday. The Cabinet Office confirmed that the documents, including reports on Al-Qaeda and Iraqi security forces, had been found on the train and handed in to the offices of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), who turned the files in to police.

According to the BBC, one of the documents, a seven-page report entitled "Al-Qaeda Vulnerabilities", was classified "UK Top Secret" and had every page numbered and labelled "for UK/US/Canadian and Australian eyes only". The other document, "Iraqi Security Forces: More or Less Challenged?", had been commissioned by the Ministry of Defence, which the BBC's security correspondent, Frank Gardner, described as being "damning" in parts. Both were produced by the Joint Intelligence Committee, a government organisation designed to present information from several British intelligence services to ministers and senior officials.

The person believed to be responsible for the breach works for the Cabinet Office's intelligence and security unit, which contributes to the Joint Intelligence Committee. He had authority to take classified documents out of the Cabinet Office, under strict security procedures. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the incident, which the Conservative Party's security spokeswoman, Dame Pauline Neville-Jones called "the latest in a long line of serious breaches of security involving either the loss of data, documents or Government laptops".

The Cabinet Office's admission of the breach came on the same day the UK government voted on a resolution allowing authorities to detain terror suspects for up to 42 days without charge.

<h2>Australian government considers controlling fuel supplies</h2>
The gas crisis in Western Australia deepens with more business standing people down without pay. Businesses have been instructed to turn off non-essential items including limiting the number of lifts and reduced lighting, domestic customers are urged to reduce energy use.

In the Federal parliament today Resources Minister Martin Ferguson raised the prospect of activating the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act, saying "During such a situation, I can control the production, transfer and stock levels of crude and liquid fuel...While I sincerely hope that this will not be required, the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act provides authority for the Australian Government to prepare for and manage a national liquid fuel emergency supply"

WA Premier Alan Carpenter called on Western Australians to cut back on energy usage saying that situation can be managed with on going co-operation, while reassuring Western Australians that the crisis will be short. Supplies were interupted after a fire at Apache's Vanarus Island refinery which supplied 30% of the states natural gas requirements.

<h2>Temporary restraining order stops demolition of partially collapsed building in Buffalo, New York</h2>
In an exclusive report, Wikinews has learned that a restraining order won by area residents has temporarily stopped the emergency demolition of a three story building which partially collapsed on Wednesday, June 11, 2008 in Buffalo, New York. The collapse caused at least 15 homes surrounding the property to be evacuated

During the early afternoon hours on June 11, the Buffalo Fire Department was called to scene at 428 Jersey Avenue after residents called 9-1-1 stating that part of a building had collapsed. A large portion of a former livery and stable had collapsed into the yards of at least four houses that surround the stable. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.

According to savethelivery.com, a website set up and dedicated to "saving part of this historic structure", the restraining order was granted on Saturday, forcing demolition crews to halt their work. The site also states that court papers will be filed on Monday in an attempt to hold the owner Bob Freudenheim responsible for the damage done to the building, and surrounding properties. The site states that Freudenheim has neglected the building for "the last twenty years."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Al%20Gore%20endorses%20Obama%20for%20US%20President&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Environmental activist and former Vice-President &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; today announced his support for &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.
In an email sent to Obama supporters, Al Gore voices his support for the presumptive nominee. "From now through Election Day," he writes, "I intend to do whatever I can to make sure he is elected President of the United States." He believes that Obama is the candidate who will "bring change to America" in issues such as the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AEconomy%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;American economy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Aclimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;.

"Over the past 18 months, Barack Obama has united a movement," Gore writes. "He knows change does not come from &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ACapitol%20Hill"&gt;Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt;. It begins when people stand up and take action."

Gore also stated his intention to attend a rally with Obama in &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; later that night. Obama was in &lt;a href="w%3AFlint%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Flint&lt;/a&gt; earlier today, where he addressed a crowd of workers at a &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; plant. Obama said Gore was "a visionary, not just for the party, but for the country."

At the rally in Detroit's &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Louis%20Arena"&gt;Joe Louis Arena&lt;/a&gt;, Gore called Obama "the next President of the United States of America" and said he could lead the nation past "eight years in which our &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; has been dishonored and disrespected". He addressed the issue of climate change, which he said many &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; had "refused to discuss at all". 

"The outcome of this election will affect the future of our entire planet," Gore said, adding that "the future is ours, not to predict, but to create." He compared the criticisms of Obama's young age and foreign policy experience to those faced by &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3A1960%20United%20States%20Presidential%20election"&gt;1960 Presidential election&lt;/a&gt;.

Obama spoke next, thanking Al Gore and calling him "a global leader in the fight for a clean energy future". He discussed many issues, including healthcare, education, the national debt, and the war in Iraq. He criticized the way the &lt;a href="w%3ABush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt; has handled these issues, and repeated the oft-heard criticism that McCain is running for Bush's "third term".

"We can't afford 8 more years of George W. Bush policies," Obama said. He said that if there was one thing that could unite the Democrats, it is that "when we go into the polling places in November, the name 'George W. Bush' will not be on the ballot." Obama commended McCain for his service to the country, but said that he "seems to have lost his way" from his reputation as a political maverick. "The Straight Talk Express lost a couple of wheels," he said.

Many of the problems in America "go back for decades," Obama said. "The American people feel that &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20dream"&gt;American dream&lt;/a&gt; slipping away. So we cannot wait... and that is why I am running for President of the United States of America." Between cynicism and faith, Obama says, "I choose hope. I choose faith."

Obama thanked his supporters for helping his campaign, saying that "change in America doesn't happen from the top down; it comes from the bottom up." He also thanked former candidate &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, although many booed at the mention of her name. "She's a fighter," Obama said. "And we need fighters in the Democratic Party because we've got a lot to fight for." Obama and Gore were introduced by Michigan governor &lt;a href="w%3AJennifer%20Granholm"&gt;Jennifer Granholm&lt;/a&gt;, who supported Clinton in the primaries but now says she is supporting Obama.

Al Gore served as Vice-President under President &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; in the '90s, and after losing the &lt;a href="w%3A2000%20United%20States%20Presidential%20election"&gt;2000 Presidential election&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, he focused his efforts on environmental activism. He has won an &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; for his documentary ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAn%20Inconvenient%20Truth"&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, as well as a &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; for his efforts in teaching the public about climate change.

In the &lt;a href="w%3AMidwestern%20United%20States"&gt;Midwestern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, floodwaters contaminated with a toxic brew containing such ingredients as sewage, farm runoff, and petroleum are raising concerns over the availability of clean drinking water. 

Flooding has been reported in the states of &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, with three deaths reported each in Iowa and Indiana, prompting comparisons to similar floods in 1993 that caused &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;21 billion in damages. The flooding in Iowa has resulted in damage to buildings, infrastructure and farms, and governor &lt;a href="w%3AChet%20Culver"&gt;Chet Culver&lt;/a&gt;'s office has estimated that 36,000 people have been made homeless.

Residents of &lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20Rapids"&gt;Cedar Rapids&lt;/a&gt;, Iowa, who had begun returning to their homes to inspect damage and salvage belongings, wade through ankle-deep water that has picked up refuse from farms, sewage, and other noxious chemicals. LeRoy Rippert, chairman of emergency management and homeland security in &lt;a href="w%3ADes%20Moines%20County%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Des Moines County&lt;/a&gt;, was concerned for residents, saying "It is very, very wise to stay out of it. It's as dangerous as anything". Experts in biology and medicine also raised concerns over the floodwater contaminating rural wells and providing breeding grounds for mosquitos. "For rural folks, it's going to be hard to know if their water's safe or not," said G. Richard Olds, chairman of the Medical College of Wisconsin. Ken Sharp, environmental health director for the Iowa Department of Public Health, acknowledged the risks of the contaminated water, but suggested that the sheer volume of water may help to dilute the pollution.

June has seen a number of disasters hit the Midwest, including a tornado that killed four Boy Scouts last week.

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3APremier%20of%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAlan%20Carpenter"&gt;Alan Carpenter&lt;/a&gt; made a two-minute broadcast on all televisions and radio stations over the gas crisis. The crisis began after a major fire at the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AVanarus%20Island"&gt;Vanarus Island&lt;/a&gt; refinery operated by &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AApache%20Corporation"&gt;Apache Corporation&lt;/a&gt; reduced the available &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; by 30%.

During the broadcast which was recorded earlier in the day Premier Carpenter said, "this is a serious situation which affects us all."

"While the state government has the power to guarantee gas supplies to essential services and households, some industries and businesses have been hit hard."

"A number of them are being forced to scale back operations and others have temporarily closed."

The Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry predicts that up to 15% of companies will be forced into temporary shut down. A representative from the Property Council of WA, which represents commercial property owners, has said that "we are going to have to get used to cold offices and dimly lit shopping centres"

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWestern%20Power"&gt;Western Power&lt;/a&gt; today released figures showing that the power consumption has reduced since the crisis started. They said that the daily usage reduction of 40-50 &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Amegawatts"&gt;megawatts&lt;/a&gt; was a moderate saving, that consumers could do much more.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n economic growth forecast for 2008/09 has been reduced to 2.75% as the impact of the &lt;a href="Apache%20pipeline%20fire%20-%20Varanus%20Island%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;gas crisis&lt;/a&gt; ripples through the economy. 

Federal Resources Minister &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMartin%20Ferguson"&gt;Martin Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; said today that disruption to economic activity is expected as &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australian&lt;/a&gt; companies layoff thousands of workers with mining and industrial companies forced to cut back production. 

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABHP%20Billiton"&gt;BHP Billiton&lt;/a&gt; has brought forward upgrades to its nickel refinery in Kambalda and diverted its gas allocation to keeping the Worsley Alumina refinery operating. The upgrade originally scheduled for mid 2009 is expect to take four months to complete. BHP has said that it will continue to accept ore from independent mining operators in the area inline with current contracts.

Economists expect continuing turbulence as mining companies come under pressure to continue to supply China's demand for materials from Western Australia, combined with growing inflation rising gold and commodity prices.

A team of scientists from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; have determined that chemicals that form the building blocks of &lt;a href="w%3ADeoxyribonucleic%20acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARibonucleic%20acid"&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt; found in a meteorite had formed before the meteorite fell to Earth. In a paper published in ♡❤Earth and Planetary Science Letters♡❤ on June 15, the team documents an examination of molecules found in the &lt;a href="w%3AMurchison%20meteorite"&gt;Murchison meteorite&lt;/a&gt;, fragments of which landed near the village of &lt;a href="w%3AMurchison%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Murchison, Victoria&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in 1969.

Previous studies had identified &lt;a href="w%3Aamino%20acid"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; and sugars in the meteorite that were believed to have formed in space. The samples the current study examined included molecules of &lt;a href="w%3Auracil"&gt;uracil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Axanthine"&gt;xanthine&lt;/a&gt;, which belong to the class of &lt;a href="w%3Anucleobase"&gt;nucleobases&lt;/a&gt; - chemicals which, when combined with sugars, form a crucial part of DNA and RNA. These molecules contained a form of carbon, known as carbon 13, in much higher concentrations than would be expected if they had come from contamination through exposure from Earth sources. The study, using &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20magnetic%20resonance"&gt;nuclear magnetic resonance&lt;/a&gt; (NMR) imaging, had not been undertaken before due to its laborious and time-consuming nature - the low concentration of nucleobases in the meteorite meant that 15 grams of space rock had to be processed to get a large enough sample, compared to the milligrams required for previous studies.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ contacted Professor &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Davies"&gt;Paul Davies&lt;/a&gt;, a physicist and astrobiologist presently at &lt;a href="w%3AArizona%20State%20University"&gt;Arizona State University&lt;/a&gt;, about the recent findings. While he agreed with the findings, he said that he thinks such discoveries are "a red herring in the origin of life story - a hangover from the &lt;a href="w%3AMiller-Urey%20experiment"&gt;Miller-Urey experiment&lt;/a&gt;. Life is all about information - its replication and processing."

Governor &lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Jindal"&gt;Bobby Jindal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; politician from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, appeared on CBS’s &lt;a href="w%3AFace%20the%20Nation"&gt;Face the Nation&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday and said he supports teaching &lt;a href="w%3Aintelligent%20design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt; (ID) in public school as "the very best &lt;a href="w%3Ascience"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;." Jindal, who was elected governor in 2007, is a &lt;a href="w%3AHindu"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; convert to &lt;a href="w%3ACatholic"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt; who takes the &lt;a href="w%3ABiblical%20literalism"&gt;Bible literally&lt;/a&gt;.

In his exchange on the Sunday morning talk show, "Some want only to teach intelligent design, some only want to teach evolution. I think both views are wrong, as a parent."

In a September 2007 debate he supported the view of &lt;a href="w%3Acreationism"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; saying, "Personally, it certainly makes sense to me that when you look at &lt;a href="w%3ACreation%20%28theology%29"&gt;creation&lt;/a&gt;, you would believe in a creator."
Recently, the Louisiana House of Representatives passed legislation, which the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20for%20Science%20Education"&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt; said "opens the door to creationism in public school science classes." The bill is currently on his desk.

Jindal is currently considered a possible &lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; candidate for &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008"&gt;U.S. Presidential campaign&lt;/a&gt;.

A bombing in the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; has killed 51 people, according to local police. The car bomb exploded near a bus stop in the &lt;a href="w%3AHurriya"&gt;Hurriya&lt;/a&gt; area, which is mainly populated with &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20Islam"&gt;Shia Muslims&lt;/a&gt;. 75 people were also wounded by the attack.

This bombing, which set over twenty shops alight, has a higher death toll than any other bombing in Baghdad over the last three months. 

The attack follows an effort by the Iraqi and US forces to increase the security situation in Iraq, which has suffered many attacks since the 2003 invasion by coalition forces.

After 22 years of waiting, the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Celtics"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt; have won their 17th &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Basketball%20Association"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; championship, adding to the 16 that already hang from the rafters of the &lt;a href="w%3ATD%20Banknorth%20Garden"&gt;TD Banknorth Garden&lt;/a&gt; and before that, the old Boston Garden.

The Celtics won the game 131 to 92 and won the series with 4 wins over their old rivals, the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Lakers"&gt;Los Angeles Lakers&lt;/a&gt;' 2. The game was highlighted by &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Allen"&gt;Ray Allen&lt;/a&gt;'s seven 3-pointers, tying the NBA Finals single game record, as well as the Celtics 18 steals, easily a single game record also. &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Pierce"&gt;Paul Pierce&lt;/a&gt; has been chosen series MVP.

The season is noted for the biggest single-season turnaround in NBA history as the last Celtics season was considered to be one of the worst in franchise history.

<h1>Associated Press goes after bloggers for copyright violation</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Associated%20Press%20goes%20after%20bloggers%20for%20copyright%20violation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (AP) news agency has come under fire from the &lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; community after issuing a number of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADMCA"&gt;DMCA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown notices against bloggers who have used extracts from AP articles.

Quoting from correspondence surrounding the takedown notices, a Drudge Retort contributor claims in his personal blog that not only is AP asserting that the quotes are a copyright violation, but that they also constitute '"hot news" misappropriation.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ contacted several people in an effort to get to the bottom of this issue. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARogers%20Cadenhead"&gt;Rogers Cadenhead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one of the copublishers of the Drudge Report blog, brought ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ up to speed on the DMCA notices. The takedown notices were received by email on June 10, he said. This, in and of itself, constitutes an improper filing. The letter of the law requires that a DMCA notice be sent to the appropriate party by recorded postal delivery.

Cadenhead remains unaware of any other bloggers who have been similarly notified, and says receiving seven takedown notices left him "dumbfounded". Previous Drudge Retort interaction with AP's legal team had seen AP complain about people posting entire reports in the comments section of the site. These were quickly removed and users warned that this was inappropriate and indisputably a copyright violation, says Cadenhead.
Cadenhead goes on to discuss how blogs, and other social networking sites, are of benefit to mainstream media such as AP. He describes how the posting of excerpts and quotes helps drive visitors to the sites where the full article text can be found, "MSNBC publishes its news videos with an "embed" button that makes it possible to share them on blogs. If NBC sees the value of that, print-based media should recognize the benefits of encouraging the link-and-excerpt culture of bloggers. I heard on NPR yesterday that 20 percent of the New York Times web traffic is referred by blogs."

There may be a longer-term strategy behind these actions from the Associated Press. A report on ChannelWeb indicates that AP wants to charge for excerpts of their online content. The pricing schedule reported on this site starts at &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;12.50 for quoting five to twenty-five words and goes up to US$100.00 for over 251 words. This, a challenge to the very existence of fair use, is to be managed by the company &lt;a href="w%3AiCopyright"&gt;iCopyright&lt;/a&gt; operating as a copyright protection service. &lt;a href="w%3ACory%20Doctorow"&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt; goes into this in some depth on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoing%20Boing"&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; site, commenting that those who inform on violators may receive up to one million dollar rewards. In addition, the "no disparagement" clause is highlighted, whereby AP reserves the right to revoke the license where they are unhappy with the usage.

"Welcome to a world in which you won’t be able to effectively criticize the press, because you’ll be required to pay to quote as few as five words from what they publish," Doctorow wrote.

The controversy provoked by these moves from AP, apparently, prompted them to schedule a meeting with the Media Bloggers Association to hammer out a set of guidelines.

The Associated Press case seems to rely on the 1918 U.S. Supreme Court case, &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20News%20Service%20v.%20Associated%20Press"&gt;International News Service v. Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; where, following INS being prevented from using allied telegraph lines following unfavourable reporting, they used AP reports as a source to rewrite in their own words. With one vigorously dissenting justice, the case was closed in AP's favour, with the INS usage described as "misappropriation". Today sees a similar battle played out where bloggers and other citizen journalists simply do not have the resources to place their own reporters at the scene and must excerpt or rewrite from sources such as AP.

According to Michael Kwun, a senior staff attorney with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEFF"&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one of their blog entries describes the action as biting the hand that feeds them. Kwun questioned whether the 1918 ruling could still be considered "good law", that changes in Federal law likely rendered it inapplicable, and that there was only a small chance that at state level this could still be applied.

Despite several attempts to get input from the Associated Press, they had not responded to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ at time of publication. Attempts to contact Reuters and the BBC for input also went unanswered.

On June 20, Cadenhead released a statement saying that after receiving additional information from AP, he is "glad" the dispute is over. AP said it had a "constructive exchange" with a "number of interested parties in the blogging community" and will seek to continue dialogue.

"I think it would be helpful for bloggers and users of social news sites to know what the AP believes to be fair use of their copyrighted work," said Wade Duchene, attorney for Cadenhead. "I hope that any guidelines that are issued are not interpreted as an agreed definition of fair use."

&lt;a href="Mozilla"&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;'s new browser &lt;a href="w%3AFirefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; 3.0 has been downloaded over 8 million times in 24 hours. The &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Foundation"&gt;Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has encouraged users worldwide to download their latest browser in an attempt to enter the &lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records"&gt;Guinness Book of World Records&lt;/a&gt;, with what is referred to as Download Day 2008. The target of five million downloads was reached long before the 24 hour period was over.

The 24 hour download session ended at 18:16 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; on June 18th, one hour later than the original time of 17:00. This delay is due to technical problems which included the servers being overwhelmed. For a while after the specified launch time, the Firefox website linked to a download for Firefox 2.

Over 2.88 million of the downloads were from the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;; 2.56 million were from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The unofficial, unaudited final number of downloads during the 24 hour marathon was 8,320,331. This figure still needs to be checked by the Guinness Book of Records for validity. 

If the unofficial figure is accurate, almost 100 copies of the application were downloaded every second.

John Lilly, the CEO of Mozilla commented on the release of Firefox 3. “We’re really proud of Firefox 3 and it just shows what a committed, energized global community can do when they work together,” he said.

<h1>Government Accountability Office requests rerun of US Air Force tanker bid</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Government%20Accountability%20Office%20requests%20rerun%20of%20US%20Air%20Force%20tanker%20bid&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20Accountability%20Office"&gt;Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt; on June 18 called for a re-run of the bidding for the U.S. Air Force $40 billion &lt;a href="w%3AKC-X"&gt;tanker contract&lt;/a&gt;, citing major flaws in the procurement process. This imperils the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthrop%20Grumman"&gt;Northrop Grumman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEADS%20North%20America"&gt;EADS North America&lt;/a&gt; plan to assemble the planes in &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;.

When the Air Force selected &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; based Northrop Grumman on February 29 to build the aircraft, &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; challenged the award in a formal protest before the GAO, claiming the evaluation was skewed towards Northrop. 

The GAO upheld Boeing's protest, though not all of their individual claims were upheld.

"Our review of the record led us to conclude that the Air Force had made a number of
significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close
competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman," said Michael R. Golden, the GAO's 
managing associate general counsel for procurement law.

The GAO issued a non-binding recommendation that the Air Force re-open the competition, allow the competitors to submit revised bids, and completely re-evaluate the new bids. This process could take a year or more to complete. 

The Air Force has 60 days to respond to the GAO. 

<h3>Reaction</h3>

Northrop said that they needed time to consider the ruling, but their spokesman, Randy Belote, said "we continue to believe that Northrop Grumman offered the most modern and capable &lt;a href="w%3ANorthrop%20Grumman%20KC-45"&gt;tanker&lt;/a&gt; for our men and women in uniform."

Boeing supporters on Capital Hill urged the Air Force to scrap the contract and start a new competition as soon as possible.

"I believe the Air Force should set aside the agreement it improperly reached with EADS/Northrop Grumman and we should proceed expeditiously to build the best aircraft - the Boeing KC-767" said &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Rep.%20Norm%20Dicks"&gt;U.S. Rep. Norm Dicks&lt;/a&gt;, D-Wash, in whose state the Boeing aircraft would be built.
Alabama politicians were disappointed and surprised by the GAO's ruling. Northop and EADS were to assemble their tankers in Alabama at a new assembly plant at Mobile's &lt;a href="w%3ABrookley%20Industrial%20Complex"&gt;Brookley Industrial Complex&lt;/a&gt;.

"I don't believe this ruling signals the end of Alabama's hopes for building tankers for the Air Force," said &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Rep.%20Jo%20Bonner"&gt;U.S. Rep. Jo Bonner&lt;/a&gt;, R-Mobile. "Like everyone else, I look forward to hearing from the GAO and meeting with the Air Force on how we move forward. For the sake of our airmen and women, we must find a way to do so quickly."

<h3>Main Points of the GAO evaluation:</h3>

The 69 page GAO decision was not made public, due to sensitive information about the aircraft, but a 3 page press release stated the main points of the ruling:

<ul>
BULLET::::- The Air Force did not correctly apply its own criteria when assessing the aircraft.
BULLET::::- They miscalculated the costs associated with the Boeing tanker, and incorrectly concluded that Northrop's would be cheaper.
BULLET::::- They wrongly gave Northrop's tanker extra credit for exceeding key performance objectives.
BULLET::::- They did not back up their claim that the Northrop tanker could refuel all current Air Force fixed-wing aircraft.
BULLET::::- They told Boeing that its aircraft met a key performance objective, before deciding this was only partially true.
BULLET::::- The Air Force "unreasonably" favored Northrop after the company refused to help set up maintenance depots within two years of the first airplane delivery.

<h1>Bush calls for US offshore oil exploration</h1>

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; delivered a speech Wednesday in which he urged the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; to end a ban on oil exploration off of US shores. Currently there is both an &lt;a href="w%3Aexecutive%20order%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congressional&lt;/a&gt; moratorium against such exploration.

The Congress issued its moratorium in 1981. In 1989, President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.W.%20Bush"&gt;George H.W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; issued an executive order in the wake of the &lt;a href="w%3AExxon%20Valdez%20oil%20spill"&gt;Exxon Valdez oil spill&lt;/a&gt;.

President Bush said that "we should expand American oil production by increasing access to the Outer Continental Shelf, or OCS. Experts believe that the OCS could produce about 18 billion barrels of oil. That would be enough to match America's current oil production for almost ten years."

"I know the Democratic leaders have opposed some of these policies in the past," President Bush said. "Now that their opposition has helped drive gas prices to record levels, I ask them to reconsider their positions. If Congressional leaders leave for the Fourth of July recess without taking action, they will need to explain why $4-a-gallon gasoline is not enough incentive for them to act."

Senator &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, who is the &lt;a href="w%3Apresumptive%20nominee"&gt;presumptive nominee&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;, said on Tuesday that he favors offshore drilling.

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate majority leader&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, said: "This week’s flip-flop on offshore oil drilling by President Bush and Senator John McCain is nothing more than a cynical campaign ploy that will do nothing to lower energy prices, and represents another big giveaway to oil companies already making billions in profits."

"It's cynical to say that we can drill our way out of this mess," said Athan Manuel, of the environmental group &lt;a href="w%3ASierra%20Club"&gt;Sierra Club&lt;/a&gt;. "The solution to $4 gas is not off our coast."

A recent poll conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AZogby%20International"&gt;Zogby&lt;/a&gt; showed that about 60% of Americans support more oil drilling and refinery construction, yet nearly the same percentage also say they are in favor of conservation.

"We will take pressure off gas prices over time by expanding the amount of American-made oil and gasoline. We will strengthen our national security by reducing our reliance on foreign oil. We will benefit American workers by keeping our nation competitive in the global economy — and by creating good jobs in construction, and engineering, and refining, maintenance, and many other areas," said Bush in his speech.

The third annual Taste of Taiwan Cuisine opened on Wednesday of June 18, 2008 and runs until June 21. Organized by &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council"&gt;Taiwan External Trade Development Council&lt;/a&gt; to promote the culinary culture of &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, the tradeshow featured three main shows for food and food packaging industries: "Food Taipei", "Foodtech Taipei", and "Taipei Pack".

Twenty-seven countries including &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Fiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, and six nations from &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, grouped their own national pavilions for sourcing and procurement. In addition, the Taiwan Pavilion featured sections on culture, product image, brand design, and agriculture verification in Food Taipei.

Industrial solutions including medical applications, packaging machines, food &lt;a href="w%3ACNC"&gt;CNC&lt;/a&gt;s, and bar-code printers are showcased in the "Foodtech Taipei" and "Taipei Pack". Seminars and forums from security, global marketing, and policies for food, machinery, and packaging industries are also held during show hours.

After the 3-in-1 show in Taipei, the Kaohsiung International Food Show will be scheduled for November.

Six &lt;a href="w%3AOrbcomm"&gt;Orbcomm&lt;/a&gt; satellites have been launched by a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AKosmos-3M"&gt;Kosmos-3M&lt;/a&gt; carrier rocket. Lift-off, from Site 107 at the &lt;a href="w%3AKapustin%20Yar"&gt;Kapustin Yar&lt;/a&gt; launch site in South-West Russia, occurred at 06:36:28 GMT. This is the first orbital launch to occur from Kapustin Yar since April 1999.

&lt;a href="w%3AOrbcomm"&gt;Orbcomm&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; company which operates a constellation of &lt;a href="w%3Acommunications%20satellites"&gt;communications satellites&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3Alow%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;low Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;. The satellites launched today were five Quick Launch satellites, and a technology demonstration spacecraft which will be operated in conjunction with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coastguard"&gt;United States Coastguard&lt;/a&gt;. A seventh satellite, &lt;a href="w%3AUfa%20State%20University"&gt;Ufa State University&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AUGATUSAT"&gt;UGATUSAT&lt;/a&gt; nanosatellite, was originally scheduled to be launched, but was moved to a later launch aboard a &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz-2"&gt;Soyuz-2&lt;/a&gt; rocket for unknown reasons. The launch was conducted by &lt;a href="w%3ACOSMOS%20International"&gt;COSMOS International&lt;/a&gt;, a Russo-&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; organisation, and Russia's &lt;a href="w%3AStrategic%20Rocket%20Forces"&gt;Strategic Rocket Forces&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the 31 orbital launch of 2008, and the second of which to have been conducted by a Kosmos-3M rocket. The next Kosmos-3M launch is currently scheduled for the end of July, when the &lt;a href="w%3ASAR-Lupe%205"&gt;SAR-Lupe 5&lt;/a&gt; satellite will be placed into orbit.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Shortly after an extended question and answer session last night, anti-war activist &lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt; easily secured an endorsement from the San Francisco Green Party as nominative challenger to the Speaker of the House &lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%27s%208th%20congressional%20district"&gt;California's 8th congressional district&lt;/a&gt;.

Sheehan answered a wide variety of questions helping to overcome a common perception that she is a one-issue candidate. Sheehan emphasized the stance for which she is famous, regarding ending the War in Iraq and dramatically reducing the amount of money spent by the Pentagon, explaining that the United States' founders intended for us to have militia, not a multi-trillion dollar military used for "corporate imperialism."
She also demonstrated a knowledge in a variety of topics that are important to party members, underscoring a commitment to the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party"&gt;Green Party's&lt;/a&gt; "10 Key Values," while acknowledging that her campaign's platform on indigenous rights is still being developed. 

She stressed her differences from speaker Pelosi's positions, and reaffirmed her belief that Pelosi has been complicit in maintaining the US presence in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Sheehan pointed out that she presently lives in the district, whereas Pelosi only recently purchased a home in Pacific Heights, her first in San Francisco. Pelosi has often been criticized for her absence from the district she represents. Sheehan provided an understanding of local issues, including the recent Hunter's Point controversy, reiterating her commitment to "affordable housing, better mass transit, alleviating traffic, dependence on fossil fuels, [and] rent control."

On the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11 World Trade Center attacks&lt;/a&gt;, Sheehan said, "I've never said it's been an inside job, I'm not convinced of that," but asserted that there are questions about the attacks that still need to be answered that only an independent, thorough investigation could provide. 

Sheehan is receiving support from independent presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Nader"&gt;Ralph Nader&lt;/a&gt; and expected Green Party candidate &lt;a href="w%3ACynthia%20McKinney"&gt;Cynthia McKinney&lt;/a&gt;. When asked whom she would endorse for president, Sheehan replied, "It's a tossup between Ralph and Cynthia."

Cindy Sheehan is still collecting the signatures needed to get on the ballot by the July filing date, but is expected to gain a substantial amount at the Gay Pride celebrations in the upcoming weeks. Sheehan is not running as a Green Party candidate, and has the endorsement of the local &lt;a href="w%3APeace%20and%20Freedom%20Party"&gt;Peace and Freedom Party&lt;/a&gt;. 

Also present was Barry Hermason, Green Party candidate for &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%27s%2012th%20congressional%20district"&gt;California's 12th district&lt;/a&gt;, which includes most of the south-west quarter of San Francisco.

&lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20Tobacco"&gt;Imperial Tobacco&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;-based tobacco company, has announced that it will cut 2,440 jobs as part of a restructuring plan. This move comes after the Imperial's takeover of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AAltadis"&gt;Altadis&lt;/a&gt;.

The job cuts were made as part of the process of moving the production of tobacco products to Northern Spain. In the United Kingdom, the &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; factory is the only one that is completely closing, although there are significant job losses at other locations. 

A spokesperson for Imperial Tobacco defended the move. "We are regrettably closing the cigar factory in Bristol - it's a very regrettable step for us to take, but it is an industry which is under considerable pressure," he said. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnite%20union"&gt;Unite union&lt;/a&gt; has stated that they will fight the decision. Iain MacLean, a union spokesman, said that "it’s early days but we will be fighting for every job and there will be absolutely no acceptance of any compulsory redundancies."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Judge Justice Christopher Burns of the &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;State Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; has ordered a halt to an emergency demolition on a 19th century stable and livery on 428-430 Jersey Street in &lt;a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; that partially collapsed on Wednesday June 11, initially causing at least 15 homes to be evacuated. At least two homes remain evacuated.

Burns orders that both the city and the group ♡❤Save The Livery♡❤ (www.savethelivery.com) have to come to an agreement on what to do with the building, and try to work out ways of saving at least some portions if it including the facade, side walls and a lift tower. ♡❤Save The Livery♡❤ is comprised of concerned area residents who have grown to love the building's historic and unique character. On June 14, they won a temporary restraining order to stop demolition. The court ruled that the city was only allowed to remove material in immediate danger to residents and pedestrians, but stated that the demolition could only be performed with "hand tools." The court also ordered that any rubble which had fallen into neighboring yards when the building collapsed, to be removed.

"It is in the interest of the city to have a safe environment--but also important to maintain a sense of historical preservation," stated Burns in his ruling. Burns has given the sides until tomorrow (Friday June 20) to come to an agreement and has ordered both parties to return to court at 9:30 a.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;) "sharp." Activists of ♡❤Save The Livery♡❤ urge supporters of the stable to "fill the courtroom" to show "continued and ongoing support." The hearing is scheduled to take place at 25 Delaware Avenue in the Supreme Court building, 3rd Floor, trial part 19.

Currently the building is owned by Bob Freudenheim who has several building violations against him because of the buildings poor condition. He has received at least five violations in three months and residents who live near the building state that Freudenheim should be "100% responsible" for his actions. Many are afraid that if the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished.

On June 17, developer and CEO of Savarino Companies, Sam Savarino was at the site of the stable, discussing the building with residents and preservationists. In 2006, Savarino proposed and planned ♡❤The Elmwood Village Hotel♡❤, a 'botique' hotel on the Southeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues. The project was later withdrawn after residents filed a lawsuit against Savarino and the city. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ extensively covered the story, and contacted Savarino for his professional opinion on the building.

"[I would] love to see it preserved. I was there to see if there was anything we could do to help, to see if anything can be salvaged. I just want to see the right thing happen, and so does the city," stated Savarino to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ who added that he was allowed inside the building for a brief period.

"The side walls are beyond repair. The roof has rotted and it could come down at any time," added Savarino who also said that the building "below the second floor appears to be stable." He also states that the back wall of the building, which borders several homes, appears to be intact.

"Eliminating the back wall could be a problem for the neighbors. It is not unreasonable to leave at least 12 feet" of the back wall standing, added Savarino.

Savarino did not say if he was interested in buying the property, but did state, "I am sure there are a couple of people interested" in buying the property. On Thursday, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Buffalo%20News"&gt;Buffalo News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that a "businessman" might be interested in purchasing the property, though ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is not able to independently confirm the report. Savarino says that with the property still slated for emergency demolition, a potential buyer could face tax fees of nearly &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;300,000.

Freudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built. Residents say that he has been the owner for at least 22 years.

The building was first owned by a company called ♡❤White Bros.♡❤ and was used as a stable for a farm which once covered the land around the building for several blocks. The &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Buffalo Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; believes the building was built around 1814, while the city property database states it was built in 1870. Servants and workers of the farm were housed inside resident quarters situated at the rear of the building on what is now Summer Street, but are now cottages where area residents currently reside. Some date as far back as 1829.

At about 1950, the stable was converted into an automobile body shop and gasoline station.A property record search showed that in 1950 at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property. Two are listed as 550 square feet while the other two are 2,000 square feet. All of the tanks are designated as a TK4, which &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; State says is used for "below ground horizontal bulk fuel storage." The cost of installing a tank of that nature according to the state, at that time, included the tank itself, "excavation and backfill," but did not include "the piping, ballast, or hold-down slab orring." It is not known if the tanks are still on the property, but residents are concerned the city was not taking the precautions to find out.

Further rain has continued to fall across southern &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; after the country was devastated by floods earlier this week.
176 people have been confirmed to have died as a result of the flooding, and around 50 more are officially missing. &lt;a href="w%3AXinhua"&gt;Xinhua&lt;/a&gt;, the state news agency in China, has reported that the flooding in the &lt;a href="w%3APearl%20River%20Delta"&gt;Pearl River Delta&lt;/a&gt; was the worst in the area for over fifty years.

The Chinese government says it evacuated 111,476 in the &lt;a href="w%3ASichuan%20Province"&gt;Sichuan Province&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="w%3AWenchuan%20County"&gt;Wenchuan County&lt;/a&gt;, 72,000 were relocated. Over the past week some 1.3 million people have reportedly fled their homes.

The &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Meteorological%20Administration"&gt;China Meteorological Administration&lt;/a&gt; (CMA) issued a warning on the situation before the first wave of flooding. "Faced with the increasingly severe rain and flood situation, at 16 o’clock of June 12, Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters of Guangxi urgently started level 2 flood control emergency response and required the relevant departments and places to prepare immediately so as to ensure the work of flood control and drought relief," the CMA said in a statement released late last week.

White 'chunks' that were photographed by the &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Phoenix lander&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="Mars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; on June 15 after digging a trench, have disappeared, leading scientists to believe they most certainly found ice on the Red Planet.

"It must be ice. These little clumps completely disappearing over the course of a few days, that is perfect evidence that it's ice. There had been some question whether the bright material was salt. Salt can't do that," said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Arizona"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="Tucson"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.

The chunks were left at the bottom of a trench informally called "Dodo-Goldilocks" when Phoenix's Robotic Arm enlarged that trench on June 15, during the 20th Martian day, or sol, since landing. Several were gone when Phoenix looked at the trench early today, on Sol 24.

Digging in a different trench Phoenix's robotic Arm connected with a hard surface that has scientists excited about the prospect of next uncovering an icy layer.

"We have dug a trench and uncovered a hard layer at the same depth as the ice layer in our other trench," said &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20University"&gt;Washington University&lt;/a&gt; robotic arm investigator for Phoenix, Ray Arvidson. The arm tried at least three times to penetrate the layer, but was unsuccessful. As a result the arm went into a holding pattern, awaiting its next commands.

Last Saturday June 14, 2008 Google Developer Day made its first appearance in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; at the Taipei International Convention Center. Approximately 1,000 developers participated in this conference.

Unlike the first two Developer Days held in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, this event focused more on demonstrations of "&lt;a href="w%3AOpenSocial"&gt;OpenSocial&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20App%20Engine"&gt;Google App Engine&lt;/a&gt;".

&lt;a href="w%3AKai-Fu%20Lee"&gt;Kai-fu Lee&lt;/a&gt;, Founding Chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20China"&gt;Google China&lt;/a&gt;, proposed the theory on different generations and leaders on the Internet.

Li-feng Chien, Engineering Director of Google Taiwan, commented about the theory to ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Journalist :

Google Developer Day 2008 took place on June 18 at the Wharf 8 Venue Complex in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. This is the fourth event after &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. Thirteen Google Developer days have been scheduled for 2008. About 650 local developers participated in this conference.

Internet &lt;a href="w%3AApplication%20programming%20interface"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;s on websites and enterprises was emphasised at this event, in addition to discussions on &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Apps%20Engine"&gt;Google Apps Engine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Maps"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAndroid%20%28mobile%20device%20platform%29"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;.

Alan Noble, Engineering Director of Google Australia and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, hoped potential talents and developers can be discovered in this conference, and also commented about the Internet era to local media: "Developers took hold of the notion that the web itself is truly the platform of the future - an open playing field where anyone can build innovative applications."

The &lt;a href="w%3AOcean%20Surface%20Topography%20Mission"&gt;Ocean Surface Topography Mission&lt;/a&gt; (OSTM), or Jason-2, satellite, has been launched into &lt;a href="w%3Alow%20Earth%20orbit"&gt;low Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20II"&gt;Delta II&lt;/a&gt; rocket carrying the satellite lifted off from &lt;a href="w%3AVandenberg%20AFB%20Space%20Launch%20Complex%202"&gt;Space Launch Complex 2W&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AVandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Vandenberg Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, at 07:46 &lt;a href="w%3AGMT"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Spacecraft separation occurred around an hour later, and the solar panels on the satellite have deployed.
OSTM is a collaboration between the American space agency, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; space agency, &lt;a href="w%3ACNES"&gt;CNES&lt;/a&gt;. It will study and map the surface of the oceans from space. The Delta II rocket flew in the 7320 configuration, the lowest capacity variant, with three &lt;a href="w%3Asolid%20rocket%20motor"&gt;solid rocket motor&lt;/a&gt;s, and no third stage. The exact launch time was 07:46:25.192 GMT.

This is the third launch of a Delta II carrier rocket to be conducted so far this year, and the 137 overall. The next Delta II is scheduled to launch in mid-late August, with the &lt;a href="w%3AGeoEye-1"&gt;GeoEye-1&lt;/a&gt; civilian imagery satellite, however A GPS satellite launch which was delayed from mid July to an unconfirmed date could potentially occur before this. This is the 32 orbital launch of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AWikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt;, a website which hosts copies of restricted documents, recently received a claim of copyright infringement from the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints"&gt;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt; (LDS). This development follows a similar letter being sent to the Wikimedia Foundation, owners of &lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;, regarding a link to the Wikileaks document.
The letter sent to Wikileaks demands that Wikileaks take down the document immediately. In an exclusive statement given to Wikinews, however, Wikileaks said that "WikiLeaks will not remove the handbooks, which are of substantial interest to current and former Mormons. WikiLeaks will remain a place where people from around the world can safely reveal the truth."

In another exclusive statement given to Wikinews, before the LDS incident, Wikileaks did say that if there was a substantial danger, Wikileaks would remove the documents from the site. 
"If aliens parked in orbit and said that they would obliterate the world if Wikileaks did not remove some document exposing them, would
Wikileaks' distributed file server operators remove the document in question? Of course, even though there is no mechanism to do
this, everyone involved would work out how to ."

The letter notifying Wikileaks of the copyright infringement was sent by Berne S. Broadbent, president of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Intellectual%20Reserve"&gt;Intellectual Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, which controls the intellectual property of the Mormon Church.

On May 5, the Wikimedia Foundation received a copyright infringement claim from Intellectual Reserve. The infringement claim was addressed to &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Adesignated%20agent"&gt;designated agent&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and requested that access to the link to Wikileaks be removed. Wikinews acted differently to Wikileaks after receiving the notice, as Wikinews took down the link soon after being made aware of the claim.

A &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeping helicopter crashed near &lt;a href="w%3ABanja%20Luka"&gt;Banja Luka&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, killing the four servicemen on board. Two were &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; and two were &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;.

The helicopter belonged to Spain and was deployed as part of the &lt;a href="w%3AEUFOR"&gt;EUFOR&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeping mission, which Spain and Germany have 250 and 130 soldiers engaged in respectively. It was a German-built &lt;a href="w%3AMesserschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm%20BO-105"&gt;Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm BO-105&lt;/a&gt;. Spain's defence ministry named the deceased Spaniards as Lieutenant Santiago Hormigo Ledesma and Sergeant Joaquin Lopez Moreno. The Germans have not been named.

The cause of the accident is unknown, but the crash was witnessed by a second military helicopter in the area at the time. They reported seeing smoke from the helicopter but little else because the mountainous and forested terrain impeded their view. It is also known that the aircraft departed on a routine flight and crashed half an hour later after issueing a distress call. An investigation is ongoing.

The bodies were recovered today. The Spaniards were flown home on a &lt;a href="w%3AC-130"&gt;C-130&lt;/a&gt; military transport plane, after a short ceremony in which a Spanish general placed medals upon the coffins in the presence of the Spanish ambassador and EUFOR officials.

A EUFOR spokesman said the bodies of the Germans will probably be flown home on Monday.

For two weeks, from Saturday June 21 to Saturday July 5 2008, &lt;a href="w%3A%C5%A0ibenik"&gt;Šibenik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; will be welcoming the whole world at the 48th International Children's Festival. Musicians, actors, film-makers, poets, puppeteers and other performance artists will perform for the young spectators. 

Performances generally take place in the evening, while budding artists will have access to numerous workshops during the day.

At the peek of summer, children will be able to train their creativity in the cool yard of a &lt;a href="w%3ABaroque"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; hotel, explore the mysterious network of the wells and tanks of an old city or launch an attack on the numerous strongholds which once protected the city, the first one constructed by the Croatian kings.

<h1>Technology giants battle for USB 3.0 standards</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Technology%20giants%20battle%20for%20USB%203.0%20standards&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Even though the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Serial%20Bus%23USB%203.0"&gt;USB 3.0&lt;/a&gt; standard, with transmission speeds nearing 5Gbit/s (600MB/s), has not yet matured and is not expected until 2009 or 2010, technology leaders &lt;a href="Intel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAdvanced%20Micro%20Devices"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AnVidia"&gt;nVidia&lt;/a&gt; are battling to take the lead on the USB 3.0 specifications.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUSB%20Implementers%20Forum"&gt;USB Implementers Forum&lt;/a&gt; (USB-IF) was founded in 1995 by Intel, &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHewlett-Packard%20Company"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20Instruments"&gt;Texas Instruments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANEC"&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ANXP%20Semiconductors"&gt;NXP Semiconductors&lt;/a&gt;. These companies are also promoting the new standard of USB 3.0.

But AMD, nVidia, and &lt;a href="w%3AVIA%20Technologies"&gt;VIA Technologies&lt;/a&gt; have jointly made an attempt to develop another "USB 3.0" standard to compete with Intel. The opportunity arose because Intel has yet to release their standard for USB 3.0.

"If the USB 3.0 have two different standards in the future, the consumer will be the greatest loser in this &lt;a href="w%3Aformat%20war"&gt;'standard' battle&lt;/a&gt;. As of this issue, we [the Federal Trade Commission] decided to investigate Intel on monopolizing the specification of USB 3.0 and hope this conflict can be smoothly solved." said the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Trade%20Commission"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; in a statement.

Nick Knupffer, a spokesperson for Intel, claimed that Intel will release related technical specifications on USB 3.0 for the &lt;a href="w%3Ainformation%20technology"&gt;Information Technology&lt;/a&gt; industry to prevent unnecessary conflicts on standards and specifications.

<h1>'Pregnancy pact' grabs international attention for small Massachusetts town</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27Pregnancy%20pact%27%20grabs%20international%20attention%20for%20small%20Massachusetts%20town&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A supposed "pregnancy pact" at &lt;a href="w%3AGloucester%20High%20School%20%28Massachusetts%29"&gt;Gloucester High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGloucester%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Gloucester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; has drawn international attention to the small Massachusetts fishing city which is considered to be one of the oldest settlements (1623) in the American continent.

The story, which was broken by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATIME%20%28magazine%29"&gt;TIME&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ magazine and the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Globe"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, involved the fact that 17 girls, all sixteen years old or younger, got themselves pregnant as part of a "pregnancy pact", so that the teenage mothers could raise their babies together.

According the magazine article, school officials at the 1,162 student school became concerned starting as far back as October when a uncommonly large amount of girls began to enter the school's health clinic to see if they were pregnant. 

As of earlier this May, seven girls returned more than once seeking pregnancy tests and upon hearing results, "Some girls seemed more upset when they weren't pregnant than when they were," according to James Sullivan, the principal of the school. Some smiled, others cried, and one declared, "Sweet!", according to the ♡❤Globe♡❤ upon hearing their results.

Local officials, including the mayor, are uncertain whether there really was a "pact", however. Mayor Carolyn Kirk called it a "blip" in the pregnancy rate and noted many factors playing into it, such glamorization of teen pregnancy including the announcement around the same time that Britney Spear's sister, Jamie Lynn Spears had given birth to a baby, and last year's critically acclaimed movie, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJuno%20%28film%29"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a comedy about a 16-year-old girl who gets pregnant and other movies, such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AKnocked%20Up"&gt;Knocked Up&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

There is some concern over what might be &lt;a href="w%3Astatutory%20rape"&gt;statutory rape&lt;/a&gt;, as it has been reported that most of the men who are the fathers are older, including one report that one of the fathers is a 24-year-old homeless man. In Massachusetts, the age of consent is 16, therefore it is illegal for anyone to have sexual intercourse with anyone under 16.

Other teen mothers however have criticized the new mothers. Two such girls are Alivia Fidler and Meaghan Orlando, childhood friends and sophomore students at the high school, the girls were 16 years old when they became pregnant unexpectedly.

Orlando noted, "If I could go back in time I would want to wait and have the same baby later. You can't do stuff that normal teens do," who is now 17 and has a 3-month-old son named Jayden, "They don't know what they’re getting themselves into."

Meaghan's friend, Alivia, also now 17, said the pact idea is "ridiculous." Noting, "They're not going to be friends very long. You have to take care of your baby. It's frustrating. I don't have a lot of support." Fidler is no longer with the father of the baby, 5 month-old Xavier Fidler-Aguiar and recently lost her job at McDonalds.

One other teen mother, Amanda Ireland, who recently graduated from the school, also gave a warning to the mothers, "Don't try to get pregnant. People say they know what it's like because they have younger siblings, but they really have no idea."

Ireland also noted, "They're so excited to finally have someone to love them unconditionally. I try to explain it's hard to feel loved when an infant is screaming to be fed at 3 a.m." 

46 year-old Gloucester resident Lori Mitchell, whose daughter dropped out of high school at 16 to raise a child said there are worse things than being a teenage mother, "They could be junkies or prostitutes. You try to protect them as much as you can, but it's up to them to do the right thing."

Greg Verga, the chairman of the Gloucester School Committee called the pact, "disturbing", as he himself was once a teen father.

"They are going to have a rude awakening. It was no picnic. People don’t realize there’s 3 a.m. feedings ... it’s a lifestyle change. It’s not a possession you can play with and stick on the shelf. That's why I fear for these girls."

At the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft"&gt;2008 edition of the NHL entry draft&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Stamkos"&gt;Steven Stamkos&lt;/a&gt;' long-anticipated selection first overall by the &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%20Bay%20Lighting"&gt;Tampa Bay Lightning&lt;/a&gt; may have been overshadowed by numerous trades and signings made on the draft floor.

Before even the first pick was made, the &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary%20Flames"&gt;Calgary Flames&lt;/a&gt; had acquired &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Cammalleri"&gt;Mike Cammalleri&lt;/a&gt; in a three-way trade. Calgary's pick, 17th overall was traded with the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Kings"&gt;Los Angeles Kings&lt;/a&gt;' pick, 28th overall, to the &lt;a href="w%3AAnaheim%20Ducks"&gt;Anaheim Ducks&lt;/a&gt;. The Kings received the Ducks' pick, 12th overall. Later, the Flames shipped forward &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Tanguay"&gt;Alex Tanguay&lt;/a&gt; and fifth-round pick to the &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%20Canadiens"&gt;Montreal Canadiens&lt;/a&gt; for the 25th overall selection and a 2009 second-round pick.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Panthers"&gt;Florida Panthers&lt;/a&gt; also made a major trade at the draft, moving their captain, &lt;a href="w%3AOlli%20Jokinen"&gt;Olli Jokinen&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20Coyotes"&gt;Phoenix Coyotes&lt;/a&gt; for two defencemen, &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Ballard"&gt;Keith Ballard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Boynton"&gt;Nick Boynton&lt;/a&gt; as well as the 49th overall selection. The &lt;a href="w%3AColumbus%20Blue%20Jackets"&gt;Columbus Blue Jackets&lt;/a&gt; made a major trade of their own, picking up &lt;a href="w%3AR.J.%20Umberger"&gt;R.J. Umberger&lt;/a&gt; and the 119th pick overall from the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for the 19th and 67th picks, overall.

Out of the first 30 picks in the draft, 17 had been traded around between teams. The first round was rich in defencemen; out of thirty players picked, half were defencemen. After Stamkos was picked first overall, the next four picks, &lt;a href="w%3ADrew%20Doughty"&gt;Drew Doughty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AZach%20Bogosian"&gt;Zach Bogosian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Pietrangelo"&gt;Alex Pietrangelo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20Schenn"&gt;Luke Schenn&lt;/a&gt; were all blueliners. 

The hosts, &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Senators"&gt;w:Ottawa Senators&lt;/a&gt;, also made numerous moves. The Senators traded up to the 15th pick overall to draft &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Karlsson"&gt;Erik Karlsson&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier in the day, the had also resigned &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Kelly%20%28ice%20hockey%29"&gt;Chris Kelly&lt;/a&gt; to a four-year, $8.5 million contract extension. Previously, the Senators also waived goaltender &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Emery"&gt;Ray Emery&lt;/a&gt;. Emery could be bought out as early as today.

The NHL free-agency season starts July 1.

&lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aflag%20carrier"&gt;flag carrier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20Airways"&gt;Sudan Airways&lt;/a&gt; has been grounded by the &lt;a href="w%3ASudanese%20Civil%20Aviation%20Authority"&gt;Sudanese Civil Aviation Authority&lt;/a&gt; (CAA). The airline's &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Operators%20Certificate"&gt;Air Operators Certificate&lt;/a&gt; will be revoked starting from Monday.

CAA director of safety and flight operations Mohamed Hassan al-Mujammar said that the grounding was not directly connected to the crash of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20Airways%20Flight%20109"&gt;Sudan Airways Flight 109&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum%20International%20Airport"&gt;Khartoum International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, which has 30 confirmed fatalities. However, he did say that the airline said it was unable to make urgent improvements suggested by the CAA in a safety audit last month because they were too preocupied with dealing with the disaster's aftermath.

"It is high time to stop this type of non-compliance with international standards," said Mujammar. 

Sudan Airways now has one month in which to appeal the decision or make the requested improvements. The airline had prevously complained of trouble acquiring spare parts and pilot training because of sanctions imposed by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on Sudan. The airline says even parts for &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an-manufactured &lt;a href="Airbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; planes are affected.

The airline operates mainly routes in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Gulf"&gt;the Gulf&lt;/a&gt;.

Poison claim the two companies have underpaid them royalties for years.

The band claims Capitol miscategorized various record sales and miscalculated every possible expense since the 1980s. They say when attempting to check company records they received no co-operation and are now asking a judge to order the firms to reveal their records so the band can determine how much they are owed.

Capitol and EMI have refused to comment.

It is feared that over 700 people have died after a ferry in the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; capsized after being hit by Typhoon Fengshen. So far, 38 people from the ferry have been found alive. Some people were washed onto the shore. One of the survivors, Reynato Lanoria, a janitor on the ferry, said that about 100 people jumped into the ocean. 

The ferry left Manila en route to Cebu on Friday, and according to the owners, Sulpicio Lines, contact was lost at about 12:30 local time Saturday.

A rescue ship was sent to rescue the survivors, although this only happened 24 hours after contact was lost with the boat.

One of the survivors described the incident. "There were many of us who jumped overboard, but we were separated because of the big waves," he said.

He continued, "The others were also able to board the life rafts, but it was useless because the strong winds flipped them over."

"It is with great pride and a lot of joy that I announce today that we have found proof that this hard bright material is really water ice and not some other substance," said Peter Smith, the primary investigator for Phoenix, at the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Arizona"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Tucson"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.

The chunks were left at the bottom of a trench informally called "Dodo-Goldilocks" when Phoenix's Robotic Arm enlarged that trench on June 15, during the 20th Martian day, or sol, since landing. Several were gone when Phoenix looked at the trench days later. The chunks were visible on June 16, but when Phoenix looked at the trench again on June 19, some of the material had disappeared, implying that it may have evaporated or melted.

"This tells us we've got water ice within reach of the arm, which means we can continue this investigation with the tools we brought with us," said primary investigator for Phoenix's stereo imager, Mark Lemmon.

Scientists are planning to examine the substance and the soil surrounding it more closely. They plan to test it for signs of organic material and minerals, and hope to find out if the ice was ever a liquid which could have supported microbial life.

In December of 2006, scientists announced that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Global%20Surveyor"&gt;Mars Global Surveyor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; captured images of deposits in gullies on the surface of the planet Mars which have been created since the areas were photographed nine years ago. These deposits were believed to be the residue of liquid water breaking out of cliffs and crater walls, carrying sediment downhill through the gullies, and later evaporating. The gullies are located inside the Terra Sirenum crater and the Centauri Montes regions.

In June 2007 the &lt;a href="ESA"&gt;ESA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Express"&gt;Mars Express&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft discovered ice deposits in the South Pole of Mars that are larger than the state of &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists say that there is enough water in the deposits to cover the entire planet with up to 36 feet of water if the ice was to melt.

A bombing in the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i province of &lt;a href="w%3ADiyala%20Governorate"&gt;Diyala&lt;/a&gt; has killed 15 people, according to local officials. The suicide bomb exploded at the entrance to a local government centre in the city of &lt;a href="w%3ABaquba"&gt;Baquba&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the most deadly areas in Iraq. 39 people were also wounded by the attack.

An anonymous witness of the blast described the bomber. "I heard some of the injured people saying they saw a woman wearing a black robe blow herself up."

This attack comes after a bombing on Tuesday killed 51 people, according to local police. That bomb exploded near a bus stop in the &lt;a href="w%3AHurriya"&gt;Hurriya&lt;/a&gt; area, which is mainly populated with &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20Islam"&gt;Shia Muslims&lt;/a&gt;. 75 people were also wounded in Tuesday's attack, which was the deadliest in the area for three months.

An &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n air safety group claims that &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta%20International%20Airport"&gt;Yogyakarta International Airport&lt;/a&gt; was opearating illegally with no license when &lt;a href="Garuda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737&lt;/a&gt;, crashed at the airport, killing 16 &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;ns and five Australians.

Flight Safety Pty Ltd had been asked to carry out an independent investigation by an anonymous client after the March 2007 disaster, which occurred when the aircraft landed at excessive speed and shot off the end of the runway. Flight Safety has now announced that they have found Yogyakarta International had been granted a five year license but this would be withdrawn after twelve months if several conditions were not met. Since these conditions remained unchanged, the license effectively voided six months before the disaster, claim Flight Safety. One of the conditions was extension of the runway and provision of an adequate &lt;a href="w%3ARunway%20End%20Safety%20Area"&gt;Runway End Safety Area&lt;/a&gt; (RESA). 

The group adds that it also conducted checks on &lt;a href="w%3ASolo%20International%20Airport"&gt;Solo International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAchmad%20Yani%20International%20Airport"&gt;Semarang International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and that these airports also had invalid &lt;a href="w%3AAirport%20Operating%20Certificates"&gt;Airport Operating Certificates&lt;/a&gt;. The final report was not released at the time as the client in question felt it 'too sensitive', and Flight Safety says that it was rapidly covered up three months later when it leaked in Indonesia.

The group says it notified the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organisation"&gt;International Civil Aviation Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (ICAO), and that they in turn said the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Transport%20Safety%20Bureau"&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau&lt;/a&gt; (ATSB) - who assisted in the crash investigation - was in control of the situation. However, Flight Safety claim that when approached, the ATSB denied knowing about it. Allegedly, the ATSB had missed the licensing discrepancy because they only checked the front page of the airport's license and did not conduct a detailed analysis of the small print.

Flight Safety claim that the &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesian%20Director%20of%20Aviation%20Safety"&gt;Indonesian Director of Aviation Safety&lt;/a&gt; told them that the situation had been rectified. However, the group have now conducted a re-audit and say Solo and Yogyakarta airports both remain illegal. They go on to accuse the ICAO, ATSB and Indonesian Director of Aviation Safety of "keeping quiet" and described them as 'compromised'.

Flight Safety go on to claim that the survivors of the crash and relatives of the deceased have not been informed either, and say that this will have a serious effect on the compensation process and on any insurance claims. ♡❤Crikey♡❤, an Australian news service, also suggested that &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;12 million of aid promised by Australia to help Indonesia improve air safety is also being misused. All Indonesia's air carriers are currently on the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;list of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;.

An official statement by Flight Safety head Chris Weir concluded "It [the group's findings] should now be exposed as the safety issues remain unresolved."

Mardjono Siswo Suwarno of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transport%20Safety%20Committee"&gt;National Transport Safety Committee&lt;/a&gt;, the body responsible for investigating the disaster, denied that Yogyakarta Airport was illegal, saying "At that time [the license] was still valid, but the RESA was not long enough... But still in the [Garuda] case, even if the RESA length was adequate, the plane would have still overrun because the speed was 1.8 times normal speed."

The final report found that the pilot-in-command, who has been arrested and charged over the crash, attempted to land after fifteen &lt;a href="w%3AGround%20Proximity%20Warning%20System"&gt;Ground Proximity Warning System&lt;/a&gt; activations to tell him he was landing too fast, and says that although a longer runway and full-sized RESA wouldn't have stopped an airliner traveling at such excessive speed it could have reduced the toll of deaths and injuries.

The directors of Yogyakarta and Solo airports claim that since the re-audit they have taken steps to improve safety and rectify any problems, but have not actually admitted their airports were illegal. Indonesian director general of air transportation Budi Mulyawan Suyitno said that although local budget limitations have prevented some airports from being improved there are no problems currently at Yogyakarta, with improvements including declaration of a RESA for 140 metres of the 2,250 metre runway and stationing &lt;a href="w%3AAircraft%20Rescue%20and%20Firefighting"&gt;Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting&lt;/a&gt; trucks at the airport.

<h1>News briefs:June 23, 2008</h1>
<h2>Ban Ki-moon calls for Zimbawe elections to be postponed</h2>
Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General of the United Nations, has said that the elections in Zimbabwe should be postponed due to the fact that Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Zimbabwe's main opposition party, has said that he will pull out of the race to become the president of Zimbabwe.

Ki-moon released a statement highlighting his concerns. "The Secretary-General deeply regrets that, despite the repeated appeals of the international community, the Government of Zimbabwe has failed to put in place the conditions necessary for free and fair run-off elections," he said.

"The circumstances that led to the withdrawal of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai today from the presidential elections represents a deeply distressing development that does not bode well for the future of democracy in Zimbabwe. The campaign of violence and intimidation that has marred this election has done a great disservice to the people of the country and must end immediately," continued the Secretary general.

He finished by saying that "the Secretary-General has discussed the situation with various leaders, including those of the African Union and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). He strongly supports the statement of the Chairman of SADC that conditions do not exist for a run-off election to be held at this time and that they should be postponed."

This move by Ban Ki-moon comes after Morgan Tsvangirai called for the international community to intervene to improve the situation in Zimbabwe.

<h2>Over 700 feared dead after ferry hit by typhoon</h2>
It is feared that over 700 people have died after a ferry near the Philippines capsized after being hit by Typhoon Fengshen. So far, 38 people from the ferry have been found alive. Some people were washed onto the shore. One of the survivors, Reynato Lanoria, a janitor on the ferry, said that about 100 people jumped into the ocean.

The ferry left Manila en route to Cebu on Friday, and according to the owners, Sulpicio Lines, contact was lost at about 12:30 local time Saturday.

A rescue ship was sent to rescue the survivors, although this only happened 24 hours after contact was lost with the boat.

One of the survivors described the incident. "There were many of us who jumped overboard, but we were separated because of the big waves," he said.

He continued, "The others were also able to board the life rafts, but it was useless because the strong winds flipped them over."

<h2>Phoenix lander confirms presence of water ice on Mars</h2>
For the first time ever, NASA has confirmed the presence of water ice on Mars. The Phoenix lander, which landed on Mars on May 25, has confirmed to NASA scientists that the white substance it found while digging a trench on June 15 is water ice.

"It is with great pride and a lot of joy that I announce today that we have found proof that this hard bright material is really water ice and not some other substance," said Peter Smith, the primary investigator for Phoenix, at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

The chunks were left at the bottom of a trench informally called "Dodo-Goldilocks" when Phoenix's Robotic Arm enlarged that trench on June 15, during the 20th Martian day, or sol, since landing. Several were gone when Phoenix looked at the trench days later. The chunks were visible on June 16, but when Phoenix looked at the trench again on June 19, some of the material had disappeared, implying that it may have evaporated or melted.

"This tells us we've got water ice within reach of the arm, which means we can continue this investigation with the tools we brought with us," said primary investigator for Phoenix's stereo imager, Mark Lemmon.

Scientists are planning to examine the substance and the soil surrounding it more closely. They plan to test it for signs of organic material and minerals, and hope to find out if the ice was ever a liquid which could have supported microbial life.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AICANN"&gt;Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ICANN), a non-profit organisation based in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to regulate internet domain names, will vote on Thursday for a proposal to allow the open registration of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATop-level%20domain"&gt;top-level domains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (TLDs) for Internet addresses. If the proposal succeeds, then as soon as next year any entity with sufficient funds may be able to apply for ownership of a relevant TLD, so that, for example, web sites could have addresses ending in .paris, .ebay or .love.

The range of TLDs has traditionally been heavily restricted by ICANN, with most being country codes (such as .uk for the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, or .jp for &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;) or related to the purpose of a website (like .com for commercial websites, .edu for educational sites, and .org for non-profit organisations). 

Some existing owners of TLDs have already set up arrangements that have made use of their flexibility - for example, the countries of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATuvalu"&gt;Tuvalu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFederated%20States%20of%20Micronesia"&gt;Federated States of Micronesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have leased many domains on their country code TLDs (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A.tv"&gt;.tv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A.fm"&gt;.fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; respectively) to entertainment websites based on the association with "television" and "FM radio".

Commentators have pointed out that this may open the way for the controversial &lt;a href="w%3A.xxx"&gt;.xxx&lt;/a&gt; domain, proposed for sites with adult content, which ICANN has previously rejected. Its existence will not be guaranteed in the new system, however, as domain registration will be subject to an independent arbitration process, and granted only when the registrant can demonstrate "a business plan and technical capability", and applications may be rejected on "morality or public order" grounds. While the proposal does not include registration fees, the TLDs are predicted to cost several thousand dollars, at least.

ICANN CEO Paul Twomey, speaking with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , compared the opening of domains to the opening of real estate in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century. "It's a massive increase in the geography of the real estate of the Internet," he said.

The ICANN International Public Meeting, which opened in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, includes workshops and public forums as well as the ICANN Board meeting.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Two weeks after a 19th century stable and livery on Jersey Street partially collapsed and caused 15 homes to be evacuated in &lt;a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;, residents still do not have answers from the city despite a court order to work with them and come to an agreement on a way to save some or all of the building, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned. Despite the frustration from residents, the city is planning on suing the building's owner. A rally was held at the stable's site where residents are hoping to bring more awareness to the situation and gain more support to save the building.

On June 11, a significant portion of the stable's right side wall collapsed into the yard of a resident's home. Authorities, including the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Buffalo Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; were called to the scene to evaluate the collapse and evacuate 15 homes of residents surrounding the stable as a precautionary measure. The following day, the city ordered an emergency demolition on the building, which was stopped by a restraining order residents with ♡❤Save The Livery♡❤ (www.savethelivery.com) won on June 14. Two weeks later, five homes are still evacuated and residents don't know when they will be able to return.

On June 19, Judge Justice Christopher Burns of the &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;State Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ordered a halt to the emergency demolition and ordered the city and residents to come to an agreement to save the building, or at least a significant portion of it. Despite a court date today, no agreement has yet been reached between the two parties.

"It is in the interest of the city to have a safe environment--but also important to maintain a sense of historical preservation," stated Burns in his June 19th ruling. The court ruled that a limited demolition could take place and that the city was only allowed to remove material in immediate danger to residents and pedestrians, but stated that the demolition could only be performed with "hand tools." The court also ordered that any rubble which had fallen into neighboring yards when the building collapsed, to be removed. Since then, most of not all the significantly damaged portions of the building or portions in immediate danger of falling have been demolished. The roof has also been removed to put less stress on the stable's walls.

"Its been over three years since we have been having problems with part of the livery falling down. There was an implosion two weeks ago and suddenly the city wanted to have an emergency demolition," said Catherine Herrick who lives on Summer Street immediately behind the stable and is the main plaintiff in the lawsuit against the city. Many homes on Summer are small cottages which were used as servants quarters when the stable was in operation, many of which were built in the 1820's. At least seven homes on Summer border the stable's back walls. Residents in those homes have significant gardens which have been planted against the building and growing for decades.

"Both parties are to continue to work together to see how we can meet everybody's needs. This is the third time we have been in that courtroom, and that is what we were basically told to do," added Herrick who said the rally was held today because this "is Buffalo's history. Buffalo is a wonderful place to live because of its history and this is a historical, beautiful building and we need to keep those beautiful buildings."

Herrick states that the city is working with residents, but also believes that its "slow moving" and they are allowing the owner to get away with neglect on the property.

"I believe right now that they are letting the owner get off. The owner was negligent for 20 years, and hasn't done anything to it despite what he has claimed to say. Now that this is an emergency situation, the city has a lot to say about it," added Herrick.

Currently the building is owned by Bob Freudenheim who has several building violations against him because its poor condition. He has received at least five violations in three months and residents who live near the building state that Freudenheim should be "100% responsible" for his actions. 

Freudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be "rehabilitating the building anytime soon." Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the Southeast corner of Forest and Elmwood Avenues. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built. Residents say that he has been the owner for at least 22 years. Attorneys for Freudenheim confirm that the city is starting proceedings against him for his violations beginning as early as Wednesday June 25. Freudenheim has not released a statement and could not be reached for comment.

Many residents want the building preserved and Herrick states that their engineer can have it stable in "four days" as opposed to the 14-30 days it would take to demolish the building and "at a lesser cost than what it costs to demolish it."

It will cost the city nearly &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;300,000 to demolish the building which is paid for with tax money collected from residents in the city. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20News"&gt;Buffalo News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports that fees are approaching $700,000. Though reports say there is a potential buyer of the stable, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ cannot independently confirm those reports.

Residents say the stable was designed by &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20A.%20Waite"&gt;Richard A. Waite&lt;/a&gt;, a 19th century architect, and was first owned by a company called ♡❤White Bros.♡❤, used as a stable and housed at least 30 horses at any given time. It also stored "coaches, coupes, broughams, Victorias and everything in the line of light livery," stated an article from the ♡❤West Side Topics♡❤ dated 1906. According to the article, The company first opened in 1881 on Thirteenth Street, now Normal Avenue, and later moved into the Jersey building in 1892. The &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Buffalo Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; believes the building was built around 1814, while the city property database states it was built in 1870. It is believed to be only one of three stables of this kind still standing in the country.

At about 1950, the stable was converted into an automobile body shop and gasoline station.A property record search showed that in 1950 at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property. Two are listed as 550 square feet while the other two are 2,000 square feet. All of the tanks are designated as a TK4, which &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; State says is used for "below ground horizontal bulk fuel storage." The cost of installing a tank of that nature according to the state, at that time, included the tank itself, "excavation and backfill," but did not include "the piping, ballast, or hold-down slab orring." It is not known if the tanks are still on the property, but residents are concerned the city was not taking the precautions to find out.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has called the city along with the Mayor's office several times, but both have yet to return our calls. There are conflicting reports as to the date of the next hearing. According to Herrick, the next hearing is July 1, 2008 though the Buffalo News states the next hearing is July 8. The News also states that Burns will make a final ruling on the stable at this time.

Divers from the combined teams of the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20Navy"&gt;Philippine Navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; were able to penetrate the interior of the submerged sections of the &lt;a href="w%3AMV%20Princess%20of%20the%20Stars"&gt;MV Princess of the Stars&lt;/a&gt;.

Spokesman for the Navy confirmed fears that there were several passengers of the ill-fated passenger ferry who were trapped when the ferry listed and over turned at around noon of June 22.

Lt. Col. Edgard Arevalo of the Navy said that there could have been survivors initially, passengers who were trapped within a pocket of air but the rescue team were only able to reach and enter the ferry, almost three days since it capsized.

The length of time for any survivor trapped inside the capsized ship to have breathable air would be limited.

Four bodies were retrieved and the team with the help of specialists and salvage teams from the &lt;a href="w%3AUSNS%20GYSGT%20Fred%20W.%20Stockham%20%28T-AK-3017%29"&gt;USNS Stockham&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Navy"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;, supported by the resources of the US carrier group &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Ronald%20Reagan%20%28CVN-76%29"&gt;USS Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; will return on Wednesday morning to attempt to stabilize the ship and retrieve more bodies.

&lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippine&lt;/a&gt; authorities are concerned that boring a hole or disturbing the ferry's present location could cause the ship to slide down into deeper waters or cause an environmental damage to the area due to the fuel the ship carries.

The ferry capsized some 500 meters off the coast of the town of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Fernando%2C%20Romblon"&gt;San Fernando&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARomblon"&gt;Romblon&lt;/a&gt; province.

The U.S. state of &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; entered an agreement on June 24, 2008 to purchase the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Sugar"&gt;U.S. Sugar Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, the largest manufacturer of cane sugar in the U.S., in an effort to restore the &lt;a href="w%3AEverglades"&gt;Everglades&lt;/a&gt;. Terms of the agreement stated that the purchase would be completed within 75 days, but that U.S. Sugar would be able to operate for another six years. After that, the state of Florida will retain ownership of U.S. Sugar's manufacturing facilities in &lt;a href="w%3AClewiston%2C%20Florida"&gt;Clewiston&lt;/a&gt;, Florida, and 187,000 acres of fields that have grown sugarcane since the 1960s will be allowed to return to their natural state.

U.S. Sugar and the state of Florida have been in legal disputes since the &lt;a href="w%3AEverglades%20Forever%20Act"&gt;Everglades Forever Act&lt;/a&gt; was passed in 1994. The act was an attempt to clean up water tainted with &lt;a href="w%3Aphosphorus"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt;, a component of fertilizer, which runs off the sugarcane fields and into the Everglades.

Phosphorus alters Everglades ecosystems, allowing invasive and exotic &lt;a href="w%3Acattails"&gt;cattails&lt;/a&gt; to replace &lt;a href="w%3ACladium"&gt;sawgrass&lt;/a&gt; when levels rise above 50 parts per billion (ppb). Tests in the 1980s in the &lt;a href="w%3ALoxahatchee%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge"&gt;Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge&lt;/a&gt; directly south of sugarcane fields indicated that the water had 500 ppb of phosphorus.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Institute%20of%20Health%20and%20Welfare"&gt;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare&lt;/a&gt; (AIHW) conference, held in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, received mixed messages on Tuesday about the health of Australians. While average life expectancy is 81.4 years, second only to Japan's 82.2, and rates of cancer, heart disease and stroke are dropping, incidence of obesity, alcohol-related diseases, and sexually transmitted infections are on the increase.

The AIHW report highlighted the increasing gap between Australia's &lt;a href="w%3AIndigenous%20Australians"&gt;Indigenous&lt;/a&gt; population and the rest of the nation. &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Aborigines"&gt;Australian Aborigines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATorres%20Strait%20Islanders"&gt;Torres Strait Islanders&lt;/a&gt; have a life expectancy around 17 years lower than the general populace, and in at least four states 71% of Aboriginals who died were under 65-years old, compared with 21% for the rest of the population. Indigenous Australians are reported to have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, respiratory illness, teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. People living in rural and regional areas were also found to have lower life expectancies and higher illness rates than their suburban and metropolitan counterparts.

While obesity is a growing concern in Australia, AIHW director Penny Allbon expressed skepticism over a recent report from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute that claimed that Australia had overtaken the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; as the "fattest" nation in the world, with "over four million adult Australians [...] currently obese". Allben commented that the institute's sample from 100 locations across the country may not be representative of the whole population. "At the moment the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics"&gt;ABS&lt;/a&gt; [Australian Bureau of Statistics] is out there measuring height and weight in a population-based survey, so we don't know the results," Dr Allbon said. "We were just a bit concerned that the statistics that came out about us being the fattest in the world is not based on a population survey." AIHW reported the number of Australians being obese as closer to 2.5 million, with 7.4 million being overweight.

Between 1997 and 2005, the number of &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20practitioner"&gt;general practitioners&lt;/a&gt; in Australia has dropped 9%, although in regional areas there has been an increase of 15%.

Based on the report, the AIHW has recommended that Australians consider lifestyle change, such as healthier eating and more exercise, to alleviate the pressure on Australia's public health system. "In rank order, the greatest improvements can be achieved through reductions in tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, high blood cholesterol and excessive alcohol consumption," according to Dr. Allbon.

&lt;a href="Animal%20rights"&gt;Animal rights&lt;/a&gt; activists have complained after officials from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon"&gt;Wimbledon tennis tournament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shot down &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFeral%20Pigeon"&gt;pigeons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , allegedly because they were an inconvenience to players. This move was possibly illegal under Animal Welfare Act 2006, which prevents using lethal force unless it is used as a last resort.
♡❤Wikinews♡❤ spoke to Bruce Friedrich, Vice President of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeople%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals"&gt;PETA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which has campaigned against the move. He said that "killing animals so quickly and for such frivolous reasons is cruel, illegal, and won’t work."

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has also been told by Friedrich that "the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAll%20England%20Lawn%20Tennis%20and%20Croquet%20Club"&gt;All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; should still be prosecuted for cruelty to animals, since they broke the law and should be held accountable."Violation of the Animal Welfare act carries a maximum sentence of "imprisonment for a term not exceeding 51 weeks" or a fine "not exceeding £20,000"

Wikinews has also been given a copy of the letter sent to Wimbledon officials. Below is the text of the first paragraph:
The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (which runs the Wimbledon Championships) has not yet released a statement regarding the incident, although ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Independent"&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ has reported that one will be made after the tournament.

In a 5-4 vote, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; overturned the &lt;a href="w%3Acapital%20punishment"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt; for Patrick Kennedy, convicted of &lt;a href="w%3Arape"&gt;raping&lt;/a&gt; a child, saying it is not proportional to the crime and that it violates the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Constitutional&lt;/a&gt; ban on &lt;a href="w%3Acruel%20and%20unusual%20punishment"&gt;cruel and unusual punishment&lt;/a&gt;, and thereby setting a &lt;a href="w%3Aprecedent"&gt;precedent&lt;/a&gt;.

In the case ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20v.%20Louisiana"&gt;Kennedy v. Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Patrick Kennedy of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; was convicted of raping his eight-year old stepdaughter, and was sentenced to death for the crime. A Louisiana law adopted in 1995 allowed the death penalty for those who had raped a child under 12 years old (later amended to 13). Five other states have similar laws, while the remaining states ban the death penalty for rape. The last execution for rape in America occurred in 1964.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Louisiana Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; defended Kennedy's sentence, saying that "short of first-degree murder, we can think of no other non-homicide crime more deserving" of the death penalty. Kennedy, who was one of two criminals on death row in America who did not commit murder, challenged the court's decision, and the case was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Writing for the majority, Justice &lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Kennedy"&gt;Anthony Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; said the Constitution did not allow the death penalty where the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in a person's death. He noted exceptions in cases of crimes against the state, such as &lt;a href="w%3Atreason"&gt;treason&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aespionage"&gt;espionage&lt;/a&gt;. Despite "the years of long anguish that must be endured by the victim of child rape," Justice Kennedy wrote, "the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken." He added, "When the law punishes by death, it risks its own sudden descent into brutality, transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint."
The four liberal-leaning justices (&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Souter"&gt;Souter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Bader%20Ginsburg"&gt;Ginsburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Breyer"&gt;Breyer&lt;/a&gt;) joined Kennedy, a &lt;a href="w%3Amoderate"&gt;moderate&lt;/a&gt; who often casts the deciding vote in close cases. The four conservative-leaning justices (&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Roberts"&gt;Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAntonin%20Scalia"&gt;Scalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20Thomas"&gt;Thomas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20Alito"&gt;Alito&lt;/a&gt;) dissented. 

Samuel Alito wrote in his dissent, "The harm that is caused to the victims and to society at large by the worst child rapists is grave... It is the judgment of the Louisiana lawmakers and those in an increasing number of other states that these harms justify the death penalty." Alito said the decision would bar the death penalty "no matter how young the child, no matter how many times the child is raped, no matter how many children the perpetrator rapes, no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how much physical or psychological trauma is inflicted, and no matter how heinous the perpetrator's prior criminal record may be."

Louisiana governor &lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Jindal"&gt;Bobby Jindal&lt;/a&gt; also criticized the court's decision. "One thing is clear: The five members of the court who issued the opinion do not share the same 'standards of decency' as the people of Louisiana," Jindal said.

The presumptive &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; Presidential nominee and &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; state senator &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; conveyed his sympathies and condolonces to the people of the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; through President &lt;a href="w%3AGloria%20Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;, after the country was struck over the weekend by &lt;a href="w%3ATyphoon%20Fengshen%20%282008%29"&gt;Typhoon Fengshen&lt;/a&gt;.

Obama also extended his regrets for not being able to meet Mrs. Arroyo who is on a 10-day official visit in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and met up with President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; at the White House.

The senator from Illinois stressed the strong bond between the Philippines and the United States, taking note of the two countries partnership during the &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; era and during the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;. Obama also pointed out that the Philippines is also an important ally in the on-going war on terror.

He also expressed his desire on meeting Arroyo in the future and working closely with the people of the Philippines.

He also urged the Bush administration to provide more aid to the Philippines in the wake of the retrieval of victims of Typhoon Fengshen who drowned or were lost at sea.

Obama urged the "US government to provide emergency support to alleviate the suffering caused by the catastrophic natural disaster." 

Typhoon Fengshen lashed through the islands of the Philippines last June 21 to 22 causing mud floods, landslides and the capsizing of a passenger ferry, the &lt;a href="w%3AMV%20Princess%20of%20the%20Stars"&gt;MV Priness of the Stars&lt;/a&gt;, killing more than 700 passengers on board off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ARomblon"&gt;Romblon&lt;/a&gt; island.

The National Disaster Coordinating Agency of the Philippines reported that five days after the ferry tragedy, only 48 passengers survived and rescuers were able to retrieve 67 bodies.

Transportation and Communications Secretary Leandro Mendoza also reported that 138 fishing vessels were reported missing as a result of Typhoon Fengshen.

A cargo vessel, the MV Lake Paoay carrying 5,000 metric tons of coal from the mines in Semirara island was also lost off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AIloilo"&gt;Iloilo&lt;/a&gt; province.

<h2>Marine inquiry begins</h2>

The Board of Marine Inquiry of the Philippines was convened Wednesday on the possible criminal and civil liability of the owners of the passenger ferry MV Princess of the Stars.

Rear Admiral Ramon Liwag ordered the management of Sulpicio Lines to submit several documents such as certificates of conveniences, permits to depart port, navigational manuals and other important papers by June 27.

Liwag was also hopeful that the ferry's captain, Florencio Marimon, Sr. survived the mishap and shed light on what really happened.

During Wednesday's inquiry, Sulpicio Executive Vice-President Edgar Go assured the panel that the ferry was in top condition.

Liwag questioned Go as to how the ferry was cleared to sail Friday night when Typhoon Fengshen was plotted by the weather bureau to strike the area Cebu province were the ferry was destined.

The inquiry told Sulpicio Lines that as of June 2007, the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;Philippine Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; was mandated under a Memorandum Circular stating, "restricting movements during bad weather, vessels of any size are banned from travel when public storm signal 3 and 4 are raised within the point of origin, route and destination."

The representative of Sulpicio Lines denied any knowledge of such a circular.

The &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; and other members of the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociation%20of%20Southeast%20Asian%20Nations"&gt;Association of Southeast Asian Nations&lt;/a&gt; (ASEAN) are becoming alarmed over the rapid increase of global oil prices and are seriously looking into prospects of building nuclear powered plants to energize the electric needs of the 10 member nations of ASEAN.

The heads of Asean Power Utilities/Authorities (Hapua) Council got together in &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; this week and are forming an ASEAN Power Grid.

Energy ministers and delegates from ASEAN member countries, &lt;a href="Brunei"&gt;Brunei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Laos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; and the Philippines are pursuing alternative sources of energy and connecting the power grids of the member countries.

A task force was created by the Philippines Department of Energy that will look into the possibility of using nuclear power as a counter-measure to dependence on oil to power up the Philippines and the rest of ASEAN's power generators.

Energy secretary Angelo Reyes also received the recommendations from a six-man team from the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; on the prospects of operating the moth-balled &lt;a href="w%3ABataan%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant"&gt;Bataan Nuclear Power Plant&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABataan"&gt;Bataan&lt;/a&gt; nuclear plant was first built in the late seventies under the administration of President &lt;a href="w%3AFerdinand%20Marcos"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt; but was scrapped by President &lt;a href="w%3ACorazon%20Aquino"&gt;Corazon Aquino&lt;/a&gt; in 1986 owing to kick-backs in the plant's construction and safety concerns.

Reyes stated that the council and the department was also looking into alternative sources of renewal energy such as solar and wind power, biomass, geothermal and hydro-electric to reduce dependency on fossil fuel.

For the time, the Philippines has implemented several measures on conserving energy particularly the conversion to compact fluorescent lights (CFLs).

A large &lt;a href="w%3Adry%20lightning"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; storm this week sparked over 800 &lt;a href="w%3Awildfires"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. A lightning storm this past Friday caused wildfires burning from &lt;a href="w%3AMendocino%20County"&gt;Mendocino County&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AMonterey%20County"&gt;Monterey County&lt;/a&gt;, the latter a county that has been declared an emergency zone, along with &lt;a href="w%3ATrinity%20County"&gt;Trinity County&lt;/a&gt;. Of the 800 wildfires burning, recent numbers say that around 200 are unattended, some being left to burn themselves out.

Over 100,000 acres have been burned from these wildfires. Already an early fire season, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Climatic%20Data%20Center"&gt;National Climatic Data Center&lt;/a&gt; reports this has been the driest spring in 114 years of record keeping. The lack of precipitation and dry thunderstorms have turned the northern part of the state into a smoky inferno. Smoke is so bad in Sacramento (and as far away as Reno) that health authorities have encouraged the public to stay inside, and in Monterey County some residents were ordered to evacuate.

Governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; asked for help from other states, and &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; have thus far responded. Oregon has sent 2,400 &lt;a href="w%3Afirefighter"&gt;firefighters&lt;/a&gt; already. Nevada itself has struggled with wildfires, nearly 100 fires are estimated to be burning. Oregon does not have as many wildfires due to their saturated climate.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20Human%20Rights%20Commission"&gt;Asian Human Rights Commission&lt;/a&gt; or AHRC appealed to the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; government to seriously pursue judicial options against victims of &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; in the country.

The AHRC press statement was issued as part of the commemoration of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;' International Day in Support of Victims of Torture calendared every June 26.

AHRC is a regional non-governmental organization monitoring and lobbying human rights issues in &lt;a href="w%3AAsia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;. The Hong Kong-based group was founded in 1984

The statement claimed that the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines%20constitution"&gt;Philippines Constitution&lt;/a&gt; specifically prohibits torture but there was no specific law against it, The group also lamented that, ♡❤"there no judicial remedy for a violation of this right, torture has also not been declared a crime in the Philippines."♡❤

An appeal was also conveyed to the Supreme Court to plan and implement remedies for torture victims and appealed to the country's law makers to enact a law specifically banning and criminilizing any acts of torture.

AHRC compared the Philippines to &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, wherein both countries are signatories to the Convention against Torture Act of 1994 of the United Nations.

The group cited that,♡❤ "Sri Lanka has already complied with its obligation under the convention, the Philippines, which has signed and ratified the same U.N. convention against torture, has not done so despite being a party to the convention since June 1987.♡❤"

The president of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20Petroleum%20Exporting%20Countries"&gt;Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&lt;/a&gt; (OPEC) &lt;a href="w%3AChakib%20Khelil"&gt;Chakib Khelil&lt;/a&gt; predicts that prices of world crude oil could reach the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;150 to $170 range per barrel before this year's summer ends.

In an interview on the French news channel &lt;a href="w%3AFrance24"&gt;France24&lt;/a&gt;, Khelil who is also &lt;a href="Algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;'s energy minister, also stated that prices won't reach $200 per barrel when asked as to how far would prices would go up.

During the interview, Khelil said that prices would depend on how far the United States puts pressure on oil producer &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, over its nuclear program and on the stability of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;, Europe's currency.

In a transcript of the France24 interview, the OPEC President said, "I think that the devaluation of the dollar against the euro, if everything goes as I think it will, will be of the order of perhaps 1-2 percent and this will probably generate an $8 rise in the price of oil," he said.

The OPEC president blamed the weakness of the U.S. dollar as the main reason for the current prices of oil.

Khelil was also quoted saying, "You can see it, every time there is a strengthening of the dollar, there's a drop in prices."

Come September, Khelil said that the thirteen member countries of OPEC will review its hands off policy on the sky rocketing prices of world crude oil.

Western nations has been pressuring OPEC to increase oil production to halt the soaring oil prices.

Fulfilling a pledge of fairness, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; announced Thursday that the United States will soon remove &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; from a list of countries seen as 'sponsoring &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;' in the world.

The announcement was made as a 'reward' to North Korea for turning over all documents related to its controversial &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20program%20of%20North%20Korea"&gt;nuclear program&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3APyongyang"&gt;Pyongyang&lt;/a&gt; turned over to &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; documents related to its &lt;a href="w%3Aplutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt; core and waste activities.

Pyongyang finally turned over documents and plans of its &lt;a href="w%3AYongbyon%20Nuclear%20Scientific%20Research%20Center"&gt;nuclear enrichment facilities&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AYongbyong"&gt;Yongbyong&lt;/a&gt;. 

North Korean state television also announced that the state will televise the demolition of the cooling tower of the Yongbyong nuclear facilities on Friday.

Mr. Bush called the North Korean action as a positive step with no illusions. He also said that the act truly pleased him and it's just the first step towards repairing North Korea's relation and status with the world community.
The president added that in response to the act, he will lift the trade sanctions under the &lt;a href="w%3ATrading%20With%20the%20Enemy%20Act"&gt;Trading With the Enemy Act&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; will also inform the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; that in 45 days, the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; will remove North Korea from a list of nations that sponsor terrorism.

The United States reminded North Korea that it still has some requirements to complete in order for the country to be completely removed from its diplomatic and economic isolation. Pyongyang still remains obliged to answer questions such as the degree of its uranium enrichment and proliferation that possibly benefited &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;.

The United Nations sanction sponsored by the United States issued on February 13, 2007 also demanded for a complete accounting of the alleged half a dozen units of nuclear bombs, the real number and its actual location. 

U.S. National Security Adviser &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Hadley"&gt;Stephen Hadley&lt;/a&gt; downplayed any heightened expectations from North Korea and branded the latest act as a mere "stepping stone." Hadley warned that the process remains delicate and there will still be "definite consequences," if North Korea fails to fulfill its end of the bargain.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; expressed 'unease' over the decision of the United States to remove North Korea from the 'terror' list, claiming that there is still a need to resolve issues about the kidnapping of Japanese nationals by agents of Pyongyang.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled Thursday in a 5-4 decision that a &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; ban of personal firearms possession is unconstitutional. In a majority opinion written by &lt;a href="w%3AAntonin%20Scalia"&gt;Antonin Scalia&lt;/a&gt;, the court found that "&lt;nowiki&gt;[t]&lt;/nowiki&gt;he &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Second Amendment&lt;/a&gt; protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home." 

Justice &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;John Paul Stevens&lt;/a&gt; delivered a dissenting opinion that acknowledged an individual right protected by the Second Amendment, but disagreed about the "scope" of that amendment, writing, "&lt;nowiki&gt;[w]&lt;/nowiki&gt;hether it also protects the right to possess and use guns for nonmilitary purposes like hunting and personal self-defense is the question presented by this case."

The case, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20of%20Columbia%20v.%20Heller"&gt;District of Columbia v. Heller&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, stemmed from a lawsuit brought by special police officer Dick Heller against the Washington, D.C. city government after it refused to issue a permit for him to keep a handgun in his home for personal protection. The District of Columbia had based this refusal on the &lt;a href="w%3AFirearms%20Control%20Regulations%20Act%20of%201975"&gt;Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975&lt;/a&gt;.

The Supreme Court decision upheld a 2007 ruling by the D.C. federal appellate court that had nullified gun possession restrictions and trigger lock requirements in the 1975 law.

D.C. Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AAdrian%20Fenty"&gt;Adrian Fenty&lt;/a&gt; expressed disappointment in the outcome of this case, but stated that he will order the district's police department to provide a means for citizens to register handguns within 21 days. "It is important to respect the court's authority and to act quickly," Fenty said.

A grocer in &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; has been told that, under regulations brought in by the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, he is not allowed to sell a recently imported batch of &lt;a href="w%3Akiwi%20fruit"&gt;kiwi fruit&lt;/a&gt; because they are too small. A spokesperson for the UK's &lt;a href="w%3ARural%20Payments%20Agency"&gt;Rural Payments Agency&lt;/a&gt; said that they failed the EU standards for fruit. 

Tim Down, the grocer involved, responded angrily to the action taken by government. "I was given 24 hours to think about it and my outrage grew." He continued "They are perfectly fit to eat. These regulations come at a time when rising food prices are highlighted and we're being forced to throw away perfectly good food."

Down then claimed that there was no problem with the food. "There is nothing wrong with its palatability, it's purely because it is slightly less than the prescribed minimum size."

The government officials found that some of the Kiwis weighed only 58 grams, four grams below the required level. The EU has said that it plans to lessen the restrictions imposed by the regulation, potentially stopping an incident like this occurring in the future.

"The inspector's decision is consistent with RPA's commitment to protect consumers, who must feel confident that the produce they are buying is of the right quality," said a spokesperson of the Rural Payments Agency, explaining the move.

Under the Agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964, selling undersized fruit, or providing them at no cost, is an offence which can carry a penalty of £5,000. The &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20Standards%20Agency"&gt;Food Standards Agency&lt;/a&gt; has said that the act "provides for the application and enforcement in Great Britain of European Community Regulations specifying the grading, marketing and labelling requirements for certain fresh fruit and vegetables and makes certain acts or omissions that contravene those rules punishable offences. "

Two days before the actual slug out between US-born fighter &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20D%C3%ADaz"&gt;"Dangerous" David Díaz&lt;/a&gt; (34-1-1, 17 KOs) and challenger, a three title holder &lt;a href="w%3AFilipino"&gt;Filipino&lt;/a&gt; boxing champion, Emmanuel "Pacman" Pacquiao (46-3-2, 34 KOs) occurs in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; on June 28, 2008 the two trades verbal punches at each other during a meeting with members of sports media.

The camp of &lt;a href="w%3AManny%20Pacquiao"&gt;Manny Pacquiao&lt;/a&gt; led by manager Freddie Roach claimed that Diaz will need a "fucking miracle" to stop 'The Pacman' from moving up to the 135 lbs. weight class where Diaz is top brass.

The side of Diaz led by Jim Strickland warned that tough Pacquiao has three belts in boxing, Diaz should not be discounted.

Boxing punters observed that Diaz has a lot of heft in the way he delivers his punches but Pacquiao's speed and strong punches are something Diaz should be wary about.

Pacquiao has won three different belts in three different weight classes of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Boxing%20Council"&gt;World Boxing Council&lt;/a&gt; or WBC.

Diaz debuted in the boxing world when he was part of the winning &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Games"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; boxing team during the &lt;a href="w%3A1996%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;1996 Atlanta Olympic&lt;/a&gt; games.

The 32-year-old native of &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; claimed the 135 lbs. title from &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89rik%20Morales"&gt;Érik Morales&lt;/a&gt; and plans to defend it a third time against the Philippines' prize fighter.

Meanwhile, Pacquiao dedicated his bout against Diaz to all the victims of &lt;a href="w%3ATyphoon%20Fengshen"&gt;Typhoon Fengshen&lt;/a&gt; which devastated his home country, the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, and killed hundreds of people.

&lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s former president &lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Mandela"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; will turn 90 on July 18, but despite his retirement from the public eye five years ago, his age has never prevented him from being pushed back into the limelight.

Political, business and showbiz elite from around the world arrived in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to greet South Africa's long-imprisoned champion of anti-&lt;a href="w%3Aapartheid"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt; with a fund-raising concert on Friday, June 27.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, talk-show queen &lt;a href="w%3AOprah%20Winfrey"&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; winning actor &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20De%20Niro"&gt;Robert De Niro&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Bond"&gt;James Bond&lt;/a&gt; actor &lt;a href="w%3APierce%20Brosnan"&gt;Pierce Brosnan&lt;/a&gt; were among the stars joining Mandela in the British capital.

The Mandela birthday celebration will be capped with a concert at &lt;a href="w%3AHyde%20Park%2C%20London"&gt;Hyde Park&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that will feature Annie Lennox, &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20%28band%29"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;, Razorlight, &lt;a href="w%3ALeona%20Lewis"&gt;Leona Lewis&lt;/a&gt; and the Soweto Gospel Choir.

The proceeds from the concert will go to Mandela's 46664 Foundation that looks after people suffering from &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; in his beloved South Africa.

Mandela was imprisoned for a total of 27 years by a then predominantly white South African government until the abolition of apartheid in the country.

In a sweeping change of the political landscape in the wealthiest country in the African continent, Mandela was elected as the first black president of the country in 1994.

Mandela said before members of media that, though he may be retired, he still works for his suffering people and he wants to take advantage of his landmark birthday to raise funds for his charity work.

<h2>Mandela criticizes Robert Mugabe</h2>

Former South African President Nelson Mandela criticized &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;'s President &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt;, labeling him a "tragic failure of leadership." Mandela expressed his sadness over the political and economic chaos that now rocks South Africa's biggest neighbor, to its north-west.

The former anti-apartheid leader broke his silence while in London after hearing of accounts that opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AMorgan%20Tsvangirai"&gt;Morgan Tsvangirai&lt;/a&gt; withdrew from the scheduled next phase of the run-off presidential elections in Zimbabwe.

Mandela's statement is expected to put pressure on his successor, President &lt;a href="w%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt;, to finally speak out against Mugabe.

The three 100 foot &lt;a href="w%3Areinforced%20concrete"&gt;reinforced concrete&lt;/a&gt; sugar storage silos around which the investigation into the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Georgia%20sugar%20refinery%20explosion"&gt;2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion&lt;/a&gt; is centred have been demolished. The February &lt;a href="w%3Aindustrial%20disaster"&gt;industrial disaster&lt;/a&gt; killed 13 people when the &lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20Sugar"&gt;Imperial Sugar&lt;/a&gt; refinery at &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Wentworth%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Port Wentworth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; exploded.

The initial investigation concluded the disaster to have been a &lt;a href="w%3Adust%20explosion"&gt;dust explosion&lt;/a&gt; that ignited under the silos, but investigators from the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Chemical%20Safety%20Board"&gt;U.S. Chemical Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; (CSB) and the &lt;a href="w%3AOccupational%20Health%20and%20Safety%20Administration"&gt;Occupational Health and Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt; (OSHA) have been hampered as OSHA declared them to be unsafe after the accident.

A 7,000lb wrecking ball has now been brought in and demolished the structures, which were 18 inches thick. This will allow access for investigators, and make way for replacement silos and a new sugar packaging building, which are scheduled to be in place by Summer 2009. The refinery hopes to restart sugar processing by the end of the year.

Imperial vice president Brian Harrison, who is overseeing reconstruction at the site, said of the move "Several people have indicated to me it's a passage from the old to the new and a significant sign of the progress we're making to rebuild."

2.8 million pounds of fire-hardened sugar were still present in one silo, and 500,000 pounds in another. Imperial brought in a crane with a bucket to retrive this and intends to recycle it for &lt;a href="w%3Aethanol"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt; production.

Four workers are still hospitalised after the explosion, three in critical condition. The disaster is also blamed for a $15.5 million loss Imperial posted in this year's first quarter.

As the National Disaster Coordinating Agency continues to evaluate the reports coming from regions all over the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, bodies of those who drowned or perished while at sea have started to float into the shores of islands in Central Philippines. On Thursday, the Philippines Coast Guard reported that villagers recovered 124 bodies whose identities are still uncertain.

Advanced decomposition has made identification difficult for authorities and, fearing a health epidemic, all of the bodies were immediately buried in makeshift graves.

The identification of the victims has caused a stir among relatives looking for their missing family members, as forensic investigators were rendered helpless in proceeding to the scattered locations where bodies have been washing ashore.

Over 100 divers from the combined Philippines and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; naval forces have been working overtime to retrieve the bodies of passengers trapped inside the capsized &lt;a href="w%3AMV%20Princess%20of%20the%20Stars"&gt;MV Princess of the Stars&lt;/a&gt;.

Disaster management officials in the country announced that the dead from the weekend battering from &lt;a href="w%3ATyphoon%20Fengshen"&gt;Typhoon Fengshen&lt;/a&gt; could reach to a high of 1,300 people nation-wide. State officials reported that some 2.4 million Filipinos were affected by the disaster, putting property damage at a conservative estimate of $125 million.

Relatives of missing passengers were finally brought near the site where the ferry capsized. On board a tug boat, relatives became severely emotional after a &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; mass was celebrated to commemorate the memory of those lost at sea.

Scientists at &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration claimed that they were "flabbergasted" by their discovery on the possibility that life could grow on Martian soil.

"It is the type of soil you would probably have in your back yard, you know, alkaline. You might be able to grow asparagus in it really well. ... It is very exciting for us," said Sam Kounaves, the lead &lt;a href="w%3AWet%20chemistry"&gt;wet chemist&lt;/a&gt; at NASA.

The project did not elaborate any further if there was indeed life on Mars, down to the microbe level and instead stated that their discovery was only preliminary and more analysis will be needed.

There was still no evidence in the soil that "would preclude life," and instead of an assumption of a toxic environment, Martian soil is actually, "very friendly."
The discovery was made after the Mars Phoenix Lander scooped up Martian soil for analysis. The lander touched down on Mars on May 25, 2008 and has been conducting several survey projects.

After 33 years of managing software giant Microsoft, founder Bill Gates will retire from day-to-day management today.

Gates will retain the title of Chairman but without executive functions and will only report for work once a week.

The man who took a gut feeling of seeing personal computers in every household, each requiring a stable operating system will now pursue philanthropic activities under the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Microsoft did not announce any major event to mark the day when its founder steps down but internal private activities were scheduled to take place at the company's headquarters at Redmond, Washington.

In the year 2000, the functions of being Chief Executive of Microsoft was turned over to long-time partner Steve Ballmer.

As Gates leaves day-to-day operations, two people will assume his two vital duties. Craig Mundie will handle the company's long-term planning while Ray Ozzie will handle the operations.

Gates will focus more on helping out in causes he chooses through his foundation that is endowed with $38.7 billion and will soon gain more funds with his personal wealth and an endowment from billionaire Warren Buffet.

Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1975 which has since dominated the market for operating systems in personal computers. Gates managed close to 78,000 employees in 103 countries all over the world.

In recent months, Microsoft's dominance has been threatened by Google which dominates the on-line industry and has business models that will soon eat up into Microsoft's core software businesses.

The process of reconciliation and unifying the Democratic party started at the ballroom of the Mayflower hotel in Washington, DC with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and his wife both individually issuing a check amounting to $2,300 to the Hillary Clinton for President committee.

New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton introduced to her fund contributors Illinois Senator Barack Obama as the first step of unifying the two sides who quite recently bitterly fought over winning the Democratic party's nomination.

Hillary Clinton appealed to her supporters to help Barack Obama and pledged that she will personally help in defeating the presidential plans of Republican presumptive Presidential candidate, Arizona senator John McCain.

Mrs. Clinton asked for nothing in exchange for her support of Obama, but Obama instead countered with a gesture of contributing to Mrs. Clinton campaign that is now burdened by debt. Obama signaled his own contributors to help Clinton pay off the debt incurred by her campaign.

A Casa-212 aircraft owned by the &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n air force disappeared while on a flight from the capital &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to Bogor in West Java Friday morning.

The plane was carrying 12 Indonesian military personnel and 6 civilians including a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;an and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n national.

The plane was tasked to test a new digital camera designed to conduct aerial mapping and topography.

The aircraft was last sighted on radar in the Salak moutain region on the main island of Java, 90 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of the Indonesian capital.

The Indonesian military has deployed a search and rescue team in the area.

Authorities fear that the aircraft crashed in a densely forested area making any rescue difficult.

Air Force spokesman Chaeruddin Ray said the region was covered in thick fog and in a rough terrain.

Three planes and forty people were deployed into the region to look for the downed plane.

Indonesia has been plagued with several plane accidents resulting in a ban on the entry of Indonesian airlines into &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an airports. This is the second incident in Indonesian aviation involving a Casa-212. In January of 2008, a similar plane model owned by a private company also crashed.

The Casa-212 is a design by &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; avionics company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEADS%20CASA"&gt;Construcciones Aeronáuticas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a turbo-prop plane designed for a short take-off and landing.

The Spanish company licensed an Indonesian avionics firm to assemble and manufacture this aircraft.

At 23:59 GMT yesterday, a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AProton%20rocket"&gt;Proton rocket&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href="w%3ABlock%20DM"&gt;Block DM-3&lt;/a&gt; upper stage, launched from Site 81/24 at the &lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, placing a &lt;a href="w%3ASPRN-2%20Prognoz%E2%80%8E"&gt;Prognoz satellite&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Ministry%20of%20Defence"&gt;Russian Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href="w%3AGeosynchronous%20orbit"&gt;geosynchronous orbit&lt;/a&gt;. Prognoz satellites are used for missile detection, as a defence against nuclear attacks.

The Proton-K configuration was used for this launch. The Proton-K, also known as the Proton 8K72K, is an old configuration, which is out of production. It is believed that three more Proton-K rockets are in storage. The modernised Proton-M, which will replace it, has been in use for commercial launches for several years, and made its first military launch last December.

This is the first launch of a Proton since a failure in March, which left the &lt;a href="w%3AAMC-14"&gt;AMC-14&lt;/a&gt; satellite stranded in a useless orbit. The &lt;a href="w%3ABriz-M"&gt;Briz-M&lt;/a&gt; upper stage, whose malfunction resulted in the launch failure, was not used in today's launch, with an older Block DM stage being flown instead. The Briz-M has been cleared for return to flight, and was not used on this mission due to payload requirements, rather than reliability concerns. AMC-14 has now been sold to a new company, and is now in the process of raising itself into a geosynchronous orbit, where it will operate in a limited capacity for a fraction of its planned lifetime. 

The launch is the 33 of &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20in%20spaceflight"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the 335 flight of a Proton rocket. The next Proton launch is currently planned for July, when a Proton-M with a Block DM-2 upper stage will launch three &lt;a href="w%3AGLONASS"&gt;GLONASS&lt;/a&gt; navigation satellites.

<h1>North Korea destroys nuclear cooling tower</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=North%20Korea%20destroys%20nuclear%20cooling%20tower&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; producer reported that the &lt;a href="North%20Korean"&gt;North Korean&lt;/a&gt; authorities did indeed destroy the cooling tower of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYongbyong%20nuclear%20facility"&gt;Yongbyong nuclear facility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and admitted on global television that they did extract &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aplutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the said facility to build &lt;a href="nuclear%20weapons"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;.

Five television networks from countries party to the six-nation talks that constructively engaged North Korea to disengage in its nuclear weapons program were invited into the country to cover and televise the destruction of the cooling towers.

Specialists in nuclear science confirmed that the implosion of the cooling tower will prevent North Korean from processing plutonium for about a year. It will take at least twelve months to rebuild the cooling tower if the North Koreans intend to pursue its nuclear weapons building program.

The destruction of the cooling tower is seen as a gesture of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APyongyang"&gt;Pyongyang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leadership to finally comply to pressures coming from the West, particularly the United States for the communist run government to end pursuing its nuclear weapons program.

The facilities at Yongbyong was shuttered July of last year as part of talks with dialog partners; &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The cooling tower is approximately 20 meters in height and has been in operation since March 2003 until July of last year. The destruction of the tower is viewed as a symbolic gesture since the entire facility has been scheduled for scrapping.

On Thursday, North Korea turned over to China a 60-page document confirming the country's capability to control the power of plutonium since the program was started in 1986.

In the said document, Pyongyang confirmed that their research resulted in the extraction of 40 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akilogram"&gt;kilograms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of enriched plutonium, enough to produce at least seven nuclear warheads.

An actual accounting of North Korea's possession of live nuke weapons was not included in the report presented to China and remains as a speculation.

Also missing were reports and confirmation of North Korea's assistance to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the later's own nuclear weapons program as well as reports of Pyongyang's uranium enrichment program.

<h1>BBC spends £3.4m on sell-off</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=BBC%20spends%20%C2%A33.4m%20on%20sell-off&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports today that the sale of the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Resources"&gt;BBC Resources Ltd&lt;/a&gt;., has cost &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;3.4m in consultancy fees — over £1m more than the £2.3m trading profit the commercial division is estimated to have made for the last financial year. Details of the failed privatisation were released by the BBC following a &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act%202000"&gt;freedom of information&lt;/a&gt; request, and prior to publication of its annual report on July 8.

Fourteen months after advisers were appointed to try to sell BBC Resources Ltd., only one of the three main business units has been sold — its Outside Broadcast division to &lt;a href="w%3ASatellite%20Information%20Services"&gt;Satellite Information Services Limited&lt;/a&gt; (SIS), for an estimated £20m. On March 7, 2008 it was also announced that the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Studios"&gt;studios&lt;/a&gt; operation would remain in BBC ownership and in early June, the fate of the third business was put on hold with the BBC stating that ♡❤"like Studios, Post Production will remain within BBC Resources, which will continue to operate as a wholly-owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC."♡❤

BBC Resources Ltd. made an operating profit of £6.1m for 2005-06, down from £7.4m the year before, with the BBC accounting for 83.3% of its turnover, down from 87.4% for 2004-05. Last year's published figure for 2006-07 was £5.2 million — with BBC business at 80% of turnover.

&lt;a href="w%3ABroadcasting%2C%20Entertainment%2C%20Cinematograph%20and%20Theatre%20Union"&gt;BECTU&lt;/a&gt; Assistant General Secretary Luke Crawley is quoted as saying: ♡❤"It's fairly outrageous that around half the profit of the company [announced last year] has been spent trying to sell it. It's an inordinate amount of money. The BBC was promised big returns if it sold BBC Resources but it's only managed to sell outside broadcasts and we do not know how much it made out of that. We think the £3.4m is a poor investment."♡❤

<h2>Background to the Resources sale</h2>

The Resources business-to-business unit was formed in 1998 to operate television studios, post-production and outside broadcast facilities for its parent share-holding company, the BBC. It does not own any studios or premises, its assets being staff and equipment. 

BBC Resources was the first of the BBC's commercial divisions to be set up as a limited company and the last to be sold, the BBC having previously divested itself of &lt;a href="w%3ASiemens%20AG"&gt;BBC Technology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bee%20Media"&gt;BBC Broadcast&lt;/a&gt;, although BBC Enterprises — now known as &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Worldwide"&gt;BBC Worldwide&lt;/a&gt; — remained in-house.

It had been intended to float Resources back in 2005, but this was postponed for two years following strike action and &lt;a href="w%3AAdvisory%2C%20Conciliation%20and%20Arbitration%20Service"&gt;ACAS&lt;/a&gt; talks in June 2005 — the BBC giving an undertaking that there would be no preparations made to sell the company until January 2007, and no sale allowed before July 2007.

Advertised for sale on August 16, 2007 in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFinancial%20Times"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABroadcast%20magazine"&gt;Broadcast&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the disposal — led by &lt;a href="w%3AErnst%20%26amp%3B%20Young"&gt;Ernst &amp; Young&lt;/a&gt; — invited expressions of interest for the whole division or for each of its three operations separately.
On October 18, 2007, &lt;a href="w%3ADirector-General%20of%20the%20BBC"&gt;Director General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Thompson"&gt;Mark Thompson&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Television%20Centre"&gt;Television Centre&lt;/a&gt;, the home of BBC Studios and Post Production, would be sold ♡❤"by the end the financial year 2012/13"♡❤ with a BBC spokeswoman adding that ♡❤"this is a full scale disposal of BBC Television Centre and we won't be leasing it back"♡❤.

On April 1, 2008, BBC Outside Broadcasts was transferred into &lt;a href="w%3ASatellite%20Information%20Services"&gt;SIS&lt;/a&gt; ownership.

<h4>BBC Costume and Wigs</h4>

This was the second largest collection of its kind in the UK, after the leading suppliers &lt;a href="w%3AAngels%20and%20Bermans"&gt;Angels The Costumiers&lt;/a&gt;. It was not included in the privatisation, and in early October 2007 it was announced that the business was to close within six months and the entire stock sold as a complete collection.

BBC Costume and Wigs (part of BBC Studios) ceased trading on February 14, 2008 after failed attempts to sell this business unit as a going concern with a BBC spokeswoman saying that ♡❤"the arrangements [the corporation] was pursuing have not worked out and BBC Resources is currently inviting interested parties to consider making an offer to purchase."♡❤

On March 30 the costume collection — consisting of over 1 million items — was sold to Angels and the collection of wigs and hairpieces was sold separately to The Wig Store (a management buy-out put together by Philippa Devon and Alan Godleman).

To showcase achievements of &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;'s Internet industry, the Institute of Information Industry of Taiwan (III) held the 2008 IDEAS Show this Wednesday June 25. The IDEAS Show is similar from the DEMO, an Internet investment trade show in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; since 2006.

&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Shipley"&gt;Chris Shipley&lt;/a&gt;, Producer of DEMO Conference, was invited to make a speech in the opening keynote. She mentioned about evolutions and transformations of the Internet, especially on business models and change of leaders. Her words mostly echoed some theories proposed during the 2008 Google Developer Day in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3AKai-Fu%20Lee"&gt;Kai-Fu Lee&lt;/a&gt;, Founding Chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20China"&gt;Google China&lt;/a&gt;.

In this exhibition, thirty websites from mobile networking, &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%202.0"&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, social networks, application services, and hardware integrations were showcased there. The website evaluation from professional judges was also held during the showcase to encourage excellent websites promoted into the world.

A former &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Poland%29"&gt;Foreign Affairs Minister&lt;/a&gt; and the current Secretary of State at the President's Chancellery, &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Fotyga"&gt;Anna Fotyga&lt;/a&gt;, is reported to have flown to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; with a "secret mission" regarding the "last chance" negotiations about the location of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20missile%20defense"&gt;anti-missile shield&lt;/a&gt; in Poland. 

According to Polish newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGazeta%20Wyborcza"&gt;Gazeta Wyborcza&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Fotyga's trip hasn't been acknowledged by either the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Poland"&gt;Prime Minister's Office&lt;/a&gt;, or the Foreign Affairs Ministry, who are responsible for the negotiations. ♡❤Wyborcza♡❤ also claims that this misunderstanding &amp;mdash; according to an anonymous expert on &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; affairs in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; might introduce chaos in the talks. The daily writes that the Polish Foreign Affairs Ministry has made it clear to the Americans that Minister Fotyga does not hold any authority on this trip.
Polish President &lt;a href="w%3ALech%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Lech Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt; is enthusiastic about the anti-missile shield in Poland; he has supported the initiative&amp;mdash;along with the former cabinet of his twin brother &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Jarosław Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;many times in the past. However, the PM's &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADonald%20Tusk"&gt;Donald Tusk&lt;/a&gt; government is more skeptic; the current Foreign Affairs Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARados%C5%82aw%20Sikorski"&gt;Radosław Sikorski&lt;/a&gt; with the PM himself have told the press that the acceptance of locating the shield in Poland "has to pay off". 

In return for locating the shield in Poland, the Polish government wants Washington to equip &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20Armed%20Forces"&gt;Polish Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3AMIM-104%20Patriot%23PAC-3"&gt;Patriot PAC-3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATHAAD"&gt;THAAD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAMRAAM"&gt;AMRAAM&lt;/a&gt; air-defence missile systems. 

According to the spokesman of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Piotr Paczkowski, the Ministry had been informed about the Anna Fotyga's visit in the US and found it unadvisable. "The President's Chancellary did inform us about Ms Fotyga's trip. However, we cannot say they did negotiatie it with us," Paczkowski said on Thursday. Radosław Sikorski told reporters that the Polish authorities "could use a greater dose of coordination, especially at such a delicate moment in Polish-American negotiations." 

On the other hand, the President's Chancellary Minister Maciej Łopiński said that "Minister Fotyga hasn't travelled to the US to negotiate about the shield, but to meet with some American diplomats. The shield was just one of the topics." The Minister has also confirmed once more that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been informed about the trip. "The President has made the decision on Friday and the Foreign Affairs Ministry has been informed on Friday as well," he said. 

The vice-Secretary of State at the President's Chancellary, &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Draba"&gt;Robert Draba&lt;/a&gt;, has stated that "the President by no means interfere in the negotiations and he doesn't want to do so." He told the press that the information about President wanting to do harm to the negotiations are not true and that taking a double position on negotiations is out of the question. "The President has the right to be informed by the American side."

Anna Fotyga has been on her few-days-trip in the United States since Tuesday.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; claim to have killed the head of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaida%20in%20Iraq"&gt;al-Qaida in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; along with two other insurgents in a Tuesday gun battle in . The man, who an official military statement identified only by his nickname of 'Abu Khalaf', was described by US forces as the "emir" of terror in Mosul, al-Qaida's last Iraqi stronghold.

The statement identified one of the others by the nickname of 'Abu Khalud' and said he was a &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n, while the third was said to be an unnamed woman shot while attempting to detonate an explosive belt attached to a killed colleague.

The States also claim that Khalaf had been one of &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt;'s deputies. Al-Zarqawi, the former leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, was killed by a US air strike in 2006 in &lt;a href="w%3ADiyala"&gt;Diyala&lt;/a&gt;.

Khalaf is said by the US military to have arranged many attacks in Iraq. All three militants were shot during a raid on a building by US forces. The move is part of an effort to drive al-Qaida from Mosul. The programme began last month.

An asteroid the size of Pluto that slammed into the Northern hemisphere of &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; created the Borealis basin, based on the latest survey of NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Global Surveyor.

The report released by the magazine ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ explains the 1984 observation of the unusual shape of Mars terrain in the northern hemisphere against the southern hemisphere.

An asteroid with a body of 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) smashed into the planet some 3.9 billion years ago, creating the vast Borealis basin (measuring 8,500km [5,300 miles] by 10,600km [6,600 miles] across), which occupies nearly 40 per cent of the Martian surface.

The new data has convinced a lot of scientists, but the theory will need further proof before being accepted by the wider scientific community.

Thousands of supporters from both camps gathered together, cheering both candidates as the two complimented each other and acted like team mates.

Clinton described their rivalry as standing "toe-to-toe," and now they stand, "shoulder-to-shoulder." The former First Lady also appealed to her supporters who might switch to Republican candidate &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; to stay on and support Obama and the party's bid to re-gain control of the White House.

Clinton rallied the Democrats to form, "an unstoppable force for change we can all believe in."

For the part of Obama, he described Clinton and her husband, former president &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; as pillars of the party and both as a team are needed to bring back unity in the party and in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Thailand's Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASamak%20Sundaravej"&gt;Samak Sundaravej&lt;/a&gt; and his cabinet survived a bitter no-confidence vote called by fellow members of parliament. The opposition called for a no confidence vote over allegations of economic mismanagement, and Samaks's alleged disregard for Thai sovereignty. The final vote saw 280 votes against the motion, and 162 cast as no-confidence.

Sharply criticism was levelled at the Minister of Commerce due to the sharp increase in prices of rice in the country; this despite the fact Thailand is a leading exporter of rice. Prices of fuel have inflicted a crippling blow to the Thai economy, something which is also blamed on Samak's leadership.

The opposition, supported by thousands of street protesters, slammed the PM's decision to enter into an early agreement with neighbour Cambodia over an ancient temple. Protesters claimed that Samak gave up a portion of Thai land with historical significance.

Another severely criticized cabinet minister was Finance Minister Surapong Subewonglee. He denied reports that there will be a cabinet reshuffle even after their administration survived the parliamentary challenge.

Protesters who started to camp outside Government House, the official residence of the Thai Prime Minister pledged to remain and will press on for Mr. Samak's resignation.

Samak was elected last December 2007 after months of a political transition from a coup that removed Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;.

Protesters accused Mr. Samak of interfering in the investigation involving Thaksin's corruption and abuse of power.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Snow%20and%20Ice%20Data%20Center"&gt;National Snow and Ice Data Center&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href="w%3ABoulder%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Boulder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; said that there will be a 50% chance that the already thin ice on the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Pole"&gt;North Pole&lt;/a&gt; will melt away this September as a result of the on-going global warming.

The center's senior researcher Mark Serreze said that in September of 2007, ice on the north pole retreated to record levels, opening the Northwest Passage for the first time in shipping history.

Serreze added that every year, ice in the North pole has been thinning year after year. The scenario where the pole will be ice free will depend on this year's weather and climatic conditions.

The center observed that the last year's weather conditions in the north were sufficient to clear the lanes of the Northwest passage and for this year, the situation will be depending on what the weather will be.

He also assured the public that the lack of ice in that region should not concern everyone since it won't be bringing any immediate consequences. He said, "the North Pole is just another point in the globe, but it does have this symbolic meaning. There's supposed to be ice at the North Pole. The fact that we may not have any by the end of this summer could be quite a symbolic change."

The scenario of an ice-less Arctic has been seen as far back as five years ago but the rate of melting was not expected to happen in a matter of five years.

Serreze also corrected those saying that the melting of Arctic ice is just part of a "historic cycle."

He adds that as far back as 30 years ago, their earliest climate models have suggested that the very first sign of an impact from global warming would have been the melting of Arctic ice.

Their studies also reveal that the ice could return given conditions wherein the planet will cool down.

A year since taking up residence at No. 10 Downing street, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his Labour Party is already in trouble after losing a local election, finishing fifth after previously win-less political parties and popularity rating at an all time low.

Health Minister Ben Bradshaw described the party's loss to the British National Party and to the Greens as a, "terrible loss" and blamed the economic conditions such as rising food and fuel costs as factors that dampens the Labour Party's appeal with the public.

Conservative Party leader David Cameron countered Bradshaw's opinion by saying, Mr. Brown was to blame for the economic distress. Cameroon cited the Prime Minister's ten years of handling the economy as minister prior to assuming office when Tony Blair stepped down last year.

The by-elections in Henley were won by Tory John Howell with a majority of over 10,000 votes, defeating by a large margin the Liberal Democrats who were presumed to have a close edge of beating both Conservatives and Labour. Labour threw in their support with Richard McKenzie who only garnered 3% of the votes behind the BNP and Greens. 

Henley called for an election when its representative Boris Johnson was elected Lord Mayor of the City of London.
