<h3>&lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate%20passes%20financial%20overhaul%20bill"&gt;United States Senate passes financial overhaul bill&lt;/a&gt; (0:36)</h3>

On Thursday, the United States Senate approved the financial overhaul package in a 60-39 vote. The bill is now awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. This bill is the second major domestic policy victory for Obama, after his revamp of the health care system.

Obama is expected to sign the legislation into law next week, and the focus now switches to how the new regulations will be implemented in the coming weeks and months. The legislation will give financial regulators significant discretion in shaping the rules.

The legislation also puts faith in regulators to spot developing problems in the financial system, and gives them the authority to act to attempt to prevent another financial crisis. The bill calls for banks to hold more money in their reserves to prepare for bad economic situations, but the details of how this will be done are also up to regulators.

<h3>&lt;a href="Australian%20Prime%20Minister%20denies%20striking%20a%20deal%20with%20predecessor"&gt;Australian Prime Minister denies striking a deal with predecessor&lt;/a&gt; (1:29)</h3>

In the wake of a special caucus vote that removed former Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd and instated Julia Gillard as the new Prime Minister, claims have arisen regarding a deal made between the two in the Prime Minister's official residency that allegedly occurred the night before the special caucus vote and Gillard's apparent breaking of the agreement.

During the question portion of Gillard's recent address to The National Press Club, veteran journalist Laurie Oakes asked if a deal had been made between Rudd and Gillard during the negotiations in the PM suite prior to the announcement of the leadership spill.

Claims were further made that Rudd then contacted his supporters to inform them of what he thought was a deal, while Gillard did the same. However, in that time Gillard learned that she had gained the numbers in the caucus to challenge Rudd, and proceeded to tell him that she would indeed be challenging his position.

Gillard refused to answer to the claims stating out of respect she would not speak publicly about the events of that night.

"It's not my intention to canvass any of the matters that were discussed in that room." she went on to say, "I intend to respect that confidence for the rest of my life."

If the claims were to be true, the only other notable time where an event such as this occurred was in 1989 where former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke promised to stand down for former Prime Minister, Paul Keating for the 1990 election. This never happened and a similar caucus vote took place.

A spokesperson for Kevin Rudd, said he had no comment to make regarding the claims.

<h3>&lt;a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20legalized%20in%20Argentina"&gt;Same-sex marriage legalized in Argentina&lt;/a&gt; (2:58)</h3>

Earlier today, Argentina's senate approved legislation that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, making it the first country in Latin America and the tenth country in the world to do so.

The law, which also allows same-sex couples to adopt, was voted on at 0400 local time after 14 hours of debate and passed with 33 votes in favor to 27 opposed with three abstentions. Since the lower house of Argentina's government has already passed the bill and President Cristina Fernandez is in favor of the bill, it is expected to enter into law in only a few days, once it is published in Argentina's official bulletin.

The legislation, backed by President Fernandez's government, was the subject of a campaign by the Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups, which held rallies against it, including a march on Argentina's Congress, and encouraged citizens to protest the bill. Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, as part of his opposition to the bill, said that "children need to have the right to be raised and educated by a father and a mother."

Members of Senate were divided in their views of the bill. One senator, Juan Perez Alsina, said that "[m]arriage between a man and a woman has existed for centuries, and is essential for the perpetuation of the species." Speaking in favor of the bill, another senator, Daniel Filmus, said that "[s]ociety has grown up. We aren't the same as we were before."

Elsewhere in Latin America, same-sex civil unions have been legalized in Uruguay and in parts of Mexico and Brazil. Mexico City legalized same-sex marriage in 2009.

<h3>&lt;a href="Facebook%20and%20UK%20government%20clash%20over%20tributes%20to%20killer"&gt;Facebook and UK government clash over tributes to killer&lt;/a&gt; (5:21)</h3>

Social networking site Facebook was yesterday refusing to remove pages set up in tribute to British killer Raoul Moat, despite pressure from the highest levels of the UK government. A Downing Street official had earlier said that a complaint would likely be lodged with Facebook, following questions to Prime Minister David Cameron in Parliament.

Raoul Moat killed one person and seriously wounded two others in Northumbria following his release from prison, prompting a major week-long manhunt. A standoff with police ended early on Saturday morning with Moat shooting himself. An investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission is ongoing.

Thirteen people have now been arrested, with several under suspicion of assisting Moat in evading the police. Flowers have been left on the riverbank where Moat shot himself, and outside his home in Newcastle. A tribute page on Facebook titled "RIP Raoul Moat You Legend" has attracted over 30,000 members.

During the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session, Conservative MP Chris Heaton-Harris asked David Cameron to contact Facebook about removing the page, which he described as containing "a whole host of anti-police statements".

The Prime Minister described Moat as a "callous murderer", and condemned the expressions of sympathy for him.

"I cannot understand any wave, however small, of public sympathy for this man," stated Cameron. "There should be sympathy for his victims and the havoc he wreaked in that community. There should be no sympathy for him."

A spokesman for the Prime Minister later said that Facebook would be contacted over the matter. In response Facebook issued a statement saying that the page did not breach its terms of service and would not be removed.

"Facebook is a place where people can express their views and discuss things in an open way as they can and do in many other places, and as such we sometimes find people discussing topics others may find distasteful, however that is not a reason in itself to stop a debate from happening."

<h3>&lt;a href="Animal%20rights%20protestor%20found%20guilty%20of%20Oxford%20arson%20plot"&gt;Animal rights protestor found guilty of Oxford arson plot&lt;/a&gt; (7:14)</h3>

An animal rights protester who left home-made petrol bombs at buildings of the University of Oxford has been jailed for ten years. Mel Broughton, a prominent member of the campaign group SPEAK, had denied the charges of conspiracy to commit arson and possession of an article with intent to destroy property, but the jury at Oxford Crown Court found him guilty by unanimous verdict after deliberating for over five hours.

Broughton made his devices using water bottles and sparklers. He put one on the roof of a cricket pavilion belonging to The Queen's College in November 2006, and two under a portable cabin at Templeton College in February 2007. The device at the cricket pavilion, which contained twelve liters of petrol, went off and caused about £14,000 of damage. The Templeton College petrol bombs, together containing nine liters of petrol, did not ignite, and DNA on one of them linked Broughton to the attacks. He was protesting about the university's decision to back the construction of an animal research laboratory, and a police search of his home found more sparklers, as well as documents about the university and its staff.

This was the second time that Broughton had been convicted of the offences: his conviction in February 2009 was overturned by the Court of Appeal and a re-trial was ordered. This began on June 16, and ended on Tuesday with Broughton's conviction. Judge Patrick Eccles QC imposed a ten-year prison sentence, which will be reduced by two and a half years for the time that Broughton has already served in custody. When sentencing Broughton after the first trial, Judge Eccles said that these events "were part of a ruthless conspiracy to instill fear in all those connected to the laboratory."

An officer from Thames Valley Police, Detective Superintendent Mark Jones, said that Broughton "was someone who believes direct action, in the form of planting explosives and setting fires, is acceptable", adding that the conviction was the "right result". A university spokesperson said that it "accepted the rights of protesters to voice their objections within the law", but would work "to protect staff and students from criminal activity of any kind."

<h3>&lt;a href="India%20approves%20symbol%20for%20currency"&gt;India approves symbol for currency&lt;/a&gt; (9:21)</h3>

A symbol for the Indian Rupee was approved by the Government of India today. The Indian currency had previously lacked a distinctive symbol like those associated with the US dollar, euro, pound sterling and the yen.

Minister for Information and Broadcasting of India, Ambika Soni announced the symbol chosen for the currency. "The symbol for the rupee would lend a distinctive character and identity to the currency and further highlight the strength and robustness of the Indian economy as a favored destination for global investments," Soni stated.

A competition was held to select the symbol, which drew more than 3,000 entries. After evaluation by the head of the Reserve Bank of India, five entries were shortlisted. The winning design came from a post-graduate student, D Udaya Kumar, who won $5,000.

The government announced that the symbol will not be printed on currency notes or coins, but would be added to the Unicode Standard and other scripts used in the world. Soni said the symbol would be adopted in India by the next two quarters and globally within a year and a half to two years. She mentioned that it would soon feature in worldwide keyboards for easy use.

<h3>&lt;a href="Dog%27s%20throat%20cut%20in%20Cairns%2C%20Australia"&gt;Dog's throat cut in Cairns, Australia&lt;/a&gt; (11:05)</h3>

In what the RSPCA calls a "horrific" case of animal cruelty, a dog's jaw was taped shut, and its throat cut, in Cairns, Australia.

The Staffordshire mix, who was found by police in a critical condition last Thursday, was reportedly struggling to breath and bleeding heavily due to her throat being slashed and her muzzle being bound.

"The way they cut was almost down to the larynx, so muscles were cut but luckily they missed the jugular veins," said Sarah Gill, the vet who stitched the 10 cm long, 3 cm deep cut.

In a statement reported on Tuesday, Inspector Cameron Buswell, a law enforcement officer with the RSPCA animal welfare charity, said it is hard to comprehend that there are people in the community capable of this level of cruelty.

"This would have to be up there as one of the more horrific cases we've dealt with [...]The poor dog must have been petrified. How she didn't die is miraculous." he said.

Named 'Franky' by rescuers, the dog is progressing well along her road to recovery, has a warm, loving and kind nature, and has begun to come out of her shell, Buswell said.

This has become apart of string of violent attacks on pets in Queensland. Another dog in North Queensland named 'Boof' was beaten and left to die with a 30kg chain around his neck in January. In May, a family dog in Toowoomba had its throat slit and a rubber band placed around the wound, twice.

The RSPCA is appealing for information from the public regarding the person or persons responsible for the latest attack.

<h3>&lt;a href="Scholastic%20sued%20for%20Harry%20Potter%20copyright%20infringement"&gt;Scholastic sued for Harry Potter copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt; (12:40)</h3>

A trustee of the estate of the late author Adrian Jacobs filed a lawsuit against the US publisher of the Harry Potter series, Scholastic Inc, on Tuesday. He claimed that J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, had copied scenes from Jacob's novel, The Adventures of Willy the Wizard, to the fourth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The suit followed a similar case last year, in which the trustee sued the UK publisher of the series, Bloomsbury Publishing plc. Both of these cases are currently pending.

The complaint stated that both books, the protagonists "are required to deduce the exact nature of the central task in the competition", and had done so in a bathroom. Both books also involved "rescuing hostages imprisoned by a community of half-human, half-animal creatures." The suit also claimed that Christopher Little, a literary agent of Rowling, was originally the literary agent of Jacobs. The claim was denied by Scholastic.

Scholastic called the claim "completely without merit". They pointed out that Rowling had said in February that she had never read Jacobs' book. The trustee said that the US was the world's largest foreign market, so they brought their first overseas action there. He demanded that all copies of the Harry Potter novel be destroyed, and all the profit made by the book given to him.

No word if either of the court cases will require the use of the magic, mind reading spell Legilimens.

In the year 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte had begun his ill-fated campaign in Egypt and Syria to protect French trade interests and undermine Britain's access to India. Accompanying the expeditionary army was a corps of 167 technical experts known as the Commission of the Sciences and Art and was comprised of mathematicians, astronomers, artists, architects and other scientists.

A year into the campaign as French soldiers under the command of Colonel d'Hautpoul were strengthening the defenses of Fort Julien, a couple of miles north-east of the Egyptian port city of Rashid (also known as Rosetta), Lieutenant Pierre-François Bouchard spotted a slab with inscriptions on one side. Immediately recognizing that this slab was unique, the find was announced to Napoleon's newly-founded scientific association in Cairo, the Institut d'Égypte. In a report by Commission member Michel Ange Lancret, he noted that it contained three inscriptions, including Greek and ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, and rightly suggested that the three inscriptions could be versions of the same text.
The slab Bouchard found was made of black granite measuring 45 inches high, 28.5 inches wide and 11 inches thick, weighed 1,700 lbs and was classified as a Ptolemaic-era stele, objects which are tall, slender stone monuments, often with writing carved into its surface. It was thus named the Rosetta stone after the town it was discovered in and it quickly became one of the most famous archeological and important linguistic finds in modern history.

The Rosetta stone as we now it exists in a damaged state, as it is actually a fragment of a larger stele and all three texts are incomplete. The Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone. The demotic text (a form of evolved Egyptian writing) has survived best: it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on the right side. The hieroglyphic inscription has suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; all of them are broken on the right side, and twelve of them on the left.

The text recorded on the stone is an inscription recording a decree, known as the Memphis decree, that was issued roughly around March 27, 196 BCE by a congress of Egyptian priests in honor of 13-year-old King Ptolemy V and establishing the worship of the new ruler as a god. The Decree records that Ptolemy V gave a gift of silver and grain to the temples, adding that in the eighth year of his reign during a particularly high Nile flood, he had the excess waters dammed for the benefit of the farmers. In return, the priesthood pledged to celebrate the king's birthday and coronation days annually, and that all of the priests of the land are to serve him along with the other gods.

A portion of the stone reads "and his priesthood shall be entered upon all formal documents and private individuals shall also be allowed to keep the feast and set up the aforementioned shrine, and have it in their houses, performing the customary honors at the feasts, both monthly and yearly, in order that it may be known to all that the men of Egypt magnify and honor the God Epiphanes Eucharistos the king, according to the law."

Using the Rosetta stone to decipher Egyptian glyphs was, in hindsight, a relatively straight forward affair.

At the time of the stone's discovery, Egyptian hieroglyphs were undeciphered and there had been no understanding of the ancient Egyptian language since shortly before the fall of the Roman Empire. By the 4th century A.D., few Egyptians were capable of reading hieroglyphs, and the myth of allegorical hieroglyphs was ascendant. Monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased after the closing of all non-Christian temples in 391 AD by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I and the last known inscription is from Philae, known as The Graffito of Esmet-Akhom, from 396 AD.

Efforts to translate the glyphs date back as far as the fifth century when Horapollo wrote the Hieroglyphica, a spurious explanation of almost 200 glyphs. Considered authoritative yet largely false, the work was a lasting impediment to the decipherment of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to be able to at least partly decipher what was written in the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, by relating them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time.

The study of hieroglyphs continued centuries later, when various modern scholars attempted to decipher the glyphs, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Silvestre de Sacy, Johan David Åkerblad and Thomas Young in the early 19th century, each of them making important steps toward the solution but failing to find it.

It wasn't until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone on July 15, 1799 that the critical missing information would eventually allow the French scholar Jean-François Champollion to discover the nature of the script.

While ancient Greek was widely known to scholars, the details of its use in the Hellenistic period as a government language in Ptolemaic Egypt were not so familiar: large scale discoveries of Greek papyri were still a long way in the future. Thus the earliest translations of the Greek text of the Stone show the translators still struggling with the historical context and with administrative and religious jargon.

It was Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon who produced in 1803 the first published translations of the Greek text, in both Latin and French to ensure that they would circulate widely. This work was then further refined by Christian Gottlob Heyne and at Cambridge, Richard Porson worked on the missing lower right corner of the Greek text. 

At the moment of the Stone's discovery in Egypt, the Swedish diplomat and scholar Johan David Åkerblad was working on a little-known script of which some examples had recently been found in Egypt, the script known today as Demotic. He called it "cursive Coptic" because, although it had few similarities with the later Coptic script, he was convinced that it was used to record some form of the Coptic language (the direct descendant of ancient Egyptian).

When the French Orientalist Silvestre de Sacy received a lithograph of the Rosetta stone he realized that the middle text was in this same Demotic script so together with Åkerblad, they set to work on the middle text of the stone, assuming that the script was alphabetic. They attempted, by comparison with the Greek, to identify within this unknown text the points where Greek names ought to occur. Then in 1802, Silvestre de Sacy reported that he had successfully identified five names ("Alexandros", "Alexandreia", "Ptolemaios", "Arsinoe" and Ptolemy's title "Epiphanes"). However, de Sacy and Åkerblad could not identify the remaining characters in the demotic text, which, as is now known, included ideographic and other symbols alongside the phonetic ones.

Though de Sacy eventually gave up work on the Stone, he was able to make one other contribution. In 1811, prompted by discussions with a Chinese student about Chinese script, de Sacy recalled a suggestion made by Georg Zoëga in 1797 that in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions foreign names might be written phonetically; he also recalled that as long ago as 1761 Jean-Jacques Barthélemy had suggested that the characters enclosed in cartouches in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names. Thus, when Thomas Young, foreign secretary of the Royal Society of London, wrote to him about the Stone in 1814, de Sacy suggested in reply that in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text Young might look for cartouches that ought to contain Greek names, and try to identify phonetic characters in them.

Young did so, with two results that together paved the way for the final decipherment. He discovered in the hieroglyphic text the phonetic characters "p t o l m e s" that were used to write the Greek name "Ptolemaios". He also noticed that these characters resembled the equivalent ones in the Demotic script, and went on to note as many as 80 similarities between the hieroglyphic and demotic texts on the Stone, an important discovery because the two scripts were previously thought to be entirely different from one another. This led him to deduce correctly that the demotic script was only partly phonetic, also consisting of ideographic characters imitated from hieroglyphs.

Finally, in 1814, Young first exchanged correspondence about the Stone with Jean-François Champollion, a teacher at Grenoble who had produced a scholarly work on ancient Egypt. Champollion, in 1822, saw copies of the brief hieroglyphic and Greek inscriptions of the Philae obelisk, on which William John Bankes had tentatively noted the names "Ptolemaios" and "Kleopatra" in both languages. 

From this, Champollion identified the phonetic characters "k l e o p a t r a". On the basis of this and the foreign names on the Rosetta Stone, he quickly constructed an alphabet of phonetic hieroglyphic characters, which appears, printed from his hand-drawn chart, in his famous letter to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Paris Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres at the end of 1822 and immediately published by the Académie. 

This "Letter" marks the real breakthrough to reading Egyptian hieroglyphs, not only for the alphabet chart and the main text, but also for the postscript in which Champollion notes that similar phonetic characters seemed to occur not only in Greek names but also in native Egyptian names. During 1823, he confirmed this, identifying the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose.

The stone itself currently resides in the British Museum, and in July of 2003, Egypt first requested the return of the Rosetta Stone. Zahi Hawass, the chief of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, asked that this piece be repatriated to Egypt, as one of several key items belonging to Egypt's cultural heritage. 

In December 2009, Hawass said that he would drop his claim for the return of the Rosetta Stone if the British Museum loaned the stone to Egypt for three months, for the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza in 2013. 

It is unlikely that the British Museum will hand over the Rosetta Stone permanently to Egypt. In response to repeated Greek requests for repatriation of the Elgin Marbles and similar requests to other museums around the world, in 2002 over 30 of the world's leading museums—including the British Museum, the Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum in New York City—issued a joint statement declaring that "objects acquired in earlier times must be viewed in the light of different sensitivities and values reflective of that earlier era" and that "museums serve not just the citizens of one nation but the people of every nation".

<h1>Researchers discover last common ancestor of apes and monkeys</h1>
Researchers have unearthed a new fossil &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aprimate"&gt;primate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that they think may be closely related to the common ancestor of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AApe"&gt;apes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOld%20World%20Monkey"&gt;Old World monkeys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , collectively known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACatarrhini"&gt;catarrhine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; primates. Paleontologist Iyad Zalmout of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Michigan"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; discovered the new species, ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaadanius"&gt;Saadanius hijazensis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMecca"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; the discovery gives new insights into &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20evolution"&gt;human evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The specimen, a partial skull, dates to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOligocene"&gt;Oligocene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , approximately 29 to 28&amp;nbsp;million years ago, and exhibits puncture wounds from a large predator that may have killed it. ♡❤Saadanius♡❤ is thought to have been a tree-dweller and lived at a time when the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArabian%20peninsula"&gt;Arabian peninsula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had not yet split away from the African continent, forming the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Sea"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The discovery may help resolve the dating of the split between Old World monkeys and apes. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaleoanthropology"&gt;Paleoanthropologists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have traditionally dated the divergence to between 25 and 23&amp;nbsp;million years ago, based on early fossils of the two groups. Genetic studies, however, date it to between 30 to 35&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

Although ♡❤Saadanius♡❤ shares some features with living catarrhine primates, such as a bony ear tube, called an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aectotympanic"&gt;ectotympanic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , it also possesses other features more common in the fossils of primitive or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABasal%20%28phylogenetics%29"&gt;basal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; catarrhines, from which Old World monkeys and apes did not evolve. These basal features include a longer face and the lack of a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afrontal%20sinus"&gt;frontal sinus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 3.6 earthquake occurred on Friday near &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, capital of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Initial reports state that the quake shook windows on buildings in the area, including the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but did not cause any major damage.

According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the tremor occurred 05:04 a.m. local time, at a depth of 5 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akilometre"&gt;kilometers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (3.1 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amile"&gt;miles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). The epicenter was located 2 kilometers at the southeast of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGermantown%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Germantown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;; 4 kilometers at the northwest of &lt;a href="Gaithersburg%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Gaithersburg&lt;/a&gt;, Maryland; 5 kilometers at the southwest of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMontgomery%20Village%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Montgomery Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Maryland; 34 kilometers at the northwest of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArlington%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Arlington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;; and 35 kilometers at the northwest of &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;

The earthquake is the largest to strike within 50 kilometers (31 miles) of the capital in the 35 years that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeismometer"&gt;seismographic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recordings have been taken. The previous strongest tremor in the area was a 2.6 magnitude tremor in 1990. "Most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains has infrequent earthquakes [...] The earthquakes that do occur strike anywhere at irregular intervals," USGS said.

In May 2010, Akio Toyoda and Elon Musk, leaders of Toyota and Tesla, respectively, announced they would work together on electric vehicles. The agreement formalizes this announcement and would allow Tesla to work with Toyota at an automobile production plant in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

The plant will open 2011, when Tesla reopens it after it bought the Fremont, California plant. The plant was previously used by Toyota and General Motors, but was shut down when Toyota said it would not produce cars in California.

Tesla currently produces only a single model, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 109,000 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATesla%20Roadster"&gt;Roadster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , although it is currently designing a second model, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATesla%20Model%20S"&gt;Model S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which will be produced at the Fremont factory.

Analysts supported the move; John Boesel, CEO of a green-transportation trade group, said that "Toyota's willingness to partner with Tesla to provide an electric version of one of the Japanese automaker's existing vehicles suggests the partnership between the two companies is going to be a meaningful one."

Following this announcement, Tesla's shares rose $0.75, while Toyota's fell $1.65.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Manchin"&gt;Joe Manchin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , governor of &lt;a href="West%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, named attorney &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarte%20Goodwin"&gt;Carte Goodwin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to replace the late &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Byrd"&gt;Robert C. Byrd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who died at age 92 on June 28, in the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; until a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABy-election"&gt;special election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is held. Goodwin will be sworn in next Tuesday.

The special election has not been scheduled; however, it could occur as early as November 2. Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Rockefeller"&gt;Jay Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , member of the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; in West Virginia, says that the appointment of the Senate's 59th Democrat is crucial to passing an unemployment benefits bill that has been blocked by members of the &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;.

"My responsibility [is] to work very hard every day to maintain the trust of the people of West Virginia," Goodwin said. "My sole objective will be to make West Virginia proud. I'm excited about the challenge. I'm looking forward to it," he added.

Goodwin, who is 36, will become the youngest member of the Senate. He served as an adviser to Governor Manchin from 2005 to 2009. Before this assignment was announced, Goodwin worked as an associate in his family's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharleston%2C%20West%20Virginia"&gt;Charleston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -based law firm.

Al-Awlaki was denoted as a "key leader" of &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. According to US Treasury Undersecretary Stuart Levey, al-Awlaki "...has sought to encourage his supporters to provide money for terrorist causes."

Al-Awlaki was jailed in 2006 in a Yemen prison for kidnapping for ransom. He was released in 2007 and afterwards went into hiding. 

This move by the Treasury placed al-Awlaki onto a list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. This freezes his assets, prevents American citizens from sending him money, and disallows him from traveling to the United States.

<h1>Apple to give free cases, refunds to iPhone 4 owners</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Apple%20to%20give%20free%20cases%2C%20refunds%20to%20iPhone%204%20owners&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="Apple%20Inc."&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; announced Friday that it will give owners of its new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiPhone%204"&gt;iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a free case in response to mounting concerns over the device's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aantenna"&gt;antenna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; placement. The iPhone 4 antenna is actually a metal strip that wraps around the side of the device, which has caused &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adropped%20call"&gt;dropped calls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when held in a certain way.

The announcement came in a rare press conference held by Apple on Friday morning. During the event, company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Steve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; attempted to address reports by both consumers and the media of signal reception issues relating to the positioning of the phone's antenna. Rather than recall the devices or offer a hardware fix, Jobs said yesterday that Apple will offer a free case to anyone who has purchased an iPhone 4.

The rubber cases, or "bumpers", wrap around the side of an iPhone and have been found to alleviate the reception issues. Apple's bumpers were priced at &lt;a href="US%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;29 before the press conference, but will be free to anyone with an iPhone 4 until September 30. Jobs also said that those who had already purchased a bumper will receive a full refund for the accessory. For consumers still dissatisfied with iPhone 4, Jobs said that the phones can be returned for a refund as well.

Jobs acknowledged that "a very small percentage of users" were experiencing antenna issues, but dismissed the existence of an "Antennagate," saying that similar problems plague all &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acellular%20phone"&gt;cellular phones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and that the iPhone issue "has been blown so out of proportion that it is incredible." He showed videos demonstrating a drop in signal strength when held in a certain way for other &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asmartphones"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to help make his point.

According to company statistics, about one out of every 200 iPhone 4 customers have called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAppleCare"&gt;AppleCare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to complain about the antenna. The iPhone 4 return rate is about one-third of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiPhone%203GS"&gt;iPhone 3GS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; return rate. However, Jobs admitted that the percentage of calls dropped on the iPhone 4 was slightly greater than the percentage of calls dropped on the 3GS. Jobs attributed the small increase to fewer iPhone 4 users putting cases on their devices.

In response to critics saying that Apple had not addressed the reception problem quickly enough, Jobs said that iPhone 4 had only been out for 22 days and that the company could not have resolved the issue any faster. The press event came just days after ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Reports"&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ declined to give Apple's newest phone a "recommended" rating due to the antenna's placement. The group said that Apple's move to give away free cases is a good first step, but not permanent enough to earn a higher rating.

Earlier, on June 24, Apple told customers to either hold the phone without covering the antenna, or to use a case. The so-called "death grip", however, has not been as big an issue for other phones as it has for iPhone 4, said Mike Gikas of ♡❤Consumer Reports♡❤. On July 2, Apple associated the issue with a long-undiscovered software bug relating to the formula for calculating signal strength. An &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiOS%20%28Apple%29"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; update released Thursday came with an updated, more accurate method of calculating the number of cellular signal bars to display, but did not actually prevent the signal loss that comes with covering the antenna.

<h3>&lt;a href="Magnitude%203.6%20earthquake%20shakes%20Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Magnitude 3.6 earthquake shakes Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; (0:40)</h3>

A magnitude 3.6 earthquake occurred on Friday near Washington, D.C., capital of the United States. Initial reports state that the quake shook windows on buildings in the area, including the White House, but did not cause any major damage.

According to the United States Geological Survey, the tremor occurred 05:04 a.m. local time, at a depth of 5 kilometers with the epicenter was located 35 kilometers northwest of the capital.

The earthquake is the largest to strike within 50 kilometers of the capital in the 35 years that seismographic recordings have been taken. The previous strongest tremor in the area was a 2.6 magnitude tremor in 1990. According to the USGS, "Most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains has infrequent earthquakes [...] The earthquakes that do occur strike anywhere at irregular intervals".

Even though nobody has yet been able to find a way to blame him for Friday's earthquake, 

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20freezes%20assets%20of%20suspected%20terrorist"&gt;US freezes assets of suspected terrorist&lt;/a&gt; (1:33)</h3>

The United States Department of the Treasury has frozen the assets of terror suspect, Anwar al-Awlaki. He is wanted in Yemen for his alleged participation in the Christmas Day bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight.

Al-Awlaki was denoted as a "key leader" of al-Qaeda. According to US Treasury Undersecretary Stuart Levey, al-Awlaki "...has sought to encourage his supporters to provide money for terrorist causes."

Al-Awlaki was jailed in 2006 in a Yemen prison for kidnapping for ransom. He was released in 2007 and afterwords he went into hiding.

This move by the Treasury placed al-Awlaki onto a list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. This freezes his assets, prevents American citizens from sending him money, and disallows him from traveling to the United States.

Finances in the US, however, should finally to begin to start moving again as 

<h3>&lt;a href="West%20Virginia%20governor%20names%20Carte%20Goodwin%20as%20new%20Senator"&gt;West Virginia governor names Carte Goodwin as new Senator&lt;/a&gt; (2:28)</h3>

Joe Manchin, governor of West Virginia, named attorney Carte Goodwin to replace the late Robert C. Byrd, who died at the age 92 on June 28, in the U.S. Senate until a special election is held. Goodwin will be sworn in next Tuesday.

The special election has not been scheduled; however, it could occur as early as November 2. Senator Jay Rockefeller, member of the Democratic Party in West Virginia, says that the appointment of the Senate's 59th Democrat is crucial to passing an unemployment benefits bill that has been blocked by members of the Republican Party.

"My responsibility [is] to work very hard every day to maintain the trust of the people of West Virginia," Goodwin said. "My sole objective will be to make West Virginia proud. I'm excited about the challenge. I'm looking forward to it," he added.

Goodwin, who is 36, will become the youngest member of the Senate. He served as an adviser to Governor Manchin from 2005-2009. Before this assignment was announced, Goodwin worked as an associate in his family's Charleston-based law firm.

<h3>&lt;a href="First%20international%20flight%20lands%20at%20Delhi%20airport%27s%20new%20Terminal%203"&gt;First international flight lands at Delhi airport's new Terminal 3&lt;/a&gt; (4:21)</h3>

An Air India Boeing 777 from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport was the first international flight to land at Delhi's new Terminal 3 at Indira Gandhi International Airport.

However, this was only one of nine “terminal process proving flights” that landed or departs from the brand-new steel and glass T3 on either Wednesday or Thursday. Seven of the proving flights departed or arrived on Wednesday and two on Thursday. The new terminal was inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on July 3. Terminal 3 is designed to handle large international aircraft like the Airbus A380, which landed as one of the terminal process proving flights on Thursday.

Though Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), which operates the airport, had planned earlier to commission the new terminal for international operations on Wednesday, the commissioning was pushed to July 28 due to unfinished construction.

However, the proving flights proceeded as planned, and DIAL, with 450 employees from 13 airlines, conducted a full trial of all operations on Tuesday.

In addition to the Air India arrival from New York, United States, the first departure in the new Terminal was a Jet Airways international flight to Kathmandu, Nepal. The first domestic flight that departed from T3 was an Air India flight from Jaipur, Rajasthan.

On Tuesday, before the Air India 777 was slated to arrive, an official from that airline said that “All the 220 passengers and 18 crew members of the New York flight (AI-102) would clear their emigrations at the new terminal. It is going to be a real test for all the agencies at T3."

The terminal process proving flights aimed to make sure that everything, including airlines, air traffic control, ground handling agencies, duty free shops, flight caterers, aviation oil companies, customs, and immigration, are all in working order.

As India puts the finishing touches on it's new civillian airport, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Canada%20announces%20%249%20billion%20plan%20to%20purchase%2065%20F-35%20fighters"&gt;Canada announces $9 billion plan to purchase 65 F-35 fighters&lt;/a&gt; (6:19)</h3>

Canadian Defense Minister Peter MacKay announced on Friday morning a C$9 billion dollar plan to buy 65 F-35 "Joint Strike" fighter jets. It would be the largest military purchase in the history of Canada. "I'm convinced the F-35 is good for Canada, good for Canadians, good for the Forces and good for Canadian industry," said MacKay during a press conference.

F-35 aircraft would replace the current fleet of CF-18s, however, the Liberal Party officially opposed the deal, saying that it required further review and that they would place the deal on hold if elected.

Canada is one of several nations that assisted in the development of the F-35 and has invested over US$150 million into the program for over a decade. The new fighters would replace current aircraft from 2017 onward.

While Canada prepares to evolve its fleet of military craft, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Researchers%20discover%20last%20common%20ancestor%20of%20apes%20and%20monkeys"&gt;Researchers discover last common ancestor of apes and monkeys&lt;/a&gt; (7:19)</h3>

Researchers have unearthed a new fossil primate that they think may be closely related to the common ancestor of apes and Old World monkeys, collectively known as catarrhine primates (primates (including humans) that have nostrils that are close together and directed frontward or downward). The new species, Saadanius hijazensis was discovered near Mecca in Saudi Arabia, and gives new insights into human evolution.

The specimen, a partial skull, dates to the Oligocene, a geologic epoch approximately 29 to 28 million years ago and exhibits puncture wounds from a large predator that may have killed it. Saadanius is thought to have been a tree-dweller and lived at a time when the Arabian peninsula had not yet split away from the African continent, forming the Red Sea. The discovery may help resolve the dating of the split between Old World monkeys and apes. Paleoanthropologists have traditionally dated the divergence to between 25 and 23 million years ago, based on early fossils of the two groups. Genetic studies, however, date it to between 30 and 23 million years ago.

Although Saadanius shares some features with living catarrhine primates, such as a bony ear tube, called an ectotympanic, it also possesses other features more common in the fossils of primitive or basal catarrhines, from which Old World monkeys and apes did not evolve. These basal features include a longer face and the lack of a frontal sinus.

Finally, speaking of old bones, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Robbie%20Williams%20rejoins%20British%20musical%20group%20Take%20That"&gt;Robbie Williams rejoins British musical group Take That&lt;/a&gt; (8:56)</h3>

singer Robbie Williams has rejoined and recorded a new album with British musical group Take That, having departed from the group in 1995. The four other members of Take That are Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Jason Orange and Mark Owen.

Robbie Williams decided to leave Take That in 1995 to begin a solo music career; the group subsequently disbanded in 1996. In 2005, Take That was reformed as a four-piece band.

The last album the group released before the disbanding was entitled "Nobody Else", which was released in 1995. A single entitled "Shame", sung by Robbie Williams and Gary Barlow, is expected to be released on October 4, 2010. The new album from Take That, which has now been recorded, is anticipated to be available from November 2010. All five members of Take That have composed songs for the album, which has currently not yet been given a title and will be issued by Polydor Records.

</ul>
In 1948, the Miss Macao, a Catalina seaplane, owned by Cathay Pacific Airways and operated by a subsidiary, became the victim of the first ever hijacking of a commercial aircraft. The hijacking was carried out by four men including Huang Yu, a rice farmer, Chiu Cheong, and Mexican born Chiu Tok, who led the group as he knew how to operate an airplane after training in the Philippines.

The men had decided that piracy might afford them a better lifestyle since the Pearl River Delta was very much a lawless zone rampant with piracy and kidnappings for ransom, and so the men pooled their resources to put together the operation.

This particular flight was chosen because it was known to carry wealthy passengers between Hong Kong and Portuguese Macao. Dressed in western style business suits, the men boarded the plane and immediately after takeoff, Chiu Tok, who had been seated behind the pilot, demanded that he surrender the controls. Though three of the hijackers were armed, the pilot, Dale Warren Cramer, refused to surrender as the co-pilot, the Australian Ken McDuff, attacked one of the intruders with a flag-post rod.

<ul>

</ul>
In the confusion, Cramer was shot dead, and collapsed onto the flight controls sending the plane into an uncontrolled dive where it crashed into the Pearl River Delta. Twenty-five of the twenty-six people aboard died in the crash, one of whom was the millionaire bullion dealer Wong Chung-ping who had actually been carrying a substantial quantity of gold in his luggage.

The sole survivor actually turned out to be one of the hijackers, Huang Yu, who was found unconscious in the water by a couple of fishermen who witnessed the crash from their boat and took him to the hospital. Initially, Huang Yu remained silent about what had happened, but when another body was found in the water, this one with a bullet wound in it, piracy became the prime theory. However, because of Huang Yu's silence, police hid audio recording equipment in his hopsital room to record conversations he had with family members. Baed on these tapes, the police were able to piece together the true narrative and Huang Yu's involvement in the events.

Upon his arrest, he was brought to court by the Macau police, but a strange twist occurred. The Macau court suggested that the prosecution should actually be brought in Hong Kong since the plane was registered in Hong Kong and most of the passengers were from there. However, the British colonial government in Hong Kong stated that the incident happened over Chinese territory in which the British have no jurisdiction. Since no state claimed authority to try him, Huang was released without trial from a Macau prison three years afterwords on June 11, 1951, and was then deported to China - never to be heard from again.

Singer and song writer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALady%20Gaga"&gt;Lady Gaga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has warned her fans attending concerts about "hateful" protests that are set to take place during a concert she will be having tonight in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="Westboro%20Baptist%20Church"&gt;Westboro Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt; will be protesting outside the venue during her concert. Gaga warned of these protests on her &lt;a href="Twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; page.

"At the risk of drawing attention to a hateful organization, I would like to make my little monster fan [♡❤sic♡❤] aware of a protest being held outside the Monsterball in St.Louis tonight. Although we have had protesters before, as well as fundamentalists at the show this group of protesters are hate criminals and preach using lude [♡❤sic♡❤] and violent language and imagery that I wish I [could] protect you all from."

The Church, based in &lt;a href="Topeka%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Topeka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; and not affiliated with any Baptist organization, had planned to protest at Gaga's prior concerts held in St. Louis. The most recent protest was scheduled in January and was later canceled prior to the concert. According to Shirley Phelps-Roper, a spokesperson for the church, "[God] hates homosexuals and God hates fags [and] God hates whore Gaga," which is why the group plans a protest at tonight's concert.

"So when she gets up there and tries to hook God with that thing He calls an abomination; if you love what God hates, then God hates you," said Phelps-Roper in January. According to the church's website, the protest begins at 7:10 p.m. and lasts until 8:00 p.m.. "Now what type of wicked hypocrites would we be if we did not warn this little false prophetess and all of her over-indulged sycophants that they are each one, individually heading straight to hell in a gender-confused, self-loathing, tone-deaf hand basket and that a gift from the God they hate? So, we made a couple of songs just for this event," said their website.

Gaga tells her fans to not listen to the group. "My request to all little monsters and public authority is to pay these hate criminals no mind. Do not interact with them, or try to fight. Do not respond to any of their provocation. Don't waste your words, or feelings, no matter what you hear or see. You are more fortunate and blessed than they are, and in your heart just pray for them. Be inspired to ignore their ignorant message, and feel gratitude in your heart that you are not burdened or addicted to hate, as they are."

The Church plans two other protests at her concerts in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma%20City%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; on July 20 and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City%2C%20Missouri"&gt;Kansas City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Missouri on August 3.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATraralgon%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Traralgon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; went within a game and percentage of ladder leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaffra%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Maffra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a 118 point victory over &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarragul%20Football%20Club"&gt;Warragul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in their round 14 Gippsland Football League match. However, 24 hours later, Maffra defeated Sale by 44 points. 

The &lt;a href="Gippsland%20Football%20League"&gt;Gippsland Football League&lt;/a&gt;, officially the Gippsland League, is the only major &lt;a href="Australian%20rules%20football"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; competition in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGippsland"&gt;Gippsland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region, according to the &lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Country%20Football%20League"&gt;Country Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Warragul kicked both of its goals in the first half, still conceivably in the contest at that point thanks to Traralgon's inaccurate seven goals and ten behinds. The hosts kicked five goals in the third quarter to extend their lead to ten goals.

At the end of the day, Traralgon won 20-13 (136) to Warragul's 2-6 (18).

<h1>Oil spewing from crack in seafloor of Gulf of Mexico was fifty feet from Deepwater Horizon well</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Oil%20spewing%20from%20crack%20in%20seafloor%20of%20Gulf%20of%20Mexico%20was%20fifty%20feet%20from%20Deepwater%20Horizon%20well&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After an investigation, ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that oil spewing from a rupture in the seafloor of the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; on June 13 was 50 to 60 feet from the &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon"&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/a&gt; leak.

A nearly four and a half minute video posted on &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; on June 13 was from the Viking Poseidon ROV (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aremotely%20operated%20underwater%20vehicle"&gt;Remote Operated Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) 1. It shows oil and methane leaking from the seafloor at around 2:48 a.m. on June 13. The ROV monitors the leak for a minute and even gets covered in a plume of oil and sand before it moved on to the next spot. Smaller eruptions were seen as the ROV traveled, making the leak locations vary from 50 to 60 feet from the damaged well.

Until now, there was no way to determine the location of the ROVs in relation to the previously leaking Deepwater Horizon well. Alexander Higgins, an independent computer programmer, developed the 'Gulf Oil Spill ROV &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Transverse%20Mercator%20coordinate%20system"&gt;UTM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Distance Calculator.' Using the coordinates for the location of the Deepwater Horizon, and the location of the Viking Poseidon on June 13, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ was able to determine that the first rupture and leak was approximately 50.45 feet from the leaking well or "21.56 feet [n]orth and 45.61 feet [w]est" of the Deepwater leak point.

Higgins told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ how he created the calculator, and says it is "very accurate," but that the tool would "not give you accurate measurements over a large distance, e.g. from the well head to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

"This tool was created using java script that uses basic Pythagorean theorem (formula_1) to calculate the distance between two points. The distance is simply formula_2. ROV coordinates match the location within a few feet when looking at the well because obviously the ROV can not be over the exact center because that is where the BOP is," said Higgins.

&lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt;, who owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon, has denied that any oil or methane gas is leaking from the sea floor. On July 16, Kent Wells, the senior vice president of BP, said on their official &lt;a href="Twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; page that "4 ROVs using sonar scanning [are] looking for anomalies in seabed floor. No indications any oil or gas escaping." Seismic tests were conducted on July 16; Admiral Thad Allen of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that "no anomalies" were found, but also that the tests were "not comprehensive."

On Sunday, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ contacted BP, who authenticated the video, and asked if any ROVs were sent back to the crack and leak location on June 13 for further investigation. According to their office in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, they "sent ROVs to investigate and monitor that and no further signs of oil or gas were found." They also stated that they "have continued to monitor" and "have also carried out seismic surveys. Nothing found to give concern." ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ also asked if they could confirm the location of the leak and crack, but no response was given.

However, on July 18, the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reported that there was "seepage" coming from the area at the bottom of the Deepwater well head. For the past two days, ROV cameras showed bubbles coming from the base of well. BP said it would test the bubbles to determine what they are and as of Sunday, COO of BP Doug Suttles says the bubbles are not methane, but further tests are being conducted. "If you can imagine, it is not an easy operation to collect those bubbles so that they can be tested to see what their make-up is."

Since the June 13 video surfaced, other videos have been posted to YouTube allegedly showing some of the ROVs being tossed around by large amounts of oil seeping through the seafloor. One video showed an alleged eruption spraying oil and debris around the BOA DEEP C 2 ROV before it was tossed from side to side. It then immediately retreated to the surface. Some of the cracks on ocean floors, where oil has leaked from, have occurred naturally. One such oil spill in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 was the result of a naturally occurring crack in the floor of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Some of those cracks can cause oil to leak through at a rate as high as 5,000 gallons a day, with most of the oil not even reaching the water's surface. In the Gulf of Mexico, oil leaks through natural cracks at a rate several times less than leaked from the Deepwater well.

"The Deepwater Horizon site releases 3 to 12 times the oil per day compared to that released by natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico. By May 30, the Deepwater Horizon site had released between 468,000 and 741,000 barrels of oil, compared to 60,000 to 150,000 barrels from natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico over the same 39 day period," said Cutler Cleveland, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20University"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; professor at the university's Department of Geography and Environment.

The &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill"&gt;Deepwater Horizon oil spill&lt;/a&gt; started on April 20 after an explosion on the rig. Efforts to put out the fire failed and the rig subsequently sank to the bottom of the Gulf. On April 22, an oil slick appeared on the surface of the Gulf. BP capped the leaking well on July 13 which effectively stopped oil from leaking into the Gulf. The company has been running a pressure integrity test on the 150,000 pound cap for 48 hours. Earlier on July 17, they announced the test would continue for another day. BP hopes for the well's pressure to rise to or above 7,500 PSI. As of Saturday morning the well's pressure was just above 6,700 PSI. BP fears anything lower than the expected PSI could mean a leak in the cap or elsewhere, such as oil or methane seeping up from the seafloor.

"We are feeling more comfortable we have integrity. We will keep monitoring and make the decisions as we go forward. The longer the test goes the more confidence we have in it," said Allen.

Today on Wikinews : Leaks at the well cap and on the sea floor have been detected in the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon oil spill; violence continues in Iraq, Mexico and in Iran; India experiences yet another deadly train derailment and, in history, the Iroquois Confederacy attempt to strike a deal with The Crown.

Today is Monday, July 19, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Oil%20spewing%20from%20crack%20in%20seafloor%20of%20Gulf%20of%20Mexico%20was%20fifty%20feet%20from%20Deepwater%20Horizon%20well"&gt;Oil spewing from crack in seafloor of Gulf of Mexico was fifty feet from Deepwater Horizon well&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="ROV%20detects%20leaks%20in%20Deepwater%20Horizon%20well%20cap"&gt;ROV detects leaks in Deepwater Horizon well cap&lt;/a&gt; (0:38)</h3>

After an investigation, Wikinews has learned that oil spewing from a rupture in the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico on June 13 was 50 to 60 feet from the Deepwater Horizon leak.

A nearly four and a half minute video posted on YouTube from the Viking Poseidon ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) 1 shows oil and methane leaking from the seafloor at around 2:48 a.m. on June 13. In the video, the ROV monitors the leak for a minute and even gets covered in a plume of oil and sand before it moved on to the next spot. Smaller eruptions were seen as the ROV traveled, making the leak locations vary from 50 to 60 feet from the damaged well.

Until now, there was no way to determine the location of the ROVs in relation to the previously leaking Deepwater Horizon well. However Alexander Higgins, an independent computer programmer, developed the 'Gulf Oil Spill ROV UTM Distance Calculator.' Using the coordinates for the location of the Deepwater Horizon, and the location of the Viking Poseidon on June 13, Wikinews was able to determine that the first rupture and leak was approximately 50.45 feet from the leaking well or "21.56 feet North and 45.61 feet West" of the Deepwater leak point.

Higgins told Wikinews how he created the calculator, and says it is "very accurate," but that the tool would "not give you accurate measurements over a large distance, EG from the well head to New Orleans."

"This tool was created using java script that uses basic Pythagorean theorem (A2 + B2 = C2) to calculate the distance between two points. ROV coordinates match the location within a few feet when looking at the well because obviously the ROV can not be over the exact center because that is where the BOP is," said Higgins.

On Sunday, Wikinews contacted BP, who authenticated the video, and asked if any ROVs were sent back to the crack and leak location on June 13 for further investigation. According to their office in London, England, they "sent ROVs to investigate and monitor that and no further signs of oil or gas were found." They also stated that they "have continued to monitor" and "have also carried out seismic surveys." Wikinews also asked if they could confirm the location of the leak and crack, but no response was given.

Yesterday an unnamed United States official told the Associated Press that there was "seepage" coming from the area at the bottom of the Deepwater well head. The official said the seepage and methane gas were discovered near the Deepwater well head, but did not specify an exact location. Admiral Thad Allen, a former US Coast Guard admiral who is overseeing the spill efforts for the US government said yesterday in a letter to BP that ROVs "detected seep a distance from the well and undetermined anomalies at the well head."

As many as four leaks have been detected in the Deepwater Horizon well cap. The HOS SUPER H ROV 1 made the discovery while performing an "integrity survey" of the well and well cap. It recorded what appears to be a thin metal pipe lining the outside of the oil cap. Four small leaks of what appear to oil bubbles were detected during this survey. The first appears just after the elbow connecting the pipe to the two green pipes. The second can be seen through the hole of the large metal ring. The third is seen just to the right of the metal ring.

So far there is no word what those substances are, but BP says bubbles detected on July 18 are not of a hydrocarbon nature.

It is not yet known what the pipe carries or what they connect to. It is also not yet clear if all leaks are from the pipe, or leaking from the well. BP confirmed the leaks and told Wikinews in a phone call to their Houston, Texas press office, there is a "small leak" releasing hydrates consisting of gases and oil. They are "studying the issue" and are prepared to fix the pipe if it becomes an issue. Live camera feeds show hydrocarbons building up as the oil and gas leak from the pipe.

Since the June 13 video surfaced, other videos have been posted to YouTube allegedly showing some of the ROVs being tossed around by large amounts of oil leaking through the seafloor. One video showed an alleged eruption spraying oil and debris around the BOA DEEP C 2 ROV before it was tossed from side to side. It then immediately retreated to the surface.

Some of the cracks on ocean floors, where oil has leaked from, have occurred naturally. One such oil spill in California in 2005 was the result of a naturally occurring crack in the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Some of those cracks can cause oil to leak through at a rate as high as 5,000 gallons a day, with most of the oil not even reaching the water's surface. In the Gulf of Mexico, oil could leak through natural cracks at a rate of up to 150,000 gallons when comparing it to the amount of oil that leaked from the Deepwater well.

According to Cutler Cleveland, a Boston University professor at the university's Department of Geography and Environment, "The Deepwater Horizon site releases 3 to 12 times the oil per day compared to that released by natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico. By May 30, the Deepwater Horizon site had released between 468,000 and 741,000 barrels of oil, compared to 60,000 to 150,000 barrels from natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico over the same 39 day period".

BP capped the leaking well on July 13 which effectively stopped oil from leaking into the Gulf. The company has been running a pressure integrity test on the 150,000 pound cap for 48 hours. Earlier on July 17, they announced the test would continue for another day. BP hopes for the well's pressure to rise to or above 7,500 PSI. As of Saturday morning the well's pressure was just above 6,700 PSI. BP fears anything lower than the expected PSI could mean a leak in the cap or elsewhere, such as oil or methane seeping up from the seafloor.

Thad Allen was quoted as saying "We are feeling more comfortable we have integrity. We will keep monitoring and make the decisions as we go forward. The longer the test goes the more confidence we have in it".

<h3>&lt;a href="43%20dead%20in%20Iraqi%20bomb%20blast"&gt;43 dead in Iraqi bomb blast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="27%20reported%20dead%20in%20Iranian%20suicide%20bombings"&gt;27 reported dead in Iranian suicide bombings&lt;/a&gt; (8:10)</h3>

A suicide bomber killed 43 people in Iraq on Sunday, injuring an estimated 40 more.

The attack occurred southwest of Baghdad and targeted members of a government-backed militia, Sons of Iraq, also known as the Sahwa, who were waiting to collect their pay. Early reports say the attacks killed at least three soldiers and injured an additional thirteen, while three accountants died and four more were wounded. It's not yet clear who the remaining casualties are.

A survivor of the bombing said that "[t]here were more than 85 people lined up in three lines at the main gate of the military base to receive salaries when a person approached us. When one of the soldiers tried to stop him, he blew himself up."

An Iraqi military official said that "[t]he suicide bomber blew himself up in the biggest group of Sahwa members. We generally let them enter the base in groups of 10 for them to get their salaries."

A second suicide bombing took place in Western Iraq, when an attacker fired upon Sahwa militants in Al-Qa'im before blowing himself up, killing three people, with six more injured.

Credit for the attacks has not yet been claimed, but al-Qaeda is considered the probable culprit.

The Sahwa movement is a Sunni militia group that split from al-Qaeda in 2006, and with US support have been one of the groups fighting al-Qaeda. In recent months, members of the militia have said that they have come under attack from other militant groups, and support from the Iraqi government has been reduced.

The attack comes just a day after two suicide bombers detonated bombs at a mosque in southeastern Iran, killing 27 and leaving several hundred more injured.

The explosions occurred moments apart at a Shia mosque, killing both civilians and government officials from Iran's Revolutionary Guards. 27 people are confirmed dead, while reports of injuries totaled 270, and officials said the death toll is likely to rise.

The attacks were reportedly carried out by a Sunni rebel group, Jundallah, who said it was in retaliation for the execution of the group's leader, Abdolmalek Rigi, by the Iranian government in June.

The Revolutionary Guard's top official, Yadollah Javani, blamed the United States, Israel, and Europeean countries for the attacks, citing testimony offered by Rigi before he was executed that claimed Jundallah had received aid from Western powers.

Across the globe, the gang violence in Mexico continued as 

<h3>&lt;a href="Gunmen%20kill%20seventeen%20at%20party%20in%20Mexico"&gt;Gunmen kill seventeen at party in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Car%20bomb%20in%20Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez%2C%20Mexico%20kills%20several%2C%20many%20injured"&gt;Car bomb in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico kills several, many injured&lt;/a&gt; (10:33)</h3>

gunmen on Sunday stormed a party in Torreon, a city in the north of Mexico. According to local authorities, at least eighteen people were injured, and seventeen died. The victims have not yet been identified, but several were young and some were women.

According to a statement from the Coahuila state Attorney General's office, the gunmen arrived in several cars and opened fire without saying a word. This happened after a similar shooting last month, in which eight people were killed at a bar, in the same city. In all of northern Mexico there are increasing reports of mass shootings at parties, bars and rehab clinics.

Investigators do not yet have any suspects and do not know the motive, but believe that the shooting may be linked to Mexico's long-running drugs war. Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene, the majority of which were from .223 caliber guns.

The shooting follows the explosion of a car bomb last Thursday in a violent area of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico killing two police officers, a paramedic, and one civilian, although Mayor Jose Reyes said that only three died. At least six others were injured, although reports have said the total injured may be as high as sixteen. Four remain in the hospital, including three paramedics and one civilian.

Mexican authorities say it was a car bomb, but counter-terrorism experts are still unsure as to what caused the vehicle to explode. Intelligence expert Fred Burton said, "For this to be an improvised grenade attack, in some capacity, it doesn't surprise me."

The Juarez cartel, one of the two drug-traffickers in the area, claimed responsibility for the bombing in a graffiti message. "We have more car bombs," the graffiti said.

Ciudad Juárez has a history for trafficking drugs to the United States, especially into Texas.

Before the explosion, the police arrested a suspected leader of the Juarez cartel, Jesus Armando Acosta Guerrero.

This year more than 7,000 people have died as a result of drug-related violence in Mexico since this year began. Attorney General Arturo Chavez on Friday said nearly 25,000 people have died in the last three and a half year period.

Tragedy also struck in India today when 

<h3>&lt;a href="Many%20dead%20in%20Indian%20train%20crash"&gt;Many dead in Indian train crash&lt;/a&gt; (12:47)</h3>

a train crash at around 0200 local time Monday killed at least 40 people and injured at least another 100. The crash occurred in the town of Sainthia, which is located in eastern India. Initial reports say that one passenger train collided with another that was waiting at a station, but the exact cause is not known.

The lowest estimate of the death toll is around 40 dead, and Indian media has reported that there are as many as 100 dead. The incident has prompted a major rescue operation, and senior government officials are en route to the site of the incident.

The region's Superintendent of Police, Humayun Kabir, said that "[c]asualties have taken place. I cannot give any number now. Rescue work has begun." A local railroad official said that "[t]he people who have lost their lives were travelling in unreserved coaches. We do not have their names and any vital information about them to inform their relatives." 

The state-run Indian railway system has a poor safety record, with several hundred incidents a year taking place, and this crash is the third major one in the past decade.

A traffic accident in the UK has claimed the life of a woman 

<h3>&lt;a href="One%20dead%20after%20bus%20and%20bicycle%20crash%20in%20Hampshire%2C%20England"&gt;One dead after bus and bicycle crash in Hampshire, England&lt;/a&gt; (13:55)</h3>

after being involved in a collision between a bus and a bicycle in Hampshire in the south of England, United Kingdom. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, was cycling in the seaside resort of Southsea when a number 700 Stagecoach single-decker bus, which was traveling from Brighton to Southsea, collided with her bicycle at approximately 1:15pm local time on Saturday. A helicopter transported the woman to Southampton General Hospital, where she died at approximately 4:30pm the same day.

None of the occupants of the bus were injured. The 53-year-old bus driver has now been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Hampshire Constabulary is requesting any witnesses to the accident to contact them. PC Phil Hunt also mentioned: "We are also trying to trace the passengers, who left the scene before we could speak to them."

The road traffic accident occurred in an area where Portsmouth City Council had been intending to place a new cycle route, but the plans to do so were canceled last week. The plans, which would have cost £250,000, were said to have been canceled due to financial difficulties.

<h3>&lt;a href="Australian%20federal%20election%20announced%20for%20August%2021"&gt;Australian federal election announced for August 21&lt;/a&gt; (16:14)</h3>

Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has announced that the nation's voters will go to the polls on August 21.

"Today I seek a mandate from the Australian people to move Australia forward," Ms Gillard said. She took the office of prime minister on June 24 after the Australian Labor Party caucus elected to remove Kevin Rudd from the role.

Directly after the June 24 caucus meeting, Senator Michael Forshaw told media , "the new leader elected unopposed is Julia Gillard and the deputy will be Wayne Swan." The "leadership spill", as this scenario is known, occurred at 9:00am Australian Eastern Standard Time that morning (11:00 pm UTC the previous day). According to reports, there was no ballot after Rudd pulled out.

Gillard became Australia's first female prime minister in the country's 109 year history and has been sworn in as such by Australia's first female Governor-General, Quentin Bryce.

Australia's three major parties, the ALP, the coalition of the Liberal and National parties and the Greens, came together to encourage young people to enroll to vote.

"At the launch of our campaign this morning we had representatives from the Opposition, the shadow minister for youth as well as the Greens spokesperson for youth showing that this is not about who people vote for, it's about the fact that they've got the chance to vote," said Ms Gillard. The electoral roles close at 8pm Monday night.

Her opposition, Tony Abbott has openly stated that his shadow cabinet is ready to govern. “This is a bad government and it deserves to lose" he continued.

To win the election, the Coalition (Liberal-National parties) will need to gain 17 extra seats, with a recent opinion poll (Newspoll) tipping Labor in a two party preferred category, 53-47.

The campaign will last five weeks, one of the longest in Australia's history.

Traralgon went within a game and percentage of ladder leader Maffra with a 118 point victory over Warragul in their round 14 Gippsland Football League match. 

Warragul kicked both of its goals in the first half, still conceivably in the contest at that point thanks to Traralgon's inaccurate seven goals and ten behinds. However Traralgon kicked five goals in the third quarter to extend their lead to ten goals. At the end of the day, Traralgon won 20-13 (136) to Warragul's 2-6 (18).

24 hours later, Maffra defeated Sale by 44 points to remain the ladder leader.

The Deed from the Five Nations to the King, of their Beaver Hunting Ground, more commonly known as the Nanfan Treaty, was conducted in Albany, New York, on July 19, 1701.

The treaty was an agreement made between the representatives of the Iroquois Confederacy with John Nanfan, the acting colonial governor of New York, on behalf of the The Crown. The Iroquois, who claimed to have conquered this territory 80 years earlier, deeded the English a large tract of land north of the Ohio River when the Iroquois were allied with the English during King William's War, the first of the French and Indian Wars. 

As a vast majority of the Beaver Hunting Grounds described in the Nanfan Treaty were located in New France, the area colonized by France in North America, the French did not recognize this as a valid treaty. However, at the time, the Iroquois were also negotiating peace with the French and together they signed the Great Peace of Montreal later that same year. That treaty ended 100 years of war between the Iroquois, whom had been allied to the English, and the French, allied to the Hurons and the Algonquians. It provided 16 years of peaceful relations and trade before war started again.

The Iroquois, also known as the Haudenosaunee, the "People of the Longhouse" or more accurately, "They Are Building a Long House" and are actually an association of several tribes of indigenous people of North America. After the Iroquoian-speaking peoples coalesced as distinct tribes, based mostly in present-day upstate New York, around the 16th century they came together in an association known today as the Iroquois League, or the "League of Peace and Power". The original Iroquois League was often known as the Five Nations, as it was comprised of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca nations. After the Tuscarora nation joined the League in 1722, the Iroquois became known as the Six Nations.

The Iroquois League has also been known as the Iroquois Confederacy, a decentralized political and diplomatic entity that emerged in response to European colonization. The League still exists, but the Confederacy dissolved after the defeat of the British and allied Iroquois nations in the American Revolutionary War.

The Iroquois were a mix of farmers, fishers, gatherers, and hunters, though their main diet came from farming. The main crops they farmed were corn, beans and squash, which were called the three sisters and were considered special gifts from the Creator. These crops are grown strategically. The cornstalks grow, the bean plants climb the stalks, and the squash grow beneath, inhibiting weeds and keeping the soil moist under the shade of their broad leaves. In this combination, the soil remained fertile for several decades. The food was stored during the winter, and it lasts for two to three years. When the soil eventually lost its fertility, the Iroquois migrated.

Since they had no writing system, the Iroquois depended upon the spoken word to pass down their history, traditions, and rituals. As an aid to memory, the Iroquois used shells and shell beads. The Europeans called the beads wampum, from wampumpeag, a word used by Indians in the area who spoke Algonquian languages.

The type of wampum most commonly used in historic times was bead wampum, cut from various seashells, ground and polished, and then bored through the center with a small hand drill. The purple and white beads, made from the shell of the quahog clam, were arranged on belts in designs representing events of significance.

Certain elders were designated to memorize the various events and treaty articles represented on the belts. These men could "read" the belts and reproduce their contents with great accuracy. The belts were stored at Onondaga, the capital of the confederacy, in the care of a designated wampum keeper.

Women assumed a position in Iroquois society roughly equal in power to that of the men. Individual women could hold property including dwellings, horses and farmed land, and their property before marriage stayed in their possession without being mixed with that of their husband's. The work of a woman's hands was hers to do with as she saw fit. The chief of a clan could be removed at any time by a council of the mothers of that clan, and the chief's sister was responsible for nominating his successor.

The Iroquois aimed to create an empire by incorporating conquered peoples and remolding them into Iroquois and thus naturalizing them as full citizens of the tribe. By 1668, two-thirds of the Oneida village were assimilated Algonquians and Hurons and at Onondaga there were Native Americans of seven different nations.

In the last few decades, some historians have stressed "The Iroquois Influence Thesis" in relation to the development of the Articles of Confederation or United States Constitution. Consensus has not been reached on how influential the Iroquois model was to the development of the United States' documents, however, historians Donald Grinde and Bruce Johansen believed that the democratic ideals of the Great Law of Peace, the oral constitution whereby the Iroquois Confederacy was bound together, provided a significant inspiration to Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and other framers of the United States Constitution. The standing of the Influence Thesis was demonstrated by the United States Congress' passing a resolution in October 1988 that specifically recognized the influence of the Iroquois League upon the US Constitution and Bill of Rights.

While anthropologist Dean Snow believes "There is, however, little or no evidence that the framers of the Constitution sitting in Philadelphia drew much inspiration from the League", Benjamin Franklin wrote in volume 4 of his published papers that "It would be a very strange thing, if six Nations of ignorant savages should be capable of forming a Scheme for such a Union … and yet that a like union should be impracticable for ten or a Dozen English Colonies".

Interestingly, the Iroquois government has issued passports since around at least 1923, when Haudenosaunee authorities issued a passport to Cayuga statesman Deskaheh to travel to the League of Nations headquarters. Before 2001 these passports were accepted by various nations for international travel, but with increased security concerns across the world since the 9/11 and other terrorist attacks, this is no longer the case.

The Iroquois Nationals lacrosse team was allowed by the U.S. to travel on their own passports to an international lacrosse tournament in England after the personal intervention of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on July 14, 2010. But, the British government refused to recognize the Iroquois passports and denied the team members entry into the United Kingdom.

Singapore police arrested British author and journalist Alan Shadrake one day after the launch of his book about the country's use of the death penalty.

Shadrake, 75, was arrested on Sunday morning at a hotel in Singapore and taken into custody by police on charges of criminal defamation, in response to a complaint lodged by the city-state's Media Development Authority (MDA) over the contents of his new book, Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock. Separately, the Attorney-General served Shadrake with an application for an order of committal for contempt of court, accusing him of "cast[ing] doubt on the impartiality, integrity, and independence" of Singapore's courts through his book.

Shadrake's latest book discusses alleged "double standards" in the country's application of the death penalty, and contains interviews with local human rights activists, lawyers, and former police officers, including retired Changi Prison executioner Darshan Singh; Singh later claimed that he had been "tricked" into the interview. In earlier media comments, Shadrake stated that he expected "trouble" but no concrete action from authorities over his book, lest they draw even more attention to its claims. Retailers took his book off shelves after inquiries by the MDA; a spokesman for the MDA stated that the book was not banned, but suggested that booksellers "seek legal advice to ensure that the books they sell do not contravene Singapore laws".

Shadrake has written for a variety of newspapers, including The Daily Telegraph of London as well as the New Straits Times of neighboring Malaysia. His previous book, The Yellow Pimpernels, told the tale of various attempts to escape from East Germany over the Berlin Wall. If convicted, he faces a two-year imprisonment and a fine.

Meanwhile, anger over censorship spilled out into the streets in Turkey where 

<h3>&lt;a href="Turkish%20protesters%20march%20against%20Internet%20censorship"&gt;Turkish protesters march against Internet censorship&lt;/a&gt; (2:53)</h3>

about 2,000 protesters marched against Internet censorship last Saturday in Istanbul.

Protesters gathered at central Istanbul’s Taksim Square and marched down to Istiklal Avenue, chanting slogans against Transport and Communications Minister Binali Yildirim, Internet censorship, and especially against "Law No 5651".

Many Internet groups, nongovernmental organizations, and Internet platforms participated in the protest. 

More than 5,000 Internet sites including Last.fm, YouTube and some of Google services are currently banned in Turkey. The bans are issued by prosecutors if the site "is deemed liable to incite suicide, paedophilia, drug abuse, obscenity or prostitution, or violate a law forbidding any attacks on Atatürk."

Reporters Without Borders reported that The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) recently wrote to the Turkish authorities to urge them once again to restore access to banned Internet sites

On July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 space flight landed the first humans on our Moon, fulfilling U.S. President John F. Kennedy's goal of reaching the moon before the Soviets by the end of the 1960s.

Launched from Florida on July 16, Apollo 11 was crewed by Commander Neil Alden Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin Eugene "Buzz" Aldrin, Jr. Their landing craft, Eagle, spent 21 hours and 31 minutes on the lunar surface while Collins orbited above in the command ship, Columbia. The lunar module was named Eagle for the national bird of the United States, the bald eagle, which is featured prominently on the mission insignia. 

<ul>

</ul>
The command module was named Columbia for the feminine personification of the United States used traditionally in song and poetry. During early mission planning, the names Snowcone and Haystack were used but changed before announcement to the press.

Three days after liftoff, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility. This landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers along with the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and was unlikely to present major landing or extra-vehicular activity (EVA) challenges.

</ul>
On July 20, 1969 the lunar module Eagle separated from the command module Columbia. Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.

As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface 4 seconds early and reported that they were "long": meaning they would land miles west of their target point.

Five minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800 m) above the surface of the moon, the LM navigation and guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected "1202" and "1201" program alarms.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Audio clip &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3AAP11_FINAL_APPROACH.ogv"&gt;1201 alarm&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
The program alarms indicated "executive overflows", where the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. This was neither a computer error nor an astronaut error, but stemmed from a mistake in how the astronauts had been trained. Although unneeded for the landing, the rendezvous radar was intentionally turned on to make ready for a fast abort. Ground simulation setups had not foreseen that a fast stream of spurious interrupts from this radar could happen. Since the computer had to deal with data from two radars, not the landing radar alone, this led to the overload.

Inside Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, computer engineer Jack Garman told guidance officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent and this was relayed to the crew.

As the descent continued, Armstrong saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300 meter diameter crater (later determined to be "West crater", named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing site). At this point Armstrong took semi-automatic control as Aldrin called out altitude and velocity data.

</ul>
Eagle landed at 6:17pm EDT with only about 25 seconds of fuel left. This was less fuel than on later missions because the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to have been due to greater propellant 'slosh' than expected which was uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.

</ul>
Then at 10:39pm EDT, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 10:51 began his descent to the Moon's surface.

<ul>

</ul>
Aldrin then joined Armstrong on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead and that the fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle's shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight.

The astronauts then deployed scientific equipment, which included a passive seismograph and a laser ranging retroreflector. While Armstrong loped about 120 m from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater, Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes - the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 min.

During this period Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.

After the astronauts planted a U.S. flag on the lunar surface, they spoke with President Richard Nixon through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called "the most historic phone call ever made from the White House."

<ul>
BULLET::::- Audio clip &lt;a href="http%3A//www.archive.org/details/GMM-10460"&gt;Astronauts and Nixon&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but fellow astronaut Frank Borman who flew on the famous Apollo 8 mission, was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11 and convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, out of respect of the lunar landing being Kennedy's legacy.

For the 40th anniversary of the moon landing, a group of British scientists reflected on the significance of the moon landing:

"It was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken ... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today...The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date...nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts - Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them"

</ul>
Famed CBS news anchor, Walter Cronkite, famously said years later that he had had as much time to prepare for the moon landing as NASA, but when the mission finally landed safely, he was left speechless. Considered by many to be, at the time, the most trusted voice in America, it was Cronkite's emotional reaction to the landing which many people still remember to this day, possibly due to it adding such a human, emotional element to a technological event taking place so far away. 

At the time of the landing in the 1960's, America was at war in Vietnam, undergoing major cultural upheaval with the civil rights movement and had suffered through the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert and Martin Luther King Jr., yet for a brief moment on a summers morning, a quarter of a million miles away from any other human being (except for Collins orbiting above in the Columbia), 2 men looked back at the Earth and saw, what Carl Sagan would described years later as being the place where,

"On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena."

Despite promises he would testify in his own corruption trial, lawyers for former &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="Rod%20Blagojevich"&gt;Rod Blagojevich&lt;/a&gt; rested their case yesterday morning. His defense did not call a single witness, and apparently feels the prosecution has not proven their case. Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday.

Speculation that Blagojevich would not testify began on Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge James Zagel adjourned 90 minutes early after a private meeting with the lawyers involved. Robert Blagojevich, the former governor's brother and co-defendant in the case, had already testified on his own behalf. Blagojevich's defense team apparently considered resting their case on Tuesday, but Zagel gave them an extra day to consider their decision more carefully. 

When Zagel directly asked the former governor about his decision, he replied that he understood what he was doing. "It is my decision, under the advice of my attorneys. I make the decision fully and voluntarily," he said.

Blagojevich is charged with trying to sell the &lt;a href="U.S.%20Senate"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; seat that had been vacated by &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; when he won the &lt;a href="2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, among other crimes. Robert Blagojevich testified that his brother was trying to manipulate the political situation to his advantage, but emphasized that he engaged in nothing illegal. According to some sources, Blagojevich was interested in leading the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Zuckerberg stated that there is a "good chance" of Facebook reaching a total of a billion members in the next three to five years.

<h3>&lt;a href="China%20launches%20major%20cleanup%20operation%20after%20oil%20spill"&gt;China launches major cleanup operation after oil spill&lt;/a&gt; (0:38)</h3>

After an oil pipeline in China exploded and spilled around 1,500 tonnes of oil into the Yellow Sea near the city of Dalian, the government has launched a cleanup operation consisting of more than 800 vessels.

The spill occurred on Friday, after a pipeline at the port exploded. The oil terminal at the port has been closed ever since. Authorities have been using 24 ships designed for cleaning up oil, and today ordered around 800 civilian fishing boats to join the operation.

The spill has been halted, although an oil slick which measured 50 square kilometers at its height remains in the harbor, and ships are using absorbent foam to remove oil from the water, as well as barriers to keep oil from reaching the shore. Despite their efforts, parts of the coast reportedly have a slick of oil evident on beaches and rocks.

Although rough seas have affected the cleanup, authorities expect to have completed the operations within ten days.

According to domestic media, concerns over safety at the port have been raised in the past; a government study in 2006 noted that five projects at the port were at risk of accidents.

The spill has caused ongoing disruptions to the port's operations, with several ships, including six oil tankers carrying a total of around twelve million barrels of oil, having been diverted to other ports both in China and other countries.

On a "brighter" note, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Astronomers%20discover%20largest%20star%20on%20record"&gt;Astronomers discover largest star on record&lt;/a&gt; (2:02)</h3>

European astronomers have discovered the largest star yet on record; it is approximately 300 times the mass of our sun, beyond the previously accepted limit of 150 solar masses.

Paul Crowther, professor of astrophysics at the University of Sheffield, led the team of researchers that discovered the star. The team used the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, and data archived from the Hubble Space Telescope. The newly discovered star, designated R136a1, was discovered in the R136 star cluster in the Tarantula nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy about 165,000 light-years away.

The researchers estimate that the current mass of the star is about 265 solar masses, and could have been about 320 solar masses just after its birth.

"Unlike humans," says Cowther, "these stars are born heavy and lose weight as they age. Being a little over a million years old, the most extreme star R136a1 is already middle-aged, and has undergone an intense weight loss programme, shedding a fifth of its initial mass over that time, or more than 50 solar masses."

Astronomers not involved in the discovery, while still impressed, warn of the possibility that the team could have mistaken two relatively close stars for one large one.

"What they're characterizing as a single massive star," Mark Krumholz, an astronomer at the University of California, told the Associated Press, "could in fact be a binary system too close to be resolved."

Another astronomer, Phillip Massey from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, also warns that this may be the case. Massey explained that the star's weight had been inferred using scientific models that were subject to change.

The researchers believe that the stellar heavyweight record could be held by this star for quite some time. Cowther elaborates: "Owing to the rarity of these monsters, I think it is unlikely that this new record will be broken any time soon."

To put into perspective the size and luminosity of this star, if it were to replace our sun it would be as bright as our sun compared to the moon and according to team member Raphael Hirschi from Keele University, "Its high mass would reduce the length of the Earth's year to three weeks, and it would bathe the Earth in incredibly intense ultraviolet radiation, rendering life on our planet impossible,"

<h3>&lt;a href="Coalition%20ups%20ante%20on%20Australian%20school%20tax%20rebates"&gt;Coalition ups ante on Australian school tax rebates&lt;/a&gt; (5:30)</h3>

Australian opposition leader Tony Abbott has pledged private school relief if the Liberal/National coalition wins the upcoming federal election. The pledge came in response to the Australian Labor Party leader, and current Prime Minister, Julia Gillard proposing a uniform and school equipment tax break expansion.

Abbott's proposal includes an offer of tax rebates for sending a child to a private school. For students in primary school, prep to grade 6, the rebate will rise to $500 Australian a year per student and families will be then able to claim 50% rebate up to AU$1000.

“We are expanding the rebate so it can be claimed for school fees and also for other educational costs such as tuition and special educational costs for children with, for instance, dyslexia,” Abbott said at a press conference in Brisbane.

Before the election was called, Gillard had aimed to pledge $220 million over four years to expand the current tax breaks to cover refunds each worth $390 for primary school uniforms and $779 for high school uniforms, as well as refunds for other school equipment like texts books and computers.

"We all know that uniforms can be an expensive part of sending kids to school, but this change, along with the existing refund for textbooks and computers, will help families with that cost," stated Gillard.

An opposition spokesperson claimed that the “obvious flaw in Labor's policy is that it only applies to stationery, computer expenses and uniforms [...] You know as a parent that you need help for a whole range of expenses. Extra teachers for children with dyslexia or the costs of doing music and all the other expenses like excursions and so forth.”

The expansion is expected to cost $760 million in total and one that Abbott claims needs to happen as “cost of living pressures tend to be greatest when your kids are at school”.

As contentious as the Australian elections are turning out to be, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Australian%20election%20debate%20moved%20to%20avoid%20clash%20with%20cookery%20show"&gt;Australian election debate moved to avoid clash with cookery show&lt;/a&gt; (7:32)</h3>

A televised debate between Australia's candidates for Prime Minister in the upcoming election has been rescheduled and shortened — to avoid a clash with popular cookery show MasterChef.

The pre-election debate traditionally lasts 90 minutes and occurs at 1930 on the first Sunday of the campaign.

With the grand finale of the cooking competition already scheduled for that time, and expected to attract around four million viewers, the decision has been made to move the debate forward to 1830 and shorten it to 60 minutes.

When asked about MasterChef, Prime Minister Julia Gillard replied: "I can understand the fascination with cooking and eating, so I know many Australians will watch that show. But I think Australians still pay some regard to the debate and the election campaign."

The debate between Gillard and her Liberal/National Coalition primary opponent Tony Abbott has already been the subject of controversy. Former PM Kevin Rudd had committed to holding three debates before the election. Gillard insisted she only wanted one.

Australian Greens leader Bob Brown had also wished to be part of the debate, but joked that he probably had more chance of appearing on MasterChef.

In 1919, the Wingfoot Air Express, a dirigible owned by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, crashed into the Illinois Trust and Savings Building in Chicago in what was, up to that point, the worst dirigible disaster in United States history. 

The airship was transporting people from Grant Park to the White City amusement park when it caught fire at about 4:55pm while cruising at an altitude of 1200 feet over the Chicago Loop. When it became clear the dirigible was lost, the pilot, Jack Boettner, and chief mechanic, Harry Wacker, used parachutes to jump to safety. A second mechanic, Henry Weaver, died when his parachute caught fire and another passenger, Earl H. Davenport, a publicity agent for the White City Amusement Park remained in the blimp and died when the airship crashed. A fifth person, photographer E. H. Horton, who parachuted from the dirigible broke both legs and later died at a hospital.

Inside the Illinois Trust &amp; Savings Bank building, 150 employees were closing up the day's business in and around the main banking hall, which was illuminated by a large skylight, when the remains of the Wingfoot struck the skylight directly and flaming debris fell through to the banking hall below.

According to Harriet Messinger, a switchboard operator, "There was a shadow and I looked up to the roof. Instantly a crash sent the glass flying on [to] the heads of those below. The girls hesitated, many of them stunned by glass or too frightened to run. Then the huge machine came through. It seemed to fill the bank with flames that searched out every corner. The heaviest part, the engines and tanks, fell to the floor and exploded."

The intense heat made rescue operations very difficult and rescue workers had to wait a half an hour before they could get at the horribly burned bodies trapped under the wreckage. In all, ten employees of the bank were killed and another 27 injured.

No official cause of the accident was determined, though the pilot told a New York Times reporter that it might have been caused either by static in the air (as they were unusually high and in less than optimal atmospheric conditions) or that the engines had backfired, creating a spark due to the fuel mixture being "a little too lean". 

In the aftermath of the accident, the city of Chicago adopted a new set of rules for aviation over the city and the crash led to the closing of the Grant Park Airstrip and the creation of Chicago Air Park.

<h3>&lt;a href="Delta%20Airlines%20flight%20makes%20emergency%20landing"&gt;Delta Airlines flight makes emergency landing&lt;/a&gt; (0:35)</h3>

Delta Air Lines flight 1457, departing from Atlanta, made an emergency landing after it blew out a tire during take-off. The flight was carrying approximately 160 passengers and six crew members and was destined to Portland, Oregon.

Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said that the Boeing 737-800 turned around when the flight crew noticed the blown out tire. The flight was then forced to go into a holding pattern to burn off fuel for more than an hour before it safely landed back at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport at around 3:00pm local time with no injuries being reported at this time.

Delta did not immediately return calls inquiring about the flight, however, Delta Spokesperson Anthony Black told the Associated Press that the 160 passengers on board would be put on a future flight to Portland.

<h3>&lt;a href="Kosovo%20independence%20ruled%20legal%20by%20International%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;Kosovo independence ruled legal by International Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; (1:30)</h3>

Judges from the United Nations International Court of Justice ruled Thursday that Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008 was not in violation of international law.

Despite protests from Serbia, which claimed that Kosovo's independence threatened its sovereignty and was illegal under international law, ten of the ICJ's fourteen judges supported the non-binding motion declaring Kosovo's independence legal. The move was supported by the United States and most European countries, while other countries, including Russia and China, opposed the ruling.

In its opinion on the matter, the court said that it "considers that general international law does not contain any prohibition on declarations of independence. Accordingly, it concludes that [Kosovo's] declaration of independence on the 17th of February 2008 did not violate general international law."

Even before the ruling, 69 members of the UN, out of a total of 192, had recognized Kosovo's independence, and observers say that more may do so in light of the ICJ's ruling.

Kosovo's president, Fatmir Sejdiu, said that "[t]he decision finally removes all doubts that countries which still do not recognise the republic of Kosovo could have," while Serbian president Boris Tadic said that "Serbia will never recognise the unilaterally proclaimed independence of Kosovo."

An advert by fast food restaurant Burger King has been banned from British television over claims that it is misleading. The campaign for the new TenderCrisp chicken burger received two complaints over the fact that the burger appears significantly larger on the advert than in real life.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) investigated the complaints and purchased three burgers from a Burger King restaurant. They reported that both the thickness and the height was "considerably less" than in the advertisement.

The ASA also commented on the actor, stating, "[w]e also examined the size of the burgers in the hands of an average-sized man and considered that they did not fill the hands to the same extent as the burger featured in the advert. We concluded that the visuals in the advert were likely to mislead viewers as to the size and composition of the product."

Burger King responded to the complaints, saying that the advert needed to make all the ingredients in the product clearly visible. Despite the company's defense, it has been ruled that the advert will not be shown again in its current form.

<h3>&lt;a href="Facebook%20reaches%20500%20million%20users"&gt;Facebook reaches 500 million users&lt;/a&gt; (4:43)</h3>

Social networking service Facebook, which has been active for six years, has announced that the website reached a total of 500 million users on Wednesday. According to AFP, this number equates to one out of every fourteen people or, according to The Hindu, 8% of the population of the Earth.

Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive officer and founder of Facebook, created a blog post in relation to this milestone. He wrote "As of this morning, 500 million people all around the world are actively using Facebook to stay connected with their friends and the people around them ... This is an important milestone for all of you who have helped spread Facebook around the world."

To mark the occasion, the California, United States-based company released an application, entitled Facebook Stories, that allows the website's users to "tell the incredible stories of the moving and interesting ways they've used Facebook". Zuckerberg stated that there is a "good chance" of Facebook reaching a total of a billion members in the next three to five years.

Georg Wilhelm Richmann, a German physicist who lived in Russia, was born into a Baltic German family in modern day Estonia. Though his father had died of plague before his birth, his mother remarried and he was allowed to study in Tallinn (the capital and largest city of Estonia but then known as Reval) where he became interested in physics. 

After briefly studying in Germany at the universities of Halle and Jena, young Richmann then submitted an essay on physics to the Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg and in 1741 he was elected a member where he did pioneering work on electricity. There, he worked on calorimetry (the science of measuring the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes) and even collaborated with Mikhail Lomonosov (who had discovered that Venus has an atmosphere).

Then, on August 6, 1753, he was attending a meeting of the Academy of Sciences, when he heard thunder and so ran home with his engraver to capture the event for posterity. At the time he had been hoping to compile a list of bodies arranged by their electrical conductivity.

Considered an excellent teacher and researcher, he often arranged demonstrations of electrical phenomena to his students at the Academy, including how electricity effects animals (supposedly by electrocuting them), how the curvature of an object can effect the density of an electric charge and most importantly the properties of electrostatic induction (the redistribution of an electrical charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges.)

But on the night of August 6th, while trying to quantify the response of an insulated rod to the nearby storm, a supposed ball lightning appeared ...

... and collided with Richmann's head leaving him dead in a red spot. His shoes were blown open, parts of his clothes singed, the engraver knocked out; the door frame of the room was split, and the door itself was torn off its hinges. Reportedly, the ball lightning had traveled along the apparatus causing his unfortunate death. 

Richmann thus apparently became the first person in history to die while conducting electrical experiments, a mere single year after Thomas-François Dalibard of France conducted Ben Franklin's kite experiment from three years previous using a 40-foot-tall iron rod to extract electrical sparks from a cloud.

An independent candidate for the &lt;a href="Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; state legislature is prevented from using the words "NOT the white man's bitch" to describe herself on the ballot. The decision came on Wednesday from the state's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin%20Government%20Accountability%20Board"&gt;Government Accountability Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (GAB), which upheld a staff recommendation that deemed the wording "pejorative".

Ieshuh Griffin, a black woman running for a seat representing east &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMilwaukee"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGlendale%2C%20Wisconsin"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , argued her case before the panel of five retired judges on the GAB, which regulates elections in the state. "It's not racist, it's not a slur ... it's not pointed to a particular person. In my point of view, the average politician is a token," she said. When asked by a board member if she would be satisfied with the wording "not under the white man's influence", Griffin did not reply.

The GAB voted 3–2 to allow the wording, but one member was absent, and Griffin needed four members to vote in her favor. Gordon Myse, the GAB's chairman, supported Griffin's request. "Isn't she saying, 'I'm not under the white man's direction? I'm independent of that.' Isn't that what she's saying?" he asked. 

State election laws allow independent candidates to have a five-word description of themselves instead of the political party placed after their names, as long as it is not "pejorative, profane, discriminatory or includes an obscene word or phrase." However, Griffin claimed that the wording is protected free speech. GAB staff insisted that since she was not prohibited from using the slogan on nomination papers, her Declaration of Candidacy form, and all other public documents such as campaign materials, her free speech concerns were "circumscribed". Griffin will still appear on the ballot, but without the desired description. She plans to appeal in federal court and wants to delay the election pending a decision.

<h3>&lt;a href="Four%20earthquakes%20hit%20the%20Philippines%20in%20quick%20succession"&gt;Four earthquakes hit the Philippines in quick succession&lt;/a&gt; (0:37)</h3>

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, four earthquakes have hit in quick succession in the Moro Gulf, located in the Mindanao area in the Philippines. 

The first one, magnitude 7.3, took place on Saturday at 6:08am local time at a depth of 604.5 kilometers with the epicenter located 915 kilometers south-southeast of the capital city Manila.

The second earthquake reached a magnitude 5.4, and occurred at 6:19am at a depth of 594 kilometers and located about 7 kilometers further to the north.

A third earthquake, this one magnitude 7.6, struck at 6:51am 945 kilometers south-southeast of the capital.

The fourth and last earthquake, a magnitude 7.4, occurred at 7:15am, 35 kilometers closer to Manila.

The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has released notices in response to each of the four quakes, stating that no destructive force tsunami has been generated by the deep quakes. Rona Faeldin of the Philippines Coast Guard told CNN that no damage has been reported on the island though officials "were still determining if there were casualties or damages".

In 1976, an 8.0 earthquake struck the region generating a tsunami which devastated 700 kilometers of coastline in the Sulu Archipelago and southern Mindanao island. The region includes faults in the Sulu Trench, located in the Sulu Sea and the Cotabato Trench, a subduction zone crossing the Celebes Sea and the Moro Gulf.

Tragedy occurred yesterday when 

<h3>&lt;a href="Family%20of%20five%20killed%20in%20house%20fire%20on%20Staten%20Island"&gt;Family of five killed in house fire on Staten Island&lt;/a&gt; (2:22)</h3>

five people were killed early Thursday morning in a three-alarm fire in the New York City borough of Staten Island. The fire destroyed most of the home in the Port Richmond neighborhood. The five killed included four children and their mother 33-year-old Leisha Jones.

Neighbors said that the fire began at approximately 4 a.m. local time. Two New York Police Department officers noticed the fire and radioed for assistance at 4:10 a.m and rescue workers attempted to enter the building although they were deterred by heavy flames and smoke. Once the flames were doused, Fire Lieutenant Robert Strafer entered the building and found the youngest child, two-year-old Jermaine Sinclair. Upon further inspection, officers found the other four victims.

Witnesses reported hearing a loud popping sound before the building burst into flames. The cause of the fire is currently unknown, although it is not considered suspicious, however, the apartment which Jones and her children were living in did not have a smoke detector, as required by city law.

Jones mother, Martha Anderson, told the New York Daily News, "She was such a nice person and she was a really good mother," "She loved her kids...and I loved her."

<h3>&lt;a href="Former%20Illinois%20Governor%20Blagojevich%20rests%20in%20corruption%20trial"&gt;Former Illinois Governor Blagojevich rests in corruption trial&lt;/a&gt; (3:39)</h3>

Despite promises he would testify in his own corruption trial, lawyers for former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich rested their case on Wednesday morning. His defense did not call a single witness, and apparently feels the prosecution has not proven their case. Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday.

Speculation that Blagojevich would not testify began on Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge James Zagel adjourned 90 minutes early after a private meeting with the lawyers involved. Robert Blagojevich, the former governor's brother and co-defendant in the case, had already testified on his own behalf. Blagojevich's defense team apparently considered resting their case on Tuesday, but Zagel gave them an extra day to consider their decision more carefully.

When Zagel directly asked the former governor about his decision, he replied that he understood what he was doing. "It is my decision, under the advice of my attorneys. I make the decision fully and voluntarily," he said.

Blagojevich is charged with, among other crimes, trying to sell the U.S. Senate seat that had been vacated by Barack Obama when he won the 2008 presidential election. Robert Blagojevich testified that his brother was trying to manipulate the political situation to his advantage, but emphasized that he engaged in nothing illegal. According to some sources, Blagojevich was interested in leading the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Two people are dead and thousands of others have lost their homes in southern China after Typhoon Chanthu struck the region yesterday. The Typhoon made landfall in the Guangdong province with winds that reached 126 kilometers per hour and has caused approximately 2.2 billion yuan worth of damages.

Chanthu caused downpours in China's southern provinces, with central and western provinces expected to flood as well. The Typhoon prompted President Hu Jintao to call for increased flood control measures. Chanthu is the latest in a string of recent violent storms followed by massive floods.

So far this year 701 people have been killed by flooding, the highest since 1998. Along with that 347 people are missing and presumed dead. Storms have also destroyed 27,160 houses and 101,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of farmland.

Weather may also begin to play havoc in Australlia as 

<h3>&lt;a href="Weather%20bureau%20forecasts%20an%20early%20spring%20for%20Australia"&gt;Weather bureau forecasts an early spring for Australia&lt;/a&gt; (6:50)</h3>

Australians have been shivering through one of the coldest winters in the country's history, but the Bureau of Meteorology has issued a nationwide forecast for the coming months which predicts warmer conditions in most parts of the country excluding Tasmania.

The southern hemisphere's Spring Equinox occurs in September, but the forecast suggests unseasonal weather conditions across the nation for August and September. Temperatures in Queensland and Western Australia are predicted to soar well above the average, with heavy, torrential springtime rains arriving well in advance, and is expected to have both negative and positive effects on the agricultural industries of the states.

The south of Australia is similarly anticipating warmer-than-average conditions with Victoria, South Australia, and southern Western Australia anticipating balmy to humid weather. This comes in contrast to parts of New South Wales, which experienced their coldest night on record, while Melbourne, Victoria dealt with its coldest morning in 15 months.

Forecasters hypothesize that warmer temperatures in the Indian and Pacific Oceans could be responsible for the onset of an "early spring".

Finally, in weird news of the day, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Man%20disguised%20as%20Darth%20Vader%20robs%20bank"&gt;Man disguised as Darth Vader robs bank&lt;/a&gt; (8:03)</h3>

a man dressed as the Star Wars antagonist Darth Vader robbed a bank in Setauket, New York. The robber was dressed in a character themed mask and blue cape. Armed with a hand gun the robber stole an undetermined amount of cash from the Chase bank branch.

The robber entered the bank saying that he was robbing it. Customers initially thought it was a joke and began laughing. Detective William Lamb of the Suffolk County Police Department said that one customer attempted to tackle the robber and was attacked. The robber then approached a teller and demanded cash while brandishing a weapon.

This robbery is the latest in a string of odd bank robberies in the New York metropolitan area. Yesterday the New York Police Department arrested a man robbing banks carrying flowers and potted plants. Also police are looking for an apparent cross dressing robber who stuck up a bank in Long Island.

Chandrashekhar Sitaram Tiwari, better known as Chandrasekhar Azad, one of the most important Indian revolutionaries, was born in 1906 in Uttar Pradesh.

Azad chose the city of Jhansi in northern India for his organization's hub. In the nearby forest of Orchha, he and his followers set up a shooting range from where they could practice and train and Azad established himself as an excellent marksman. Though he lived their under an alias, he established a good rapport with the local residents and even taught schoolchildren from another nearby village.

From this base of operations, he and his compatriots planned and executed several acts of violence against the British. He was involved in numerous such activities like the Kakori Train Robbery in 1925, the attempt to blow up the Viceroy's train in 1926, as well as the assassinations of prominent figures.

The British soon clamped down on his revolutionary activities and rounded up many of the participants in the train robberies, sentencing them all to death, however Azad eluded capture.

Azad's end did eventually come in 1931, at the age of only 24. On February 27th, a Hindi writer/journalist spotted Azad and Sukhdev Thapar discussing some plans and reported their presence to the police. Within a few minutes policemen surrounded the entire park. During the initial encounter, Azad suffered a bullet wound in his thigh, making it difficult for him to escape but he made it possible for Sukhdev to escape by providing him covering fire. 

After Sukhdev's escape, Azad managed to keep the police at bay for a long time but finally, with only one bullet left in his pistol and being completely surrounded and outnumbered, Chandrashekhar Azad shot himself, keeping his pledge to never be captured alive.

Azad is today considered a hero in India. Alfred Park, where he died, was renamed Chandrashekhar Azad Park, as were scores of schools, colleges, roads and other public institutions across the now independent nation. Countless films have been made of his life and exploits, a secret file related to Azad is still kept in India's Criminal Investigation Department and the COLT pistol with which he shot himself with is still on display in the Allahabad Museum.

For the second time this season, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeongatha"&gt;Leongatha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defeated &lt;a href="Gippsland%20Football%20League"&gt;Gippsland Football League&lt;/a&gt; heavyweights &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATraralgon"&gt;Traralgon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Playing at home, they went on to win by sixteen points.

The Gippsland Football League, officially the Gippsland League, is the only major &lt;a href="Australian%20rules%20football"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; competition in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGippsland"&gt;Gippsland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region according to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Country%20Football%20League"&gt;Victorian Country Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Scores are quoted as ♡❤goals-behinds (total)♡❤; or goals, behinds. Goals are worth six points, behinds worth one.

Leongatha lead at every change, first by 31 points, then 25 points and 51 points. They kicked five goals, two behinds to a single behind in the first quarter; one goal one hind to two goals, one behind in the second; and four goals, three behinds to one behind in the third.

The final quarter saw Traralgon fight back and come within three goals of taking an unlikely victory. They managed to kick seven goals to Leongatha's, one goal, one behind to end the day losing by 16 points, 11&amp;ndash;7 (73) to 9&amp;ndash;3 (57).

Around the grounds, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADrouin%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Drouin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; kicked three more behinds than the aggregate of the match described above as they defeated Sale in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASale%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Sale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 20&amp;ndash;13 (133) to 17&amp;ndash;8 (110), an inaccurate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaffra"&gt;Maffra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defeated a dismal Warragul in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarragul"&gt;Warragul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 13&amp;ndash;26 (104) to 1&amp;ndash;3 (9) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoe%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Moe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; traveled to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMorwell%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Morwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to defeat the hosts 17&amp;ndash;13 (115) to 11&amp;ndash;17 (83).

&lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Rights%20Group"&gt;Open Rights Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a pressure group pursuing reform of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aintellectual%20property"&gt;intellectual property&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; law in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, held its first "ORGCon" yesterday at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACity%20University%20London"&gt;City University London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Approximately 100 delegates took part in six hours of panel discussions and workshops on a wide range of topics in intellectual property, discussing such subjects as "How To Talk To Your &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " and "&lt;a href="Anti-Counterfeiting%20Trade%20Agreement"&gt;ACTA&lt;/a&gt;: A Shady Business", in what ORG billed as a "crash course in digital rights" designed to inspire campaigning on intellectual property issues.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACory%20Doctorow"&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a fiction author and digital rights activist, led the keynote panel discussion "Thriving in the Real Digital Economy", which opened the conference. Doctorow called for a "reframing" of the digital rights slogan "information wants to be free". "The most important thing" about digital rights, he noted, "has nothing to do with art. We are refitting the information network with lots of control." &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20rights%20management"&gt;Digital rights management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (DRM) technologies, Doctorow warns, build in limitations on how consumers exchange information and "abuse the market". John Buckman of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMagnatune"&gt;Magnatune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; followed up Doctorow's comments, noting that DRM is "unsustainable" but that the public needed to "pressure companies into" open-source solutions.

A keynote speech by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Boyle%20%28academic%29"&gt;James Boyle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; compared the current age to the age just before application of the theories of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Smith"&gt;Adam Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other early capitalist economists began breaking down the entrenched monopolies of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amercantilism"&gt;mercantilism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Boyle called on the audience to come up with a "jaw droppingly simple" idea for a reformed copyright system; he gave his speech in front of a projection of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atwitterfall"&gt;twitterfall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as audience members commented on his words.

Boyle, like most of the conference, took a pro-reform but anti-&lt;a href="copyright%20violation"&gt;piracy&lt;/a&gt; position, saying "It is a tragedy that an entire generation has lost the notion that breaking the law is wrong". While several members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APirate%20Party%20UK"&gt;Pirate Party UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , wearing matching t-shirts, attended the conference and held a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afringe%20meeting"&gt;fringe meeting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during the last session, none spoke in the keynote sessions either as panelists or in the discussions.

Among the many workshops which comprised the last three hours of the day, Open Rights Group held a session on student groups and committed itself to establishing Open Rights Group Youth societies at universities across the United Kingdom. Young activists, such as Wikipedian &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AJdforrester"&gt;Jdforrester&lt;/a&gt;, also dominated the "Your Shout" session in which any and all delegates could give three-minute speeches on any intellectual property subject which interested them.

The organisation hopes to host a second ORGCon in 2011.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Christie"&gt;Chris Christie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , governor of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, complained on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's Sunday morning talk show ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThis%20Week"&gt;This Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ that TV series ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJersey%20Shore%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Jersey Shore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ promotes a negative image of the state. 

Prompted by a feature in ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANicole%20Polizzi"&gt;Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one of the stars of the &lt;a href="MTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt; show, interviewer Jake Tapper asked the governor whether he thought the series was positive or negative for the state. Christie unequivocally answered that the show was "negative for New Jersey... It takes a bunch of New Yorkers, drops them on the Jersey Shore, and tries to make America feel like this is New Jersey". He concluded, "I can tell people: they want to know what New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time."

In a wide-ranging interview the governor also faced questions about local and national politics, including New Jersey's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 11&amp;nbsp;billion budget deficit. Specifically, he was challenged over his plans to not pay $3&amp;nbsp;billion into public pension funds, payments described by the interviewer as a "legal obligation". He said that he "wasn't going to put $3&amp;nbsp;billion into a failing pension system" and that there would be further reforms of pensions and health benefits.

Christie was further questioned over his ongoing conflicts with teachers unions. He responded that "we can't have one sector of our society sheltered from the ravages of the recession, at the cost to people who have been hurt by the recession the most", citing the example of construction unions in New Jersey currently suffering unemployment between 35 and 50%.

&lt;a href="WikiLeaks"&gt;WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt; has released a mass of "secret" material from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' involvement in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; in the five years from 2004 to 2009.

The material was scrutinised in co-operation with the main stream newspapers ♡❤&lt;a href="The%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="The%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; magazine ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADer%20Spiegel"&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, who cross-referenced the leaked documents with published material to check the veracity of the material.

The material makes explicit the accusation that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is receiving support including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMan-portable%20air-defense%20systems"&gt;man portable anti-aircraft missiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . However, despite being condemned by the authorities in the United States, commentators have said that nothing in the released material would come as a surprise to anyone who has been following the war.

Sales of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Asmartphone"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; running the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndroid%20%28operating%20system%29"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; operating system have tripled since the beginning of 2010, according to figures released yesterday. Market analysts &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGfK"&gt;GfK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that "around one in every eight handsets sold in the UK between April and June 2010 on a contract is Android-powered, compared to one in 33 on average between January and March."

Last week, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stepped up the marketing for its latest Android-powered device, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamsung%20Galaxy%20S"&gt;Galaxy S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Other Android-powered devices include the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASony%20Ericsson%20Xperia%20X10"&gt;Sony Ericsson X10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHTC%20Desire"&gt;HTC Desire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Smartphones currently represent 73.5% of the market. GfK analyst Megan Baldock said to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤: "The figures suggest an increasing number of consumers are now asking for Android handsets by name."

&lt;a href="NASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; and Indy team owners &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChip%20Ganassi"&gt;Chip Ganassi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFelix%20Sabates"&gt;Felix Sabates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; became the first team owners in history to sweep the three top races in American motor sports. In February, NASCAR driver &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20McMurray"&gt;Jamie McMurray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; took the checkered flag at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Daytona%20500"&gt;Daytona 500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; followed by Scottish driver &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADario%20Franchitti"&gt;Dario Franchitti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's win in the Indy open wheel series at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Indianapolis%20500"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in May. Jamie McMurray helped make it a clean sweep when over the weekend he again took the top spot (and his second win of the season) by winning the Brickyard 400, also held at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20Motor%20speedway"&gt;Indianapolis Motor speedway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Pole sitter &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Pablo%20Montoya"&gt;Juan Pablo Montoya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; led the majority of Sunday's race, but in a late pit stop, he and his crew chief Brian Pattie conservatively changed four tires while teammate and rival McMurray changed only two. As a result, the Colombian born driver fell back in the field, and eventually crashed out of the race. This marks the second time Montoya has dominated this race only to fall short at the end.

NASCAR Sprint Cup points leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Harvick"&gt;Kevin Harvick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; finished in second place, followed by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Biffle"&gt;Greg Biffle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClint%20Bowyer"&gt;Clint Bowyer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Stewart"&gt;Tony Stewart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Ganassi, a former open wheel driver, formed Target Chip Ganassi Racing in 1990. This team entered cars in North America's two leading open wheel series, CART and the Indy Racing League (IRL). Meanwhile in 1989, Sabates formed SABCO Racing to compete in the NASCAR Cup, the leading stock car class in the United States. Ganassi's operation merged with SABCO in 2001, forming an organization with teams that compete not only in NASCAR and IRL, but also in sports car endurance racing. Ganassi drivers won seven open wheel championships between 1996 and 2009. Missouri NASCAR driver Jamie McMurray re-joined Ganassi's team for the 2010 season, after a five year spell with Roush-Fenway Racing.

Also in North American motorsport on Sunday, Spanish rider &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJorge%20Lorenzo"&gt;Jorge Lorenzo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; took the checkered flag in the United States Grand Prix at California's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMazda%20Raceway%20Laguna%20Seca"&gt;Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Lorenzo's victory on a Fiat Yamaha bike, over Casey Stoner (second) and Valentino Rossi (third), strengthened his points lead in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Prix%20motorcycle%20racing"&gt;MotoGP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; championship.

The next race in the NASCAR &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASprint%20Cup%20Series"&gt;Sprint Cup Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will be held on Sunday at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APocono%20Raceway"&gt;Pocono Raceway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Long Pond, Pennsylvania, where &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADenny%20Hamlin"&gt;Denny Hamlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the defending race champion.

Today on Wikinews : Two NATO soldiers are captured in Afghanistan; BP CEO Tony Hayward is set to resign and "get back to his life"; British snooker player Alex Higgins is found dead at age 61 and, in history, Arizona Governor John Howard Pyle orders the raid of a polygamist Mormon fundamentalist community.

Today is Monday, July 26, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.

<h2>Script</h2>
While the media and the average citizen sifts through and comes to terms with the nearly 90,000 leaked documents concerning the ongoing war in Afghanistan,

<h3>&lt;a href="Two%20NATO%20soldiers%20captured%20in%20Afghanistan"&gt;Two NATO soldiers captured in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; (0:40)</h3>

The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the NATO forces organization in Afghanistan, has announced two forces members have failed to return from a vehicle patrol to their Kabul City compound.

ISAF did not report the nationalities of the missing soldiers, but US officials have confirmed to the Associated Press the soldiers are United States military.

Sky News reported a Taliban spokesperson as saying three soldiers were captured, but one has since died. A ground and air search is being conducted for the missing troops, who are believed to be in Logar province.

In June 2009 Pfc Bowe Bergdahl was captured by Taliban forces in Paktika province. His whereabouts are still unknown, though the Taliban have released three videos of him, most recently in April 2010.

US military tensions also escalated this weekend in 

<h3>&lt;a href="North%20Korea%20warns%20of%20nuclear%20action"&gt;North Korea warns of nuclear action&lt;/a&gt; (1:42)</h3>

North Korea [who] threatened "powerful nuclear deterrence" on Saturday in response to military drills supported by the U.S. and held by South Korea.

The National Defense Comission of North Korea, headed by their leader Kim Jong-il, declared that they would "counter with their powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces" in a "retaliatory sacred war." Ri Tong-il, an official with North Korea’s delegation to the ASEAN security forum, had said earlier that they would show a "physical response" to the drills. Though Japan sent four military observers in apparent support of the drills, China criticized the plans.

Tensions had recently become especially high in both sides of Korea after the sinking of the warship Cheonan in South Korean waters, killing over 40 people. An international investigation concluded that the warship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo. North Korea still strongly denies any involvement in the incident, calling the results "fabricated" and refusing to apologize. "If anyone should apologize," said Ri Tong-il, "it should be South Korea, responsible for driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of an explosion."

Despite this, on 25 July 2010, the US and South Korea began their major military drills together in the Sea of Japan.

Border relations have also come to a head in South America when 

<h3>&lt;a href="Venezuelan%20army%20on%20high%20alert%20after%20Ch%C3%A1vez%20cuts%20diplomatic%20ties%20with%20Colombia"&gt;Venezuelan army on high alert after Chávez cuts diplomatic ties with Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (3:12)</h3>

Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez declared that the National Army is on maximum alert along the Colombian border, after he broke relations with that country on Thursday. The declaration comes in the wake of the Colombian Secretary of State's claim before the Organization of American States (OAS) that the FARC has a "consolidated," "active" and "growing" presence in Venezuela, with some 1500 guerrilla fighters in 87 camps.

Venezuela's Secretary of Defense, Carlos Mata, told the media that his forces have been mobilized since Thursday morning, and are awaiting the orders of their Commander in Chief, the President.

Chávez announced the breaking of diplomatic ties on behalf of the Venezuelan government after Colombia released documents allegedly showing the active presence of FARC on Venezuelan territory at the Washington headquarters of the OAS, demanding a special inquiry to investigate the matter. Relations between the two countries had previously been strained, after the Venezuelan government voiced its opposition to new US military bases being set up in Colombia.

The Colombian ambassador has been given 72 hours to vacate his offices in Caracas.

<h3>&lt;a href="BP%20CEO%20Tony%20Hayward%20to%20resign%2C%20say%20analysts"&gt;BP CEO Tony Hayward to resign, say analysts&lt;/a&gt; (4:59)</h3>

BP Chief Executive Anthony Bryan "Tony" Hayward is negotiating the terms of his departure and will stand down from the company; effectively taking responsibility for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, according to journalists. The New York Times cites an anonymous source "close to the board", and the BBC's business editor makes a similar analysis. It is expected that President and CEO of the company's Gulf Coast Restoration Organization Bob Dudley, a Mississippi native, member of the Board of Directors, and most senior American executive of BP, will replace Tony Hayward as Chief Executive.

A report by the BBC World Service said a BP press release asserted that, "[Hayward] has the full confidence of the Board." The resignation, and change of leadership, at the multinational UK-based oil firm is expected to be discussed by the company's Board of Directors on Monday; potentially being ratified as early as Tuesday.

Hayward's position was, essentially, undercut when United States President Barack Obama said he "would have fired him."

While BP cleans up the Gulf Coast and its management team, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Open%20Rights%20Group%20holds%20first%20conference%20in%20London"&gt;Open Rights Group holds first conference in London&lt;/a&gt; (5:49)</h3>

the Open Rights Group, a pressure group pursuing reform of intellectual property law in the United Kingdom, held its first "ORGCon" yesterday at City University London. Approximately 100 delegates took part in six hours of panel discussions and workshops on a wide range of topics in intellectual property, discussing such subjects as "How To Talk To Your MP" and "ACTA: A Shady Business", in what ORG billed as a "crash course in digital rights" designed to inspire campaigning on intellectual property issues.

Cory Doctorow, a fiction author and digital rights activist, led the keynote panel discussion "Thriving in the Real Digital Economy", which opened the conference. Doctorow called for a "reframing" of the digital rights slogan "information wants to be free". "The most important thing" about digital rights, he noted, "has nothing to do with art. We are refitting the information network with lots of control." Digital rights management (DRM) technologies, Doctorow warns, build in limitations on how consumers exchange information and "abuse the market". John Buckman of Magnatune followed up Doctorow's comments, noting that DRM is "unsustainable" but that the public needed to "pressure companies into" open-source solutions.

A keynote speech by James Boyle compared the current age to the age just before application of the theories of Adam Smith and other early capitalist economists began breaking down the entrenched monopolies of mercantilism. Boyle called on the audience to come up with a "jaw droppingly simple" idea for a reformed copyright system; he gave his speech in front of a projection of the twitterfall as audience members commented on his words.

Boyle, like most of the conference, took a pro-reform but anti-piracy position, saying "It is a tragedy that an entire generation has lost the notion that breaking the law is wrong". While several members of the Pirate Party UK, wearing matching t-shirts, attended the conference and held a fringe meeting during the last session, none spoke in the keynote sessions either as panelists or in the discussions.

Among the many workshops which comprised the last three hours of the day, Open Rights Group held a session on student groups and committed itself to establishing Open Rights Group Youth societies at universities across the United Kingdom. Young activists, such as Wikipedian Jdforrester, also dominated the "Your Shout" session in which any and all delegates could give three-minute speeches on any intellectual property subject which interested them.

The organization hopes to host a second ORGCon in 2011.

Another gathering, this time in Germany, ended tragically when 

<h3>&lt;a href="Stampede%20at%20German%20music%20festival%20kills%20nineteen"&gt;Stampede at German music festival kills nineteen&lt;/a&gt; (8:29)</h3>

a stampede at the entrance of the German music festival Love Parade killed nineteen people and injured around a hundred more.

The incident apparently took place due to overcrowding at the entrance to the grounds of the event, located in Duisburg, Germany, which more than a million people were reported to have attended. Despite warnings by police of overcrowding, more people tried to enter the grounds. There is speculation that the panic may have begun when people fell after trying to cross a barrier, and subsequently spread.

Witness Udo Sandhoefer said that people "climbed up the walls and tried somehow to get into the grounds from the side, and the people in the crowd that moved up simply ran over those who were lying on the ground."

Emergency responders apparently encountered difficulties in reaching those in need of assistance due to the number of people in the area. Officials also decided not to evacuate the grounds of the event, citing concerns that a larger panic would be sparked if more people knew of the deaths.

A woman attending the event said that "[t]here were piles of injured on the ground, some being resuscitated, others dead and covered with sheets. It was way too full in the afternoon, everybody wanted to get in."

A statement from president Christian Wulff said that "[i]t is terrible that such a catastrophe brought death, suffering and pain to a peaceful festival full of happy young people from many countries."

The mayor of Duisburg, Adolf Sauerland, said that security measures at the event were sufficient, and that an investigation into the incident was already under way.

<h3>&lt;a href="British%20snooker%20player%20Alex%20Higgins%20found%20dead%20at%20age%2061"&gt;British snooker player Alex Higgins found dead at age 61&lt;/a&gt; (10:57)</h3>

Snooker player Alex Higgins, nicknamed "Hurricane", was found dead in his apartment in Donegall Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland on Saturday. He was aged 61 and had been suffering from throat cancer since 1997.

Born in Belfast on March 18, 1949, Higgins became the champion of the World Snooker Championship at the age of 23 in 1972. He reached the same achievement again in 1982. Higgins' final title victory was in the Irish Professional Championship in 1989.

During 1986, he received a fine and was banned from five tournaments after headbutting a director of a tournament. He was also banned from playing for one year in 1990 after threatening to have Dennis Taylor, another snooker player, shot.

Recently, Higgins lost all his teeth as the result of having treatment for his cancer. In May 2010, a charity dinner took place in Manchester, England that raised approximately £20,000 (US$30,997, €23,859, A$34,363, C$31,961) so as to allow surgery for new teeth for him to occur. However, Higgins was considered to be too unhealthy to have the surgery in Marbella, Spain.

Dennis Taylor, now a snooker commentator at the BBC, stated that "[t]here was just something about the way he played the game - there was a little bit of [John] McEnroe in there. I don't think you'll ever see a player in the game of snooker like the great Alex Higgins."

Philip Studd, another commentator of snooker for the BBC, has described the late snooker player as being "snooker's original troubled genius" and that Higgins was "[c]harismatic, flash, fast, unpredictable, combustible - you just couldn't take your eyes off the 'Hurricane'." Studd continued to explain that "[w]hile he could never match the consistency of Steve Davis or Stephen Hendry, Higgins on his day was the greatest of them all. He touched the heights in 1982 when he won his second world title. He pipped Jimmy White to the final thanks to a break still widely regarded as the finest ever made. His tears of triumph after beating Ray Reardon - wife and baby in arms - remains one of snooker's most iconic moments. Without Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins snooker would never have become one of the most popular television sports in the 1980s and beyond."

And finally, in what has become the most popular sport here at Wikinews, 

<h3>(13:09)</h3>

for the second time this season, Leongatha defeated the Gippsland Football League heavyweights Traralgon. Playing at home, they went on to win by sixteen points.

The Gippsland Football League, officially the Gippsland League, is the only major Australian rules football competition in the Gippsland region according to the Victorian Country Football League.

Scores are quoted as goals(worth six points), behinds(worth one) and then the total of the two.

Leongatha lead at every change, first by 31 points, then 25 points and 51 points. They kicked five goals, two behinds to a single behind in the first quarter and four goals, three behinds to one behind in the third.

The final quarter saw Traralgon fight back and come within three goals of taking an unlikely victory. They managed to kick seven goals to Leongatha's, one goal, one behind to end the day losing by 16 points.

Around the grounds, Drouin defeated Sale 20-13 (133) to 17-8 (110); an inaccurate Maffra defeated a dismal Warragul 13-26 (104) to 1-3 (9) and Moe traveled to Morwel to defeat the hosts 17-13 (115) to 11-17 (83).

Just before dawn on July 26, 1953, 102 Arizona state police officers and soldiers from the Arizona National Guard entered a polygamist Mormon fundamentalist community located in Short Creek, now known as Colorado City, Arizona.

Arizona Governor John Howard Pyle initially called the raid "a momentous police action against insurrection" and described the Mormon fundamentalists as participating in "the foulest conspiracy you could possibly imagine" that was designed to produce "white slaves." More than 100 reporters had been invited by Pyle to accompany the police to observe the raid. However, the raid and its tactics attracted mostly negative media attention.

The community, which was composed of approximately 400 Mormon fundamentalists and led by Joseph White Musser, had been tipped off about the planned raid and were found singing hymns in a schoolhouse while the children played outside. The entire community was taken into custody, including 263 children. One hundred fifty of the children who were taken into custody were not permitted to return to their parents for more than two years, and some parents never regained custody of their children.

In the same week that the Korean War ceasefire was achieved, the raid achieved notoriety in media across the United States, including articles in Time and Newsweek, with many media outlets describing the raid as "odious" or "un-American." One commentator has suggested that commentary of the raid was "probably the first time in history that American polygamists had received media coverage that was largely sympathetic.

One of the few media outlets to commend the raid was the Salt Lake City-based Desert News, which was owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The News applauded the action as a needed response to prevent the fundamentalists from becoming "a cancer of a sort that is beyond hope of human repair." When the paper later editorialized its support for separating children from their polygamist parents, there was a backlash against the paper and the church by a number of Latter-day Saints, including Juanita Brooks, a Mormon historian and author, who complained that the church organ was approving of "such a basically cruel and wicked thing as the taking of little children from their mother." The Short Creek raid was the last action against polygamous Mormon fundamentalists that has been actively supported by the LDS Church.

One year later, in 1954, Governor Pyle lost his bid for re-election to Democratic candidate Ernest McFarland with Pyle blaming the fallout from the raid as having destroyed his political career and Joseph White Musser, leader of the Short Creek fundamentalists died causing a split between fundamentalists who believed he was a Mormon prophet and those who instead chose a new leader.

After the Short Creek raid, the fundamentalist Mormon polygamist colony at Short Creek eventually rejuvenated. In 1991, the Mormon fundamentalists formally established the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church).

The members of the sect did not face any prosecutions for its polygamous behavior until the late 1990s, when isolated individuals began to be prosecuted. In 2006, FLDS Church leader Warren Jeffs was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted List and was arrested and convicted in 2007 of being an accomplice to rape for performing a wedding between a 19-year-old man and his 14-year-old cousin.

On 3 April 2008, following allegations of physical and sexual abuse by an unidentified caller who claimed to be a 16-year-old girl, law enforcement officers raided a FLDS compound Jeffs had founded in Texas called the YFZ Ranch and authorities removed a total of 416 children. While former member of the FLDS Church, Carolyn Jessop, stated her opinion that the action in Texas was unlike the Short Creek raid, others, however, have drawn direct connections between the two events.

<h3>&lt;a href="Twin%20car%20bomb%20kills%2020%20in%20Iraq"&gt;Twin car bomb kills 20 in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; (0:44)</h3>

Twin car bombs killed 21 in Karbala, southern Iraq yesterday evening. The suicide attacks, on the road from Najaf, occurred at around 7:00 PM local time.

At least 47 people were injured, according to Salid Kadhim, spokesman for Karbala's health authorities, who went on to tell AFP, "Most of the killed and wounded are policemen and civilians."

Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are expected to travel to Karbala and nearby Najaf to celebrate the anniversary of the birthday of the Mahdi.

The bombing in Iraq comes just a day after

<h3>&lt;a href="Wikileaks%20release%20Afghan%20%26quot%3Bwar%20logs%26quot%3B%20in%20co-operation%20with%20mainstream%20media"&gt;Wikileaks release Afghan "war logs" in co-operation with mainstream media&lt;/a&gt; (1:19)</h3>

Wikileaks released a mass of "secret" material from the United States' involvement in Afghanistan in the five years from 2004 to 2009.

The material was scrutinized in co-operation with the main stream newspapers The Guardian and The New York Times, and the German magazine Der Spiegel, who cross-referenced the leaked documents with published material to check the veracity of the material.

The documents make explicit the accusation that the Taliban is receiving support including portable anti-aircraft missiles from Iran, and Pakistan. However, despite being condemned by the authorities in the United States, commentators have said that nothing in the released material would come as a surprise to anyone who has been following the war.

Another government report which has been relased, this time in connection to the 

<h3>&lt;a href="Investigation%20into%20Washington%20D.C.%20Metro%20crash%20finds%20need%20for%20new%20safety%20rules"&gt;Investigation into Washington D.C. Metro crash finds need for new safety rules&lt;/a&gt; (2:05)</h3>

investigation into the fatal 2009 Washington Metro train collision. The report was conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and it called for new safety and maintenance rules and blamed the crash on the faulty automatic train-control system. The report also cited the use of dated 1000-Series train cars. The 2009 crash, which killed 9 and injured 80, occurred during the evening rush between the Takoma and Fort Totten stations on the Red Line.

NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman, said that the system is currently regulated by state and local agencies. She called for Federal oversight. "Now it’s really time for them to step up to the plate and for Congress to address the issue," Hersman said during the release of the findings.

In 2009, Hersman told Congress that Federal safety guidelines should be set saying "the state oversight system is not effective, they don’t have any teeth." Currently the Federal government has control of interstate transit systems, not regional or local transit systems.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) said yesterday that it would replace all of it's 1000-Series trains with newer models. After the crash, then WMATA general manager, John Catoe said that "the system is safe." WMATA's interim general manager Richard Sarles said that "We are committed to considering and following through on the findings and recommendations."

<h3>&lt;a href="Poisoned%20liquor%20kills%2017%20in%20Kenyan%20slum"&gt;Poisoned liquor kills 17 in Kenyan slum&lt;/a&gt; (4:48)</h3>

Poisoned liquor, locally known as changaa, killed 17 and blinded a dozen in Kenya's largest slum. Many of the people who died were found in their homes, in Nairobi slum, Kibera.

Police said the changaa "may have contained traces of methanol", according to a BBC News report.

The woman who distilled the liquor was arrested and authorities are investigating if the addition of poison was accidental or not.

Changaa is often supplemented with additives that make it more potent. Many Kenyans die from poisoned liquor every year, often sold in the brewer's home.

<h3>&lt;a href="Seychelles%20sentences%20Somali%20pirates%20to%20ten%20years%20in%20prison"&gt;Seychelles sentences Somali pirates to ten years in prison&lt;/a&gt; (5:24)</h3>

The Republic of Seychelles has convicted eight men of piracy and three others for aiding and abetting piracy. All eleven men each received a ten year sentence in jail. Four of the convicted were under eighteen years of age.

The office of President James Michel states this ruling is in response to a hijack attempt on a Seychelles coast guard ship.

This ruling by Seychelles' Supreme Court in Victoria is the first time the state has convicted Somali pirates.

Seychelles set up a court for the sole purpose of trying Somali pirates earlier this year, in response to hijackings of ships in Seychellois waters.

A Seychellois government statement said that "[t]heir conviction is a historical milestone as it is the first time that a piracy trial is successfully prosecuted in the Seychelles."

Pirates attacked ships more than 200 times in 2009, including 68 hijackings, and made around US$50 million (€38.5 million) in ransoms.

Seychelles and Kenya are the only African countries on the coast of the Indian Ocean with signed agreements with the European Union to prosecute Somali pirates.

<h3>&lt;a href="Two%20tornadoes%20touch%20down%20near%20Wellington%2C%20Utah"&gt;Two tornadoes touch down near Wellington, Utah&lt;/a&gt; (6:32)</h3>

Two tornadoes touched down around the same time yesterday afternoon near the small town of Wellington, Utah in the Mill Creek Subdivision area. Initial reports are that both tornadoes rated somewhere between F0 and F1, on the lower end of the Fujita scale. Several trees were reported to have toppled over, a mobile home was severely damaged, and a travel trailer was reported to have been thrown over 50 yards. Other homes had minor damage.

It is exceedingly rare for a tornado to touch down in settled areas of Utah, and even more rare for two to touch down at the same time. The last tornadoes touched down in Utah was the Salt Lake City tornado in 1999.

Wellington is about 130 miles by road south-east of Salt Lake City, the capital of the US state of Utah.

<h3>&lt;a href="One%20dead%20after%20motorcycle%20and%20car%20collision%20in%20Guernsey%2C%20Channel%20Islands"&gt;One dead after motorcycle and car collision in Guernsey, Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt; (7:21)</h3>

A man has died as the result of a collision involving a motorcycle and another car on the island of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. On Monday, at approximately 9:30pm local time, 22-year-old Ryan Thomson, who came from Saint Martin, was riding on a motorcycle near to the location of the Mont Variouf School, located in Le Neuf Chemin, Saint Saviour. He collided with a stationary car and died as a consequence.

Analysis of the incident is currently ongoing and the States of Guernsey Police Service would like to speak with any witnesses who may have sighted two motorcycles being driven en masse near the location of the incident.

<h3>&lt;a href="Google%20Android%20smartphone%20sales%20triple%20in%20the%20UK%20this%20year"&gt;Google Android smartphone sales triple in the UK this year&lt;/a&gt; (9:05)</h3>

Sales of smartphones running the Android operating system have tripled since the beginning of 2010, according to figures released yesterday. Market analysts GfK said that "around one in every eight handsets sold in the UK between April and June 2010 on a contract is Android-powered, compared to one in 33 on average between January and March."

Last week, Samsung stepped up the marketing for its latest Android-powered device, the Galaxy S. Other Android-powered devices include the Sony Ericsson X10 and the HTC Desire.

Smartphones currently represent 73.5% of the market. GfK analyst Megan Baldock said to The Guardian: "The figures suggest an increasing number of consumers are now asking for Android handsets by name."

<h3>&lt;a href="New%20Jersey%20governor%20calls%20television%20show%20%26quot%3BJersey%20Shore%26quot%3B%20negative"&gt;New Jersey governor calls television show "Jersey Shore" negative&lt;/a&gt; (9:55)</h3>

Chris Christie, governor of the US state of New Jersey, complained on ABC's Sunday morning talk show This Week that the MTV series Jersey Shore promotes a negative image of the state.

Prompted by a feature in The New York Times on Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, one of the stars of the MTV show, interviewer Jake Tapper asked the governor whether he thought the series was positive or negative for the state. Christie unequivocally answered that the show was "negative for New Jersey... It takes a bunch of New Yorkers, drops them on the Jersey Shore, and tries to make America feel like this is New Jersey". He concluded, "I can tell people: they want to know what New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time."

In a wide-ranging interview the governor also faced questions about local and national politics, including New Jersey's US$11 billion budget deficit. Specifically, he was challenged over his plans to not pay $3 billion into public pension funds, payments described by the interviewer as a "legal obligation". He said that he "wasn't going to put $3 billion into a failing pension system" and that there would be further reforms of pensions and health benefits.

Christie was further questioned over his ongoing conflicts with teachers unions. He responded that "we can't have one sector of our society sheltered from the ravages of the recession, at the cost to people who have been hurt by the recession the most", citing the example of construction unions in New Jersey currently suffering unemployment between 35 and 50%.

<h3>&lt;a href="Chip%20Ganassi%20makes%20American%20motor%20sports%20history"&gt;Chip Ganassi makes American motor sports history&lt;/a&gt; (11:27)</h3>

NASCAR and Indy team owners Chip Ganassi and Felix Sabates became the first team owners in history to sweep the three top races in American motor sports. In February, NASCAR driver Jamie McMurray took the checkered flag at the Daytona 500 followed by Scottish driver Dario Franchitti's win in the Indy open wheel series at the Indianapolis 500 in May. Jamie McMurray helped make it a clean sweep when over the weekend he again took the top spot (and his second win of the season) by winning the Brickyard 400, also held at the Indianapolis Motor speedway.

Pole sitter Juan Pablo Montoya led the majority of Sunday's race, but in a late pit stop, he and his crew chief Brian Pattie conservatively changed four tires while teammate and rival McMurray changed only two. As a result, the Colombian born driver fell back in the field, and eventually crashed out of the race. This marks the second time Montoya has dominated this race only to fall short at the end.

NASCAR Sprint Cup points leader Kevin Harvick finished in second place, followed by Greg Biffle, Clint Bowyer and Tony Stewart.

Ganassi, a former open wheel driver, formed Target Chip Ganassi Racing in 1990. This team entered cars in North America's two leading open wheel series, CART and the Indy Racing League (IRL). Meanwhile in 1989, Sabates formed SABCO Racing to compete in the NASCAR Cup, the leading stock car class in the United States. Ganassi's operation merged with SABCO in 2001, forming an organization with teams that compete not only in NASCAR and IRL, but also in sports car endurance racing and Ganassi drivers won seven open wheel championships between 1996 and 2009. 

The next race in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series will be held on Sunday at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania, where Denny Hamlin is the defending race champion.

</ul>
Ernest Gary Gygax, an American writer and game designer, best known for co-creating the pioneering role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) with Dave Arneson, was born in Chicago within a few blocks of Wrigley Field in 1938.

The son of Swiss immigrant and Chicago Symphony Orchestra violinist Ernst Gygax, Gary spent his early childhood in Chicago, but in 1946 after he was involved in a brawl with a large group of boys, his father decided to move the family to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where Gary's mother's family had settled in the early 19th century.

During his childhood and teen years, he developed a love of games and an appreciation for fantasy and science fiction literature which his father introduced to him through pulp novels. At the age of ten, he and his friends played the sort of games that eventually came to be called "live action role-playing games", with one of them acting as a referee. His interest in games, combined with an appreciation of history, eventually led Gygax to begin playing miniature war games in 1953, with his best friend Don Kaye.

By December 1958, the game Gettysburg from the Avalon Hill company had particularly captured Gygax's attention and he ordered from the company the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games. He looked for innovative ways to generate random numbers, and used not only common, six-sided dice, but dice of all five platonic solid shapes, which he discovered in a school supply catalog. 

Gygax soon became active in fandom and by 1965 he was active in the wargame hobby, and was writing many magazine articles on the subject.

During the 1960s, as Gygax was working as an insurance underwriter for the Firemen's Fund in Lake Geneva, in 1966, he co-founded the International Federation of Wargamers (IFW) with Bill Speer and Scott Duncan. The IFW, which was created by combining several preexisting wargaming clubs, aimed to promote interest in role-playing games, especially those set in the medieval period, and provided a forum for international wargamers.

</ul>
In 1968, Gygax rented Lake Geneva's vine-covered Horticultural Hall for $50 to hold the first Lake Geneva Convention, also known as the Gen Con gaming convention for short and in 1969 he met Dave Arneson, the future co-creator of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, at the second Gen Con.

By 1970, Gary had left the insurance business and became a shoe repairman to make more time for pursuing his interest in game development and began working as editor-in-chief at Guidon Games, a publisher of wargames, for which he produced the board games Alexander the Great and Dunkirk in 1971.

That same year, his and Jeff Perren's Chainmail, a miniatures wargame that simulated medieval-era tactical combat was published and in 1972, he added a Fantasy Supplement to the rules. This supplement included warriors who were monsters of non-human races, drawn from the works of Tolkien and other sources. He also included rules for individual heroic characters, including wizards which included ten spells that could be used to affect a battle, including lightning bolts and fireballs.

</ul>
Dave Arneson, who had written the game Blackmoor, adopted these new fantasy rules into his game and while visiting Lake Geneva in 1972, he and Gygax immediately saw the potential of role-playing games. Gygax and Arneson collaborated on "The Fantasy Game", the role-playing game that later became Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D). In 1973, Gygax quit his day job and attempted to publish the game through Avalon Hill, who turned down his offer.

So, together with Don Kaye as a partner, in 1973 he founded the publishing company Tactical Studies Rules (later known as TSR, Inc.) with an initial investment of $1000 each. However, this did not give them enough capital to publish the rules for Dungeons &amp; Dragons and, worried that other companies would be able to publish similar projects first, the two convinced acquaintance Brian Blume to join TSR in 1974 as an equal one-third partner; this brought the financing that enabled them to publish Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

Dungeons &amp; Dragons was first released by TSR in January 1974 as a boxed set; a hand-assembled print run of 1,000 copies, put together by hand in Gygax's home, sold out in less than a year. That same year he also created the magazine The Strategic Review with himself as editor, which later became known as Dragon magazine. 

<ul>

</ul>
Then, sadly, in 1975, Don Kaye unexpectedly died of a heart attack in January at the age of 36. As Kaye had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one-third share of the company, his share of TSR passed to his wife, a woman whom Gygax characterized as "less than personable" and who "dumped all the Tactical Studies Rules materials off on my front porch. It would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner."

However, two years later, in 1977, a new version of D&amp;D, Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (AD&amp;D), was published. The Monster Manual, released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed over the next few years and by 1980 sales of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game reached $8.5 million.

Dungeons &amp; Dragons reached mainstream notoriety when negative media attention focused on Dungeons &amp; Dragons. In 1982, Patricia Pulling's son killed himself; blaming Dungeons &amp; Dragons for his suicide, and Pulling formed an organization named B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons &amp; Dragons) to attack the game and the company that produced it. 

By 1984, Gygax discovered that TSR had run into serious financial difficulties and was $1.5 million in debt. In October 1985, TSR's Board of Directors removed Gygax as the company's President and Chairman of the Board. Sales of Dungeons &amp; Dragons reached $29 million by 1985, but Gygax, seeing his future at TSR as untenable, left the company on December 31, 1985.

Gygax continued to write new books and games, and in the intervening 20 years, he became something of a cult, nerd hero, culminating in a famous episode of the Fox cartoon series Futurama in which he, Nichelle Nichols from the original Star Trek series, the famed physicist Stephen Hawking and US Vice President Al Gore each lent their voices as a team of "Vice Presidential Action Rangers", whose task is to protect the space-time continuum. In fact, Gary Gygax's appearance alongside Al Gore is something of an inside joke since Gore's wife, Tipper, hates Dungeons &amp; Dragons and has been publicly critical of it.

A lifelong cigarette smoker, Gygax went into semi-retirement after suffering strokes on April 1 and May 4, 2004, and almost suffered a heart attack after receiving incorrect medication to prevent further strokes. In late 2005, he was diagnosed with an inoperable abdominal aortic aneurysm, yet despite his reduced workload, Gygax continued to be active in the gaming community.

Then on March 4, 2008, Gygax died at his home in Lake Geneva at age 69. 

Gygax married his first wife, Mary Jo Gygax, in 1958. By 1961 they had two children who would later assist with play-testing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Three more children were to follow before the marriage ended in divorce in the early 1980s. On August 15, 1987, the same day as his parents' 50th wedding anniversary, he married his second wife, Gail Carpenter, and together they had his sixth and last child. By 2005, Gygax had seven grandchildren.

</ul>
Gygax's influence is still strongly felt across the gaming community as a whole. The popular online role playing game, World Of Warcraft, dedicated a patch to the franchise in his honor, numerous webcomics make reference to him and even faux-conservative Stephen Colbert, avid D&amp;D gamer in his youth, dedicated the last part of the March 5, 2008 episode of The Colbert Report to Gygax.

Today on Wikinews : A plane crash in the Pakistani capital Karachi kills 152; bull fighting banned in Catalonia; hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean is considering standing for president of Haiti and, on this day in history, The Red Priest dies a pauper in Vienna.

Today is Wednesday, July 28, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Plane%20crash%20in%20Pakistani%20capital%20kills%20152"&gt;Plane crash in Pakistani capital kills 152&lt;/a&gt; (0:38)</h3>

An Airblue-owned passenger plane, originating from Karachi, Pakistan, crashed on approach to Islamabad International Airport in the Pakistani capital earlier today. There were a total of 146 passenger, including three foreigners and 6 crew members on board.

Initial reports were unclear as to the death toll, with some indicating that everyone on board, including crew, had died, and others saying at least five survivors had been taken to the hospital. Later reports, however, confirmed that all aboard had died.

Officials blame the crash on heavy fog and bad weather. Airblue spokesman Raheel Ahmed said that "[a]pparently the cause of the crash is bad weather, but we leave that to the investigators. We are now preoccupied with rescue work and striving to take care of the relatives of the passengers who were on board."

Rescuers were reportedly finding it difficult to reach the area of the crash, which is on a hill inaccessible by roads. An Islamabad city official, Aamir Ali Ahmed, said that "[i]t's a very difficult operation because of the rain. Most of the bodies are charred. We're sending body-bags via helicopters."

Witnesses said that the plane had been flying low over Islamabad before crashing; a local TV reporter, Anjum Rahman, said that "I wondered why the plane wasn't flying higher as it was flying towards the hill. Then within three or four minutes I heard a loud explosion."

This crash is the deadliest crash involving a Pakistani passenger jet since 1992, when 167 people on board an Airbus A300 were killed as it crashed into a hillside on its approach to the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu.

Weather conditions are also playing havoc in Russia as

<h3>&lt;a href="Severe%20smog%20blankets%20Moscow"&gt;Severe smog blankets Moscow&lt;/a&gt; (2:19)</h3>

hot weather and peat fires near Moscow have created the worst smog in the city in almost a decade, with pollution levels around ten times higher than is considered safe.

At least 43 peat fires have erupted in rural regions to the east and south of the city, and temperatures only 0.1 degrees Celsius less than the record high of 34.7 degrees, set Monday, have led to a thick cloud of smog settling over the city.

According to pulmonologist Alexander Chuchalin, breathing the smog is equivalent "to the effect of two packs of cigarettes smoked within three or four hours."

Scientists predict that several hundred people may die as a result of the smog; Vladimir Kuznetsov of the Independent Center for Environmental Policy said that "[t]here will be sad news for some people with severe allergies, heart conditions, asthma, other breathing conditions and the like."

Numerous buildings in Moscow, particularly those dating from the era of the Soviet Union, lack air-conditioning, which makes it particularly difficult to combat the smog.

Temperatures are predicted to begin cooling by the weekend, and smog is expected to begin dissipating by the end of this week, although traces could remain for a few weeks.

<h3>&lt;a href="Bull%20fighting%20banned%20in%20Catalonia"&gt;Bull fighting banned in Catalonia&lt;/a&gt; (4:18)</h3>

The parliament of Catalonia, an autonomous region of Spain, today voted to outlaw bullfighting – an iconic sport in much of the country. The vote was held after animal rights activists, led by Spanish animal rights group Prou! (Spanish for "Enough!"), who claim the practice is "barbaric", collected 180,000 signatures to a petition.

Bullfighting has been outlawed in the Canary Islands since 1991. In other areas, such as Portugal and southern France, the bulls, which are specially bred for fighting, are not killed in the ring.

The ban, which passed with a 68–55 majority and nine abstentions, will come into force in Catalonia in January 2012, making the region the first place in mainland Spain to outlaw the practice. Supporters of the practice claim that it is an art form which forms an important part of the Spanish culture, and fear that the ban could be the first of many in Spain. They also say that many jobs would be lost as a result of the ban, with estimates that it could cost €300 million in lost revenue.

Both the main parties in the Catalan parliament took the unusual step of allowing their members a free vote in the debate, which saw high emotions on both sides. The debate was officially over the animal welfare concerns; however, many believe that the underlying issue of Catalan nationalism played a significant part in the outcome. Some expressed the opinion that Catalonia, which, while officially part of Spain, has its own language and flag, was attempting to distinguish itself from the rest of Spain by outlawing one of its most famous traditions.

Politics and popular culture are also converging in Haiti where, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Wyclef%20Jean%20considering%20standing%20for%20president%20of%20Haiti"&gt;Wyclef Jean considering standing for president of Haiti&lt;/a&gt; (5:56)</h3>

following months of rumors, musician and hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean today confirmed that he is considering standing for the presidency of Haiti in the country's November elections. A statement from his family and verified by his spokeswoman said that the 37-year-old had not yet announced his intention to run, but that media would be informed "if and when a decision is made".

Jean, whose full name is Nel Ust Wycliffe Jean, is seen as popular among young Haitians. With current President René Préval unable to stand for re-election, so far no one has emerged as a clear successor. Despite growing up in the United States and becoming an award-winning hip-hop artist, Jean was born near Port-au-Prince. He has already been appointed as a roving ambassador for his birth country and is the founder of the Yéle Haiti Foundation. He was at the forefront of fund-raising efforts following the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti in January, but his charity faced allegations of financial irregularities.

Rumours that he would stand for president had been circulating for months, but, until today's statement, had been flatly denied.

"Wyclef's commitment to his homeland and its youth is boundless", said the statement from the Jean family, continuing, "and he will remain its greatest supporter regardless of whether he is part of the government moving forward."

Michael Shifter of think tank Inter-American Dialogue said that the race was "wide open" but that Jean would be "a long-shot". Acknowledging Jean's popularity, he pointed out that the musician was "unaccustomed to the rough and tumble of Haitian politics."

It is unclear whether Jean would be constitutionally able to become President. The constitution of Haiti lays out six conditions for candidates and whilst Jean is thought to meet most of these criteria, The Guardian reports that the singer is "understood to have US citizenship", and that this would make him ineligible. This was denied by Jean's uncle Raymond Joseph, who is also Haitian Ambassador to the United States.

"He is not a US citizen and has never been," Joseph told the Christian Science Monitor. The ambassador claimed that Jean had always remained a Haitian citizen.

Even then, it is unclear whether Jean will qualify under the residence clause, having spent much of his life in the United States. Ambassador Joseph admitted that this would be up to the Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council to decide.

<h3>On this day in history (8:25)</h3>

</ul>
While it may be hard to believe now, the piece of music you are listening to had, for over 100 years, been largely ignored. Yet such was the fate of composer, priest, and famous virtuoso violinist Antonio Lucio Vivaldi.

Born in Venice on March 4, 1678, he was immediately baptized, possibly due to an earthquake that shook the city that same day and in the trauma of the quake, Vivaldi's mother, Camilla Calicchio, may have dedicated him to the priesthood either out of fear or due to his poor health. 

And his health was problematic. His symptoms, "tightness of the chest", has been interpreted as a form of asthma, but this did not prevent him from learning to play the violin, composing or taking part in musical activities, although it did stop him from playing wind instruments. 

His father, Giovanni Battista, a barber before becoming a professional violinist, taught Antonio to play the violin, and then toured Venice playing the violin with his young son. 

In 1693, at the age of 15, he began studying to become a priest and was ordained in 1703, aged 25. He was soon nicknamed il Prete Rosso, "The Red Priest", because of his red hair, a family trait. However, not long after his ordination, in 1704, he was given a reprieve from celebrating the Holy Mass because of his ill health. Vivaldi only said mass as a priest a few times and though he appears to have withdrawn from priestly duties, he remained a priest.

In September 1703 at the age of 25, Vivaldi, who was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist, became the master of violin at one of the four, state run orphanages called the Devout Hospital of Mercy in Venice and over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working there. 

Shortly after Vivaldi's appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad yet his relationship with the board of directors of the orphanage was often strained. Each year the board had to take a vote on whether to keep a teacher and the votes on Vivaldi was seldom unanimous. In 1709 the vote went 7 to 6 against him and he was dismissed. However, after a year as a freelance musician, he was recalled by the orphanage with a unanimous vote in 1711; clearly during his year's absence the board realized the importance of his role. He then became responsible for all of the musical activity of the institution and was promoted to maestro di' concerti (music director) in 1716.

</ul>
In early 18th century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment and this proved profitable, if contentious, for Vivaldi as there were several theaters competing for the public's attention. In 1715, he planned to put on an opera titled Arsilda Queen of Ponto but the state censor blocked the performance because the main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man. However, Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.

His progressive operatic style also caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians, like Benedetto Marcello, a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a pamphlet denouncing him and his operas. The pamphlet, The fashionable theatre, attacks Vivaldi though without mentioning him directly.

Though only around 50 operas are known to exist, Vivaldi makes mention of him writing 94 and though he certainly composed many operas in his time, he never reached the prominence of other great composers, as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for any period of time in any major opera house.

Then, around 1718, Vivaldi was offered a new prestigious position as Maestro di Cappella to the court of Prince Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt who was governor of Mantua. While he continued to write operas during this period, one of which he performed before the new Pope Benedict XIII, it was during this time that he wrote the Four Seasons, the famous four violin concertos depicting scenes appropriate for each season and probably inspired by the countryside around Mantua.

The concertos were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, children ice-skating, and warming winter fires. Each concerto is associated with a sonnet, possibly also by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music. They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve in Amsterdam by Le Cène in 1725.

It was also during his time in Mantua when Vivaldi became acquainted with the aspiring young singer Anna Tessieri Giro who was to become his student, protégée, and favorite prima donna. Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, became part of Vivaldi's entourage and regularly accompanied him on his many travels. There was speculation about the nature of Vivaldi's and Giro's relationship, but no evidence exists to indicate there was anything beyond a friendship and professional collaboration between the two and he adamantly denied any romantic relationship in a letter to his patron dated November 16, 1737.

</ul>
During the height of his career, Vivaldi received commissions from European nobility and royalty. In 1728, Vivaldi met Emperor Charles VI who admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years. Charles even granted Vivaldi the title of knight, a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna.

However, like many composers of the time, the final years of Vivaldi's life found him in financial difficulties. His compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once were in Venice as changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded. In response, Vivaldi chose to sell off sizable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to Vienna. The reasons for Vivaldi's departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that, after the success of his meeting with Emperor Charles VI, he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court.

Shortly after Vivaldi's arrival in Vienna, en route to which he may have stopped in Graz to see Anna Giro, Charles VI died, a stroke of bad luck that left the composer without royal protection or a steady source of income. Not long after the emperor died, on the night between July 27 and 28, 1741, while staying in a house owned by the widow of a Viennese saddlemaker, Vivaldi died of an "internal infection". On July 28 he was buried in a simple grave at the Hospital Burial Ground in Vienna.

Interestingly, Vivaldi's funeral took place at St. Stephen's Cathedral, where one of the most prolific and prominent composers of the classical period and the "Father of the Symphony and String Quartet", a young Joseph Haydn, was then a choir boy.

Only three portraits of Vivaldi are known to survive: an engraving, an ink sketch and an oil painting, the later giving us possibly the most accurate picture for it shows Vivaldi's red hair under his blond wig.

</ul>
Vivaldi's music was innovative. He brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto, in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes and many of his compositions are flamboyantly, almost playfully, exuberant.

Johann Sebastian Bach was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias and Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti but after the Baroque period, Vivaldi's published concerti went relatively unknown, and largely ignored, including The Four Seasons. Though his body of work includes over 500 instrumental concertos, sacred choral works and at least 50 operas, it would not be until the early 20th century that his work would be rediscovered.

In fact, it was an act of forgery which shed light onto the forgotten works of the composer when Fritz Kreisler composed a Vivaldi-styled concerto and tried to pass it off as an original Vivaldi work. This impelled the French scholar Marc Pincherle to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, and were acquired by the National University of Turin Library with generous sponsorship of Turinese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano.

In 1926, in a monastery in Piedmont, researchers discovered 14 folios of Vivaldi's work, previously thought lost during the Napoleonic wars. Though some volumes in the numbered set were missing, they turned up in the collections of the descendants of the Grand Duke Durazzo who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century. The volumes contained 300 concertos, 19 operas and over 100 vocal-instrumental works.

</ul>
The resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly due to the efforts of Alfredo Casella, who in 1939 organised the historic Vivaldi Week, in which the rediscovered Gloria and l'Olimpiade were first revived. Since World War II, Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed wide success. In 1947, the Venetian businessman Antonio Fanna founded the Italian Institute of Antonio Vivaldi having the purpose of promoting Vivaldi's music and publishing new editions of his works. Unlike many of his contemporaries, whose music is rarely heard outside an academic or special-interest context, Vivaldi is popular among modern audiences.

Rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi are from as recent as 2006 when the lost 1730 opera Argippo was found by conductor and harpsichordist Ondrej Macek and Vivaldi scholar Michael Talbot has said of Vivaldi's Nisi Dominus, which was rediscovered in 2005, to be "arguably the best nonoperatic work from Vivaldi's pen to come to light since... the 1920s"

The first recording of The Four Seasons is a matter of some dispute. There is a recording of one made by the violinist Alfredo Campoli taken from a French radio broadcast from early in 1939 and the first proper electrical recording was made in 1942 by Bernardino Molinari, and though his adaptation is somewhat different from what we have come expect from modern performances it is clearly recognizable.

Subsequent recordings of The Four Seasons, of which more than 300 exist, have sold tens of millions of copies, making Vivaldi one of the most popular and well known of the great composers. If he were alive today, he would be a very wealthy man from the royalties alone, though one might also like to imagine a modern Vivaldi still teaching at an orphanage in Italy, instructing the youth and inspiring them with some of the most beautiful music that has ever been written.

<h3>&lt;a href="Gibraltar%20police%20investigate%20suspicious%20death"&gt;Gibraltar police investigate suspicious death&lt;/a&gt; (0:41)</h3>

The Criminal Investigation Department of the Royal Gibraltar Police (RGP) is carrying out investigations following the discovery of a body at a house in Cumberland Road in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

An RGP spokesman confirmed that a body, that of a British woman in her 50s who lived in Gibraltar had been found, but he refused to give further details, telling reporters that the victim's next of kin had not yet been informed. He went on to say that the RGP "are dealing with this as a suspicious death". The Gibraltar Chronicle reported that the woman had sustained a wound.

Local residents became aware of the activity of the police and ambulance services around midnight.

Forensic investigators were on the scene until mid morning, and several people are believed to be helping the police with their enquiries. A man was arrested on suspicion of murder late Wednesday evening and was being held for questioning, but has now been released on Police bail pending ongoing investigations. Under local law in Gibraltar, he could be held for up to 24 hours without charge after which time, he must be released or charged.

This is the fourth death in Gibraltar in the last week, others have included a man found hanged in Upper Town, another who was found on a Ministry of Defence base in a secure area, and drowned himself in the harbor, and a third man whose body was found severely decomposed in Varyl Road.

<h3>&lt;a href="Six%20killed%20in%20Sadr%20City%20bombing"&gt;Six killed in Sadr City bombing&lt;/a&gt; (2:04)</h3>

Iraqi police report a bomb explosion killed five civilians, one security official, and injured at least another twelve Wednesday at 9:15 a.m. The bomb was planted near a state-operated bank in a Shi'ite slum.

The blast occurred while retirees waited in lie to receive their pension checks.

According to Naval officer Admiral Mike Mullen, violence in Iraq is at its lowest since 2003, however, Baghdad remains an area where low-level violence still occurs.

<h3>&lt;a href="Tennessee%20Lieutenant%20Governor%20suggests%20that%20Islam%20is%20a%20%27cult%27"&gt;Tennessee Lieutenant Governor suggests that Islam is a 'cult'&lt;/a&gt; (2:36)</h3>

A Tennessee politician has been criticized by Islamic groups and Islamic leaders by suggesting that Islam is a cult and is therefore ineligible for protection under the first amendment of the United States constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion.

Though Tennessee Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey, at a campaign stop in Chattanooga earlier in the month, said he's "all about freedom of religion", he also said that "[y]ou could even argue whether that being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, cult or whatever you want to call it".

Lt. Gov. Ramsey had been asked about a proposed Islamic mosque and community center that has been slated for construction in the town of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and also about the "threat that is invading our country from Muslims".

Ramsey's comments have been scrutinized by groups all over the country, while Ramsey's rivals for the lieutenant governor position tried to avoid the controversy.

Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called Ramsey's remarks "part of an unfortunate trend in our society" and part of "a disturbing trend in our nation in which it is suggested that American Muslims should have fewer or more restricted constitutional rights than citizens of other faiths." Hooper also encouraged Ramsey to find people "who can offer him balanced and accurate information about Islam."

Ramsey's Republican rivals, U.S. Representative Zach Wamp and Knoxville Mayor Bill Haslam, both tried to avoid the controversy about the cult comments. According to campaign spokesman Sam Edelen, Wamp declined to comment as he was "busy with voting". Meanwhile Bill Haslam's campaign spokesman Dave Smith stated in an e-mail that "The mayor's faith is very important to him, and he respects the right of others to practice their faith, so long as they are respectful of the communities in which they live and the laws of the land."

Later, Ramsey clarified his position by stating that he has "no problem — and I don't think anyone in this country has a problem — with peace-loving, freedom-loving Muslims that move to this country and assimilate into our society." However, Ramsey said he's concerned that "far too much of Islam has come to resemble a violent political philosophy more than peace-loving religion. It's time for American Muslims who love this country to publicly renounce violent jihadism and to drum those who seek to do America harm out of their faith community."

According to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, there are 1.2 billion Muslims in the world and 7 million in the United States. The U.S. Religious Landscape Survey by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life has stated that there are 63,000 Muslims in Tennessee, or 1% of that state's population.

<h3>&lt;a href="Oldest%20user%20of%20Twitter%2C%20Ivy%20Bean%2C%20dies%20at%20104"&gt;Oldest user of Twitter, Ivy Bean, dies at 104&lt;/a&gt; (6:19)</h3>

Ivy Bean, thought to have been the oldest person using the popular social networking site Twitter, has died at age 104.

By the end of her life, Bean had 53,535 followers (a term used on Twitter to indicate you are watching a person's posts) on the site and was something of an internet phenomenon. In 2008, she became known as the oldest person on Facebook, a title held previously by a 97-year-old French man. Bean frequently updated her Twitter page with videos and descriptions of activities in her daily life that included her winning of the Gold Medal in Frisbee in the Over-75 Olympics in Bradford, Northern England as well as recipes and meeting former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

At the beginning of July, Bean was admitted to hospital suffering from jaundice. On July 23rd, Bean returned to the care home where she was a resident, but was no longer able to operate her Twitter account. Manager of the care home, Pat Wright, took over the account and began posting on Bean's behalf.

It was posted on July 26th that Bean was in a poor condition and yesterday, Wright posted "Ivy passed away peacefully at 12.08 this morning".

Many of Bean's followers posted messages of condolence, making Bean the second-most discussed topic on the Twitter yesterday. Among her followers were Peter Andre and Chris Evans.

Ivy Bean was born November 8, 1905, seven years before the telephone network was established.

While Ms. Bean made excellent use of today's electronic communication tools, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Loneliness%20unhealthy%20as%20smoking%20and%20alcoholism%2C%20new%20study%20says"&gt;Loneliness unhealthy as smoking and alcoholism, new study says&lt;/a&gt; (7:48)</h3>

a recent scientific review involving more than 300,000 people across several previous studies has revealed that inadequate social networking and frequent isolation can have negative effects on a person's health equal to that caused by smoking and alcohol abuse. It was found that those who experience sufficient social interactions were 50 per cent more likely to be alive when re-examined eight years later than those who were more socially isolated.

The scientists on the project ranked having low-quality relationships with friends and family as equivalent to frequent substance abuse (that is to say, 15 cigarettes a day or heavy alcohol consumption) but worse for a person's health than not participating in exercise and being obese.

Timothy Smith, project leader from Brigham Young University (BYU), in Utah, claims that "the importance of having a network of friends and good family relationships is comparable to quitting smoking and exceeds many risk factors of mortality such as obesity, physical inactivity."

Related studies have shown that quality relationships stimulate mental and physical health. Smith went onto suggest that General Practitioners should also examine a patient's social network to promote good health.

"Physicians, health professionals, educators and the public media take risk factors such as smoking, diet and exercise seriously. The data presented here make a compelling case for social relationship factors to be added to that list," he continued.

And speaking of people who may be a little too isolated, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Ahmadinejad%20criticizes%20Paul%20the%20octopus"&gt;Ahmadinejad criticizes Paul the octopus&lt;/a&gt; (9:18)</h3>

Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claims Paul the octopus, who correctly guessed the outcomes of eight matches of the World Cup, is a sign of decay of Western culture.

Ahmadinejad said in a speech at a youth festival in Tehran, "Those who believe in this type of thing cannot be the leaders of the global nations that aspire, like Iran, to human perfection, basing themselves in the love of all sacred values."

"We are after constructing Iran, but this does not mean viewing the matter from nationalist angle and singling out the Iranian race. Today the name of Iran is synonymous with prestige, justice seeking, monotheism, anti-despotism, and the entire blessed values that are dear for the world nations," he continued.

An Irish journalist, Rory Fitzgerald, wrote a satirical piece in response to the president's remarks. "A visibly shaken Paul spoke out earlier today saying: 'As an octopus, I can claim some objectivity in my view [of] human affairs,'?" Fitzgerald wrote.

The mollusk correctly predicted the outcome of Germany's seven matches and picked Spain over the Netherlands for the World Cup final.

Paul currently lives in a tank at the Oberhausen Sea Life Centre in Germany.

<h3>On this day in history (10:41)</h3>

BULLET::::- Music credit &lt;a href="http%3A//incompetech.com/m/c/royalty-free/index.html"&gt;Consequence&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
In 1967, during the Vietnam war, the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal had been launching air strikes against North Vietnam from the Gulf of Tonkin. For four days, 150 missions had been flown off her flight deck until on the morning of July 29, while preparations for the second strike of the day were being made, an unguided 5 inch "Zuni" rocket located in a rocket pod under the wing of a F4 Phantom fighter jet was accidentally fired due to an electrical power surge during the switch from external power to internal power.

The rocket then flew across the flight deck, striking a wing-mounted external fuel tank on another plane which was awaiting launch. Though it is still unclear exactly which plane the rocket hit, one of the planes directly involved was being piloted by a young LCDR named John McCain, the now well known US Senator from Arizona and 2008 Presidential Candidate.

What happened next was a series of cascading disasters, many of which were preventable, but due to lack of training and communication, poor equipment maintenance and confusion, the accident become one of the worst accidents in US Naval history, an incident still used in US Navy training schools today.

When the Zuni rocket hit the external fuel tank of the waiting aircraft, the warhead's safety mechanism prevented it from detonating, but the impact tore the tank off the wing and ignited the resulting spray of escaping JP-5 fuel, causing an instantaneous conflagration. Other external fuel tanks overheated and ruptured, releasing more jet fuel to feed the flames which spread along the flight deck, leaving pilots in their aircraft with the options of being incinerated in their cockpits or running through the flames to escape.

At the time, because of a shortage of 1,000 lb bombs, the older style Composition B bombs had been loaded from the ammunition ship USS Diamond Head, instead of newer Composition H6 which capable of withstanding higher temperatures. One pilot, LCDR Fred White, leaped from his burning aircraft but was killed instantly (along with many firefighters) by the cooking off of the first bomb. LCDR Herbert A. Hope jumped out of the cockpit of his aircraft between explosions, rolled off the flight deck and into the starboard man-overboard net. He then made his way down below to the hangar deck, and took command of a firefighting team. McCain escaped by climbing out of the cockpit, walking down the nose and jumping off the refueling probe.

The fire team's chief, Gerald Farrier (without benefit of protective clothing) immediately smothered two of the 1,000 lb bombs which lay in the burning fuel with a PKP fire extinguisher, a dry chemical fire suppression agent, in an effort to knock down the fuel fire long enough to allow the pilots to escape. 

According to their training, the fire team normally had almost three minutes to reduce the temperature of the bombs to a safe level, but the chief did not realize the older Composition B bombs were already critically close to cooking-off until one split open. The chief, knowing a lethal explosion was imminent, shouted for the fire team to withdraw but the bomb exploded seconds later - only one and a half minutes after the start of the fire.

The detonation destroyed McCain's aircraft (along with its remaining fuel and armament), blew a crater in the armored flight deck, and sprayed the deck and crew with shrapnel and burning jet fuel. It killed the on-deck firefighting contingent, with the exception of three men who survived with critical injuries. Two bomb-laden aircraft which were in line ahead of McCain's were riddled with shrapnel and engulfed in the flaming jet fuel still spreading over the deck, causing more bombs to detonate and more fuel to spill.

Nine bomb explosions occurred on the flight deck, eight caused by the Composition B bombs and the ninth occurred as a sympathetic detonation between an old bomb and a newer H6 bomb. The explosions tore large holes in the armored flight deck, causing flaming jet fuel to drain into the interior of the ship, including the living quarters directly underneath the flight deck, and the below-decks aircraft hangar.

Sailors and Marines finally controlled the flight deck fires within about two hours, and continued to clear smoke and to cool hot steel on the 02 and 03 levels until all fires were under control by 1:42pm. They finally declared the fire defeated at 4:00am the next morning, due to additional flare-ups. Throughout the day the ship’s medical staff worked in dangerous conditions to assist their comrades including HM2 Paul Streetman, one of 38 corpsmen assigned to the carrier, who spent over 11 hours on the mangled flight deck tending to his shipmates.

</ul>
In all, the fire left 134 crewmen dead and 161 more injured. Many planes and armament were jettisoned to prevent them from catching fire or exploding. Twenty-one aircraft also sustained enough damage from fire, explosions and salt water to be stricken from naval inventory. 

Though there were many firefighting tools available on Forrestal, including emergency respirators, the general crew were not trained in their use and either failed to use them correctly or did not coordinate their efforts correctly. For example, there were damage control teams spraying foam on the deck to contain the flames, which was the correct procedure, yet crewmen on the other side of the deck sprayed seawater, washing away the foam and worsening the situation by washing burning fuel through the hole in the flight deck into the decks below; burning fuel is not easily extinguished and can in fact be spread by water. Due to the first bomb blast killing nearly all of the specially trained firefighters on the ship, the remaining crew, who had no formal firefighting training, had to improvise.

The Navy still commonly refers to the fire aboard Forrestal, and the lessons learned, when teaching damage control and ammunition safety. A large portion of basic training is dedicated to firefighting and prevention tactics and every US Navy sailor is considered a firefighter first, a job your host once had when he served in the US Navy 25 years after the USS Forrestal, or Forrest Fire, incident.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAntelope%20Valley"&gt;Antelope Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; A huge wildfire that has been burning in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Desert%20%28California%29"&gt;High Desert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20California"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; since 2:00 pm (2200 UTC) yesterday continues to threaten residents in the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APalmdale%2C%20California"&gt;Palmdale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the Antelope Valley region of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this afternoon. Mandatory evacuation orders have been set in place, affecting 2,000 homes.

The fire is one of three that ignited yesterday in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMojave%20Desert"&gt;Mojave Desert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Gabriel%20Mountains"&gt;San Gabriel Mountains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The first was a 30-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aacre"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; fire that began to the west of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALancaster%2C%20California"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the Fairmont area. It was contained and suppressed by mid-afternoon, but the other two fires ignited while firefighters were battling the first. The second fire, the "Briggs Fire", began shortly after 2:00 pm near 8334 Soledad Canyon Road and Briggs Road, south of the freeway. It burned 500 acres south of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Route%2014"&gt;14 Freeway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Los Angeles County Fire Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (LACFD) now has it contained, and firefighters are hopeful that it will burn itself out as it edges closer to the 160,577-acre burn area of last year's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStation%20Fire"&gt;Station Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The third fire, the "Crown Fire", broke out at around the same time as the Briggs Fire on the northern side of the 14 Freeway near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AActon%2C%20California"&gt;Acton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Crown fire has so far burned 13,000 acres and has been heading north into &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeona%20Valley%2C%20California"&gt;Leona Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APalmdale%2C%20California"&gt;Palmdale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Over 800 firefighters are now tackling the Crown Fire on the ground, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20747"&gt;Boeing 747&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMcDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10"&gt;McDonnell Douglas DC-10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; fixed-wing aircraft have taken to the skies to drop &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhos-Chek"&gt;Phos-Chek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; slurry (a red powdery fire retardant that is a mixture of mostly water and fertilizer, and doesn't evaporate) on the fire, and modified &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASikorsky%20UH-60%20Black%20Hawk"&gt;Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; helicopters known as "Firehawks" are making water-drops. As well as LACFD, firefighters from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Los Angeles City Fire Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Department%20of%20Forestry%20and%20Fire%20Protection"&gt;California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Cal Fire) are also helping to battle the fire. Weather conditions and topography have hindered their efforts, as temperatures rose to 98 degrees Fahrenheit today, with windspeeds of 25mph. Tonight, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; predicts winds will reach as high as 50mph.

The fire burned down a Los Angeles County Sheriff Department communications tower, forcing Lancaster and Palmdale-based deputies to set up mobile operations bases and coordinate their efforts using cell phones and computers. Last night, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Aqueduct"&gt;California Aqueduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; acted as a barrier to the fire.

Residents of Leona Valley, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Elizabeth%2C%20California"&gt;Lake Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Ritter Ranch, Rancho Vista, Ana Verde and Palmdale received &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReverse%20911"&gt;Reverse 911&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; telephone calls last night alerting them of mandatory evacuations. Many of the evacuation orders were lifted this morning as the spread of the fire decreased. However, as winds picked up in the afternoon, fire embers were carried across the aqueduct and the fire is now heading towards a highly-populated area of Palmdale. Residents who were allowed back into their homes were re-evacuated to Red Cross shelters set up in local schools and parks.The fire is also threatening five high-voltage power lines that supply electricity to much of Southern California. 21 customers in the immediate vicinity have been without power since yesterday.

At 5:00 pm, California Governor &lt;a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;, police and fire officials held a press conference. The governor said that the fire was 20% contained and had burned 13,000 acres. It is thought that the fire began when workers in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAgua%20Dulce%2C%20California"&gt;Agua Dulce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; caused sparks by hammering the bolts when they were removing a tire from a rim.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Q2%20economic%20growth%20slows%20to%202.4%25&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The US government announced yesterday that economic growth in the &lt;a href="USA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; has slowed to 2.4% in the second quarter as the economy struggles with high unemployment and the aftermath of the worst recession since the 1930's. 

This slower rate compares with a newly revised number of 3.7% for Q1, and 5% in Q4 of last year. Economists had been expecting economic growth of 2.5% for Q2. 

For this year's second quarter, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis"&gt;Bureau of Economic Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' report on the economy carried more disappointing news. Consumer spending growth in the North American country slowed from 1.99% in Q1 to just 1.6%. Also, businesses and retailers stocked shelves at a slower pace, and America's trade deficit, the largest in the world, widened as the country imported more goods.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce"&gt;US Commerce Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also revised some of their estimated economic growth statistics. The Department revised their estimate of Q1 economic growth from 2.7% to 3.7%, and also revised their estimate of the severity of the 2007&amp;ndash;2009 recession from a real-GDP contraction of 2.5% to an new figure of 2.8%. Also, there were some economic bright spots in Q2. State and local governments, who have been cutting spending for months, spent 1.3% more than in Q1. Residential investment grew 27.9% from &amp;minus;12.3% in Q1. Nonresidential building investment rose for the first time in two years, and disposable personal incomes rose 4.4%, though it appears that people are not spending it.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; test drove a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChevrolet%20Volt"&gt;Chevrolet Volt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Friday during a visit to a plant in &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. The visit was part of a larger trip to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADetroit"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; area to discuss the progress of Obama's bailout of the auto industry earlier in his administration.

As the president toured the factory, managers invited him to test drive the Volt, which will soon be manufactured there. After consulting reluctant top aides and Secret Service personnel, Obama accepted. "I hope it has an air bag," said press secretary Robert Gibbs. Obama hopped into the car with assembly manager Teri Quigley, buckled his seat belt, and crept forward about ten feet (three meters). As he got out he remarked that the ride was "pretty smooth".

Obama visited the Detroit area to defend his controversial decision to invest &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 50 billion in the failing auto industry last year. "It's estimated we would have lost another million jobs had we not stepped in," said Obama. Instead, job growth totaled 50,000 workers this year, the largest since 1999. Obama warns, though, that recovery is not yet complete.

This was the second time Obama drove a car since early 2007, when as a presidential candidate he requested Secret Service protection. The first was a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADodge%20Charger"&gt;Dodge Charger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which he drove a few months ago at a Secret Service training facility.

Today on Wikinews : Raging Southern California wildfires force mandatory evacuation orders; 3 fatal air crashes occur in the United States; a French woman admits to killing her eight infants and, in history, Jimmy Hoffa disappears without a trace.
Today is Friday, July 30, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.

<h2>Script</h2>
<h3>&lt;a href="Raging%20Southern%20California%20wildfires%20force%20mandatory%20evacuation%20orders"&gt;Raging Southern California wildfires force mandatory evacuation orders&lt;/a&gt; (0:34)</h3>

A huge wildfire that has been burning in the High Desert of Southern California since 2pm yesterday continues to threaten residents in the city of Palmdale in the Antelope Valley region of the Los Angeles County this afternoon. Mandatory evacuation orders have been set in place, affecting 2,000 homes.

Over 800 firefighters are now tackling the fire on the ground in coordination with aircraft dropping the red powdery fire retardent known as Phos-Chek slurry. However, weather conditions and topography have hindered their efforts, as temperatures rose to 98deg Farenheit today, with wind speeds at 25mph. Tonight, the National Weather Service predicts winds will reach as high as 50mph.

Residents of Leona Valley, Lake Elizabeth, Ritter Ranch, Rancho Vista, Ana Verde and Palmdale received Reverse 911 telephone calls last night alerting them of mandatory evacuations.

Many of the evacuation orders were then lifted this morning as the spread of the fire decreased. However, as winds picked up in the afternoon, fire embers were carried across California Aqueduct which had been acting as a barrier to the fire, and the fire is now heading towards a highly-populated area of Palmdale. Residents who were allowed back into their homes were re-evacuated to Red Cross shelters set up in local schools and parks. The fire is also threatening five high-voltage power lines that supply electricity to much of Southern California. 

At 5:00 pm, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, police and fire officials held a press conference. The governor said that the fire was 20% contained and had burned 13,000 acres. It is thought that the fire began when workers in Agua Dulce created sparks from the hammering of bolts when they were removing a tire from a rim.

In the neighboring state of Arizona, 
<h3>&lt;a href="Medical%20helicopter%20crashes%20in%20Tucson%2C%20Arizona%2C%20kills%20all%20on%20board"&gt;Medical helicopter crashes in Tucson, Arizona, kills all on board&lt;/a&gt; (2:25)</h3>

a medical helicopter crashed into a fence just outside a house in the city of Tucson on Wednesday afternoon, killing all three crew members on board. The crash occurred at 1:42 p.m. Arizona time at the intersection of Glenn Street and Park Avenue. Eyewitness Ricardo Carrasco said that he saw the rotors stop working and the helicopter start plummeting towards the ground, with the pilot attempting to steer it away from the house.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the helicopter was a Eurocopter AS350B3 flown in the LifeNet Arizona fleet. It was operated by the Colorado-based Air Methods Corporation, which specializes in flying emergency medical helicopters.

"This is a sad day for all of us at Air Methods and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family and friends of our employees who perished while on duty," Air Methods Corporation CEO Aaron Todd said after the crash.

Two other fatal aviation accidents were reported in the United States on Wednesday.

In Alaska, 

<h3>&lt;a href="C-17%20crashes%20near%20air%20force%20base%20in%20Alaska"&gt;C-17 crashes near air force base in Alaska&lt;/a&gt; (3:25)</h3>

a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, operated by the United States Air Force, crashed near Elmendorf Air Force Base at about 6:15 pm, killing all four crew members. Three were members of the U.S. National Guard, one was active duty. Names are being withheld pending the notification of family members.

The crash's resulting fireball and plume, which occurred as the plane had been practicing for the 2010 Arctic Thunder air show, was visible from downtown Anchorage, located near the base. According to Anchorage Fire Dept. Captain Bryan Grella in an interview with the Associated Press "It was a big, gray plume of smoke and I saw a fireball go up in it,"

Finally, in Delaware, Ohio city councilman and airport commissioner James Moore died when his rented light plane crashed and caught fire close to the city's airport.

Tragedy also occurred in Africa where

<h3>&lt;a href="Up%20to%20140%20feared%20dead%20as%20boat%20sinks%20in%20DR%20Congo"&gt;Up to 140 feared dead as boat sinks in DR Congo&lt;/a&gt; (4:25)</h3>

as many as 140 people are feared dead after a boat sank on the Kasai River, a tributary of the Congo River, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The central African country, of equivalent size to western Europe, has very poor road infrastructure, meaning that many people travel on boats, which are often overloaded. The boat involved in the accident was traveling to the capital city, Kinshasa, from the town of Mushie. The accident occurred in the province of Bandundu, approximately 30 km (20 miles) from the provincial capital, where officials reportedly held a crisis meeting to deal with the incident.

The boat is believed to have been overweight, carrying at least 180 passengers as well as goods. As it is the dry season in the Congo, the river is shallow and the sinking was reportedly the result of hitting a mud bank, causing the vessel to capsize.

Lambert Mende, the Congolese information minister, said in a statement that at least 80 people had been confirmed dead while 76 were thought to have survived. However, the local police later announced a provisional death toll of 138, and possibly more.

Safety standards are poor in the Democratic Republic, with overcrowding common on boats, which often do not carry life jackets and are forced to navigate poorly marked waterways, meaning that fatal accidents are not uncommon in the country.

<h3>&lt;a href="Former%20USDA%20employee%20Shirley%20Sherrod%20to%20sue%20blogger%20Andrew%20Breitbart"&gt;Former USDA employee Shirley Sherrod to sue blogger Andrew Breitbart&lt;/a&gt; (6:14)</h3>

Shirley Sherrod, an African-American employee of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) who was ousted last week, has said that she will "definitely sue" conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart over a video clip posted online at BigGovernment.com, operated by Breitbart, that made her appear racist.

Formerly the director of rural development in Georgia, Sherrod was referred to on Breitbart's site as a "racist govt employee," and the video had been edited to make her appear to have discriminated against Caucasians. 

The clip of Sherrod, who spoke in March of this year at an NAACP meeting, was edited from the original video footage of this meeting and misrepresents Sherrod as deliberately failing to support a white farmer because of his race. In reality, the full video revealed that Sherrod was speaking about racial reconciliation and the lessons she learned after the episode. However, the USDA asked Sherrod to resign before the full video was released. The farmer mentioned in the video and his wife later stated that Sherrod had actually helped to save their farm, and after the full video was made public, US Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and US President Barack Obama apologized and Vilsack offered Sherrod a new job with the USDA. However, Sherrod said that she has not decided whether to accept the new position.

Breitbart said that he posted the edited clip to prove that the NAACP has racist elements, and has not apologized to Sherrod. Shortly before the video clip was posted, the NAACP had demanded that the &lt;a href="Tea%20Party%20movement"&gt;Tea Party&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative activist group that Breitbart is active in, remove racism from parts of that group.

However, Sherrod says that she no longer wants an apology. "He had to know that he was targeting me," the 62-year-old said at a convention of the National Association of Black Journalists.

Disturbing news has come to light in France where

<h3>&lt;a href="French%20woman%20admits%20to%20killing%20her%20eight%20infants"&gt;French woman admits to killing her eight infants&lt;/a&gt; (8:06)</h3>

French prosecutors confirmed on Thursday that nursing assistant Dominique Cottrez killed her eight newborn infants and buried their remains. Prosecutors called the case "non-standard... given the large number of newborns."

According to prosecutors, Cottrez, in her 40s, is heavy-set and she was able to hide her eight pregnancies. Cottrez did not want to visit a doctor for contraceptives nor did she want more children.

Cottrez admitted to strangling eight infants and hiding the remains in garbage bags. The killings occurred over a time span of several years, from 1989 to 2006 or 2007. Prosecutors charged her with "deliberate homicides of minors under the age of 15," which could cause Cottrez to serve a life sentence in prison.

New homeowners of the Cottrez's former house discovered bags with the remains of two infants. Investigators then discovered an additional six children in the Cottrez's current residence.

Cottrez's husband, Pierre-Marie Cottrez, was unaware of the killings.

<h3>&lt;a href="July%20deadliest%20month%20for%20US%20in%20Afghanistan%20War"&gt;July deadliest month for US in Afghanistan War&lt;/a&gt; (9:14)</h3>

Three US troops died in two separate blasts yesterday, and three more died today, increasing the American death toll in Afghanistan for July to 66, and making this month the deadliest month for American involvement in the nine-year war.

A NATO statement released on Friday stated that three troops had been killed by two blasts, and US officials said those killed were Americans. Another NATO statement released today confirmed the deaths of three more troops.

Though this month has been deadliest for the US, June was the most deadly month for NATO as a whole, with 104 troops, including 60 Americans, killed. In this month, 86 troops have been killed, including the 66 aforementioned Americans. The death totals for Taliban fighters and Afghan civilians have been harder to count, although in recent months, civilian casualties have been on the rise.

As US President Barack Obama ordered 30,000 extra reinforcements to beat back a rising Taliban, casualties have increased as well, as US and NATO commanders had warned. There are currently over 150,000 NATO and US troops in the Asian country. However, President Obama has promised to begin withdrawing troops in about a year's time.

</ul>
Born February 14, 1913, James Riddle Hoffa, better known simple as Jimmy Hoffa, disappeared on this day in 1975. 

Hoffa was born in Brazil, Indiana; his father, a coal miner, died in 1920 when Hoffa was seven years old and so the family moved to Detroit in 1924, where Hoffa was raised and lived the rest of his life. Hoffa left school when he was still a teenager at 14, and began working as a full-time manual laborer to help support his family.

While working at a grocery chain he and his fellow employees were displeased with working conditions as the chain paid substandard wages and offered minimal job security and so they tried to organize a union to better their lot. Although Hoffa was young, his bravery and approachability in this role impressed his fellow workers, and he rose to a leadership position. By 1932, after being dismissed from the grocery chain—in part because of his union activities—Hoffa joined and became involved with Local 299 of the truck driving and warehouseman Union, known as the Teamsters, in Detroit.

Although he never actually worked as a truck driver, he became president of Local 299 in December 1946. Through his tactic of using "quickie strikes", secondary boycotts, and other means of leveraging union strength at one company, to then move to organize workers, he could win contract demands at other companies.

He then rose to lead the combined group of Detroit-area locals shortly afterwords, and advanced to become head of the Michigan Teamsters groups sometime later. During this time, Hoffa obtained a deferment from military service in World War II, by successfully making a case for his union leadership skills being of more value to the nation, by keeping freight running smoothly to assist the war effort.

The Teamsters union, founded in 1899, had only 75,000 members in 1933. As a result of Hoffa's work with other union leaders to consolidate local union trucker groups into regional sections and then into one gigantic national body — work that Hoffa ultimately completed over a period of two decades — membership grew to 170,000 members by 1936. Three years later, there were 420,000; and the number grew steadily during World War II and through the post-war boom to top a million members by 1951.

By 1952, Hoffa rose to national vice-president of the Teamsters' IBT union, which was on its way to becoming the largest and most powerful single union in the United States. To gain this position, Hoffa quelled an internal revolt against incoming president Dave Beck, by securing the Midwest's support for Beck during an IBT convention in Los Angeles.

In 1955, the IBT moved its headquarters from Indianapolis to Washington, DC, taking over a large office building in the US capital and with an increased staff with many lawyers hired to assist with contract negotiations.

</ul>
During 1957 when he had taken over the presidency of the Teamsters, his predecessor, former president Dave Beck was under indictment on fraud charges and appeared before the US Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor or Management Field in March. Beck took the Fifth Amendment, which protects a defendant from being a witness against himself, 140 times in response to questions. 

Following Hoffa's re-election as president in 1961, he worked to expand the union. In 1964, he succeeded in bringing virtually all over-the-road truck drivers in North America under a single national master-freight agreement. He then tried to bring the airline workers and other transport employees into the union, but with limited success. During this period, Hoffa was facing immense personal strain as he was under investigation, on trial, launching appeals of convictions, or imprisoned for virtually all of the 1960s.

In 1964, Hoffa was convicted in Chattanooga, Tennessee, of attempted bribery of a grand juror, and was sentenced to eight years. Hoffa was also convicted of fraud later that same year for improper use of the Teamsters' pension fund, in a trial held in Chicago. He received a five-year sentence to run consecutively to his bribery sentence.

Hoffa began serving his sentences in March 1967 at the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary in Pennsylvania. Just before he entered prison, Hoffa appointed Frank Fitzsimmons as acting Teamsters president. Fitzsimmons was a Hoffa loyalist, fellow Detroit resident, and a longtime member of Teamsters Local 299 in Detroit, and owed his high position in large part to Hoffa's influence. Despite this, Fitzsimmons distanced himself from Hoffa's influence and control after 1967, much to Hoffa's displeasure. Fitzsimmons also decentralized power somewhat within the Teamsters' union administration structure. During the Hoffa era, Hoffa had kept most power in his own hands.

But then on December 23, 1971, less than five years into his 13-year sentence, Hoffa was released from the Lewisburg, Pennsylvania prison, when President Richard Nixon commuted his sentence to time served. The IBT had endorsed Richard Nixon, the Republican Party's candidate, in his presidential re-election bid in 1972; in prior elections, the IBT union had supported Democratic Party nominees. Suspicions were soon raised of a deal for Hoffa's release being connected with the IBT's support of Nixon in 1972.

While glad to regain his freedom, Hoffa was displeased with the condition imposed on his release by President Nixon that restricted Hoffa from participating in union activities until 1980. Hoffa was planning to sue to invalidate the non-participation restriction, in order to reassert his power over the Teamsters; but he faced immense resistance to this course of action from many quarters, and had lost much of his earlier support, even in the Detroit area. As a result, he intended to begin his comeback at the local level, with Local 299 in Detroit, where he retained some influence.

</ul>
Then at, or sometime after, 2:45 pm on July 30, 1975, from the parking lot of the Machus Red Fox Restaurant in Bloomfield Township, a suburb of Detroit, Hoffa disappeared. It was believed that he was to have been meeting with two Mafia leaders — Anthony Giacolone from Detroit, and Anthony Provenzano from New Jersey, but during the ensuing FBI investigation, Giacolone and Provenzano were each found not to have been in the vicinity of the restaurant that afternoon, and each of them denied that they had scheduled any meeting with Hoffa.

Although not claiming to conclusively establish the specifics of his disappearance, a 56-page report the FBI prepared indicates that law enforcement's belief is that Hoffa was murdered at the behest of organized crime figures who deemed his efforts to regain power within the Teamsters to be a threat to their control of the union's pension fund.

Following Nixon's resignation as president in disgrace over the Watergate scandal in August, 1974, Nixon avoided public life for over a year; his first public event was a charity fund raising golf tournament in California on October 9, 1975, at the La Costa Resort and Spa, which was heavily attended by Teamsters' leaders and associates, including IBT President Frank Fitzsimmons and mobster and IBT leading official Allen Dorfman; Hoffa had disappeared only ten weeks earlier.

Molly Hagerty, 54, claimed Gore "sexually assault[ed] me in his [hotel] room." Hagerty was called to Gore's Portland hotel room to give him a massage. Hagerty said Gore pinned her down and "he kept trying to have sex with [her]."

Prosecutors closed the case, but after tabloid ♡❤National Inquirer♡❤ interviewed Hagerty they reopened the case. Hagerty refused to take a polygraph test.

Deputy DA Don Rees said there is "contradictory evidence, conflicting witness statements, credibility issues, lack of forensic evidence, and denials by Mr. Gore." 

Rees continued saying Hagerty and her attorneys were uncooperative in the investigation.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAntelope%20Valley%2C%20California"&gt;Antelope Valley, California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The Crown Fire that has burned through 13,980 acres in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Desert%20%28California%29"&gt;High Desert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20California"&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; since 2:32 pm (2232 UTC) Thursday was at 82% containment Saturday evening, according to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Los Angeles County Fire Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

On Friday high winds caused the fire to jump the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Aqueduct"&gt;California Aqueduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and spread into the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APalmdale%2C%20California"&gt;Palmdale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Over 2,000 residents of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeona%20Valley"&gt;Leona Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Ana Verde, and Rancho Vista were given mandatory evacuation orders. The sky was blanketed with thick orange &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apyrocumulus%20cloud"&gt;pyrocumulus clouds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and falling ash, making the air hard to breathe.

State Governor &lt;a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Palmdale on Friday to survey the burned areas. "We were very fortunate to not have fires for quite some time because the air temperature was cool and we didn't have the experiencing of dry weather and all the winds and so on, but all of a sudden the fire season kicked in as if, 'Here we are,'" Schwarzenegger said during a press conference. "But we are ready and we have luckily distributed resources all over the state of California, so we are ready at any given time."

The fire has so far destroyed one house and three mobile homes, damaging the roof of another and burning car garages, horse stables, and other outbuildings. Most of the more seriously threatened homes were constructed recently from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFireproofing"&gt;fire-proof materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with walls coated in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astucco"&gt;stucco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and fire-resistant plants in the yards. Although some roads are still closed to all traffic, all existing evacuation orders were lifted late Friday night and 500 residents of Rancho Vista were told to "shelter in place" until further notice. Despite the absence of mandatory evacuation orders, over 2,000 houses, 60 commercial buildings, and 100 outbuildings are still under threat.

Throughout the night, fire crews have been battling the wildfire, assisted by cooler temperatures and lighter-than-expected winds which have enabled them to establish containment lines. "Crews went out [Friday] night and did some great work trying to complete more lines and also trying to take care of what we call 'cat eyes' which are embers within the perimeter of the fire, so there will be much more work being done there today," said LACFD Captain Roland Sprewell. "But of course we're not going to rest on our laurels today...we're going to be vigilantly watching the winds, especially in the ridge and down in the valleys."

At the height of the fire, 1,700 firefighters from all over California were battling the flames, although as of 12:00 pm Saturday afternoon, it has been reduced to around 1,350 personnel. 16 fire camp crew have also assisted. 250 fire engines and four bulldozers have been used. In the air, 4 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20747"&gt;Boeing 747&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; supertankers, 1 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMcDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10"&gt;McDonnell Douglas DC-10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tanker, and 6 modified &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASikorsky%20UH-60%20Black%20Hawk"&gt;Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; helicopters known as "Firehawks" have been dropping water and red &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhos-Chek"&gt;Phos-Chek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; slurry. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Sheriffs%20Department"&gt;Los Angeles Sheriffs Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also increased its presence in the Antelope Valley by bringing in response teams from stations outside the AV. This afternoon, the deployment has been scaled back to three teams as the fire stabilizes and further evacuation orders become unlikely.

Three firefighters have been injured battling the fire, although all injuries are minor. One sheriff deputy was also hospitalized for smoke inhalation but has since been released.

&lt;a href="Chelsea%20Clinton"&gt;Chelsea Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, the only daughter of former &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20president"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and current &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Rodham Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, wed long-time boyfriend and investment banker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarc%20Mezvinsky"&gt;Marc Mezvinsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Saturday evening. The ceremony occurred in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARhinebeck%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Rhinebeck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; amidst a flurry of secrecy and speculation surrounding the event.

Not much was known about the wedding, and those involved in the event did not say anything to the media. An estimated 500 guests were at the ceremony, which took place at Astor Courts, a large &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeaux%20Arts"&gt;Beaux Arts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; estate built for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Jacob%20Astor%20IV"&gt;John Jacob Astor IV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over 100 years ago. The secluded mansion is situated on 50 acres (20.2 hectares) of land in the small town of Rhinebeck. A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ano-fly%20zone"&gt;no-fly zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was established over the estate.

The guest list was the subject of much speculation, but notable figures &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOprah%20Winfrey"&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Steven%20Spielberg"&gt;Steven Spielberg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Major"&gt;John Major&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reportedly did not attend the festivities. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMadeleine%20Albright"&gt;Madeleine Albright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bing"&gt;Steve Bing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Buffet"&gt;Warren Buffet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKobe%20Bryant"&gt;Kobe Bryant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were rumored to have been seen at the wedding.

The marriage ceremony was led by Rabbi James Ponet and the Reverend William Shillady. Mezvinsky, who is &lt;a href="Judaism"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt;, wore a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atallit"&gt;tallit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (prayer shawl) and a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ayarmulke"&gt;yarmulke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Clinton is a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMethodist"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A Clinton family friend read the poem "The Life That I Have", by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeo%20Marks"&gt;Leo Marks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Chelsea Clinton wore a strapless dress designed by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVera%20Wang"&gt;Vera Wang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . She had been spotted by ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWomen%27s%20Wear%20Daily"&gt;Women's Wear Daily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ at Wang's New York showroom earlier last week, and Wang was reportedly seen in Rhinebeck as well.

The town of Rhinebeck was the subject of much public interest on Saturday. Photographers, journalists, and ordinary citizens lined the streets to get a peek at the celebrities attending the wedding. Many stores had signs saying something similar to "Congratulations Marc &amp; Chelsea." Residents temporarily displaced by the wedding were even given bottles of wine for the inconvenience.

30-year-old Chelsea Clinton and 32-year-old Marc Mezvinsky first met in &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; while teenagers, and both later attended &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Now living in New York, Mezvinsky works at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AG3%20Capital"&gt;G3 Capital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as an investment banker, while Clinton recently earned her master's degree in public health at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Mezvinsky is the son of the now-divorced &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarjorie%20Margolies-Mezvinsky"&gt;Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Mezvinsky"&gt;Ed Mezvinsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , friends of the Clinton family.

Although thought to cost several million dollars, a Clinton family friend claimed that the event would carry a price tag of less than &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 1 million.

Two games of round 16 of the &lt;a href="Gippsland%20Football%20League"&gt;Gippsland Football League&lt;/a&gt; split the round over the weekend. On Saturday, Sale defeated Moe by 75 points, while on Sunday, Warragul lost to Drouin.

The split round will be completed next weekend with Leongatha traveling to Maffra and Morwell travelling to Wonthaggi. Traralgon has the bye.

The preliminary ladder has, in order, Maffra on top followed by Traralgon, Morwell, Drouin and Leongatha in the the top five. Moe and Sale need to win both of their remaining games and have other results go their way to make the finals. Wonthaggi and Warragul cannot make the finals.

The Gippsland Football League, officially the Gippsland League, is the only major &lt;a href="Australian%20rules%20football"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; competition in the rural region east from &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; border, according to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Country%20Football%20League"&gt;Victorian Country Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Scores are quoted as ♡❤goals-behinds (total)♡❤.

<h2>Sale defeat Moe</h2>
A nine-goal second quarter lead to a 75 point win for Sale at home over Moe.

Sale kicked eight points clear at the end of the first quarter before extending the lead to 51 at half time. A four-goal third quarter from both the hosts and Moe saw Sale's lead increase by only 2 points.

Sale kicked five goals and six behinds to Moe's two goals and two behinds in the final quarter to run out winners, 23-20 (153) to 12-11 (83).

<h2>Drouin v Warragul</h2>
Drouin held Warragul goalless as they ran out winners by 90 points. Warragul kicked their lowest score since 1909. Drouin, however, couldn't replicate their highest winning margin of 92 points set in 1930.

Warragul remain winless and will end the season in last place. Drouin will move up to third pending the completion of the split round.

Jurors in the &lt;a href="Rod%20Blagojevich"&gt;Rod Blagojevich&lt;/a&gt; corruption trial began their fifth day of deliberations this morning, having sent no notes to the judge at all yesterday. Notes they sent out last week, however, suggest that the discussions could take much longer.
The jury has sent two notes to US District Judge James B. Zagel since deliberations began last Wednesday. The first came on Thursday, when the jury requested a transcript of one of the prosecution's closing arguements. Zagel refused, saying that closing arguments are not evidence.

The second note came on Friday, when the foreman wrote "Is it permissible to obtain the transcript of the testimony? It would be helpful." Zagel interpreted the request as saying that the jury wanted transcripts of the testimony of every single witness in the trial. Zagel again declined the request because it was not practical to do so; about 30 witnesses testified in this case, and the transcripts have not yet been prepared. Zagel instead offered to consider requests for transcripts of testimony from "specific identified witnesses", but said that he would warn the jury that such requests could take some time to fulfill. 

Defense attorney Sheldon Sorosky objected to this plan, saying that "the government will have the benefit of presenting its case a whole second time." Zagel said in reply that he would still consider each of the jury's requests individually.

Such a request, however, suggests that the jury intends to conduct a lengthy review of the case. The six male and six female jurors continued their deliberations on Monday without sending any further notes to the judge. 

Blagojevich is charged with trying to sell the U.S. Senate seat that had been vacated by &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; when he won the &lt;a href="2008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election"&gt;2008 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, among other crimes. Robert Blagojevich, Rod's brother and co-defendant in the case, testified that Rod was trying to manipulate the political situation to his advantage, but emphasized that he engaged in nothing illegal. According to some sources, Blagojevich was interested in leading the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

According to new polls, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama's&lt;/a&gt; approval ratings have dropped across the board. According to a new ♡❤&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤/&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGallup"&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; poll, Americans are losing faith in the president's plan in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, where wars have been going on for years and casualties have risen. 43% of those polled say that it was a mistake for Obama's predecessor &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; to go to war after terrorists &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%20attacks"&gt;crashed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; planes into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; buildings in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; on September 11, 2001. Barely a third of respondents favoured Obama's strategy in the two &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; wars. In another Gallup poll, just 36% of poll respondents supported the way Obama was handling Afghanistan, a sharp decline from 48% in February.

The drop in support for the ongoing wars (though the one in Iraq is slated to end soon) has been hastened by rising casualties and the &lt;a href="Wikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Wikileaks%20release%20Afghan%20%26quot%3Bwar%20logs%26quot%3B%20in%20co-operation%20with%20mainstream%20media"&gt;leak of over 90,000 confidential military documents&lt;/a&gt; that paint a grim picture of the war in Afghanistan. About 76,000 of these have been released to the public. However, two-thirds of the people polled in the USA Today/Gallup Poll said it was wrong for the whistle-blower website to publish the documents, which have often been compared to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APentagon%20Papers"&gt;Pentagon Papers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Also, 57% of respondents said they want a timetable for removing American troops, and two-thirds of those 57% said they want a gradual withdrawl. 

Obama's personal approval rating also hit a new low in the poll. Just 41% of poll respondents approved of Obama's handling of his job, while 53% disapproved. The above poll was conducted Tuesday through Sunday, and a Gallup poll on Monday had him at 45% approval. A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARasmussen%20Reports"&gt;Rasmussen Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; poll has Obama's July approval rating at 46%, while 54% disapprove. 

Also, according to another poll, Obama's quarterly job approval average has hit an administration low. The quarterly rating, which is compiled of Gallup polls averaged out each quarter, has sunk every quarter Obama has been in office, but at different rates. In his sixth quarter of office, Obama averaged 47.3% approval, which varied from 52% in a poll conducted in mid-May to just 44% in another one conducted in mid-July. The biggest quarterly drop that Obama had was from Q2 to Q3 of his presidency, when health-care reform ran into trouble. Obama's approval rating declined from 62% to 52.9% during that period. Since then, the approval slide has plateaued, with declines of 2% of average from Q4-Q6.

A &lt;a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida"&gt;Gainesville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; church named the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADove%20World%20Outreach%20Center"&gt;Dove World Outreach Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has drawn international attention to itself with its planned book burning of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQur%27an"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The church urges people to send them copies of the book for burning at a bonfire event to be held on church property this coming September 11. The date marks the ninth anniversary of the 2001 &lt;a href="September%2011%20attacks"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt; on the United States. The church's motive is an act "in remembrance of the fallen victims of 9/11 and to stand against the evil of Islam," according to its page wall on &lt;a href="Facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The church is receiving condemnation as the book of Qur'an, often spelled Koran in Western usage, is the central religious text of &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;.

A group of religious leaders in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, represented by Catholic, Confucian, Hindu, Muslim, and Protestant persuasions, publicly condemned the church leaders, Pastors Terry and Sylvia Jones. Describing the plan as an "anarchist action," they seek to meet with the United States ambassador in hopes of putting an end to an action that "puts other religions in contempt" of the event.

A local news outlet in Gainesville, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Independent%20Florida%20Alligator"&gt;The Independent Florida Alligator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , published an August 3 letter to the editor written by &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; resident Kirsten Tedesco. The author, who identifies as Christian, wrote of Dove World church, "Your message of hate and bigotry is another twisting of [a Christian] faith based on love and compassion for all people."

Two days later, the Alligator news staff published an editorial pointing out that city mayor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Lowe"&gt;Craig Lowe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "hasn’t wasted any time coming out in protest of [the church's] plans." Noting the press coverage this has already generated, the editorial urged that the event be ignored. Describing the church group as people who have gone beyond being a "fringe" element, the editorial closed by suggesting, "… but we do have high hopes that a lack of attention will make them move to a place that feeds the fire – hopefully somewhere far away from Gainesville."

In a comment to the editorial, made by a reader going by the screen name Abaddon, the user's post wryly observes, "I suppose I get no points for pointing out the irony in publishing an article in a newspaper about how something 'deserves no attention', but there it is anyway." 

The church, which is non-denominational, is promoting the event on its official website and other online media. A church pastor, Wayne Sapp, has posted two videos on &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; titled, ♡❤International Burn a Koran Day♡❤. The first was posted two weeks ago. Part 2 of the video came a week later. The first video has been labeled by the YouTube community as, "... being potentially offensive or inappropriate." In the Part 2 video, Sapp says the church has received "several hundred emails" and "some comments [in the YouTube community]" to which the second video is in response. In doing so, Sapp ridicules all but one of the persons he responds to by the deliberate and incorrect pronunciation of the screen names of those to whom the rebuttal is directed.

On Facebook, so far the church has at current count nearly 3,600 People [who] Like This. On that forum, the church invites other religious groups to join in standing "against the evil of Islam. Islam is of the devil!"

"♡❤Islam is of the devil♡❤" is the title of a book written by senior pastor of the church Terry Jones. "Islam and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASharia%20law"&gt;Sharia law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was responsible for 9/11, we will burn Qur'ans because we think it's time for Christians, for churches, for politicians to stand up and say no; Islam and Sharia law is not welcome in the U.S." he said. The book title is being marketed as a slogan that appears on hats, shirts, and coffee mugs that can be purchased at a dot.com website with an address bearing the book's title. 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20Evangelicals"&gt;National Association of Evangelicals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the United States has already issued a statement urging the church to cancel the event as this would offend and hurt the international Muslim community.

<h1>Waters on trial for House ethics charges</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Waters%20on%20trial%20for%20House%20ethics%20charges&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; ethics panel has charged Representative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaxine%20Waters"&gt;Maxine Waters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;) with violating unspecified ethics rules, making her the second Democrat in a week to be charged with ethical violations.

Since 2008, the Office of Congressional Ethics has investigated Waters for requesting a meeting with former Secretary of the Treasury &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Paulson"&gt;Henry Paulson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Although the meeting was supposed to be about minority-owned banks, the actual conversation focused on one bank, OneUnited. Water's husband, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASidney%20Williams"&gt;Sidney Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had been a stock-holder and board member in the bank at the time.

OneUnited later received &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 12 million in bailout funds, and an unnamed member of Congress said that Waters had been unsure how to deal with OneUnited, which had been near collapse, "because Sidney's been on the board." 

A statement from the panel does not disclose when it will state the charges or say how many there are.

Waters released a statement stating "I have not violated any House rules. Therefore, I simply will not be forced to admit to something I did not do and instead have chosen to respond to charges made by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in a public hearing."

She also vowed to take the case to a public trial, and also said "The record will clearly show that in advocating on behalf of minority banks neither my office nor I benefited in any way, engaged in improper action or influenced anyone."

Waters has represented her district in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Los%20Angeles"&gt;South Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; for 20 years.

This incident comes just five days after another House Democrat, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Rangel"&gt;Charlie Rangel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; was charged with thirteen ethics violations. Rangel's charges range from tax evasion to donations he solicited for an education center bearing his name.

Today is Monday, August 02, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>

Over the weekend, 

<h3>&lt;a href="14%2C000-acre%20Southern%20California%20%27Crown%20Fire%27%20at%2082%25%20containment%2C%20evacuation%20orders%20lifted"&gt;14,000-acre Southern California 'Crown Fire' at 82% containment, evacuation orders lifted&lt;/a&gt; (0:36)</h3>

the Crown Fire, which has burned through 13,980 acres in the High Desert of Southern California since Thursday, was, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department at 82% containment Saturday evening.

On Friday, over 2,000 residents of Leona Valley, Ana Verde, and Rancho Vista were given mandatory evacuation orders as the sky was blanketed with thick orange pyrocumulus clouds and falling ash, making the air hard to breathe. However, by late Friday night, all existing evacuation orders were lifted and 500 residents of Rancho Vista were told to "shelter in place" until further notice. Yet despite the absence of mandatory evacuation orders, over 2,000 houses, 60 commercial buildings, and 100 outbuildings are still under threat.

At the height of the fire, 1,700 firefighters from all over California were battling the flames, although as of 12:00 pm Saturday afternoon, it has been reduced to around 1,350 personnel. Three firefighters have been injured battling the fire, although all injuries are minor. One sheriff deputy was also hospitalized for smoke inhalation but has since been released. The fire has so far destroyed one house and three mobile homes, damaging the roof of another and burning car garages, horse stables, and other outbuildings.

As dry conditions threaten the residents of California, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Deadly%20flooding%20in%20Pakistan%20kills%20hundreds"&gt;Deadly flooding in Pakistan kills hundreds&lt;/a&gt; (1:59)</h3>

The worst flooding in 80 years in Pakistan has left at least 800 people dead, and affected over a million more. The floods were caused by heavy monsoon rains and have destroyed homes in the country, especially in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department said that twelve inches of rain fell over a 36 hour period. Sohail Rahman, reporting for Al Jazeera from Pakistan's capital of Islamabad, said that Islamabad experienced a "deluge of water" flowing south from Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. He went on to say that "floods have really affected the infrastructure in and around the province. The people in the affected areas were quite critical in the first 24 hours, saying that the authorities were not doing enough."

Rescue operations have been hampered by the weather; while seventeen helicopters are operating, with more to come, they cannot operate in all areas due to the weather, and just 48 boats are available for use by rescue crews.

Last Wednesday, the bad weather was also to blame for a passenger plane crash which killed all 152 on board. Four days later, on Saturday,

<h3>&lt;a href="%27Black%20box%27%20found%20near%20crash%20site%20of%20Airblue%20flight"&gt;'Black box' found near crash site of Airblue flight&lt;/a&gt; (3:02)</h3>

investigators found the black box and flight data recorder of Airblue Flight 202 that crashed into the Margalla Hills of Pakistan's capital city. 

Junaid Amin, the head of Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, told CNN that the recorders will be sent to either Germany or France, which have the necessary resources to analyze the data. Such an investigation could take months to complete, however.

The black box records communication data and technical information such as speed and altitude, as well as conversations in the airplane cockpit. It could thus help investigators determine why the plane crashed.

Another air disaster, this time in Alaska, took place on Sunday when

<h3>&lt;a href="Cargo%20plane%20crashes%20in%20Alaska%27s%20Denali%20Park%2C%20sparks%20wildfire"&gt;Cargo plane crashes in Alaska's Denali Park, sparks wildfire&lt;/a&gt; (3:48)</h3>

a cargo plane crashed into a mountain in Alaska's Denali National Park, killing around three people and sparking a small wildfire after the aircraft disintegrated and burst into flames. According to the National Park Service, the plane crashed into the southern slope of Mount Healy, and the crash was just 200 yards away from Denali's only road.

Though it is estimated that three people died in the crash, it has been hard to determine exactly how many died as, according to park spokeswoman Kris Fister, "the plane pretty much disintegrated,". The explosion from the crash sparked a small wildfire that firefighters contained within two acres (one hectare.)

Though George Clare, a man from Las Vegas who witnessed the crash, thought the plane looked like a military aircraft, US military officials have stated that none of their planes were involved. Clare has said that the plane was "... a military khaki green kind of color. It was propellor-driven. It was a fixed wing aircraft and it had kind of a flat underbelly."

Jeff Kowalczyk, an EMT hiking through the 6,075,107 acre park with his wife, a nurse, said that he saw the plane positioned almost upside-down as it crashed. The crash was only a few hundred yards from where he was watching, and he also said "the whole experience was really surreal."

The crash came just four days after another major airplane crash that happened in the vicinity, when a military cargo plane crashed a minute after taking off at the Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage. The crash killed four people onboard who were training for an airshow.

<h3>&lt;a href="After%20100%20days%2C%20Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill%20still%20threatens%20Gulf%20coast"&gt;After 100 days, Deepwater Horizon oil spill still threatens Gulf coast&lt;/a&gt; (6:06)</h3>

Last Wednesday marked the 100th day since the beginning of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and although the leaking well was recently capped, the estimated three million or more barrels of oil already in the Gulf of Mexico are still causing trouble for many residents of the Gulf coast.

There are still many unanswered questions about the long-term impact of the spill, including how it has affected the environment and natural habitats of the Gulf as well as whether residents of the area will be able to return to their jobs and livelihoods now that the leak has been capped. US government officials say that, even after the oil well is permanently sealed, workers will still have a lot to do, including the removal of around 20 million feet of containment boom. "I would characterize this as the first 100 days. There's a lot of work in front of us," said Rear Admiral Paul Zukunft of the US Coast Guard.

Authorities will use submarines to assess damage underwater, while teams on the ground assess the shoreline. While removing oil from beaches is expected to be fairly straightforward, cleaning the marshlands will be particularly difficult, as boats are needed to maneuver through small channels and workers are unable to stand on solid ground. At least 638 miles (1,027 kilometres) of the Gulf coast have been hit by the oil.

The government is focusing on both cleaning sensitive coastal regions and looking for underwater oil plumes, but is also probing into what may have been the largest accidental oil spill. The US Justice Department, as well as Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, are all investigating what contributed to the disaster. The Washington Post reported one team is looking into whether a close relationship between BP and government regulators played a role in the spill. The Post also said that Deepwater Horizon operator Transocean as well as oil services group Halliburton were being investigated.

BP officials say that they will try to perform the "static kill" process on Monday, a process which involves pumping a thick mixture of mud and cement down into the cap currently stopping the leak. At the end of next week, one of two relief wells currently being drilled should reach the leaking well, and officials will then know if the static kill has worked. It is hoped that this "bottom kill" operation will be able to permanently seal the damaged well.

Even though BP is close to sealing the oil reservoir, it still faces legal battles, economic struggles, and internal changes. On Tuesday, BP announced Tony Hayward would step down from his position as the company's chief executive. His replacement, American Bob Dudley, will be the first non-British CEO of the company.

On Thursday, lawyers met at a Boise, Idaho hearing to determine how around 200 various lawsuits against BP will play out. Depending on whether the suits can be consolidated, BP could be facing years of legal disputes. BP, Transocean, and Halliburton had already blamed each other for the disaster during a May hearing before the US Senate. Federal regulatory officials were criticized for allegedly taking bribes and not thoroughly inspecting the oil rig.

The company also reported a quarterly loss of US$16.9 billion and said it has allocated US$32.2 billion to pay for the spill. BP has a US$20 billion fund to help make up for the massive losses of the Gulf fishing, oil, and tourism industries and will pay damages for each of the millions of barrels of oil lost in the disaster.

BP says that it is the "responsible party" for cleaning up the spill because it owned the leaking well and had leased the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, but claims that it is not responsible for the entire spill.

The overall economic picture for the United Sates was just as gloomy as

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20Q2%20economic%20growth%20slows%20to%202.4%25"&gt;US Q2 economic growth slows to 2.4%&lt;/a&gt; (9:48)</h3>

the US government announced on Friday that economic growth in the US has slowed to 2.4% in the second quarter as the economy struggles with high unemployment and the aftermath of the worst recession since the 1930's.

This slower rate compares with a newly revised number of 3.7% for Q1, and 5% in Q4 of last year. Economists had been expecting economic growth of 2.5% for Q2.

For this year's second quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis' report on the economy carried more disappointing news. Consumer spending growth in the North American country slowed from 1.99% in Q1 to just 1.6%. Also, businesses and retailers stocked shelves at a slower pace, and America's trade deficit, the largest in the world, widened as the country imported more goods.

The US Commerce Department also revised some of their estimated economic growth statistics. The Department revised their estimate of Q1 economic growth from 2.7% to 3.7%, and also revised their estimate of the severity of the 2007–2009 recession from a real-GDP contraction of 2.5% to an new figure of 2.8%. 

There were some economic bright spots in Q2. State and local governments, who have been cutting spending for months, spent 1.3% more than in Q1. Residential investment grew 27.9% from -12.3% in Q1. Nonresidential building investment rose for the first time in two years, and disposable personal incomes rose 4.4%, though it appears that people are not spending it.

One of US President Obama's plans to improve the US economy has been a focus on alternative energy and so on Friday, 

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20President%20Barack%20Obama%20test%20drives%20Chevy%20Volt%20in%20Michigan"&gt;US President Barack Obama test drives Chevy Volt in Michigan&lt;/a&gt; (11:39)</h3>

the President test drove a Chevrolet Volt during a visit to a General Motors plant in Michigan. The visit was part of a larger trip to the Detroit area to discuss the progress of Obama's bailout of the auto industry earlier in his administration.

As the president toured the factory, managers invited him to test drive the Volt, which will soon be manufactured there. After consulting reluctant top aides and Secret Service personnel, Obama accepted. "I hope it has an air bag," said press secretary Robert Gibbs. Obama hopped into the car with assembly manager Teri Quigley, buckled his seat belt, and crept forward about ten feet (three meters). As he got out he remarked that the ride was "pretty smooth".

Obama visited the Detroit area to defend his controversial decision to invest US$50 billion in the failing auto industry last year. "It's estimated we would have lost another million jobs had we not stepped in," said Obama. Instead, job growth totaled 50,000 workers this year, the largest since 1999. Obama warns, though, that recovery is not yet complete.

This was the second time Obama drove a car since early 2007, when as a presidential candidate he requested Secret Service protection. The first was a Dodge Charger, which he drove a few months ago at a Secret Service training facility.

NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Greg Biffle his first win of the season after leading thirty laps during the 2010 Sunoco Red Cross Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania. The victory kept him in the top twelve points position, but he was still 428 points behind Kevin Harvick.

This was his fifteenth career victory; his previous win came sixty-four races ago in 2008 at Dover International Speedway.

Tony Stewart finished in the second position, ahead of Carl Edwards and Kevin Harvick in third and fourth, respectively. Denny Hamlin, Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin, Jeff Burton, Martin Truex, Jr., and Jimmie Johnson rounded out the top ten positions. The race had a total of five cautions and twenty-three lead changes among nine different drivers. Jimmie Johnson led the most laps by leading ninety-six.

In the point standings, Harvick and Gordon remained in the first and second position, and Hamlin maintained the third position as Johnson kept fourth. Burton, Kyle Busch, Kurt Busch, and Stewart followed in the top eight points positions. Matt Kenseth fell to the ninth position, as Edwards remained in tenth. Greg Biffle and Clint Bowyer rounded out the top twelve, and are currently in the Chase.

<h3>&lt;a href="UK%20military%20deaths%20in%20Afghanistan%20reach%20327"&gt;UK military deaths in Afghanistan reach 327&lt;/a&gt; (15:33)</h3>

On Monday, the Ministry of Defence announced that two UK troops died in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, as the result of two isolated occurrences yesterday. Small arms fire killed one soldier, who came from the 1st Battalion Scots Guards in the Lashkargah District.

The other individual, who was working as a Royal Marine within 40 Commando, was in the Sangin District when the explosion of an improvised explosive device (IED) occurred. The families of the deceased have now been notified.

Including these new deaths, the total number of UK military deaths in Afghanistan has rose to 327. The UK has been active in Afghanistan since October 2001. Task Force Helmand spokesman Lieutenant Colonel David Southall spoke of the soldier's "selfless courage and sacrifice". He commented: "Commanding his men, he was killed in action by small arms fire whilst providing security to the Afghan people." Southall also stated about the Marine: "He gave his life whilst seeking to improve the lives of ordinary Afghans. His sacrifice will not be forgotten."

<h3>&lt;a href="Chelsea%20Clinton%20marries%20Marc%20Mezvinsky%20in%20Rhinebeck%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Chelsea Clinton marries Marc Mezvinsky in Rhinebeck, New York&lt;/a&gt; (16:35)</h3>

Chelsea Clinton, the only daughter of former US president William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton and current US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, wed long-time boyfriend and investment banker Marc Mezvinsky on Saturday evening. The ceremony occurred in Rhinebeck, New York amidst a flurry of secrecy and speculation surrounding the event.

Not much was known about the wedding, and those involved in the event did not say anything to the media. An estimated 500 guests were at the ceremony, which took place at Astor Courts, a large Beaux Arts estate built for John Jacob Astor IV over 100 years ago. The secluded mansion is situated on 50 acres (20.2 hectares) of land in the small town of Rhinebeck. A no-fly zone was established over the estate.

The guest list was the subject of much speculation, but notable figures Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and John Major reportedly did not attend the festivities. Madeleine Albright, Steve Bing, Warren Buffet, and Kobe Bryant were rumored to have been seen at the wedding.

The marriage ceremony was led by Rabbi James Ponet and the Reverend William Shillady. Mezvinsky, who is Jewish, wore a tallit (prayer shawl) and a yarmulke. Clinton is a Methodist. A Clinton family friend read the poem "The Life That I Have", by Leo Marks. Chelsea Clinton wore a strapless dress designed by Vera Wang. She had been spotted by Women's Wear Daily at Wang's New York showroom earlier last week, and Wang was reportedly seen in Rhinebeck as well.

The town of Rhinebeck was the subject of much public interest on Saturday. Photographers, journalists, and ordinary citizens lined the streets to get a peek at the celebrities attending the wedding. Many stores had signs saying something similar to "Congratulations Marc &amp; Chelsea." Residents temporarily displaced by the wedding were even given bottles of wine for the inconvenience.

30-year-old Chelsea Clinton and 32-year-old Marc Mezvinsky first met in Washington, D.C. while teenagers, and both later attended Stanford University. Now living in New York, Mezvinsky works at G3 Capital as an investment banker, while Clinton recently earned her master's degree in public health at Columbia University. Mezvinsky is the son of the now-divorced Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Ed Mezvinsky, friends of the Clinton family.

Although thought to cost several million dollars, a Clinton family friend claimed that the event would carry a price tag of less than US$1 million.

The opening to a compilation titled "Where I'm Calling From" bears a quote written by Milan Kundera from his novel "The Unbearable Lightness of Being". The quote reads "We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come." In other words, things are clear in retrospect, but not as they are happening.

It is no mistake then that this quote opens the beginning to a collection of short stories by Rayomd Carver, who died on this day in history in 1988. Carver, who was only 50 when he died, described himself as "inclined toward brevity and intensity"; his writing focused on the blue-collar experience, and was clearly reflective of his own life; a life of alcoholism and recovery and most importantly, the theme of communication - or, more accurately, the inability and struggle to communicate with ourselves and each other.

Carver came from humble beginnings. He was born in Clatskanie, Oregon, a mill town along the Columbia River, and grew up in Yakima, Washington. His father, a skilled sawmill worker from Arkansas, was a fisherman and a heavy drinker and his mother worked on and off as a waitress and retail clerk.

As a child, he busied himself reading Mickey Spillane crime novels and, being an active hunter and fisherman, sports and outdoor recreation magazines. After high school, at the age of 19 in June 1957, he worked in the sawmill with his father and married Maryann Burk, who was 16 at the time. Their daughter, Christine La Rae, was born in December the same year.

When Carver was 20, he supported his family by working as a janitor, sawmill laborer, delivery man, and library assistant while Maryann worked as a waitress, salesperson, administrative assistant, and high school English teacher. 

The family then moved to California where Maryann's mother lived and Carver soon became interested in writing. While attending a creative-writing course, he met the novelist John Gardner who would become his mentor and ultimately had a major influence on Carver's life and career. 

By 1963, after attending Chico State University and Humboldt State College, Carver had earned his BA and began to publish and edit in the University literary magazine Toyon. In 1968, while working as a night custodian he published his first book of poetry titled Near Klamath with the guidance of poet Dennis Schmitz. For three years he held a job as a textbook editor for Science Research Associates but was fired in 1970 for his inappropriate writing style, however at this piont his writing career began to take off.

Carver's writing style and themes are often identified with Ernest Hemingway and Anton Chekhov with minimalism being generally seen as one of the hallmarks of Carver's work. This style grew from Gardner's advice for Carver to use fifteen words instead of twenty-five and more dramatically, when Carver was being edited by the famed Esquire magazine editor Gordon Lish to use five in place of fifteen. However, objecting to the "surgical amputation and transplantation" of Lish's heavy editing, Carver eventually broke with him.

His style has also been described as Dirty realism, which connected him with a group of writers in the 1970s and 1980s that included Richard Ford, Tobias Wolff -- two writers Carver was closely acquainted with -- as well as Ann Beattie and Jayne Anne Phillips. With the exception of Beattie, who wrote about upper-middle class people, these were writers who focused on sadness and loss in the everyday lives of ordinary people -- often lower-middle class or isolated and marginalized people -- who represent Henry David Thoreau's idea of living lives of "quiet desperation."

Carver's focus on short stories and poems was "that the story [or poem] can be written and read in one sitting." This was not simply a preference but, particularly at the beginning of his career, a practical consideration as he juggled writing with work and family. 

During his years of working different jobs, rearing children, and trying to write, Carver started to drink heavily. By his own admission, eventually he more or less gave up writing and took to full-time drinking. In the fall semester of 1973, Carver was a teacher in the Iowa Writers' Workshop with John Cheever, but Carver stated that they did less teaching than drinking and almost no writing. The next year, after leaving Iowa City, Cheever went to a treatment center to attempt to overcome his alcoholism, but Carver continued drinking for three years. After being hospitalized three times (between June 1976 and February or March 1977), Carver began his 'second life' and stopped drinking on June 2, 1977, with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous.

By 1984, Carver was nominated for his second National Book Award for his collection of short stories titled Cathedral, a story Carver saw as a watershed in his career in its shift towards a more optimistic and confidently poetic style. 

It is within this collection that Carver's theme of communication and human connectedness is most apparent. In the story titled "A Small, Good Thing", Carver writes about a family who have just lost their child after being hit by a car in a minor accident. In the story, he writes "[Ann]", the boy's mother, "gazed out into the parking lot and then turned around and looked back at the front of the hospital. She began shaking her head. "No, no," she said. "I can't leave him here, no." She heard herself say that and though how unfair it was that the only words that came out were the sort of words used on TV shows where people were stunned by violent or sudden deaths. She wanted her words to be her own."

In Cathedral, "A Small, Good Thing" is printed near the halfway point of the collection, yet the final story, the titular "Cathedral", resolves this inability for characters to communicate. In the story, the main character is asked to draw a cathedral for an old blind man who has no concept of a cathedral, a task he is reluctant to do, but in the process of moving the pen across the paper as the old, blind man holds onto the main characters pen hand, he experiences a brief moment of revelation which he can only describe as "It's really something". 

Much like the main character, Carver had experienced a real breakthrough, and by this point he was considered one of the major figures in American literature. However, in 1988, only 6 weeks after marrying his second wife, Tess Gallagher, herself a writer, he died of lung cancer at only 50 years old. 

Yet Carver believed he would have died of alcoholism at the age of 40 if he hadn't found a way to stop drinking. When he knew the cancer would kill him, he wrote a poem about that bonus of 10 years, called "Gravy."

So, while me may not know how to make sense of our lives as we live them, we can at least appreciate them in the short time we all have.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (FBI) has asked the &lt;a href="Wikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (WMF), host of ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ and its sister projects, to take down its image of the FBI seal from its websites. However, the WMF declined, saying that FBI lawyers had misinterpreted the relevant federal law.
In a letter dated July 22, David C. Larson, Deputy General Counsel of the FBI demanded that the WMF remove the seal from its websites within fourteen days, claiming that "it facilitates both deliberate and unwitting violations of these restrictions by Wikipedia users." 
Larson cited 18 U.S.C. 701, which states: "Whoever manufactures, sells, or possesses any badge, identification card, or other insignia, of the design prescribed by the head of any department or agency of the United States for use by any officer or employee thereof, or any colorable imitation thereof, or photographs, prints, or in any other manner makes or executes any engraving, photograph, print, or impression in the likeness of any such badge, identification card, or other insignia, or any colorable imitation thereof, except as authorized under regulations made pursuant to law, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both."

Larson went on to say that use of the FBI seal may be authorized only by the director of the FBI; the FBI director has not given such permission to WMF. 

The WMF, represented by General Counsel &lt;a href="Mike%20Godwin"&gt;Mike Godwin&lt;/a&gt;, responded, saying in a letter dated July 30, that Larson's interpretation "is both idiosyncratic (made especially so by your strategic redaction of important language) and, more importantly, incorrect."

Godwin said that "while we appreciate your desire to revise the statute to reflect your expansive vision of it, the fact is that we must work with the actual language of the statute, not the aspirational version" Larson provided. According to the relevant case law, it "was intended to protect the public against the use of a recognizable assertion of authority with intent to deceive." 
Godwin asserted that the use of the FBI seal by the WMF and its projects do not fall under the purview of that law.

The websites of the Wikimedia Foundation are filled with user-generated text, pictures, and other materials, uploaded and curated by independent, often anonymous, volunteers, who change the websites minute by minute. The most well-known sites are the Wikipedias, encyclopedias with over 13 million articles in hundreds of languages. However, the foundation also hosts an image and media library, dictionaries, the ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ news websites, book websites and many other educational collaborations.

Cindy Cohn, legal director for the &lt;a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (where Godwin was once staff counsel), said that the WMF's constitutional right to free expression allows it to use the FBI seal. "I have to believe the FBI has better things to do than this," she said. The reason for the FBI's request is unknown, as the FBI seal is published on many other websites, including &lt;a href="Encyclopedia%20Britannica"&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/a&gt;.

Forecasters predict that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAurora%20%28astronomy%29"&gt;northern lights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could be visible to the naked eye late tonight and early tomorrow morning across &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , northern parts of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and possibly the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Solar storms caused a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACoronal%20mass%20ejection"&gt;large ejection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APlasma%20%28physics%29"&gt;plasma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the Sun's surface on Sunday, and the plasma is heading directly towards Earth. The plasma, a cloud of rapidly moving hydrogen gas atoms and subatomic particles, is expected to reach us late Tuesday. The plasma will interact with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEarth%27s%20magnetic%20field"&gt;Earth's magnetic field&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and atmosphere, which will cause northern lights, or ♡❤aurora borealis♡❤, to be visible much further south than is usual. Northern lights usually appear as green or red rivers of lights across the sky.

"It's the first major Earth-directed eruption in quite some time" said astronomer Leon Golub of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The eruption was detected by NASA's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASolar%20Dynamics%20Observatory"&gt;Solar Dynamics Observatory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which was launched in February 2010, and is currently orbiting the Earth. 

The Sun goes through approximately eleven-year long activity cycles, with the last maximum occurring in 2001. Sunday's eruption is a sign that the many years of inactivity is over, and the Sun is heading towards another maximum.

Today is Monday, August 02, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>

Over the weekend, 

<h3>&lt;a href="14%2C000-acre%20Southern%20California%20%27Crown%20Fire%27%20at%2082%25%20containment%2C%20evacuation%20orders%20lifted"&gt;14,000-acre Southern California 'Crown Fire' at 82% containment, evacuation orders lifted&lt;/a&gt; (0:36)</h3>

the Crown Fire, which has burned through 13,980 acres in the High Desert of Southern California since Thursday, was, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department at 82% containment Saturday evening.

On Friday, over 2,000 residents of Leona Valley, Ana Verde, and Rancho Vista were given mandatory evacuation orders as the sky was blanketed with thick orange pyrocumulus clouds and falling ash, making the air hard to breathe. However, by late Friday night, all existing evacuation orders were lifted and 500 residents of Rancho Vista were told to "shelter in place" until further notice. Yet despite the absence of mandatory evacuation orders, over 2,000 houses, 60 commercial buildings, and 100 outbuildings are still under threat.

At the height of the fire, 1,700 firefighters from all over California were battling the flames, although as of 12:00 pm Saturday afternoon, it has been reduced to around 1,350 personnel. Three firefighters have been injured battling the fire, although all injuries are minor. One sheriff deputy was also hospitalized for smoke inhalation but has since been released. The fire has so far destroyed one house and three mobile homes, damaging the roof of another and burning car garages, horse stables, and other outbuildings.

As dry conditions threaten the residents of California, 

<h3>&lt;a href="Deadly%20flooding%20in%20Pakistan%20kills%20hundreds"&gt;Deadly flooding in Pakistan kills hundreds&lt;/a&gt; (1:59)</h3>

The worst flooding in 80 years in Pakistan has left at least 800 people dead, and affected over a million more. The floods were caused by heavy monsoon rains and have destroyed homes in the country, especially in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department said that twelve inches of rain fell over a 36 hour period. Sohail Rahman, reporting for Al Jazeera from Pakistan's capital of Islamabad, said that Islamabad experienced a "deluge of water" flowing south from Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. He went on to say that "floods have really affected the infrastructure in and around the province. The people in the affected areas were quite critical in the first 24 hours, saying that the authorities were not doing enough."

Rescue operations have been hampered by the weather; while seventeen helicopters are operating, with more to come, they cannot operate in all areas due to the weather, and just 48 boats are available for use by rescue crews.

Last Wednesday, the bad weather was also to blame for a passenger plane crash which killed all 152 on board. Four days later, on Saturday,

<h3>&lt;a href="%27Black%20box%27%20found%20near%20crash%20site%20of%20Airblue%20flight"&gt;'Black box' found near crash site of Airblue flight&lt;/a&gt; (3:02)</h3>

investigators found the black box and flight data recorder of Airblue Flight 202 that crashed into the Margalla Hills of Pakistan's capital city. 

Junaid Amin, the head of Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, told CNN that the recorders will be sent to either Germany or France, which have the necessary resources to analyze the data. Such an investigation could take months to complete, however.

The black box records communication data and technical information such as speed and altitude, as well as conversations in the airplane cockpit. It could thus help investigators determine why the plane crashed.

Another air disaster, this time in Alaska, took place on Sunday when

<h3>&lt;a href="Cargo%20plane%20crashes%20in%20Alaska%27s%20Denali%20Park%2C%20sparks%20wildfire"&gt;Cargo plane crashes in Alaska's Denali Park, sparks wildfire&lt;/a&gt; (3:48)</h3>

a cargo plane crashed into a mountain in Alaska's Denali National Park, killing around three people and sparking a small wildfire after the aircraft disintegrated and burst into flames. According to the National Park Service, the plane crashed into the southern slope of Mount Healy, and the crash was just 200 yards away from Denali's only road.

Though it is estimated that three people died in the crash, it has been hard to determine exactly how many died as, according to park spokeswoman Kris Fister, "the plane pretty much disintegrated,". The explosion from the crash sparked a small wildfire that firefighters contained within two acres (one hectare.)

Though George Clare, a man from Las Vegas who witnessed the crash, thought the plane looked like a military aircraft, US military officials have stated that none of their planes were involved. Clare has said that the plane was "... a military khaki green kind of color. It was propellor-driven. It was a fixed wing aircraft and it had kind of a flat underbelly."

Jeff Kowalczyk, an EMT hiking through the 6,075,107 acre park with his wife, a nurse, said that he saw the plane positioned almost upside-down as it crashed. The crash was only a few hundred yards from where he was watching, and he also said "the whole experience was really surreal."

The crash came just four days after another major airplane crash that happened in the vicinity, when a military cargo plane crashed a minute after taking off at the Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage. The crash killed four people onboard who were training for an airshow.

<h3>&lt;a href="After%20100%20days%2C%20Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill%20still%20threatens%20Gulf%20coast"&gt;After 100 days, Deepwater Horizon oil spill still threatens Gulf coast&lt;/a&gt; (6:06)</h3>

Last Wednesday marked the 100th day since the beginning of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and although the leaking well was recently capped, the estimated three million or more barrels of oil already in the Gulf of Mexico are still causing trouble for many residents of the Gulf coast.

There are still many unanswered questions about the long-term impact of the spill, including how it has affected the environment and natural habitats of the Gulf as well as whether residents of the area will be able to return to their jobs and livelihoods now that the leak has been capped. US government officials say that, even after the oil well is permanently sealed, workers will still have a lot to do, including the removal of around 20 million feet of containment boom. "I would characterize this as the first 100 days. There's a lot of work in front of us," said Rear Admiral Paul Zukunft of the US Coast Guard.

Authorities will use submarines to assess damage underwater, while teams on the ground assess the shoreline. While removing oil from beaches is expected to be fairly straightforward, cleaning the marshlands will be particularly difficult, as boats are needed to maneuver through small channels and workers are unable to stand on solid ground. At least 638 miles (1,027 kilometres) of the Gulf coast have been hit by the oil.

The government is focusing on both cleaning sensitive coastal regions and looking for underwater oil plumes, but is also probing into what may have been the largest accidental oil spill. The US Justice Department, as well as Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, are all investigating what contributed to the disaster. The Washington Post reported one team is looking into whether a close relationship between BP and government regulators played a role in the spill. The Post also said that Deepwater Horizon operator Transocean as well as oil services group Halliburton were being investigated.

BP officials say that they will try to perform the "static kill" process on Monday, a process which involves pumping a thick mixture of mud and cement down into the cap currently stopping the leak. At the end of next week, one of two relief wells currently being drilled should reach the leaking well, and officials will then know if the static kill has worked. It is hoped that this "bottom kill" operation will be able to permanently seal the damaged well.

Even though BP is close to sealing the oil reservoir, it still faces legal battles, economic struggles, and internal changes. On Tuesday, BP announced Tony Hayward would step down from his position as the company's chief executive. His replacement, American Bob Dudley, will be the first non-British CEO of the company.

On Thursday, lawyers met at a Boise, Idaho hearing to determine how around 200 various lawsuits against BP will play out. Depending on whether the suits can be consolidated, BP could be facing years of legal disputes. BP, Transocean, and Halliburton had already blamed each other for the disaster during a May hearing before the US Senate. Federal regulatory officials were criticized for allegedly taking bribes and not thoroughly inspecting the oil rig.

The company also reported a quarterly loss of US$16.9 billion and said it has allocated US$32.2 billion to pay for the spill. BP has a US$20 billion fund to help make up for the massive losses of the Gulf fishing, oil, and tourism industries and will pay damages for each of the millions of barrels of oil lost in the disaster.

BP says that it is the "responsible party" for cleaning up the spill because it owned the leaking well and had leased the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, but claims that it is not responsible for the entire spill.

The overall economic picture for the United Sates was just as gloomy as

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20Q2%20economic%20growth%20slows%20to%202.4%25"&gt;US Q2 economic growth slows to 2.4%&lt;/a&gt; (9:48)</h3>

the US government announced on Friday that economic growth in the US has slowed to 2.4% in the second quarter as the economy struggles with high unemployment and the aftermath of the worst recession since the 1930's.

This slower rate compares with a newly revised number of 3.7% for Q1, and 5% in Q4 of last year. Economists had been expecting economic growth of 2.5% for Q2.

For this year's second quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis' report on the economy carried more disappointing news. Consumer spending growth in the North American country slowed from 1.99% in Q1 to just 1.6%. Also, businesses and retailers stocked shelves at a slower pace, and America's trade deficit, the largest in the world, widened as the country imported more goods.

The US Commerce Department also revised some of their estimated economic growth statistics. The Department revised their estimate of Q1 economic growth from 2.7% to 3.7%, and also revised their estimate of the severity of the 2007–2009 recession from a real-GDP contraction of 2.5% to an new figure of 2.8%. 

There were some economic bright spots in Q2. State and local governments, who have been cutting spending for months, spent 1.3% more than in Q1. Residential investment grew 27.9% from -12.3% in Q1. Nonresidential building investment rose for the first time in two years, and disposable personal incomes rose 4.4%, though it appears that people are not spending it.

One of US President Obama's plans to improve the US economy has been a focus on alternative energy and so on Friday, 

<h3>&lt;a href="US%20President%20Barack%20Obama%20test%20drives%20Chevy%20Volt%20in%20Michigan"&gt;US President Barack Obama test drives Chevy Volt in Michigan&lt;/a&gt; (11:39)</h3>

the President test drove a Chevrolet Volt during a visit to a General Motors plant in Michigan. The visit was part of a larger trip to the Detroit area to discuss the progress of Obama's bailout of the auto industry earlier in his administration.

As the president toured the factory, managers invited him to test drive the Volt, which will soon be manufactured there. After consulting reluctant top aides and Secret Service personnel, Obama accepted. "I hope it has an air bag," said press secretary Robert Gibbs. Obama hopped into the car with assembly manager Teri Quigley, buckled his seat belt, and crept forward about ten feet (three meters). As he got out he remarked that the ride was "pretty smooth".

Obama visited the Detroit area to defend his controversial decision to invest US$50 billion in the failing auto industry last year. "It's estimated we would have lost another million jobs had we not stepped in," said Obama. Instead, job growth totaled 50,000 workers this year, the largest since 1999. Obama warns, though, that recovery is not yet complete.

This was the second time Obama drove a car since early 2007, when as a presidential candidate he requested Secret Service protection. The first was a Dodge Charger, which he drove a few months ago at a Secret Service training facility.

As American consumers gear up to go green in their new automobiles, the US's leading professional stock car series stayed green despite threating rain clouds on Sunday giving

NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Greg Biffle his first win of the season after leading thirty laps during the 2010 Sunoco Red Cross Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania. The victory kept him in the top twelve points position, but he was still 428 points behind Kevin Harvick.

This was his fifteenth career victory; his previous win came sixty-four races ago in 2008 at Dover International Speedway.

Tony Stewart finished in the second position, ahead of Carl Edwards and Kevin Harvick in third and fourth, respectively. Denny Hamlin, Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin, Jeff Burton, Martin Truex, Jr., and Jimmie Johnson rounded out the top ten positions. The race had a total of five cautions and twenty-three lead changes among nine different drivers. Jimmie Johnson led the most laps by leading ninety-six.

In the point standings, Harvick and Gordon remained in the first and second position, and Hamlin maintained the third position as Johnson kept fourth. Burton, Kyle Busch, Kurt Busch, and Stewart followed in the top eight points positions. Matt Kenseth fell to the ninth position, as Edwards remained in tenth. Greg Biffle and Clint Bowyer rounded out the top twelve, and are currently in the Chase.

<h3>&lt;a href="UK%20military%20deaths%20in%20Afghanistan%20reach%20327"&gt;UK military deaths in Afghanistan reach 327&lt;/a&gt; (15:33)</h3>

On Monday, the Ministry of Defence announced that two UK troops died in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, as the result of two isolated occurrences yesterday. Small arms fire killed one soldier, who came from the 1st Battalion Scots Guards in the Lashkargah District.

The other individual, who was working as a Royal Marine within 40 Commando, was in the Sangin District when the explosion of an improvised explosive device (IED) occurred. The families of the deceased have now been notified.

Including these new deaths, the total number of UK military deaths in Afghanistan has rose to 327. The UK has been active in Afghanistan since October 2001. Task Force Helmand spokesman Lieutenant Colonel David Southall spoke of the soldier's "selfless courage and sacrifice". He commented: "Commanding his men, he was killed in action by small arms fire whilst providing security to the Afghan people." Southall also stated about the Marine: "He gave his life whilst seeking to improve the lives of ordinary Afghans. His sacrifice will not be forgotten."

<h3>&lt;a href="Chelsea%20Clinton%20marries%20Marc%20Mezvinsky%20in%20Rhinebeck%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Chelsea Clinton marries Marc Mezvinsky in Rhinebeck, New York&lt;/a&gt; (16:35)</h3>

Chelsea Clinton, the only daughter of former US president William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton and current US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, wed long-time boyfriend and investment banker Marc Mezvinsky on Saturday evening. The ceremony occurred in Rhinebeck, New York amidst a flurry of secrecy and speculation surrounding the event.

Not much was known about the wedding, and those involved in the event did not say anything to the media. An estimated 500 guests were at the ceremony, which took place at Astor Courts, a large Beaux Arts estate built for John Jacob Astor IV over 100 years ago. The secluded mansion is situated on 50 acres (20.2 hectares) of land in the small town of Rhinebeck. A no-fly zone was established over the estate.

The guest list was the subject of much speculation, but notable figures Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and John Major reportedly did not attend the festivities. Madeleine Albright, Steve Bing, Warren Buffet, and Kobe Bryant were rumored to have been seen at the wedding.

The marriage ceremony was led by Rabbi James Ponet and the Reverend William Shillady. Mezvinsky, who is Jewish, wore a tallit (prayer shawl) and a yarmulke. Clinton is a Methodist. A Clinton family friend read the poem "The Life That I Have", by Leo Marks. Chelsea Clinton wore a strapless dress designed by Vera Wang. She had been spotted by Women's Wear Daily at Wang's New York showroom earlier last week, and Wang was reportedly seen in Rhinebeck as well.

The town of Rhinebeck was the subject of much public interest on Saturday. Photographers, journalists, and ordinary citizens lined the streets to get a peek at the celebrities attending the wedding. Many stores had signs saying something similar to "Congratulations Marc &amp; Chelsea." Residents temporarily displaced by the wedding were even given bottles of wine for the inconvenience.

30-year-old Chelsea Clinton and 32-year-old Marc Mezvinsky first met in Washington, D.C. while teenagers, and both later attended Stanford University. Now living in New York, Mezvinsky works at G3 Capital as an investment banker, while Clinton recently earned her master's degree in public health at Columbia University. Mezvinsky is the son of the now-divorced Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Ed Mezvinsky, friends of the Clinton family.

Although thought to cost several million dollars, a Clinton family friend claimed that the event would carry a price tag of less than US$1 million.

The opening to a compilation titled "Where I'm Calling From" bears a quote written by Milan Kundera from his novel "The Unbearable Lightness of Being". The quote reads "We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come." In other words, things are clear in retrospect, but not as they are happening.

It is no mistake then that this quote opens the beginning to a collection of short stories by Rayomd Carver, who died on this day in history in 1988. Carver, who was only 50 when he died, described himself as "inclined toward brevity and intensity"; his writing focused on the blue-collar experience, and was clearly reflective of his own life; a life of alcoholism and recovery and most importantly, the theme of communication - or, more accurately, the inability and struggle to communicate with ourselves and each other.

Carver came from humble beginnings. He was born in Clatskanie, Oregon, a mill town along the Columbia River, and grew up in Yakima, Washington. His father, a skilled sawmill worker from Arkansas, was a fisherman and a heavy drinker and his mother worked on and off as a waitress and retail clerk.

As a child, he busied himself reading Mickey Spillane crime novels and, being an active hunter and fisherman, sports and outdoor recreation magazines. After high school, at the age of 19 in June 1957, he worked in the sawmill with his father and married Maryann Burk, who was 16 at the time. Their daughter, Christine La Rae, was born in December the same year.

When Carver was 20, he supported his family by working as a janitor, sawmill laborer, delivery man, and library assistant while Maryann worked as a waitress, salesperson, administrative assistant, and high school English teacher. 

The family then moved to California where Maryann's mother lived and Carver soon became interested in writing. While attending a creative-writing course, he met the novelist John Gardner who would become his mentor and ultimately had a major influence on Carver's life and career. 

By 1963, after attending Chico State University and Humboldt State College, Carver had earned his BA and began to publish and edit in the University literary magazine Toyon. In 1968, while working as a night custodian he published his first book of poetry titled Near Klamath with the guidance of poet Dennis Schmitz. For three years he held a job as a textbook editor for Science Research Associates but was fired in 1970 for his inappropriate writing style, however at this piont his writing career began to take off.

Carver's writing style and themes are often identified with Ernest Hemingway and Anton Chekhov with minimalism being generally seen as one of the hallmarks of Carver's work. This style grew from Gardner's advice for Carver to use fifteen words instead of twenty-five and more dramatically, when Carver was being edited by the famed Esquire magazine editor Gordon Lish to use five in place of fifteen. However, objecting to the "surgical amputation and transplantation" of Lish's heavy editing, Carver eventually broke with him.

His style has also been described as Dirty realism, which connected him with a group of writers in the 1970s and 1980s that included Richard Ford, Tobias Wolff -- two writers Carver was closely acquainted with -- as well as Ann Beattie and Jayne Anne Phillips. With the exception of Beattie, who wrote about upper-middle class people, these were writers who focused on sadness and loss in the everyday lives of ordinary people -- often lower-middle class or isolated and marginalized people -- who represent Henry David Thoreau's idea of living lives of "quiet desperation."

Carver's focus on short stories and poems was "that the story [or poem] can be written and read in one sitting." This was not simply a preference but, particularly at the beginning of his career, a practical consideration as he juggled writing with work and family. 

During his years of working different jobs, rearing children, and trying to write, Carver started to drink heavily. By his own admission, eventually he more or less gave up writing and took to full-time drinking. In the fall semester of 1973, Carver was a teacher in the Iowa Writers' Workshop with John Cheever, but Carver stated that they did less teaching than drinking and almost no writing. The next year, after leaving Iowa City, Cheever went to a treatment center to attempt to overcome his alcoholism, but Carver continued drinking for three years. After being hospitalized three times (between June 1976 and February or March 1977), Carver began his 'second life' and stopped drinking on June 2, 1977, with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous.

By 1984, Carver was nominated for his second National Book Award for his collection of short stories titled Cathedral, a story Carver saw as a watershed in his career in its shift towards a more optimistic and confidently poetic style. 

It is within this collection that Carver's theme of communication and human connectedness is most apparent. In the story titled "A Small, Good Thing", Carver writes about a family who have just lost their child after being hit by a car in a minor accident. In the story, he writes "[Ann]", the boy's mother, "gazed out into the parking lot and then turned around and looked back at the front of the hospital. She began shaking her head. "No, no," she said. "I can't leave him here, no." She heard herself say that and though how unfair it was that the only words that came out were the sort of words used on TV shows where people were stunned by violent or sudden deaths. She wanted her words to be her own."

In Cathedral, "A Small, Good Thing" is printed near the halfway point of the collection, yet the final story, the titular "Cathedral", resolves this inability for characters to communicate. In the story, the main character is asked to draw a cathedral for an old blind man who has no concept of a cathedral, a task he is reluctant to do, but in the process of moving the pen across the paper as the old, blind man holds onto the main characters pen hand, he experiences a brief moment of revelation which he can only describe as "It's really something". 

Much like the main character, Carver had experienced a real breakthrough, and by this point he was considered one of the major figures in American literature. However, in 1988, only 6 weeks after marrying his second wife, Tess Gallagher, herself a writer, he died of lung cancer at only 50 years old. 

Yet Carver believed he would have died of alcoholism at the age of 40 if he hadn't found a way to stop drinking. When he knew the cancer would kill him, he wrote a poem about that bonus of 10 years, called "Gravy."

So, while me may not know how to make sense of our lives as we live them, we can at least appreciate them in the short time we all have.

<h3>&lt;a href="Suicide%20bomber%20kills%20five%20Afghan%20children"&gt;Suicide bomber kills five Afghan children&lt;/a&gt; (0:42)</h3>

Five children were killed by a suicide car bomb in the Kandahar province in southern Afghanistan on Monday. Officials say the suicide bomber was trying to attack the governor of the Dand district, Ahmadullah Nazak. 

Nazak, who was unharmed, later recalled "I dropped down. Then I heard a second explosion. It hit our car, but it didn't injure me".

There have not been any claims of responsibility for this bombing. Assassinations and attempts have become more common this year in Kandahar, and between January and April, at least 27 government officials or foreign contractors have been killed.

In other areas of Afghanistan there have been similar incidents. A blast in Nangarhar province hit the car of a senior adviser to President Hamid Karzai. Six people, including Wahidullah Sabawoon, the adviser, were injured in the blast. Sabawoon's injuries were "not critical", according to spokesperson Ahmad Zia Abdulzai.

<h3>&lt;a href="Waters%20on%20trial%20for%20House%20ethics%20charges"&gt;Waters on trial for House ethics charges&lt;/a&gt; (1:39)</h3>

A United States House of Representatives ethics panel has charged Representative Maxine Waters (D-California) with violating unspecified ethics rules, making her the second Democrat in a week to be charged with ethical violations.

Since 2008, the Office of Congressional Ethics has investigated Waters for requesting a meeting with former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson. Although the meeting was supposed to be about minority-owned banks, the actual conversation focused on one bank, OneUnited. Water's husband, Sidney Williams, had been a stock-holder and board member in the bank at the time.

OneUnited later received US$12 million in bailout funds, and an unnamed member of Congress said that Waters had been unsure how to deal with OneUnited, which had been near collapse, "because Sidney's been on the board."

A statement from the panel does not disclose when it will state the charges or say how many there are.

Waters released a statement stating "I have not violated any House rules. Therefore, I simply will not be forced to admit to something I did not do and instead have chosen to respond to charges made by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in a public hearing."

She also vowed to take the case to a public trial, and also said "The record will clearly show that in advocating on behalf of minority banks neither my office nor I benefited in any way, engaged in improper action or influenced anyone."

Waters has represented her district in South Central Los Angeles, California for 20 years.

This incident comes just five days after another House Democrat, Charlie Rangel of New York was charged with thirteen ethics violations. Rangel's charges range from tax evasion to donations he solicited for an education center bearing his name.

Another politican with ethics troubles awaits his fate as

<h3>&lt;a href="Illinois%20jurors%20begin%20fifth%20day%20of%20deliberations%20in%20Blagojevich%20corruption%20trial"&gt;Illinois jurors begin fifth day of deliberations in Blagojevich corruption trial&lt;/a&gt; (3:26)</h3>

jurors in the Rod Blagojevich corruption trial began their fifth day of deliberations Tuesday morning, having sent no notes to the judge at all yesterday. Notes they sent out last week, however, suggest that the discussions could take much longer.

The jury has sent two notes to US District Judge James B. Zagel since deliberations began last Wednesday. The first came on Thursday, when the jury requested a transcript of one of the prosecution's closing arguments. Zagel refused, saying that closing arguments are not evidence.

The second note came on Friday, when the foreman wrote "Is it permissible to obtain the transcript of the testimony? It would be helpful." Zagel interpreted the request as saying that the jury wanted transcripts of the testimony of every single witness in the trial. Zagel again declined the request because it was not practical to do so; about 30 witnesses testified in this case, and the transcripts have not yet been prepared. Zagel instead offered to consider requests for transcripts of testimony from "specific identified witnesses", but said that he would warn the jury that such requests could take some time to fulfill.

Defense attorney Sheldon Sorosky objected to this plan, saying that "the government will have the benefit of presenting its case a whole second time." Zagel said in reply that he would still consider each of the jury's requests individually.

Such a request, however, suggests that the jury intends to conduct a lengthy review of the case. The six male and six female jurors continued their deliberations on Monday without sending any further notes to the judge.

Blagojevich is charged with trying to sell the U.S. Senate seat that had been vacated by Barack Obama when he won the 2008 presidential election, among other crimes. Robert Blagojevich, Rod's brother and co-defendant in the case, testified that Rod was trying to manipulate the political situation to his advantage, but emphasized that he engaged in nothing illegal. According to some sources, Blagojevich was interested in leading the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

<h3>&lt;a href="FBI%20asks%20Wikimedia%20Foundation%20to%20remove%20seal%20from%20websites%2C%20Wikimedia%20declines"&gt;FBI asks Wikimedia Foundation to remove seal from websites, Wikimedia declines&lt;/a&gt; (6:18)</h3>

The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has asked the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), host of Wikinews and its sister projects, to take down its image of the FBI seal from its websites. However, the WMF declined, saying that FBI lawyers had misinterpreted the relevant federal law.

In a letter dated July 22, 2010, David C. Larson, Deputy General Counsel of the FBI demanded that the WMF remove the seal from its websites within fourteen days, claiming that "it facilitates both deliberate and unwitting violations of these restrictions by Wikipedia users."

Larson quoted a section of US law detailing the proper use of the seal and went on to say that use of the FBI seal may be authorized only by the director of the FBI; the FBI director has not given such permission to WMF.

The WMF, represented by General Counsel Mike Godwin, responded, saying in a letter dated July 30, that Larson's interpretation "is both idiosyncratic (made especially so by your strategic redaction of important language) and, more importantly, incorrect."

Godwin said that "while we appreciate your desire to revise the statute to reflect your expansive vision of it, the fact is that we must work with the actual language of the statute, not the aspirational version" Larson provided. According to the relevant case law, it "was intended to protect the public against the use of a recognizable assertion of authority with intent to deceive."

Godwin asserted that the use of the FBI seal by the WMF and its projects do not fall under the purview of that law.

The websites of the Wikimedia Foundation are filled with user-generated text, pictures, and other materials, uploaded and curated by independent, often anonymous, volunteers, who change the websites minute by minute. The most well-known sites are the Wikipedias, encyclopedias with over 13 million articles in hundreds of languages. However, the foundation also hosts an image and media library, dictionaries, the Wikinews news websites, book websites and many other educational collaborations.

Cindy Cohn, legal director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (where Godwin was once staff counsel), said that the WMF's constitutional right to free expression allows it to use the FBI seal. "I have to believe the FBI has better things to do than this," she said. The reason for the FBI's request is unknown, as the FBI seal is published on many other websites, including Encyclopedia Britannica.

In a bit of trivia, Mike Godwin is also well known for the famous internet discussion rule known as Godwin's Law which states "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1." Godwin believes the ubiquity of such comparisons trivializes the Holocaust.

<h3>&lt;a href="Emergency%20spacewalks%20planned%20to%20fix%20International%20Space%20Station"&gt;Emergency spacewalks planned to fix International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (9:13)</h3>

NASA is scrambling to solidify plans to fix the broken down cooling systems on the International Space Station during two spacewalks, currently planned for Friday and Monday. The systems broke down late Saturday July 31, triggering alarms that woke the six astronauts (three Russian and three American) currently on board the station. NASA's flight controller said the astronauts are not in any danger, but that science experiments are on hold until the problem can be fixed.

Michael Suffredini, a manager for the International Space Station Program, had this to say about the incident:

</ul>
The first spacewalk is set to begin Friday at 6:55 a.m. EDT, NASA officials said. The two planned spacewalks will be conducted by astronauts Douglas Wheelock and Tracy Caldwell Dyson. They will replace an ammonia pump module, which shut down Saturday. The pump's failure prompted the astronauts to shut down several other systems as well. The spare pump had been delivered to the station in July 2006, during STS-121.

Normally, major repair spacewalks take weeks of preparation. Fortunately an unrelated spacewalk had already been planned for this Thursday, which would have been conducted by Wheelock and Dyson, so the space suits and equipment are ready to go. NASA decided late Monday evening that the spacewalk would be postponed to Friday to allow for more preparation.

In October 2010 the space station is expected to break the record for the longest continuously inhabited space station, a record currently held by Mir.

<h3>&lt;a href="Northern%20lights%20may%20appear%20across%20Canada%20and%20northern%20U.S.%20late%20Tuesday%20night"&gt;Northern lights may appear across Canada and northern U.S. late Tuesday night&lt;/a&gt; (11:17)</h3>

forecasters predict that the northern lights could be visible to the naked eye late tonight and early tomorrow morning across Canada, northern parts of the U.S., and possibly the United Kingdom.

Solar storms caused a large ejection of plasma from the Sun's surface on Sunday, and the plasma is heading directly towards Earth. The plasma, a cloud of rapidly moving hydrogen gas atoms and subatomic particles, is expected to reach us late Tuesday. The plasma will interact with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, which will cause northern lights, or aurora borealis, to be visible much further south than is usual. Northern lights usually appear as green or red rivers of lights across the sky.

"It's the first major Earth-directed eruption in quite some time" said astronomer Leon Golub of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The eruption was detected by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which was launched in February 2010, and is currently orbiting the Earth.

The Sun goes through approximately eleven-year long activity cycles, with the last maximum occurring in 2001. Sunday's eruption is a sign that the many years of inactivity is over, and the Sun is heading towards another maximum.

Two games of round 16 of the Gippsland Football League split the round over the weekend. On Saturday, Sale defeated Moe by 75 points, while on Sunday, Warragul lost to Drouin.

The split round will be completed next weekend with Leongatha traveling to Maffra and Morwell traveling to Wonthaggi. Traralgon has the bye.

The preliminary ladder has, in order, Maffra on top followed by Traralgon, Morwell, Drouin and Leongatha in the the top five. Moe and Sale need to win both of their remaining games and have other results go their way to make the finals. Wonthaggi and Warragul cannot make the finals.

</ul>
Though the project is still shrouded in mystery, on this day in history in 1977 the Church Committee began its hearing on the illegal US Central Intelligence Agencies human research program, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence and known by its codename MKULTRA.

This official U.S. government program began in the early 1950s and continued through the late 1960s. The program used U.S. and Canadian citizens as its test subjects to study the use of many types of drugs, as well as other methods, to manipulate individual mental states and to alter brain function.

The project actually began in 1945 when the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency was established and given direct responsibility for Operation Paperclip. Operation Paperclip was a program to recruit former Nazi scientists, some of whom had studied torture and brainwashing, and several had just been identified and prosecuted as war criminals during the Nuremberg Trials.

Several secret U.S. government projects grew out of Operation Paperclip and their purpose was to study mind-control, interrogation, behavior modification and related topics.

Headed by Sidney Gottlieb, the MKULTRA project was started on the order of CIA director Allen Dulles on April 13, 1953, largely in response to Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind-control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war in Korea. The CIA wanted to use similar methods on their own captives and was also interested in being able to manipulate foreign leaders with such techniques, and would later invent several schemes to drug Fidel Castro.

Experiments were often conducted without the subjects' knowledge or consent. In some cases, academic researchers being funded through grants from CIA front organizations were unaware that their work was being used for these purposes. To fund the project, a secretive arrangement granted the MKULTRA program a percentage of the CIA budget. The MKULTRA director was granted six percent of the CIA operating budget in 1953, without oversight or accounting and an estimated $10 million or more was spent.

</ul>
Yet because most MKULTRA records were deliberately destroyed in 1973 by order of then CIA Director Richard Helms, it has been difficult, if not impossible, for investigators to gain a complete understanding of the more than 150 individually funded research sub-projects sponsored by MKULTRA and related CIA programs.

</ul>
The few remaining CIA documents suggest that "chemical, biological and radiological" means were investigated for the purpose of mind control as part of MKULTRA. These means included the testing of hypnotic drugs such as temazepam, heroin, mescaline, and in one technique investigated, a patient was connected to a barbiturate IV in one arm and an amphetamine IV into the other. The barbiturates were released into the person first, and as soon as the person began to fall asleep, the amphetamines were released. The person would then begin babbling incoherently, and it was sometimes possible to ask questions and get useful answers.

However, the use of LSD came to dominate many of MKULTRA's programs. Experiments included administering LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, prostitutes, mentally ill patients, and members of the general public in order to study their reactions. LSD and other drugs were usually administered without the subject's knowledge or informed consent, a violation of the Nuremberg Code that the U.S. agreed to follow after World War II.

Efforts to "recruit" subjects were often illegal, even though actual use of LSD was legal in the United States until October 6, 1966. In Operation Midnight Climax, the CIA set up several brothels in San Francisco, CA to obtain a selection of men who would be too embarrassed to talk about the events. The men were dosed with LSD, the brothels were equipped with two-way mirrors, and the sessions were filmed for later viewing and study.

</ul>
In Canada, when the CIA recruited Scottish psychiatrist and former member of the Nuremberg medical tribunals of 1946–47, Donald Ewen Cameron, the program experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power as well as putting subjects into a drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. The experiments were typically carried out on patients who were being treated for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, yet many of them suffered permanently from his actions.

Given the CIA's purposeful destruction of most records, its failure to follow informed consent protocols with thousands of participants, the uncontrolled nature of the experiments, and the lack of follow-up data, the full impact of MKULTRA experiments, including deaths, will never be known. However, several known deaths have been associated with Project MKULTRA, most notably that of Frank Olson.

</ul>
Olson, a United States Army biochemist and biological weapons researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November, 1953 and died under suspicious circumstances a week later when Olson exited a hotel window and fell thirteen stories to his death. 

Olson's death was described as a suicide that occurred during a severe psychotic episode, possibly exacerbated by the LSD due to his already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies. The Olson family, however, disputed the official version of events. They maintained that Frank Olson was murdered because, especially in the aftermath of his LSD experience, he had become a security risk who might divulge state secrets associated with highly-classified CIA programs, many of which he had direct personal knowledge.

In 1975, Olson's family received a $750,000 settlement from the U.S. government and formal apologies from President Gerald Ford and CIA Director William Colby and later forensic evidence supported the family when Olson's body was exhumed in 1994. A medical examiner termed Olson's death a "homicide" due to cranial injuries indicating Olson had been knocked unconscious before he exited the window. 

A considerable amount of credible circumstantial evidence suggests that Theodore Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, participated in CIA-sponsored MKULTRA experiments conducted at Harvard University from the fall of 1959 through the spring of 1962. Beginning at the age of sixteen, Kaczynski participated along with twenty-one other undergraduate students in the Harvard experiments, which have been described as "disturbing" and "ethically indefensible."

In all, forty-four American colleges or universities, 15 research foundations or chemical or pharmaceutical companies and the like including Sandoz (currently Novartis) and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., 12 hospitals or clinics (in addition to those associated with universities), and three prisons are known to have participated in project MKULTRA.

The project also plays a part in many conspiracy theories given its nature and the destruction of most records. Some believe the Jonestown mass suicide was thought to be a test site for MKULTRA experiments and others believe Sirhan Sirhan, who assassinated Robert Kennedy, was under the influence of CIA directed hypnotic mind conrtol when he fired his weapon.

Although the CIA insists that MKULTRA-type experiments have been abandoned, 14-year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducts disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MKULTRA was abandoned a "cover story" even though President Gerald Ford in 1976 issued an Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited "experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with informed consent." Subsequent orders by Presidents Carter and Reagan expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.

The man, whose name is Omar Thornton, went on his killing spree after being showed video evidence of him stealing beer from Hartford Distributors Inc, a wholesaler of beverages. 

Company Vice President Steve Hollander said that Thornton "was cool and calm. He didn't yell. He was cold as ice. He didn't protest when we were meeting with him to show him the video of him stealing. He didn't contest it. He didn't complain. He didn't argue. He didn't admit or deny anything. He just agreed to resign. And then he just unexplainably pulled out his gun and started blasting." Hollander also stated that the 34 year-old man had guns hidden away in his lunch box, and said that two people around him were killed. Hollander, however, was only injured and said "By just the grace of God, I don't know how he missed me." Another employee said "people were pleading with him to put the gun down and to stop, but he was in his own world at that point."

Thornton opened fire around 7:00 am local time (11:00 UTC). During a phone call, in which his mother pleaded with the gunman not to commit suicide, he said that "[he] killed the five racists that was there that was bothering me. The cops are going to come in so I am going to take care of myself," according to his uncle Will Holliday.

<h3>BP starts "static kill" to permanently stop oil spill</h3>

&lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP (British Petroleum)&lt;/a&gt; engineers began injecting drilling mud into the capped &lt;a href="Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill"&gt;♡❤Deepwater Horizon♡❤ oil well&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; as the first part of a "static kill" procedure intended to permanently stop the flow of oil into the Gulf coast. Earlier in the day, the multi-national energy company ran "injectivity tests" to find out if the well, which had been leaking for months, could withstand the pressure of the procedure, which is meant to plug up the oil that isn't flowing because the well has been capped. The procedure, unlike the "top kill" attempted in May, is designed to proceed slowly. 

After a day-long delay, BP declared that the procedure could safely begin and that company's senior vice president, Kent Wells, said that the afternoon pressure test "went exactly as planned". 

The company also said that the "static kill" was only half the solution, with the other half being two relief wells that are planned to plug the well from the bottom.

<h3>Drunk illegal immigrant kills nun, injures two</h3>
An illegal immigrant accused of driving drunk has been charged with killing Sister Denise Mosier, a nun, and severely injuring two other nuns. Carlos Martinelly Montano, 23, has been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and involuntary manslaughter, following a car crash which occurred at 8:30 AM EDT on Sunday (0030 Monday, UTC). The man has also been charged with felony driving under a revoked drivers license. The car accident occurred in &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA's&lt;/a&gt; Prince William County. Police also said that Montano is an illegal immigrant awaiting deportation and has also repeatedly been charged with drunk driving. 

The US &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stated that Montano had been released in 2008, with immigration judge's review of his case pending. Homeland Security Secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJanet%20Napolitano"&gt;Janet Napolitano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called the accident "a horrible thing" and saying, "this is a horrible case. Why is it that this individual was still out driving? He was in removal proceedings. Why were the removal proceedings taking so long?"

All three nuns were driving to a retreat at the Benedictine Monastery in Bristow, Va when Montano crashed into their car. Montano has been treated for injuries.

<h3>Kenyans to vote on new constitution</h3>

On Wednesday, &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenyans&lt;/a&gt; will vote on a new constitution that intends to fix many of the country's political problems like widespread corruption and heightened ethnic divisions. Wednesday has been declared a public holiday so more people can vote. 

Billie O’Kadameri of Radio France International described opposition that arose from an alliance of churches and political leaders. Warnings of disruption in opposition areas have marred what the government initially hoped would be a united vote in support of the proposal.

However, Salim Lone, senior adviser to Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARaila%20Odinga"&gt;Raila Odinga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that "[Kenyans] are united as we have never been since independence more than 45 years ago," and, "Virtually all Kenyans, from across the political and ethnic divides, want this constitution". 

The new constitution would restrict the president's power, gives the people a bill of rights, gives more power to local governments and encourages land reform. However, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKalenjin"&gt;Kalenjin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tribe claims that the new land reform would lead to the taxation and even seizure of their lands.

The last time a major vote was held (the Kenyan presidential election in 2007), violence left almost 1,500 people dead and over half a million displaced.

&lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; hip hop group has announced that it is almost finished with its new studio album, ♡❤The Beginning♡❤. The group's leader and producer, &lt;a href="w%3Awill.i.am"&gt;will.i.am&lt;/a&gt; (William James Adams, Jr.), says that the recording "symbolizes growth, new beginnings and starts, fresh new perspective. It's a positive, feel-good [album] at the time where there's question marks and uncertainty. People want to be reminded that it's going to be all right."

♡❤The Beginning♡❤ is the group's sixth studio album and is set to be released by the end of the year. It comes one year after the release of multiplatinum ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20E.N.D."&gt;The E.N.D.&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and one of its hit singles "&lt;a href="w%3AI%20Gotta%20Feeling"&gt;I Gotta Feeling&lt;/a&gt;".

"I Gotta Feeling" officially became the most downloaded digital song last Friday, having reached six million legal digital downloads. Released in June 2009, the song topped the charts for fourteen weeks. iTunes still lists the song as the bestselling of all time, and its music video on &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; has reached approximately 38 million views.

Will.i.am said of the milestone, "We came out in '98 and our career, if you would look at it on chart, there's no dips in it. For our career to still be healthy and vibrant and doing things like 6 million downloads, it's pretty significant."

<h3>Cutting down of tree flares up Lebanese violence</h3>

After a rare clash between &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; forces over the cutting down of a tree near the border of the two countries, it appears that all sides are attempting to restore peace. 

The skirmish started after an Israeli soldier started cutting down a tree that has the capability to provide cover for Lebanese infiltrators. Israel has stated that they clear the border of underbrush weekly. After the tree was cut down, the Lebanese army started firing. The Lebanese were allegedly aiming at a base nearby, and the resulting skirmish killed a senior Israeli military officer, a Lebanese journalist, and two Lebanese army soldiers.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeping force in south Lebanon has stated that Israel was operating in their own territory. However, Lebanese Information Minister Tarek Mitri said that the area of land which had the tree "[was] Lebanese territory," and also stated that though Lebanon respects the border, the country still contests part of it.

<h3>Music star Wyclef Jean to seek Haitian presidency</h3>

According to TIME magazine, &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haitian&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; music star Wyclef Jean is to seek Haiti's presidency this Thursday. Last week Jean, who is a former member of the Fugees music group, took legal steps to run for the presidency, and Jean said in an interview that "if I can't take five years out to serve my country as President, then everything I've been singing about, like equal rights, doesn't mean anything." His younger brother also said that his candidacy was "very serious." 

On January 12 of this year, Haiti was rocked by a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that killed 300,000 and displaced millions. Whoever wins the presidency will face the task of rebuilding the crippled country. The presidential elections are scheduled for November 28.

<h3>Pakistani president criticized over European tour</h3>

The president of &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, Asif Zardari, is facing criticism for continuing a tour of &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; while his homeland is facing the worst flooding in 80 years. 

Opposition politician Imran Khan called for the president "to head home immediately." Khan citicized Zardari for "[going] on this lavish tour &amp;mdash; this money could be used on the victims. Remember, Pakistan is bankrupt right now so the government doesn't have enough money, so he should be mobilizing people to help these victims of the floods." Zardari is scheduled to meet &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday.

The flooding has killed over 1,500 people and has left over three million others in need of assistance. According to Islamabad's National Weather Forecasting Center, rain has been falling at a rate of 25-30% higher than average.

Today on Wikinews : Eight people and a gunman are dead in shooting rampage at a Connecticut beer warehouse; US President Barack Obama'a approval ratings hit a new low and in history, we trace the importance of a humble, everyday device that was vital for the French Revolution.

Today is Wednesday, August 04, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.

<h3>&lt;a href="Nine%20dead%20in%20shooting%20rampage%20at%20Connecticut%20beer%20warehouse"&gt;Nine dead in shooting rampage at Connecticut beer warehouse&lt;/a&gt; (0:34)</h3>

A Manchester, Connecticut beer driver caught stealing beer from the warehouse he works for has killed nine people, including himself, after he resigned and went on a shooting rampage. The man, Omar Thornton, went on his killing spree after being showed video evidence of him stealing beer from Hartford Distributors Inc, a beverage wholesaler.

Company Vice President Steve Hollander said that Thornton "was cool and calm. He didn't yell. He was cold as ice. He didn't protest when we were meeting with him to show him the video of him stealing. He didn't contest it. He didn't complain. He didn't argue. He didn't admit or deny anything. He just agreed to resign. And then he just unexplainably pulled out his gun and started blasting." 

Hollander also stated that the 34 year-old man had guns hidden away in his lunch box. The Vice President, who says that two people around him were killed, was only injured and added "By just the grace of God, I don't know how he missed me." Another employee said "people were pleading with him to put the gun down and to stop, but he was in his own world at that point."

Thornton opened fire around 7:00 am local time (11:00 UTC). According to his uncle, Will Holliday, during a phone call, in which his mother pleaded with the gunman not to commit suicide, Thornton said that "[he] killed the five racists that was there that was bothering me. The cops are going to come in so I am going to take care of myself," 

<h3>&lt;a href="One%20dead%20after%20small%20plane%20crashes%20near%20Phoenix"&gt;One dead after small plane crashes near Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; (2:02)</h3>

The pilot of a small plane that crashed into a warehouse near Deer Valley Airport in Phoenix, Arizona has been confirmed dead.

The plane veered off the airport runway early Wednesday, shortly before landing, and then slammed into a pest-control building a quarter-mile away, bursting into flames. The cause of the crash is unknown, and no one knows how many passengers were in the plane. The small plane was a four-seat single-engine Cirrus SR 22, which is built out of a composite of plastics and fiberglass.

Cindy Cross, a witness of the crash, said that "there was just a horrible black plume of smoke. We knew that it had hit a building and that it was bad because it wasn't a normal fire."

The Deer Valley Airport serves general aviation and hosts an aviation school. It is unknown if the flight was a training flight or not.

<h3>&lt;a href="Obama%20approval%20ratings%20hit%20new%20lows"&gt;Obama approval ratings hit new lows&lt;/a&gt; (2:54)</h3>

According to new polls, US President Barack Obama's approval ratings have dropped across the board. According to a new USA Today/Gallup poll, Americans are losing faith in the president's plan in Afghanistan and Iraq, where wars have been going on for years and casualties have risen. 43% of those polled say that it was a mistake to go to war after terrorists crashed planes into the World Trade Center buildings in New York on September 11, 2001. Barely a third of respondents favored Obama's strategy in the two Middle East wars. In another Gallup poll, just 36% of poll respondents supported the way Obama was handling Afghanistan, a sharp decline from 48% in February.

The drop in support for the ongoing wars (though the one in Iraq is slated to end soon) has been hastened by rising casualties and the Wikileaks leak of over 90,000 confidential military documents that paint a grim picture of the war in Afghanistan. About 76,000 of these have been released to the public. However, two-thirds of the people polled in the USA Today/Gallup Poll said it was wrong for the whistle-blower website to publish the documents, which have often been compared to the Pentagon Papers. Also, 57% of respondents said they want a timetable for removing American troops, and two-thirds of those 57% said they want a gradual withdrawal.

Obama's approval rating also hit a new low in the poll. Just 41% of poll respondents approved of Obama's handling of his job, while 53% disapproved. The above poll was conducted Tuesday through Sunday, and a Gallup poll on Monday had him at 45% approval. A Rasmussen Reports poll has Obama's July approval rating at 46%, while 54% disapprove.

Also, according to another poll, Obama's quarterly job approval average has hit an administration low. The quarterly rating, which is compiled of Gallup polls averaged out each quarter, has sunk every quarter Obama has been in office, but at different rates. In his sixth quarter of office, Obama averaged 47.3% approval, which varied from 52% in a poll conducted in mid-May to just 44% in another one conducted in mid-July. The biggest quarterly drop that Obama had was from Q2 to Q3 of his presidency, when health-care reform ran into trouble. Obama's approval rating declined from 62% to 52.9% during that period. Since then, the approval slide has plateaued, with declines of 2% of average from Q4-Q6.

In the 1790's, after the beheading of King Louis XVI during the French Revolution, the French Revolutionary army had begun to expand French control to the Low Countries, Italy, and the Rhineland.

</ul>
However, though the army was characterized by its revolutionary fervor, it initially experienced mixed results. France's enemies, fearing the revolution would soon be exported to their empires, included Prussia, Austria, Sardinia, Naples, Spain and Great Britain and enjoyed superior military numbers. France thus found herself under attack on all fronts and when an armed revolt broke out in La Vendée, a fiercely Catholic region of France, it seemed that the fall of the young republic was imminent.

Poorly disciplined and, just as importantly, poorly equipped, the French Revolutionary army needed rearranging. So, in early 1793 a man named Lazare Carnot, a prominent mathematician and physicist, was promoted to the Committee of Public Safety. Carnot, who was an exceptional talent for organization and for enforcing discipline, set about reorganizing the disheveled Armies. Realizing that no amount of reform and discipline was going to offset the massive numerical superiority enjoyed by France's enemies, Carnot introduced conscription, known as the levée en masse, and he was able to raise France’s army from a meager 645,000 troops in mid-1793 to 1,500,000 in September 1794. 

Once the problem of troop numbers had been solved Carnot turned his administrative skills to the supplies that this massive army would need. Many of the munitions and supplies were in short supply: copper was lacking for guns so he ordered church bells seized in order to melt them down; saltpeter was lacking and he called chemistry to his aid and leather for boots was scarce so he demanded and secured new methods for tanning.

Yet in 1795, France was under a naval blockade imposed by Great Britain and was unable to import pure graphite sticks from the British Grey Knotts mines – the only known source in the world at the time for solid graphite. Carnot, needing to keep track of the armies supplies thus faced a unique problem; he had all these supplies, but was running out of pencils to keep tally of the mass of inventories.

</ul>
To solve this problem, Carnot turned to one of his officers, a man named Nicolas-Jacques Conté who was born on this day in history in 1755. After several days of research, Conté discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a kiln. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied.

</ul>
Thus was formed the humble, modern pencil and with its assistance the First French Republic, which had started out from a position precariously near occupation and collapse, had defeated all its enemies and produced a revolutionary army that would take the other powers years to emulate. In 1802, France and England signed the Treaty of Amiens, the only period of peace during the so-called 'Great French War' between 1793 and 1815, however the peace treaty only lasted for one year - one wonders if it may have been signed with one of Conté's pencils.

Unesco's World Heritage Committee inscribed 21 new sites into the World Heritage list on Wednesday, during the 34th session of the committee's meeting in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Culture of Brazil, João Luiz da Silva Ferreira.

Three countries had sites added to the list for the first time: &lt;a href="Tajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kiribati"&gt;Kiribati&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Marshall%20Islands"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt;. The Committee added four sites to the World Heritage in Danger list, including the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGelati%20Monastery"&gt;Gelati Monastery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABagrati%20Cathedral"&gt;Bagrati Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , both in &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="Galapagos%20Islands"&gt;Galapagos&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Ecuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;) were removed from this list.

Some of the newly included World Heritages are: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APapah%C4%81naumoku%C4%81kea"&gt;Papahānaumokuākea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ael%20Camino%20Real%20de%20Tierra%20Adentro"&gt;el Camino Real de Tierra Adentro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Crist%C3%B3v%C3%A3o%23S%C3%A3o%20Francisco%20Square"&gt;São Francisco square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;).

Unesco World Heritage sites have special cultural or physical significance as a place or region. Unesco conserves, names, and catalogues these sites for the common heritage of humanity. &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; ranks as the country with the most World Heritage sites, having 45 in total.

A criminal investigation has begun in &lt;a href="Edinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; after three children were killed in a fire at a three storey house just before 3pm yesterday.

Firefighters were called to the house on Slateford Road in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;'s capital city, for a reported gas explosion, and they put out a small fire in an upstairs room. However, there was no evidence of an explosion and none of the surrounding houses were damaged. Three young children, two boys and a girl, were found to have died at the scene. Police are treating the deaths as suspicious.

A woman, believed to be the children's mother, was found injured on the ground in front of the house and there are reports that witnesses saw her jump from a third floor balcony. She was taken for treatment at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.

In a statement the &lt;a href="Lothian%20and%20Borders%20Police"&gt;Lothian and Borders Police&lt;/a&gt; said: "The investigation into the cause of this tragedy is in its early stages." However, the police have also said that there was no fault with the gas supply.

Post-mortem examinations are due to be carried out on the children's bodies. Police said no identities would be released until these were completed.

A police spokesperson said: "A criminal investigation is currently under way and nothing more can be said at this time into the circumstances which led to their deaths."

The mother of the three children, now named as eight year olds Gianluca and Augustino and five year old Cecilia Riggi, is to be questioned by police after details emerged that suggest it is unlikely the children died in the fire.

Neighbours have reported that they heard screaming from inside the house and one source said that when they found the victims lying dead in the living room it was "a horrific scene." However reports that the children died before the fire broke out have not been confirmed by official sources and only reports by neighbours and others at the scene have indicated this. 

Police refused to confirm reports that the children had died before the fire broke out, and say that the results of the post-mortems would help them decide whether to launch a murder inquiry into the incident.

According to Detective Superintendent Allan Jones the mother, Theresa Riggi, and her three children had been living in Edinburgh for little over a month since they were reported missing from their home in Skene, Aberdeenshire last month. Mrs Riggi is currently in a stable condition in hospital and Det Supt Jones said they are hoping to speak to her on Thursday. He said: "She's not in a position to speak to us at the moment."

The children were reportedly at the centre of a custody battle between Mrs Riggi and the children's father, Pasquale Riggi. He has been informed and is helping police to determine the last movements of the family. He is not a suspect in the investigation. Det Supt Jones reported: "He's heartbroken but he's very composed. He realizes he holds a lot of central information that we need. We're conscious of the trauma he's gone through."

Theresa Riggi and her husband were going through divorce proceedings and she was due to appear at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Tuesday. She apparently did not attend the hearing. At that time the judge was told that her whereabouts were once again unknown.

The Judge, Lady Clark, granted a search warrant for Mrs Riggi and said that social workers should supervise the children, applying for child protection orders if necessary, after Mr Riggi's counsel asked for an order to safeguard the children's interests.

The children were allegedly educated at home so the Social Work Department had had no contact with the family since they moved to Scotland from the US.

It is believed that Mrs Riggi may have turned on the gas, and that a neighbour smelled the fumes and called the emergency services, which may have led to the original report of a gas explosion.

Tributes of flowers have been left close to the scene with cards of sympathy and condolences.

<h3>Update on 7 August: Mother charged with murder</h3>

Lothian and Borders Police have released a statement confirming that the post mortems of Gianluca, Augustino and Cecilia have been concluded. Following this statement a warrant was issued and Theresa Riggi was charged with murder.

A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said: "A 46-year-old woman has been arrested and charged with murder in connection with the petition warrant which was granted earlier today,"

"Due to the medical condition of the accused, it is not at this time known when she will appear in court."

In an earlier statement Mr. Riggi released a statement saying: "Our family is struggling to come to terms with the immense and tragic loss of three beautiful children.

'Thanks to all who have offered such great comfort and support.

'We request that the media respect our privacy at this difficult time."

In a statement released earlier today, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFox%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;Fox Broadcasting Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced that British producer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANigel%20Lythgoe"&gt;Nigel Lythgoe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; would rejoin ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idol"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ as the television series' executive producer. Lythgoe formerly held the position for the first seven seasons of the series.

Lythgoe, who had been with ♡❤American Idol♡❤ since its inception, left to concentrate on dancing show ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASo%20You%20Think%20You%20Can%20Dance%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29"&gt;So You Think You Can Dance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ two years ago. Fox said that Lythgoe would continue as a judge and executive producer of ♡❤So You Think You Can Dance♡❤. He will join executive producers &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Fuller"&gt;Simon Fuller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Cecile Frot-Coutaz, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Warwick"&gt;Ken Warwick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idol%20%28season%2010%29"&gt;tenth season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of ♡❤Idol♡❤.

The announcement, which had been rumored for several weeks, came during a period of falling viewership for the show, as well as the departure of two judges on the show. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Cowell"&gt;Simon Cowell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEllen%20DeGeneres"&gt;Ellen DeGeneres&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will not return for the tenth season of ♡❤American Idol♡❤, which begins airing in January 2011. Fox says that it will have selected replacements in time for the show's auditions next month, but who those replacements will be has been the subject of media speculation. Some reports claim that actress &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJennifer%20Lopez"&gt;Jennifer Lopez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or musician &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Tyler"&gt;Steven Tyler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may join the show. Other changes to the show include lowering the minimum age for contestants to fifteen and reducing the results episodes to 30 minutes.

Along with friend Simon Fuller, Lythgoe helped to create the UK series ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APop%20Idol"&gt;Pop Idol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, later working with Fuller to bring the series to the United States as ♡❤American Idol♡❤. Working with ♡❤Idol♡❤ "not only was an inspirational journey into the heart of American pop culture, it opened my eyes to the untapped potential of the incredibly dynamic young people in this world," Lythgoe said.

Today on Wikinews : California's same-sex marriage ban is ruled unconstitutional; mass panic ensues as Zimbabwean officials fake an air crash; UFO encounters may have been covered up by Churchill and Eisenhower and, in history, the story of Silent Otto.

Today is Thursday, August 05, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>

<h3>&lt;a href="California%27s%20same-sex%20marriage%20ban%20ruled%20unconstitutional%3B%20appeal%20expected"&gt;California's same-sex marriage ban ruled unconstitutional; appeal expected&lt;/a&gt; (0:37)</h3>

A federal judge in San Francisco has ruled that California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage in the state, violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution.

U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn R Walker wrote in his statement that "Each challenge is independently meritorious, as Proposition 8 both unconstitutionally burdens the exercise of the fundamental right to marry and creates an irrational classification on the basis of sexual orientation."

Proposition 8, which was passed by California voters by referendum in November 2008, banned same-sex marriage in the state, which had been legal after a California supreme court ruling on May 15, 2008. The proposition's passage did not reverse the marriages of thousands of same-sex couples who had gotten married in the state in the interval.

Anticipating a defeat of the case titled Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the pro-Proposition 8 coalition of "defendant-intervenors" filed this morning a "motion for stay pending appeal", asking the court for its ruling to not take effect unless the decision is upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals; both sides in the case say an appeal is inevitable.

Speaking for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal, Jennifer C. Pizer said, "In holding that Prop 8 cannot stand because it violates the equal protection and due process rights of California’s lesbian and gay couples, this decision adds to the growing consensus in courts and legislatures across the country that there are no good reasons for excluding same-sex couples from marriage." Courtenay Semel, an actress and LGBT activist, told Wikinews "today marks another day in history! A big win for equal marriage. It's about time that progress is being made towards equality for all."

<h3>&lt;a href="Mass%20panic%20as%20Zimbabwean%20officials%20fake%20air%20crash"&gt;Mass panic as Zimbabwean officials fake air crash&lt;/a&gt; (2:34)</h3>

On Thursday, Zimbabwean officials informed the media that an Air Zimbabwe Boeing 767 aircraft carrying 250 people had crashed at Harare International Airport, before they announced the reports were false and the incident had in fact been a drill to simulate the occurrence of such an event. Initial reports suggested that a flight from London had crashed upon landing at the airport. However, Medical Rescue International later stated in a post on Facebook that no airplane had crashed and it had "joined up with other services to attend to a mock accident at Harare International Airport ... Good to keep the practising up."

Those behind the staged accident had reportedly not told any other governmental departments, resulting in relatives inquiring with Air Zimbabwe as to what had happened. A senior figure for Air Zimbabwe stated that he was "concerned that this incident led to many, many calls to us. People were frightened. No actual plane was involved, but there was a scenario involving a Boeing 767 plane that had been hijacked and forced down at Harare airport."

It was reported that Peter Chikumba, chief of Air Zimbabwe, had also not been informed that the exercise was to take place, and that the airline had set up an emergency help desk to liaise with the families of victims. Alan McGuinness, a correspondent for Sky News, stated, "journalists who arrived at the airport saw smoke rising from a runway and were then taken to a room where they were told to wait. David Chawota, the head of the Zimbabwe Civil Aviation Authority, said the media was duped to make the drill more realistic." Chawota stated, "telling the media was part of the exercise. We wanted to see how the media would react," he said.

Chawota himself told BNO News that an airliner had crashed. Michael van Poppel, head of BNO News said that "while I first thought Chawota was just misinformed by others, although that would be odd since he is the CEO of the aviation authority, I was stunned to hear that he actually knew it was a drill and wanted to see the media's response ... This basically means he was lying to me when I spoke to him, but also to other reporters he spoke to ... I think it was absolutely irresponsible of this CEO and I can't imagine what the families of passengers travelling to Harare around that time must have gone through when they heard news reports that there had been an 'accident' at the airport."

McGuinness reported, "Stuart Sprake, general manager of FX Logistics, works at Harare airport and believed the secrecy surrounding the drill will help emergency crews learn valuable lessons." Sprake told reporters "they (the crews) had to find their way through crowds and traffic ... training exercises should be ad hoc - the less people know about it the better."

Tragically, there was a real accident today in Missouri 

<h3>&lt;a href="Two%20die%20in%20school%20bus%20accident%20in%20Missouri%2C%20several%20others%20injured"&gt;Two die in school bus accident in Missouri, several others injured&lt;/a&gt; (5:23)</h3>

involving two school buses, a tractor trailer and an sport utility vehicle has left at least two people dead and fifty more injured about 40 miles outside of St. Louis, Missouri.

The incident occurred Thursday morning on I-44 in Gray Summit between 10:15 AM to 10:30 AM local time according to Jorma Duran, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Transportation.

The school buses were carrying students from St. James High School and it was en route to the Six Flags St. Louis amusement park, approximately 10 miles from the scene of the accident.

It wasn't immediately clear how exactly the collision happened.

<h3>&lt;a href="Three%20children%20die%20in%20Edinburgh%20terrace%20fire"&gt;Three children die in Edinburgh terrace fire&lt;/a&gt; (6:51)</h3>

A criminal investigation has begun in Edinburgh after three children were killed in a fire at a three storey terraced house just before 3pm yesterday.

Firefighters were called to the house on Slateford Road in Scotland's capital city, for a reported gas explosion, and they put out a small fire in an upstairs room. However, there was no evidence of an explosion and none of the surrounding houses were damaged. Three young children, two boys and a girl, were found to have died at the scene. Police are treating the deaths as suspicious.

A woman believed to be the children's mother was found injured on the ground in front of the house and there are reports that witnesses saw her jump from a third floor balcony. She was taken for treatment at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.

The mother of the three children, now named as eight year olds Luca and Austin and five year old Cecilia Riggi, is to be questioned by police after details emerged that suggest it is unlikely the children died in the fire.

In a statement the Lothian and Borders Police said: "The investigation into the cause of this tragedy is in its early stages." However, the police have also said that there was no fault with the gas supply. 

Neighbours have reported that they heard screaming from inside the house and one source said that when they found the victims lying dead in the living room it was "a horrific scene." However reports that the children died before the fire broke out have not been confirmed by official sources and only reports by neighbors and others at the scene have indicated this. Police, refusing to confirm these reports, say that the results of the post-mortems would help them decide whether to launch a murder inquiry into the incident.

According to Detective Superintendent Allan Jones the mother, Theresa Riggi, and her three children had been living in Edinburgh for little over a month since they were reported missing from their home in Skene, Aberdeenshire last month. Mrs Riggi is currently in a stable condition in hospital and Det Supt Jones said they are hoping to speak to her on Thursday. He said: "She's not in a position to speak to us at the moment."

The children were reportedly at the center of a custody battle between Mrs Riggi and the children's father, Pasquale Riggi. The father, who is not a suspect in the investigation, has been informed of the tragedy and is helping police to determine the last movements of the family. Det Supt Jones reported: "He's heartbroken but he's very composed. He realizes he holds a lot of central information that we need. We're conscious of the trauma he's gone through."

Theresa Riggi and her husband were going through divorce proceedings and she was due to appear at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Tuesday but apparently she did not attend the hearing. 

The Judge, Lady Clark granted a search warrant for Mrs Riggi and said that social workers should supervise the children, applying for child protection orders if necessary, after Mr Riggi's counsel asked for an order to safeguard the children's interests.

The children were allegedly educated at home so the Social Work Department had had no contact with the family since they moved to Scotland from the US.

It is believed that Mrs Riggi may have turned on the gas, which a neighbor then smelled and called emergency services, which may have led to the original report of a gas explosion.

Tributes of flowers have been left close to the scene with cards of sympathy and condolences.

<h3>&lt;a href="Campbell%20testifies%20against%20former%20Liberian%20president"&gt;Campbell testifies against former Liberian president&lt;/a&gt; (10:12)</h3>

Supermodel Naomi Campbell testified for prosecutors on Thursday in a war crimes case against former Liberian president Charles Taylor.

Taylor allegedly gave an uncut blood diamond to Campbell in 1997 when they met for dinner in South Africa, according to Professor David Crane of Syracuse University.

Crane told Voice of America, "The testimony itself is important because the prosecution wants to show that Charles Taylor has the mindset or what we call the mens rea to use the blood diamonds that were mined by Sierra Leoneans chained to pits in the Kailahun and Kenema area. And, he was using them for various reasons: to buy guns, to use cash to deposit, and also to buy influence."

Taylor denies he possessed any uncut diamonds.

Campbell said in her testimony, "When I was sleeping I had a knock on my door. I opened my door and two men were there and gave me a pouch and said, 'A gift for you.'" She said the men gave her "very small, dirty looking stones."

She continued, "At breakfast I told Miss [Mia] Farrow and Miss [Carole] White what had happened and one of the two said, well that's obviously Charles Taylor, and I said, yes I guess it was."

Campbell was not sure Taylor sent her the blood diamonds and she claimed she assumed it was the accused and continued stating it was unlikely anyone else gave her the gift.

The Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague, The Netherlands ruled that no one may sketch, take photographs, or make videos of Campbell due to her high profile. Photographers were barred from taking photos of Campbell entering or leaving the courthouse, but her testimony was recorded as usual.

<h3>&lt;a href="Google%20to%20discontinue%20social%20networking%20application%20Google%20Wave"&gt;Google to discontinue social networking application Google Wave&lt;/a&gt; (11:54)</h3>

Google has decided to retire the Google Wave social-networking service after one year, citing lack of user adoption.

In May 2009, Google launched Wave as a private beta. A year later, it became open to the public. Wave is an email service that integrates social media features and capabilities into emailing and it also integrates IM-like features into its service. The company has released components of Google Wave as open source for those to create a similar service. 

Urs Hölzle, Google senior vice president for operations, said in a blog post that "Wave has not seen the user adoption we would have liked. We don't plan to continue developing Wave as a stand-alone product." Hölzle also said that as a "web app for real time communication and collaboration, it set a high bar for what was possible in a Web browser. We weren't quite sure how users would respond to this radically different kind of communication." Google says that it will continue the service until the end of the year.

<h3>&lt;a href="RAF%20UFO%20encounters%20may%20have%20been%20covered%20up%20by%20Churchill%20and%20Eisenhower"&gt;RAF UFO encounters may have been covered up by Churchill and Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt; (12:54)</h3>

In light of documents released by the National Archives, The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense has investigated claims that Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower may have orchestrated a cover-up of an Unidentified Flying Object sighting by the Royal Air Force.

Numerous public inquiry files suggest that great concern was had for the proposition that former Prime Minister of The UK, Churchill and than US General Eisenhower, knew of an unknown metallic object approaching RAF aircraft off the British coast during World War II. One inquiry noted a discussion between Churchill and Eisenhower overheard by Churchill's body guard by the apparent grandson of the body guard (whose name was blacked out).

The inquiry read, "During the discussion with Mr Churchill, a consultant dismissed any possibility that the object had been a missile, since a missile could not suddenly match its speed with a slower aircraft and then accelerate again [...] Another person at the meeting raised the possibility of an unidentified flying object, at which point Mr Churchill declared that the incident should be immediately classified for at least 50 years and its status reviewed by a future prime minister".

Further records showing Churchill's general interest in UFOs were released along side many other public inquiry files that concluded any UFO sightings were no threat to British airspace and minutes from a Joint Intelligence Committee meeting in 1959, where UFO sightings were a major theme.

Sightings made by officials and civilians were discussed at the Joint Intelegence meeting and 16 cases were singled out, 10 were identified as technical faults, misinterpretations and hoaxes - while 6 remain unidentified.

The unit of the Ministry of Defence that dealt with UFOs was closed last year.

Though he served only one and a half of the six years of World War II, the German U-boat commander Otto Kretschmer, popularaly known as Silent Otto, was the most successful Ace of the Deep and no other U-boat commander was able to surpass him in terms of tonnage sunk. 

Otto was born in Liegnitz, a city in south-western Poland on May 1 1912. At the age of seventeen he spent eight months living in Exeter, England where he learned to speak English fluently and in 1930 he joined the Reichsmarine where he became an officer and served for 1 year on the light cruiser Emden, the only ship of her class and the first new warship built in Germany after World War I.

By January 1936, he had been promoted to a senior lieutenant and was transferred to the U-boat fleet where he received extensive training and a year later during Germany's involvement in the Spanish Civil War, he was placed in command of the submarine U-35 where he patrolled the Spanish coast but sunk no vessels. However when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 he and U-35 were sent to patrol the British coast in the North Sea.

</ul>
Kretschmer's first success came when he attacked and sunk the Danish 10,517 ton tanker Danmark on January 12, 1940. However the British admiralty at that time thought that the tanker had actually struck a mine as they did not locate any U-boat in the area. A month later, on February 18th, Kretschmer sank the 1,300 ton British fleet destroyer HMS Daring while she was escorting a convoy from Norway. U-Boat crews almost always avoided deliberately engaging enemy destroyers, so the Daring's destruction was rightly seen as a very skillful attack by Kretschmer.

Then in April 1940, Kretschmer was transferred to command of the newly-completed U-99, one of the new type VII submarines (the most successful submarine of the German fleet) and it was while during this command where, in a sense, he started his legacy. 

<ul>

</ul>
During the first four patrols of the U-99, Kretschmer started attacking convoys at night on the surface, taking down merchant ships with highly accurate shots, using only one torpedo per target ship in order to save ammunition, and the quote "One torpedo ... one ship" is attributed to Kretschmer. From around this time, he was also given the nickname "Silent Otto", both for his successful use of the "silent running" capability of the U-boats as well as for his reluctance to make radio broadcasts during patrols.

And on one patrol during November and December 1940, he sank three, and mortally wounded another, British armed merchant cruisers totalling over 46,000 gross tons. These three successes earned Kretschmer the number-one spot on the Aces list, and was never surpassed even though his tactics were widely copied, with mixed results, throughout the U-Boat force. 

Kretschmer was also meticulous in his conduct towards the crews of torpedoed ships. When attacking lone merchant ships in the days before wolfpack tactics began in earnest, he had been known to hand down bottles of spirits and blankets into lifeboats and give them the course to the nearest land. On one patrol in September 1940, Kretschmer retrieved a survivor of another torpedo attack who was alone in the Atlantic on a small raft and took him aboard, transferring him later to a lifeboat after his next successful attack.

On a patrol during March 1941, he sunk 10 more vessels, but on the 17th of March U-99 was disabled after repeated depth charge attacks by the British destroyers HMS Walker and HMS Vanoc.

</ul>
Kretschmer surfaced and, under fire from the British vessels, scuttled his boat. Three of his men were lost, but Kretschmer and the remainder of U-99's crew were captured by the British. 

Kretschmer's usual standards of conduct were evident during the sinking of his boat; he signaled HMS Walker asking for rescue for his men, took pains to ensure as many left the submarine as possible, and assisted some of his crew towards the rescue nets hung from the British destroyer. Kretschmer's strength was evidently failing in the cold water and his own rescue was at the hands of a British sailor who climbed down the nets and plucked him from the water.

Upon his capture, he spent almost seven years as a P.O.W. in the hands of the British. However, Kretschmer was so valuable to the German command that in 1943, the Germans tried to rescue him from Camp 30 in Bowmanville, Ontario during the daring Operation Kiebitz.

The plan involved sending coded messages sent by mail through the International Committee of the Red Cross to the prisoners. The goal was to tunnel out of the camp, and make their way 870 miles through eastern Canada to northern New Brunswick where they would rendezvous with an awaiting U-boat. However the Canadians had been intercepting the coded messages all along but did not tip off the prisoners as the they were hoping to get a rare chance to seize a German U-boat in Canadian waters; a feat that would have been an intelligence coup for the Allies. 

As the date of the escape attempt drew closer, the camp guards moved in and seized the POWs, including Kretschmer, but one officer, Wolfgang Heyda, managed to escape over the camp walls using a crude zip-wire on electrical cables. Heyda eluded search parties and the massive police response and somehow made his way on Canadian National Railways passenger trains from southern Ontario to Pointe de Maisonnette in northern New Brunswick on Chaleur Bay. Heyda arrived at the location at the appointed time only to be arrested by personnel who were waiting to coordinate a surface task force that would attempt to attack and/or seize the awaiting U-boat.

U-536, which had been tasked with picking up the escaping naval officers, arrived off Pointe de Maisonnette and at the appointed time was signaled with a light that the escapees were to have used, however the U-boat commander was suspicious, particularly after his hydrophones picked up the sound of several warships that lay hidden nearby. U-536 opted to remain submerged and began to evade the warships which searched throughout the night and attempted unsuccessfully to attack U-536 with depth charges.

Had the plan been successful, it would have been sensational propaganda material for the Nazi war machine however Kretschmer remained a prisoner and U-536 was sunk the following month before it returned to its German homeport.

Kretschmer wasn't returned to Germany until December 1947 where, like several other surviving German naval veterans, he joined the post-WWII German Navy, the Bundesmarine, until he retired in September 1970 as a flotilla admiral. During a vacation in Bavaria on August 5th 1998, this day in history, he died in an accident on a boat on the Danube, while celebrating his 50th wedding anniversary. He was later cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea.

&lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; nominee &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElena%20Kagan"&gt;Elena Kagan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been confirmed by the US &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; by a vote of 63–37 and will be sworn in Saturday by Chief Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Roberts"&gt;John Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a Supreme Court Associate Justice.

Shortly after the Senate vote, Justice Roberts offered the 50-year-old Kagan "warm congratulations," according to Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg. 56 Democrats, five Republicans, and two Independents voted to confirm Kagan. 35 Republicans and one Democrat voted against her. The Republicans that voted for Kagan were &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Lugar"&gt;Richard Lugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJudd%20Gregg"&gt;Judd Gregg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALindsey%20Graham"&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Collins"&gt;Susan Collins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOlympia%20Snowe"&gt;Olympia Snowe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , both of &lt;a href="Maine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;. Democrat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Nelson"&gt;Ben Nelson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , of &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, voted against Kagan.

"I am confident that Elena Kagan will make an outstanding Supreme Court justice," said US president &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; after Kagan was confirmed. Obama also said that Kagan would have a positive impact on the conservative-majority court because she "understands that the law isn’t just an abstraction or an intellectual exercise" and that "she knows that the Supreme Court’s decisions shape not just the character of our democracy, but the circumstances of our daily lives." Senate Judiciary Chairman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Leahy"&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Democrat-&lt;a href="Vermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt;) also said that Kagan's confirmation was "long, long overdue."

Kagan is a former dean of the Harvard Law School, a legal adviser during the Clinton administration, and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Solicitor%20General"&gt;US Solicitor General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the current Obama administration. She becomes the fourth woman ever to serve on the court and will become the third current female justice, joining &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Bader%20Ginsburg"&gt;Ruth Bader Ginsburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASonia%20Sotomayor"&gt;Sonia Sotomayor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Sotomayor was also appointed by Obama and confirmed by the Senate by a 68–31 vote. Kagan replaces retiring Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;John Paul Stevens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who is the leading liberal on the court.

Today on Wikinews : We briefly recap the top stories from around the world and on today's this day in history, we present the missingest man in New York.

Today is Friday, August 06, 2010. I'm Dan Harlow and this is Wikinews.
<h2>Script</h2>

<h4>(0:26)</h4>
A man armed with a 2-foot long knife killed three children and a teacher in a brutal attack in Zibo in eastern China. The Chinese government has been mostly silent on the incident.

The man who killed the people was identified as 26 year-old Fang Jiantang, and he later turned himself in to police. His motive for killing the children and the teacher is unknown.

<h4>(0:49)</h4>
After a rare clash between Israeli and Lebanese forces over the cutting down of a tree near the border of the two countries, it appears that all sides are attempting to restore peace.

The skirmish started after an Israeli soldier started cutting down a tree that has the capability to provide cover for Lebanese infiltrators. Israel has stated that they clear the border of underbrush weekly. After the tree was cut down, the Lebanese army started firing. The Lebanese were allegedly aiming at a base nearby, and the resulting skirmish killed a senior Israeli military officer, a Lebanese journalist two Lebanese army soldiers.

The United Nations peacekeeping force in south Lebanon has stated that Israel was operating in their own territory. However, Lebanese Information Minister Tarek Mitri said that the area of land which had the tree "[was] Lebanese territory," and also stated that though Lebanon respects the border, the country still contests part of it.

<h4>(1:46)</h4>
According to TIME magazine, Haitian-American music star Wyclef Jean is to seek Haiti's presidency this Thursday. Last week Jean, who is a former member of the Fugees music group, took legal steps to run for the presidency, and Jean said in an interview that "if I can't take five years out to serve my country as President, then everything I've been singing about, like equal rights, doesn't mean anything." His younger brother also said that his candidacy was "very serious."

On January 12 of this year, Haiti was rocked by a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that killed 300,000 and displaced millions. Whoever wins the presidency will face the task of rebuilding the crippled country. The presidential elections are scheduled for November 28.

<h4>(2:33)</h4>
The president of Pakistan, Asif Zardari, is facing criticism for continuing a tour of Europe while his homeland is facing the worst flooding in 80 years.

Opposition politician Imran Khan called for the president "to head home immediately." Khan criticized Zardari for "[going] on this lavish tour -- this money could be used on the victims. Remember, Pakistan is bankrupt right now so the government doesn't have enough money, so he should be mobilizing people to help these victims of the floods." Zardari is scheduled to meet UK Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday.

The flooding has killed over 1,500 people and has left over three million others in need of assistance. According to Islamabad's National Weather Forecasting Center, rain has been falling at a rate of 25-30% higher than average.

<h4>(3:23)</h4>
Aircraft company Boeing lost orders for 26 jets over the past week, according to the company's website. Boeing lost 15 orders for their new and long-delayed 787 Dreamliner, 10 for their Boeing 777 and one for their smaller 737 jet. The company also gained two orders for the 737, which makes for a net loss of 25 orders. Boeing hasn't identified the customers that canceled their orders.

With the 15 dropped 787 orders, Boeing has lost four more orders than it gained for the aircraft this year. Boeing has gained 28 orders for the 787 and lost 32 in 2010. Boeing has gained 255 orders for its lineup this year, which consists of the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787. 229 of those orders are for the 737 jet.

<h4>(4:20)</h4>
Alex Rodriguez, baseball player for the New York Yankees, hit his 600th career home run on Wednesday. His 600th home run was hit in Yankee Stadium against the Toronto Blue Jays. Yankees manager Joe Girardi said that the homer was "an amazing feat -- quite an accomplishment."

With the home run, Rodriguez, also known as A-Rod, became the seventh player in Major League Baseball history to reach the 600 milestone.

It was the summer of 1930 and Judge Joseph Force Crater and his wife, Stella Mance Wheeler, were vacationing at their summer cabin at Belgrade Lakes, Maine. Everything seemed fine until, in late July, Judge Crater received a telephone call which he took in private.

He offered no information to his wife about the content of the call, other than to say that he had to return to the city "to straighten those fellows out".

The next day, he arrived at his Fifth Avenue apartment but instead of dealing with business, he made a trip to Atlantic City with his mistress, a showgirl named Sally Lou Ritz.

He then returned to Maine on August 1, but traveled back to New York on August 3. Before making this final trip, he promised his wife he would return by her birthday, on August 9. 

On the morning of August 6, Crater spent two hours going through his files in his courthouse chambers. He then had his assistant, Joseph Mara, cash two checks for him that amounted to U.S. $5,150 (equivalent to about $67,115 in today's funds).

At noon, he and Mara carried two locked briefcases to his apartment and he then let Mara take the rest of the day off.

Later that evening, Crater went to a Broadway ticket agency and bought one seat for a comedy called Dancing Partner that was playing that night at the Belasco Theatre and then went to Billy Haas’s Chophouse on West 45th Street for dinner. There, he ate dinner with Sally Lou Ritz and a friend of his who was a lawyer. The dinner ended a little after 9 pm, a short time after the curtain rose on the show for which Crater bought a ticket, and the small group went outside.

Sally and the lawyer then entered a taxi outside the restaurant and both saw Crater walking down the street. However, what happened to him after that remains a mystery.

When he did not return to Maine for 10 days, his wife began making calls to their friends in New York, asking if anyone had seen him. Only when he failed to appear for the opening of the courts on August 25 did his fellow justices become alarmed. They started a private search but failed to find any trace. The police were finally notified on September 3 and after that, the missing judge was front-page news.

</ul>
The story captivated the nation and a massive investigation was launched. The official investigations started vigorously, but quickly slowed. Detectives discovered that the judge's safe deposit box had been emptied and the two briefcases that Crater and his assistant had taken to his apartment were missing. These promising leads were also quickly bogged down by the thousands of false reports coming from people claiming to have seen the missing man. Crater's wife later found the missing money in a desk drawer in her home, along with a note from the judge.

Was he murdered? Had he run off with another woman? Or had he been involved in corrupt practices which were about to be revealed? Who knows. However, Sally Lou Ritz, the mistress, also disappeared in August or September 1930, and was never seen again either.

For many years following Crater's disappearance, "Judge Crater, call your office" was a standard gag of nightclub comedians and was often heard on public address systems. The phrase "to pull a Crater", meaning to disappear, also became a popular expression. 

However, none of the subsequent investigations succeeded in discovering the judge's fate or possible whereabouts, and Crater was officially declared dead "in absentia" on June 6, 1939 and his case — Missing Persons File No. 13595 — was officially closed in 1979. 

But then, on August 19, 2005, authorities received a note from the recently deceased 91 year old wife of former NYPD officer Robert Good. The note identified a location near West Eighth Street in Coney Island, Brooklyn, at the current site of the New York Aquarium, where she claimed the judge was buried under the boardwalk. She also identified the killers as members of the organized crime gang Murder, Inc., and her husband.

Week two of the &lt;a href="Gippsland%20Football%20League"&gt;Gippsland Football League&lt;/a&gt; round sixteen split round saw a combined winning margin of 80 points, as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaffra"&gt;Maffra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; deafeated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeongatha"&gt;Leongatha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMorwell%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Morwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defeated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWonthaggi"&gt;Wonthaggi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The Gippsland Football League, officially the Gippsland League, is the only major &lt;a href="Australian%20rules%20football"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; competition in the Gippsland region according to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Country%20Football%20League"&gt;Victorian Country Football League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Scores are quoted as ♡❤goals-behinds (total)♡❤.
Having already secured top spot on the ladder, Maffra continued their dominance of the competition with a 49 point victory over Leongatha at home. The hosts went ahead early and lead at every break; 21 points at the end of the first quarter, 32 at half time and 35 at the end of the third quarter. Final scores, in the "accurate" game of the day, Maffra 15-14 (104) defeated Leongatha 8-7 (55).

Amid recent rumors and news on the progress to find the Higgs boson, a dispute has arisen as to who should get credit for the discovery and the resulting &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20prize%20physics"&gt;Nobel Prize in Physics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Six people, across three different teams, are credited with this discovery: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Brout"&gt;Robert Brout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Englert"&gt;François Englert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversit%C3%A9%20Libre%20de%20Bruxelles"&gt;Université Libre de Bruxelles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Higgs"&gt;Peter Higgs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AG.%20S.%20Guralnik"&gt;G. S. Guralnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrown%20University"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AC.%20R.%20Hagen"&gt;C. R. Hagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Rochester"&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AT.W.B.%20Kibble"&gt;Tom Kibble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20College%20London"&gt;Imperial College London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Three papers written in 1964 explained what is now known as the "Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble mechanism" (or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHiggs%20mechanism"&gt;Higgs mechanism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHiggs%20boson"&gt;Higgs boson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for short). The mechanism is the key element of the electroweak theory that forms part of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20Model"&gt;Standard model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of particle physics. The papers that introduce this mechanism were published in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhysical%20Review%20Letters"&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1964 and were each recognized as milestone papers by PRL’s 50th anniversary celebration. 

"There are six people who developed the mechanism in quick succession and who hold a legitimate claim to credit for it," says particle physicist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Close"&gt;Frank Close&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oxford"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , UK. Because the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;Swedish Royal Academy of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can award Nobel prizes to no more than three people, this puts six men aiming for half as many Nobel medals, should the particle be found. The Nobel committee can award the prize to groups and associations.

Fermilab's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATevatron"&gt;Tevatron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALarge%20Hadron%20Collider"&gt;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACERN"&gt;CERN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are searching for a particle that will constitute evidence for this significant discovery. Recent progress has given a new urgency not only to the race to find the particle, but also to establishing authorship of the ideas behind it. As &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Ellis%20%28physicist%29"&gt;John Ellis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a particle physicist based at CERN, acknowledges: "Let's face it, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is at stake." 

The issue over credit and authorship was highlighted late July in France when the American and British team of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AG.%20S.%20Guralnik"&gt;Guralnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AC.%20R.%20Hagen"&gt;Hagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AT.W.B.%20Kibble"&gt;Kibble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were omitted from the conference overview web site. Several groups threatened to boycott and raised the issue in discussions of the theory behind the on-going search for the particle. One of the meeting's organizers, Gregorio Bernardi at the Laboratory of Nuclear and High Energy Physics in Paris, admits that the committee was surprised by the strength of objections leveled at the web advertisement and the committee. "People took this very seriously, which we didn't expect," he says.

Physicist Tom Ferbel said the snub by the French conference organizers was "insulting" and "chilling", noting that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Physical%20Society"&gt;American Physical Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; awarded the 2010 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASakurai%20Prize"&gt;J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to all six physicists for this theory. "I do fear," he said, "that the myopic views of the organizers could definitely impact the decisions of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;Swedish Academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

The conference organizers acknowledged that their choice was controversial by inviting a special talk on the tangled history of the mechanism, providing a forum for disgruntled conference participants to debate the matter. However, although the meeting ultimately ran smoothly, it seems likely that arguments over this issue will become more heated now that the Higgs particle is perceived to be within reach. As &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Ellis%20%28physicist%29"&gt;John Ellis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; states, "I'm just glad that I'm not on the Nobel committee deciding who to throw out of the lifeboat."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmina%20Mariam%20Bokhary"&gt;Amina Mariam Bokhary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was sentenced to one year of probation and a fine of 8000 &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong%20dollar"&gt;dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with her driving licence suspended for assaulting a police officer and drink-driving. According to the judge, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Yuen"&gt;Anthony Yuen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the light sentence is due to the defendant's mental illness. Both the police and the public have criticized the light sentence. Bokhary is the niece of Hong Kong judge &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKemal%20Bokhary"&gt;Kemal Bokhary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The police urged the Secretary for Justice to review the sentence. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Zervos"&gt;Kevin Zervos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that Yuen should reconsider the sentence. Politician &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARonny%20Tong"&gt;Ronny Tong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 'called for clarification over sentencing standards', according to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Standard"&gt;The Standard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

Police Inspectors' Association chairman Liu Kit-ming said that the police were worried about this case as well as future treatment of such cases. He also said that the case may give the impression that the rich are punished less severely in court. 'We are not pointing at Bokhary nor do we hope she can be imprisoned. What we are concerned about most is guidelines for similar cases,' said Liu.

Around 300 citizens took to the streets to protest against the light sentence. They wore black shirts, symbolising 'the law of Hong Kong is dead'. The organizer of the protest, an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong%20Institute%20of%20Vocational%20Education"&gt;IVE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; student named Lo, said that the sentence was unjust and that it was 'hard to believe that there was no [translation missing]'. The protest was criticised by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20of%20Hong%20Kong"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; founder &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Lee"&gt;Martin Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was a barrister himself. He believes it would lead to the fall of Hong Kong's orderly justice system and the rise of mob rule.

Lee went on to say that her mental illness was not discovered until the most recent sentence. He believes that going to prison will only worsen the situation and that Bokhary should be treated, not imprisoned. Bokhary's lawyer, Peter Duncan, denied that the light sentence was related to Bokhary's wealth. Yuen said that a jail term would 'destroy the rest of the defendant's life'.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20Defense%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, has announced wide-ranging cuts in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Military"&gt;United States Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; programs. In a press conference at 3pm &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Daylight%20Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today, Gates said that, effective immediately, a number of top-line programs would be ending.

Ten per cent of the military intelligence budget is one of the lead items to be cut, said Gates, noting the huge increase in military intelligence money since &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A9/11"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Meanwhile, "we're looking at cutting a third of the budget for services and support contracting over the next three years", Gates noted, saying that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amilitary%20contracting"&gt;military contracting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had proved inefficient compared to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ain-sourcing"&gt;in-sourcing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Gates also proposed elimination of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Joint%20Forces%20Command"&gt;U.S. Joint Forces Command&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , saying that while the command's function was important, it did not require a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afour-star%20general"&gt;four-star general&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and 2,800 staff to operate.

The proposed cuts would particularly impact the economy of the &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, whose northern counties employ large numbers of defense contractors and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; employees. Gates said, though, that some of the money saved from program cuts might go to increased shipbuilding, noting "we probably need more money for shipbuilding", and that an expanded shipbuilding program would create jobs at shipyards in &lt;a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Norfolk&lt;/a&gt;, Virginia, with Virginia potentially gaining more jobs than it lost.

Gates did not announce new cuts in military hardware programs, but stated "any bill that takes the alternate engine to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%20III"&gt;C-17s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the president, I am confident will be vetoed", referring to a proposed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 485 million program for the aircraft.

"This agenda is not about cutting the department's budget. It is about reforming and reshaping priorities" said Gates, who cast the cuts as efficiency savings. "I am determined to change the way this department has done business for a long time." He also said the cuts were pre-emptive, to stave off deeper cuts mandated by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : "My fear is that in tough times, people will see the defense budget as a place to solve the nation's economic problems."

Today's announcement, according to Gates, is part of a larger program of defense spending cuts. "This effort will not end this fall or with the FY 12 budget submission".

Long has been in government service for over three decades, and her former positions include second in command at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADefense%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Defense Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence, and deputy director of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Naval%20Intelligence"&gt;Naval Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

She also said that "I have never seen an agency as young as the NGA do so much in so little time." The NGA was created in 1996 and collects and analyzes overhead imagery and geospatial information. The agency's motto is "Know the Earth, Show the Way."

&lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Dianne%20Feinstein"&gt;Dianne Feinstein&lt;/a&gt;, chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, said that a woman director at a major intelligence agency was a key milestone, and she also said that "this is an important appointment, and I hope that she will bring a new and determined management ability to this agency." &lt;a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CIA) director &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeon%20Panetta"&gt;Leon Panetta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that Long's appointment was an "outstanding choice" and that "having served in so many important roles over the course of her distinguished career, she will undoubtedly exercise strong leadership at NGA and help identify new ways to meet those challenges."

Though women have served in as second in charge in the &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Reconnaissance%20Office"&gt;National Reconnaissance Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and at the NGA, they have not served in the No. 2 position at the CIA.

A family of six were injured at Flat Rock Bridge Family Resort and campground in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALebanon%2C%20Maine"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Maine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; after a severe thunderstorm caused trees to topple, with one landing on a tent. A 10-year-old girl was critically injured after a tree fell on the tent she was sleeping in. Witnesses say the girl was pinned under the tree for at least 10 minutes before they were able to remove it.

Witnesses also say the day was beautiful and sunny, but at around 6:00 p.m. (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) a storm rolled in, darkening the sky, followed by heavy winds and rain. Witnesses describe a "funnel-like wind" which lifted items off the ground and threw them around. The strong winds then brought down trees and limbs, with one landing on the family's campsite and tent. Severe lightning was also reported.

"The female patient was loaded into Lebanon Ambulance One and transported to Frisbie Hospital in Rochester to be stabilized and then was transferred to the trauma center at Maine Medical Center. Her injuries were considered critical and life threatening when she left the scene," said Jason Cole, the assistant rescue chief for the area. The victims names have not been released and the girl's current condition is not yet known.

Rescuers responding to the scene noticed several other trees and limbs scattered around other campsites and searched all 350 sites, but no other injuries were reported. Other campers say they had several close calls with tree limbs and debris. At least 12 trees were reported to have toppled during the storm. The family's car was also destroyed when a tree limb landed on it.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Maine says it will investigate whether or not the storm produced a tornado.

A gold mine collapse in &lt;a href="Copiap%C3%B3"&gt;Copiapó&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Atacama%20Region"&gt;Atacama Region&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; has trapped 33 miners since last Thursday. Another collapse occurred on Saturday, that provoked temporary suspension of the rescue works.

Rescue efforts were first focused on a ventilation shaft, but attempts to reach the miners failed. Rescuers have been drilling into the mine since Sunday. "The situation is very complex, the mine continues to have collapses because there is a geological fault-line," said &lt;a href="Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Pi%C3%B1era"&gt;Sebastián Piñera&lt;/a&gt;, President of Chile, who "pledged to do everything possible to get to the trapped miners," but acknowledged he was pessimistic.

There is no certainty that the miners, who are trapped about 400 meters (1300 feet) below the ground, are still alive.

A curfew has been imposed in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASrinagar"&gt;Srinagar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir"&gt;Jammu and Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and other nearby towns today to stop the march to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APampore"&gt;Pampore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by the Separatists. The march was organized to observe the death anniversary of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Parties%20Hurriyat%20Conference"&gt;Hurriyat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASheikh%20Abdul%20Aziz"&gt;Sheikh Abdul Aziz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The separatists asked people to close their businesses for the day and march to Pampore, where Aziz was buried. Aziz was killed during the '&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMuzaffarabad%20chalo"&gt;Muzaffarabad chalo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' by the soldiers on August 11, 2008. 

A senior police officer said, "Curfew is in place in old city areas of Srinagar, including uptown Maisuma and Batmaloo localities. Curfew has also been imposed in south Kashmir's Pampore, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APulwama"&gt;Pulwama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Kakpora and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATral"&gt;Tral&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; towns to prevent separatist-incited violence."

A new study suggests that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aplants"&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can adapt to changing climatic conditions more efficiently than previously thought, making the onset of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aclimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; less of a concern for plant species around the world. Jodrell Laboratory in the London Botanical Gardens has discovered that plants can alter specific components of their genetic make-up to suit rising temperatures and varying levels of rainfall that would otherwise take hundred of years to develop through &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20selection"&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , via a process known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aepigenetics"&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

This newly discovered ability suggests that mass plant extinction brought on by climate change may not happen to the extent that scientists previously predicted. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change claimed in 2007 that "20 to 30 per cent of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5C to 2.5C", a statement that now needs re-evaluating.

The study focused on three species of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acommon%20spotted%20orchid"&gt;common spotted orchid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that grow in varying environments. These plants had nearly identical genetic heritage, but thrived under very different conditions. Mark Chase of Jodrell Laboratory claims that "[their] results are particularly relevant in the present context of widespread environmental challenges and give us more hope in the adaptive potential of organisms [...] it is not instantaneous, but it is much faster than we thought previously".

It is still unclear whether plants would adapt in the same way under "extreme" climate change.

<h3>Tamil migrant boat bound for Canada sparks debate</h3>
Hundreds of &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATamil"&gt;Tamils&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; seeking asylum in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; unboarded their cargo ship that they used to sail from Sri Lanka to Vancouver. Some of the people who were on board the ♡❤MV Sun Sea ♡❤ needed medical treatment, but officials have said that they were not aware of major medical problems. 

The landing of the 490 refugees, however, has raised concerns that some onboard might have been members of the Tamil Tigers Sri Lankan rebel group. The Tigers, who fought a civil war against the Sri Lankan government for over two decades and lost in 2009, have been designated a terrorist group by the Canadian government since 2006. "Our goal is to ensure that our refugee system is not hijacked by criminals or terrorists," Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said. Toews also said that the governnment would be taking a tough line with the ship's passengers.

<h3>South Carolina Senate candidate Alvin Greene indicted on felony charge</h3>

The 32 year-old Greene was arrested last November after allegedly showing a female student obscene photos on his laptop and then asking to come to her dorm room. Greene shot to instant fame after he won the South Carolina Democratic senate primary with 58% of the vote despite not campaigning or raising funds for his US senate bid.

The site is located in &lt;a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.

Obama, who stated his endorsement at an annual dinner celebrating the &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic holiday of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARamadan"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said, "As a citizen, and as president, I believe that Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances. This is America, and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakable."

Reaction to the presidential endorsement was mixed. New York City mayor &lt;a href="Michael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, a staunch supporter of building the Cordoba House Islamic Center, has said that Obama's comments were a "clarion defense of the freedom of religion." However, many Republicans were angry, including US Representative Peter King, Republican-New York, who said that "President Obama is wrong." Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer stated that "the governor of New York offered to help find land to build the mosque elsewhere. A mosque really seeking to build bridges ... would accept the offer." Other right-wing politicians, including Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich, have opposed the mosque, calling the World Trade Center site "hallowed ground."

After years of rumours &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Lucas"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; personally announced at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars%20Celebration"&gt;Star Wars "Celebration V"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Convention in &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; the worldwide release of the Star Wars Saga on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABlu-ray"&gt;Blu-ray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in autumn 2011. All six films will be released as a box-set with high video- and audio-quality and containing additional features.

Specific details have not been mentioned, but a "deleted scene" was shown at the convention, where Luke Skywalker assembles a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alightsabre"&gt;lightsabre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "Blu-ray is the absolute best way to experience Star Wars at home – in pristine high definition,” said George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars Saga. “The films have never looked or sounded better."

According to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, George Lucas said that they wanted to wait with the Blu-ray Disc release until market penetration was high enough, because they learned from the 1980s VHS release that an early release on a new home-video system can negatively influence sale figures.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ learned yesterday that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALucasfilm"&gt;Lucasfilm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have issued copyright claims to &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; regarding videos related to the convention and the deleted scene that is now slated for release. As a result, YouTube has removed at least two videos showing this content.

<h3>Mother confesses to suffocating her two children</h3>
An unemployed, single mother from &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; has confessed to suffocating her two toddler children with her bare hands. After suffocating her one year-old and two year-old sons, 29 year-old Shaquan Duley drove her car into a river. Police have identified the suffocated children as Ja'van T. Duley and Devean C. Duley. She faces two murder charges and is scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday.

Duley had apparently argued with her mother the night before the murder. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrangeburg%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina"&gt;Orangeburg County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sheriff Larry Williams has stated that "We believe this is a direct response [to the argument] from Ms. Duley. I believe she was just fed up with her mother telling her she couldn't take care of the children and she wasn't taking care of her children and she just wanted to be free." Williams also said that Shaquan's mother "was a very, I guess, firm individual. ... She often talked with her daughter about, I guess, maybe being more of a mother or being more reliable."

<h3>US officials visit American sentenced to hard labor in North Korea</h3>
&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; officials said Monday that an American, Aijalon Mahli Gomes, sentenced to hard labor in &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; was visited by a US consular official and two American doctors. 

"We requested permission to visit Mr. Gomes. That permission from the North Korean government was granted," said U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley. Crowley also said that "We requested permission to bring Mr. Gomes home. Unfortunately, he remains in North Korea."

North Korea said that Gomes was hospitalized after attempting suicide. Gomes was arrested by North Korean authorities and sentenced to eight years of hard labor in January after the 31 year-old man alledgedly attempted to cross the border with China.

<h3>General Motors recalls 243,000 crossover vehicles</h3>
&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; car company &lt;a href="General%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; (GM) said Tuesday that it will recall 243,000 crossover vehicles due to faulty seat belts. The crossovers recalled include the Saturn Outlook, Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia and Chevrolet Traverse. The damage to the seat belts could happen after the second row seats in the car-based SUVs are returned to a upright position after being folded. The damage causes the seat belt to feel correctly latched when it is possibly not.

&lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; based game-developer Realtime Worlds entered &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdministration%20%28law%29"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today following low sales of their online shooter game, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAPB%3A%20All%20Points%20Bulletin"&gt;All-Points Bulletin (APB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Between 60 and 170 jobs will be lost, and a total closure of their &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; office has been announced. APB will stay online to gamers who have already purchased the game. The company's administrators are &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABegbies%20Traynor"&gt;Begbies Traynor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 

A former employee heavily criticised the company's business plans, saying "[t]he problem was that management looked at the revenue they wanted to generate and priced accordingly, failing to realise (or care) that there are literally a dozen top quality, subscription free team based shooters. Many of which, now, have progression and persistence of some sort – for free... The sheer time spent and money it took to make APB is really a product of fairly directionless creative leadership."

The game's early announcement, over-reliance on one product and "letting the details emerge along the way, rather than being planned out beyond even a rudimentary form," were also blamed. The company now seeks to restructure, with an aim to provide support for the new game and to work on their next release, Project: My World. This &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20networking"&gt;social networking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; game is still intended to be released, although ♡❤The Courier♡❤ reports that every member of the development team is now jobless.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (FDA) has recalled 380 million eggs and the number is expected to grow, after around 300 in &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and 2,000 nationwide became infected with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asalmonella"&gt;salmonella&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after eating eggs distributed by Wright County Eggs.

The contaminated eggs were sold under the labels Lucerne, Albertson, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma's, Sunshine, Hillandale, Trafficanda, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, Lund, Dutch Farms, Kemps, Bayview, Mountain Dairy, NuLay and Sun Valley. Eggs have been sold in seventeen states.

Wright County Egg's owner has been previously cited for breaking environmental laws. 

In response to the outbreak the FDA deployed an initial team of ten investigators to Wright County Egg in &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; to inspect the farms and determine the source of the contamination. Although no official statement has been issued, it is believed animals including birds and rodents defecated where food for chickens is stored.

The outbreak is believed to have started in early July, around the time new federal regulations to prevent salmonella contamination of eggs took effect. 

According to the FDA, the symptoms of salmonella infection includes fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Unable to avoid last place on the ladder, Warragul played for pride as they lead by five points at the end of the first quarter. They surrendered the lead in the second quarter to trail by three points at half time and seven points at the end of the third quarter.

The fourth quarter saw Warragul kick three goals and three behinds to Wonthaggi's two goals and one behind. This effort granted Warragul their only win in the 2010 season.

Around the grounds, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADrouin%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Drouin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defeated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATraralgon"&gt;Traralgon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by 53 points, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeongatha"&gt;Leongatha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defeated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoe%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Moe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by 20 points, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMorwell%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Morwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defeated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASale%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Sale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by 20 points.

The arrest warrant issued for &lt;a href="Wikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt;' editor-in-chief &lt;a href="Julian%20Assange"&gt;Julian Assange&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Aquash"&gt;quashed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Chief Prosecutor Eva Finné, who said in a press release "I am of the opinion that there is no reason to suspect that he has committed a rape." The press officer of the Swedish Prosecution Authority says that he is still suspected of molestation, and that neither police nor prosecutors have yet been able to contact Assange. Assange had this morning said that he was going to hand himself in to police but also said that the accusations against him were false. The investigation is continuing.

A warrant for Assange's arrest was issued on Friday evening after the Stockholm police informed prosecutors that he had been accused of rape. According to ♡❤Expressen's♡❤ sources two women between 20 and 30 years old are the alleged victims. Police and prosecutor Maria Häljebo Kjellstrand told Swedish news agency &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATidningarnas%20Telegrambyr%C3%A5"&gt;TT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that the alleged molestation took place in Stockholm on the night of 13–14 August and the alleged rape happened "later" in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnk%C3%B6ping"&gt;Enköping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . (♡❤Expressen's♡❤ sources say the alleged rape occurred on Tuesday.) Beyond that they have refused to comment. Sources told ♡❤Expressen♡❤ that the two women knew each other and "knew that they had been the victims of the same thing". A source says that the women were afraid of Assange's "position of power" and had been reluctant to make a formal report to the police. However, on Sunday one of his accusers was interviewed by ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAftonbladet"&gt;Aftonbladet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ and denied that they were scared of Assange: "It is wrong to say that we were frightened of Assange and that we hadn't wanted to report him for that reason. He's not violent and I do not feel threatened by him."

Assange was in Sweden last week to talk about his work and to defend Wikileaks' publication of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfghan%20War%20Diary"&gt;Afghan War Diary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a set of tens of thousands of secret US military documents whose publication has angered the Pentagon and the Obama administration. He had also met Swedish &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APirate%20Party%20%28Sweden%29"&gt;Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARickard%20Falkvinge"&gt;Rickard Falkvinge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and signed a deal in which the party agreed to provide Wikileaks with server space. The Pirate Party is continuing its cooperation with Wikileaks despite the allegations against Assange.

Assange has denied the allegations in e-mails to Swedish media and on Wikileaks' &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATwitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; feed, saying "the charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing." An official statement on the Wikileaks blog says: "We are deeply concerned about the seriousness of these allegations. We the people behind WikiLeaks think highly of Julian and he has our full support. While Julian is focusing on his defenses and clearing his name, WikiLeaks will be continuing its regular operations."

<h1>Tropical Storm Danielle forms in Atlantic Ocean</h1>
Tropical Storm Danielle, fourth named storm of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2010 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has formed in the eastern &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph). Scientists at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; predict that Danielle will strengthen to a hurricane by Wednesday. 
As the storm is far from landfall, it remains difficult to assess potential impact to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Caribbean"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;.

The storm formed near the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Verde%20Islands"&gt;Cape Verde Islands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; off the coast of West Africa, being classified as Tropical Depression Six. It then developed into a more organized cyclone moving eastward. Forecast models show it will stay on an eastward track, later turning to the Northeast. If the models are correct, Danielle will avoid any landfall across the Eastern United States.

Meteorologists predict that Danielle will be the first of several storms to form within the next two weeks, as the Atlantic Hurricane season is currently at its peak. "There are signs that the Atlantic is acting like it should in August and September. We're seeing more activity than we did earlier in the season," said Rick Knabb of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWeather%20Channel"&gt;Weather Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Even though the 2010 season seems to be one with low activity, emergency officials are still stressing safety and awareness to residents in hurricane-prone areas. "It only takes one storm to cause a loss of lives and devastating property damage. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Andrew"&gt;Hurricane Andrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was a catastrophic Category 5 storm that came during a year when it was a lower-than-average season.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Cubs"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; manager &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALou%20Piniella"&gt;Lou Piniella&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced Sunday that he will retire from &lt;a href="MLB"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; after almost fifty years of coaching, managing, and playing the sport. 

Piniella's announcement came after the Chicago Cubs lost to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Braves"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 16-5 at the Cub's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWrigley%20Field"&gt;Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The 66 year-old Piniella said that he was retiring because of family issues. For much of the 2010 MLB season, Piniella's 90 year-old mother has been ill.

"This will be the last time I put on a uniform. This has been very special for me. I'll go home, do what I have to do there...and enjoy my retirement," said Piniella. "My mom needs me at home; she hasn't gotten any better since I've been here. In fact, she's had other complications. Rather than continue to go home, come back...It's not fair to the team, not fair to the players. The best thing to do is to step down, go home and take care of my mother," he added.

During his 18 year career as a player, Piniella logged 1,705 hits. As a manager, he also won 1,800 games over the course of 23 years. Mike Quade, The Cub's third-base and outfield coach, will be Cubs manager for the remainder of the 2010 season.

A former Filipino policeman has kept &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in &lt;a href="Manila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. Rolando Mendoza fired his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AM16%20rifle"&gt;M16 rifle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the tourists. Several hostages have been rescued and least six have been confirmed dead so far. Six hostages, including the children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers. The photographers later took the place of an aged lady as she needed the lavatory. Mendoza was gunned down.

Mendoza was fired from the Police Force after robbery and drugs claims. His brother explained that 'his problem was he was unjustly removed from service. There was no due process, no hearing, no complaint.' Both government officials and his brother had tried to negotiate with him to release the hostages.

Mendoza stuck handwritten notes on the bus. One threatened that a 'big deal' would happen after 3pm; another said 'big mistake to correct a big wrong decision'. Yet another attempted to catch the attention of the media.

Gunshots were heard inside the bus and Mendoza was shot down. The police rescued the hostages on the bus. The number of survivors totalled seven. Nine were confirmed dead.

The Hong Kong government consulted Hong Thai Travel and decided to send a plane to take the survivors back to Hong Kong. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmbrose%20Lee"&gt;Ambrose Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; led an ♡❤ad hoc♡❤ group to deal with the incident. One police officer and one Immigration Department officer flew from Hong Kong to Manila to help.

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Tokyo"&gt;University of Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; group of researchers, led by bioengineer Shoji Takeuchi, has made an electronic sensor capable of smelling gases. The sensor uses genetically engineered frog cells. Since previous sensors were not very accurate, the scientist decided to try a biological approach. The invention was revealed in a US scientific journal yesterday, and is supposed to be used to design better machines to detect polluting gases in the atmosphere.

Previous smell sensors were based on quartz rods, which vibrate when a substance binds to them. The gases are distinguished by their molar masses, which can be similar for molecules with different structure, thus relatively often triggering a false positive. Trying to find a more accurate solution, Takeuchi decided to follow an example from insect world. As he explained, "when you think about the mosquito, it is able to find people because of carbon dioxide from the human. So the mosquito has CO receptors. When we can (extract) DNA (from the mosquito) we can put this DNA into the frog eggs to detect CO."

Genes of several insects (the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABombyx%20mori"&gt;silk moth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adiamondback%20moth"&gt;diamondback moth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afruit%20fly"&gt;fruit fly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), injected into African clawed frog ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20clawed%20frog"&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ eggs, allowed them to produce relatively inexpensive and useful sensors. The choice of the species was caused by their widely studied and well-understood protein expression mechanism.

The modified cells responded to three kinds of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APheromone"&gt;pheromones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and one odourant, which have similar chemical properties. When a molecule of an odorous substance adhered to the receptor on the membrane protein, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIon%20channel"&gt;ion channels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; opened for a certain period of time, and a current was generated. Its magnitude was clearly different for all four tested substances, allowing to distinguish between them accurately.

The colleagues embedded the sensor into a mannequin, so that it could shake its head when a gas was detected. It was easier to observe. Pheromones and molecules with quite similar molecule structure produced clearly distinguishable reaction, with higher accuracy than other biological or human-made sensors. As the research group said, the detection sensitivity of the odor sensor is several tens of parts per billion (ppb), and it is as high as the sensitivity of an existing odor sensor that uses an oxide semiconductor. The distinctive feature of the new sensor is its capability to selectively detect some odorous substances, rather than its sensitivity. Very few false positives were possible due to the biological mechanism involved.

At normal temperature, the sensor lifetime is about 12 hours, which can be extended by putting it into a refrigerator before first use.

Shoji Takeuchi says has a great hope for research use in future, since the frog eggs are very practical for genetic engineering, and can be conveniently used to develop smell sensors for a wide range of gases. He said, "The ♡❤X. laevis♡❤ oocyte has high versatility for the development of chemical sensors for various odorants. We believe that a shared ability to smell might open a new relationship between man and robot. .. The research will have wide implications... If the sensor is embedded in a nursing robot, it will be able to identify certain mouth odors or body odors. Also, it can be used for detecting CO, air pollution, water pollution and food. It's very important for the environment."

Hurricane Danielle is the second hurricane of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2010 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

North America is simultaneously threatened by Tropical Storm Frank. The 80 km/h (50 mph) storm in the Pacific Ocean is about 210 km (130 miles) south-south west of Acapulco, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Mexico has issued a tropical storm watch in the area.

Hurricane Danielle formed near the &lt;a href="Cape%20Verde"&gt;Cape Verde&lt;/a&gt; Islands off the coast of West Africa, being classified as Tropical Depression Six. It then developed into a more organized cyclone.

Meteorologists predict that Danielle will be the first of several storms to form within the next two weeks, as the Atlantic hurricane season is currently at its peak. "There are signs that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is acting like it should in August and September. We're seeing more activity than we did earlier in the season," said Rick Knabb of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWeather%20Channel"&gt;Weather Channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Even though the 2010 season seems to be one with low activity, emergency officials are still stressing safety and awareness to residents in hurricane-prone areas. "It only takes one storm to cause a loss of lives and devastating property damage," Lauren McKeague, Florida Division of Emergency Management, says. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Andrew"&gt;Hurricane Andrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was a catastrophic Category 5 storm that came during a year when it was a lower-than-average season.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20Army%20revives%20next-generation%20Ground%20Combat%20Vehicle%20program&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Tuesday the U.S. Army released its revised solicitation for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGCV%20Infantry%20Fighting%20Vehicle"&gt;Ground Combat Vehicle infantry fighting vehicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; three months after scrapping its previous plans.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Army retracted its first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARequest%20for%20proposal"&gt;solicitation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) on 25 August. It was decided by the army to begin anew after a "red team" recommended that the army either upgrade the existing ground vehicle fleet or rewrite the requirements. Program officials choose to end evaluations of vehicle submissions and to begin again in two months with new requirements.

The previous design requirements emphasized modularity, affordability, rapid design and low risk technology. The infantry fighting vehicle variant would have carried a crew of three and nine infantry dismounts. It was initially to be compatible with the current Battle Command Control and Communications Suite but would gradually use a more revolutionary network. The system would support networking between external systems, vehicles and soldiers. It was to be transportable by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%20III"&gt;C-17 cargo aircraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , rail, and ship and be as logistically deployable as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStryker"&gt;Stryker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The army officials were open to tracked or wheeled submissions but suggested that it be tracked due to the weight stemming from the requirements. The vehicle had an off-road speed requirement of 30 mph (50 km/h) and was required to deliver improved maintainability and consume less fuel than the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABradley%20Fighting%20Vehicle"&gt;Bradley Fighting Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The army wanted the vehicle to leverage an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aautocannon"&gt;autocannon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a anti-tank guided missile system and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANon-lethal%20weapon"&gt;non-lethal weapons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The army wanted the vehicle to have the blast protection level equal to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMRAP%20%28armored%20vehicle%29"&gt;MRAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and supplement armor with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AActive%20protection%20system"&gt;active protection systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The army wanted the first vehicle variant to be a troop carrier that would displace the aging &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AM113%20armored%20personnel%20carrier"&gt;M113 APCs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AM2%20Bradley"&gt;M2 Bradleys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Later, other variants of the GCV would appear.

There were four known competing contractors for the Ground Combat Vehicle contract. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABAE%20Systems%20inc."&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; led a team consisting of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorthrop%20Grumman"&gt;Northrop Grumman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQinetiQ"&gt;QinetiQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaft"&gt;Saft Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . BAE offered a tracked vehicle with a hybrid-electric engine, a baseline weight of 53 tons and a maximum weight tolerance of 75 tons for modular armor and various countermeasures including a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AV-hull"&gt;V-hull&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and active protection systems. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Dynamics"&gt;General Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; led a team consisting of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%20Diesel"&gt;Detroit Diesel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARaytheon"&gt;Raytheon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . General Dynamics offered a vehicle using diesel and leveraging an active protection system. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASAIC%20%28company%29"&gt;SAIC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; led a consortium called Team Full Spectrum which included &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKrauss-Maffei"&gt;Krauss-Maffei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARheinmetall"&gt;Rheinmetall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . SAIC offered a vehicle based on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APuma%20%28IFV%29"&gt;Puma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Advanced Defense Vehicle Systems (ADVS) submitted its proposal for a wheeled vehicle but was rejected for being non-compliant.

The predecessor to the GCV, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFuture%20Combat%20Systems%20manned%20ground%20vehicles"&gt;Manned Ground Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; family, was canceled in April 2009. Similar programs like the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AM8%20armored%20gun%20system"&gt;M8 light tank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AXM2001%20Crusader"&gt;XM2001 Crusader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have also been scrapped in the past. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AExpeditionary%20Fighting%20Vehicle"&gt;Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Light%20Tactical%20Vehicle"&gt;Joint Light Tactical Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and Ground Combat Vehicle programs have been targeted for cancellation by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Commission%20on%20Fiscal%20Responsibility%20and%20Reform"&gt;National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Ian Baldwin, of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMax%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Chemical%20Ecology"&gt;Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJena"&gt;Jena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and colleagues have discovered a multi-step protective mechanism of tobacco plants against ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManduca%20sexta"&gt;Manduca sexta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ caterpillars. In response to a chemical in the caterpillars' larvae, the plants release an odorous substance into air to attract another species of insects, called "big-eyed bugs" (♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeocoris"&gt;Geocoris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤). These carnivores come to the scene and attack the caterpillars. The response is triggered within 24 hours, which is a relatively short period of time. The discovery occurred as a result of field studies in a nature preserve in southwestern &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUtah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The phenomenon starts with the recognition of the caterpillars by the plant. As a PhD student in the Department of Molecular Ecology Silke Allmann explained, "The plant cannot see its attacker, but plants can sense the digestive substances that attacking larvae have in their oral secretions when these substances come into contact with the leaves." To test that, the scientists coated some of caterpillars' eggs on two groups of tobacco plants and glued them. On one of the groups, the glue was mixed with caterpillars' split. The latter got more attention of the attackers, getting 25% of eggs destroyed against 8% for the other group.

Allmann supposed that "The simplest assumption is that the larval oral secretions contain a special enzyme, probably an isomerase, which rearranges the Z:E ratio of the aldehyde in favor of (E)-2-hexenal." The researchers heated the oral secretion to destroy the enzyme, and applied it to wounded leaves. No plant response related to the studied process was observed, confirming the hypothesis.

(E)-2-hexenal is a strong antibiotic agent. The food consumed by a caterpillar typically includes hundreds of microorganisms together with leaf tissue, which are mostly unneeded and killed by the above-mentioned substance quickly. Because of this important role of this substance, the caterpillars can't change their metabolism easily enough to prevent the subsequent events from happening.
To find out what happens after a caterpillar's presence is noted by the plant, Silke Allmann, a graduate student in Baldwin's group, examined the green leafy volatiles (GLVs), the substances responsible for the smell of fresh-cut plant parts. These substances are released into air if a plant is damaged. As the study released, the tobacco plant GLVs typically have a major share of Z isomers with very small amount of E isomers present. But the shares are distributed equally during a caterpillar attack. In a study with varying amount of different isomers present, E isomers turned out to be the ones attracting the predators to come to the scene and to attack the caterpillars.

What is surprising, Silke Allmann found that the caterpillars are the direct stimulus of this change: caterpillar saliva converts the Z-isomers of the GLV molecules to E-isomers. Prof. Ian Baldwin commented, "That's where it got really weird. Why would a caterpillar do this to itself?" He suggested that the E-GLVs could have anti-biotic effect in the caterpillar's digestive system.

The speed of the triggered reaction is relatively fast, it taking about one hour for the GLV isomers ratio change, and about 24 hours for the predators to be attracted by the substance released into the air. As Prof. Ian Baldwin, who was leading the research, said, "Other indirect defense mechanisms of plants require the activation of new metabolic pathways for the release of odorant signals, and these responses are much slower."

The multi-step intricate approach involved is attracting the attention of scientists, who are looking forward to its application in agriculture. Baldwin noted that "in effect, the caterpillar calls the police on itself", and suggested to genetically modify crops to release similar signals to defend themselves against pests.

The Gippsland League is the only major &lt;a href="Australian%20rules%20football"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; competition in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia.

Traralgon defeated traditional rivals Morwell in the Qualifying Final to progress to the Second Semi Final against Maffra. Morwell now progress the the elimination First Semi Final to play either Leongather or Drouin, who are playing each other in the Elimination Final for the second straight year.

Nicole John, the daughter of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEric%20G.%20John"&gt;Eric John&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the current &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20ambassador"&gt;US ambassador&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, has died after falling from an apartment building in New York City. Nicole John, 17, fell to her death from the top floor of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHerald%20Towers"&gt;Herald Towers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a 25-storey building. She was attending a party and had been believed to have been drinking. Police said that it is suspected that she had climbed out of the window ledge to take a picture when she slipped and fell.

John's death has been ruled as an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aaccident%20%28Cause%20of%20Death%29"&gt;accident&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but 25-year old Ilan Nassimi, the tenant of the room she fell from has been arrested on charges of giving alcohol to a minor. John had been clubbing with friends before she arrived at Nassimi's party. She was using a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afake%20identification"&gt;fake identification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; card which stated her age at either 23 or 24.

A spokesman for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATenjune"&gt;Tenjune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; club John was at earlier in the night confirmed that security did check her I.D. He said "The technology can be so good that people are developing ways to sneak into places every day," said a source close to the club. "There are some [fake IDs] that are uncatchable."

Nassimi defends his innocence saying that he was unaware that John was under 21. He told police that he met her in a club and expressed to several people his interest in hosting an after party.

<h1>UK scientists discover multiple antibiotics used by fungus-farming ants to protect colonies</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20scientists%20discover%20multiple%20antibiotics%20used%20by%20fungus-farming%20ants%20to%20protect%20colonies&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20East%20Anglia"&gt;University of East Anglia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; researchers led by Dr Matt Hutchings have discovered that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeafcutter%20ant"&gt;leafcutter ants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; deploy several antibiotics to protect fungi they grow as food for their queen and larvae. It is the first time ants have been found using more than one antibiotic in combination. The new antibiotics discovered have anti-fungal effect, and can be useful for modern medicine. &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMedical%20Research%20Council%20%28UK%29"&gt;Medical Research Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; funded the investigation.
♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAcromyrmex%20octospinosus"&gt;Acromyrmex octospinosus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ leaf cutter ants form the biggest known animal colonies, reaching several million individuals. They are native to South and Central America, but are now found in the southern &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; as well. They are known to grow fungi gardens, and this is why the researchers looked into the interaction of ants and fungi. The scientists collected them from three colonies in &lt;a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt;. UEA professor Dr Matt Hutchings explained, "This was really a fun project which started with a PhD student, Joerg Barke, streaking leaf-cutting ants onto agar plates to isolate antibiotic producing bacteria."

The health of a certain type of fungus gardens is vital for the ants colony since the fungus is used to feed larvae and the queen. The antibiotics act both as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aherbicide"&gt;herbicides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and regulators of fungus growth. The antibiotics are produced by ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aactinomycete"&gt;actinomycete&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ bacteria, which live in a state of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asymbiosis"&gt;symbiosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with the ants, and are found on the bodies of the ants themselves. The symbiotic relationships benefit both the ants and the bacteria.

As a result of the study, a new antibiotic has also been discovered. It's related to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anystatin"&gt;nystatin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, one of the antifungals used in modern medicine. The researchers expect to discover more new antibiotics and are optimistic about their use in medicine. Dr Matt Hutchings who was leading the research said, "It's also very exciting that ants not only evolved agriculture before humans but also combination therapy with natural antibiotics. Humans are just starting to realize that this is one way to slow down the rise of drug resistant bacteria &amp;mdash; the so called superbugs."

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; architect Kazuyo Sejima, who won this year's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APritzker%20Prize"&gt;Pritzker Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the Biennale's first female director. 

Rem Koolhaas is renown as one of the founders of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20for%20Metropolitan%20Architecture"&gt;Office for Metropolitan Architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (OMA) in 1975, and author of ♡❤Delirious New York♡❤ (1978) and ♡❤S,M,L,XL♡❤ (1995). Among his most important buildings are the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANederlands%20Dans%20Theater"&gt;Netherlands Dance Theatre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at The Hague, the Nexus Housing at Fukuoka in Japan, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKunsthal"&gt;Kunsthal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Rotterdam, the Grand Palais of Euralille in Lille, the Villa dall’Ava in Paris, and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20Public%20Library"&gt;Seattle Public Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . One of his most recent projects is the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Central%20Television%20Headquarters%20building"&gt;China Central Television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CCTV) headquarters building in Beijing. 

The Board also awarded a special Golden Lion in memory of the Japanese architect, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKazuo%20Shinohara"&gt;Kazuo Shinohara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who died in 2006. The Golden Lion for the best National Participation was this year awarded to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abahrain"&gt;Kingdom of Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Located in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVenice"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVenetian%20Arsenal"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVenice%20giardini"&gt;Giardini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Biennale will be open until November 21.

It has been confirmed that footballer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADidier%20Drogba"&gt;Didier Drogba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has quit the &lt;a href="Cote%20d%27Ivoire"&gt;Cote D’Ivoire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACote%20D%E2%80%99Ivoire%20National%20Football%20Team"&gt;National Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The announcment has come after a week full of rumours that Drogba may leave the national side. His withdrawal was announced by new team coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Zahoui"&gt;François Zahoui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Zahoui said at a press confrence that he had a meeting with Drogba. Zahoui traveled to &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and met up with Drogba. Speaking of his meeting he said "I truly met Drogba in London. He told me he was so tired that he wanted to withdraw from the national team for a while. Drogba is a world class player who is indispensable for the Elephants, but I had to respect his decision. We will let him rest to recover his mental and physical strength and pray he comes back some day to the national team."

Several sport commentators have reported that it is more likley that Drogba withdrew from the team because he was frustrated with the F.A and the set-up of the team. However &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Anoma"&gt;Jacques Anoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the President of the F.A, has said that there is no problem between Drogba and the F.A.

Drogba is one of the Ivory Coast's best known players. He has made 71 apperances and scored 45 goals.

Research teams from the universities of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Georgia"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow%20University"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; discovered the mechanism the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrypanosoma"&gt;Trypanosome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; parasite evolved for "sleeping sickness" disease to circumvent the human immune system. Their study follows a recent &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n outbreak of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20trypanosomiasis"&gt;the disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this parasite causes. The discovery is expected to help develop a cure preventing future deaths.

The 1998–2001 sleeping sickness epidemics in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Sudan"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Angola"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; caused tens of thousands of deaths. The parasites are spread by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atsetse%20flies"&gt;tsetse flies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It is considered one of the worst epidemics in the last five decades. As &lt;a href="World%20Health%20Organization"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; reported, subsequent recent introduction of population screening in rural areas and distribution of more effective drugs had potentially reduced the number of death incidents. However, the main effect of these measures being a decrease in spreading of the parasite and not in decrease of the death rate, the researchers decided to tackle the puzzle.

The scientists studied the molecules the human immune system activates in response to the attack. They were looking for the way the parasites inhibit it and lead to the death of the victim. Of the several known parasite species, the two that can infect humans were chosen to study, called ♡❤Trypanosoma brucei gambiense♡❤ and ♡❤Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense♡❤. Several others also exist, but they affect only animals.

Researchers knew that the Trypanosoma attacks typically are repelled by an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHigh-density%20lipoprotein"&gt;HDL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , more specifically ♡❤trypanosome lytic factor-1♡❤ (TLF-1). It is generated in the humans' immune system and is toxic to the parasites but not to humans. It was known that one of the parasites, ♡❤T. b. rhodensiense♡❤, has evolved an inhibitor of the toxic chemical, called Serum Resistance Associated (SRA) protein. However the other one, ♡❤T. b. gambiense♡❤, was responsible for over 95% of human deaths, and it had been previously unknown why. 

The study showed that a gene mutation has lead to a change in the parasite's surface protein receptor. It doesn't bind to TLF-1 as well as for other species, leading to a substantial decrease in TLF-1 uptake by the parasite. The receptor is more strict, causing a lower nutrient intake as well, but it suffices, and the parasite defends against the human immune system. 

As professor and head of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at UGA (and one of the leaders of the research) Stephen Hajduk explained, "Humans have evolved TLF-1 as a highly specific toxin against African trypanosomes by tricking the parasite into taking up this HDL because it resembles a nutrient the parasite needs for survival. But T. b. gambiense has evolved a counter measure to these human 'Trojan horses' simply by barring the door and not allowing TLF-1 to enter the cell, effectively blocking human innate immunity and leading to infection and ultimately disease."

Based on the results of the research, humans could possibly develop a defense mechanism to keep the parasites from evading the human defense system. Stephen Hajduk commented, "We believe this research represents a paradigm shift and causes us to think more broadly about how pathogens avoid host defense mechanisms. It turns out that African trypanosomes have evolved a diversity of ways to avoid human innate and acquired immune systems."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOwen%20Edwards%20%28broadcaster%29"&gt;Owen Edwards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the former director of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Cymru%20Wales"&gt;BBC Wales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the first chief executive of Welsh language television station &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS4C"&gt;S4C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , died on Monday at the age of 76. Edwards had suffered from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParkinson%27s%20Disease"&gt;Parkinson's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for over twenty years.

Edwards started his career with the BBC in 1950 as a broadcaster. He worked on regional news programmes and reported on such events as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAberfan%20disaster"&gt;Aberfan disaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In 1961 he began presenting ♡❤Heddiw♡❤ (‘Today’), the BBC's Welsh early evening news programme. He took a role behind the camera in 1966.

In 1974, Edwards was made director of BBC Wales. Under his control, both &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%20Wales"&gt;Radio Wales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%20Cymru"&gt;Radio Cymru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were launched. He left the post in 1981 to found S4C, a Welsh language television station. He stayed with the channel until his retirement in 1989. In 2008, Edwards was presented with a special achievement award for his contributions to media.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMenna%20Richards"&gt;Menna Richards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the current director of BBC Wales, commented on Edwards death. She said, “He was a man who truly loved Wales, and his legacy to our nation's public life is rich and enduring.” Current S4C chair &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Walter%20Jones%20%28Wales%29"&gt;John Walter Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said, “He managed to establish a Welsh language television service that was admired throughout the world.”

On Monday, Australian telecommunications company &lt;a href="Telstra"&gt;Telstra&lt;/a&gt; has introduced dual carrier &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEvolved%20HSPA"&gt;HSPA+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; standard for broadband Internet business customers in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANext%20G"&gt;Next G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; network. This is the first time this technology is being introduced on national scale. The bandwidths the users can deploy increased into two to three times, with Telstra becoming the world’s fastest national mobile broadband service. The switch started with enabling the service for premium users. After some feedback, Telstra may expand the plan.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The higher speeds for wireless are intended to simplify and ease multitasking of users.

John Paitaridis, Telstra's executive director, network products and services in Enterprise &amp; Government, said "One of the reasons we decided to launch first to Enterprise And Government and Business customers is that clients are saying that their ability to access applications quicker makes a difference to their business and when they start to equate time savings and doing calculations around productivity it does become a return on investment."

Telstra Business Group Managing Director Deena Shiff also stated that the efforts aren't as sudden as it might seem, having feedback of many users as the base.
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; Australians are telling us they can’t afford to be tied to the desk all day and these new speeds mean they can now access mobile broadband at speeds typically reserved for the office. We have been deploying the high-speed capability in the network since December 2009 and now, with the launch of the new Ultimate USB Modem, these new speeds are available to customers across all capital city CBDs and associated airports, selected metropolitan areas and in more than 100 regional locations. These high-speed zones cover approximately 50 per cent of the Australian population and match the areas of highest customer demand and will make the frustration of waiting around for files to download a thing of the past. In other metropolitan and regional areas, the Telstra Ultimate USB Modem offers typical download speeds ranging from 550kbps up to 8Mbps... Our customers have told us that they want higher speed mobile broadband so they can work more flexibly outside of the office and we are delighted to be the first in the world to offer these new blistering speeds on a national network. The new Telstra Ultimate USB Modem provides customers with the speeds needed to handle large files, multi-task and update cloud-hosted applications effortlessly on the go when they are in a coverage area.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – Deena Shiff&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

<h3>Technology</h3>

Previous modems were able to reach peak speed 21Mbps, with real life speeds ranging from 0.5Mbps to 8 Mbps. The theoretically expected maximum of the new technology is 42Mbps with user speeds varying between 1.1 and 20 Mbps. The new speed is twice as fast. This is caused by that the dual-carrier "Evolved High-Speed Packet Access" technology allows networks to send and receive wireless data using two channels simultaneously. This technology can be deployed on Next G networks. Telstra switched to them in February, thus making the switch to HSPA possible now.

<h3>Election campaign</h3>

Telstra delayed the implementation of the new technology until elections end. This decision was intended to avoid wrong interpretation of them by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Coalition's claims include that wireless networks can be an alternative to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "♡❤fibre-to-the-home♡❤" proposal to introduce more expensive wired Internet. The announcement of the new technology, initially planned on August 25, was delayed, with Telstra spokesman Craig Middleton explaining, "We just didn't want to feel like we were influencing the [telecommunications] debate."

The political parties have different plans on development and funds on the Internet. The Labor party aims to spend AUD 43 billion to bring 1 Gbps wired Internet nationwide, and the Coalition plans to spend AUD 6 billion to introduce a variety of improvements including upgrade of existing copper Internet as well as expansion of wireless Internet to support 12Mbps. Opposition leader &lt;a href="Tony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; has said in the past that Australians shouldn’t assume wireless technologies won’t ever be comparable to fixed-line technology. Telstra's upgrade shows that wireless broadband is reaching the 100 Mbps minimum speeds promised by Labor's national broadband network.

<h3>Distribution</h3>

Telstra has only 2000 devices which support the new technology. This is why the opportunity to try it out is being given only to the Business plan customers, and they receive it for the same price as they were paying for the previous NextG plan. Since October 5, the device will be available for sale, with the Business customers able to buy it with 75% discount and a prepaid data allowance. The upgrade is expected to cover roughly 50% of the population. This is happening at the same time as one of Telstra's competitors &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is doubling data download quotas on mobile cap plans.

As some testing showed, real life download speeds reached only about the half of the maximum. Telstra executive director of wireless Mike Wright explained that the predicted figures were the estimates, with real life speeds lower due to interfering environmental conditions: "It's possible to achieve better than the typical user speed claims, but those claims occur in the ideal network environment with good signal quality. When you're out on the streets you get a lot of variation where the network is subject to signal quality, your location and the network load."

A gunman with something strapped to his chest&amp;mdash;believed to be an "explosive device"&amp;mdash;has taken at least one person hostage inside the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADiscovery%20Communications"&gt;Discovery Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; headquarters in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASilver%20Spring%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Silver Spring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. The man is reported to be named James Lee, who has posted an angry rant on a website demanding that Discovery take action over climate change, and was pictured in 2008 protesting against the company.

"Police are on high alert, positioning themselves behind columns, cars, anything that gives cover. All have their weapons drawn. From what we're seeing, everyone seems to be calm," said an eyewitness who was across from the building at the time. In a press conference at 2:30 P.M. (EST), a spokesman for police told the media that police were on scene and talking to the gunman, who has been described as an Asian male.
Employees were sent to the building's upper floors and then evacuated from the building after the gunman entered. A day care center located inside the building, which had over 100 people inside of it at the time, was also evacuated. Roads surrounding the building have been closed to traffic, and witnesses state that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; teams and law enforcement from several areas were at the scene, along with three bomb technicians. 

Lee posted a manifesto on his website, according to sources, which criticized the Discovery Channel. It read "The Discovery Channel and it's affiliate channels MUST have daily television programs at prime time slots...where solutions to save the planet would be done in the same way as the Industrial Revolution was done...The world needs TV shows that develop solutions to the problems that humans are causing, not stupefy the people into destroying the world. Not encouraging them to breed more environmentally harmful humans." The manifesto also included a list of Lee's demands to the Discovery Channel.

It has been reported that police were initially called to the scene upon receiving a report of a suspicious package. &lt;a href="CNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; has reported the man could be a former employee of the network, and a police officer at the scene said that the suspect has "concerns" with Discovery.

&lt;br style="clear:none;"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt; 
<h2>Standoff ends</h2>
The standoff ended when Lee was shot to death by the police.

On Wednesday, &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; announced that the next version of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Mobile"&gt;Windows Mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; OS series, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Phone%207"&gt;Windows Phone 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had been &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoftware%20release%20life%20cycle%23RTM"&gt;released to manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after more than 6 months of its development. The announcement outlined some of the changes in this version, and was generally positive about the milestone.

The term "release to manufacturing", also known as "going gold", is a term used to indicate that the software has reached a point that it is ready to be provided to the customer. After the event, Windows Phone 7 code has been locked down. The work in progress is the testing of Windows Phone 7 on other hardware, software, and networks. The structure of the system itself is not expected to be changed any more before the final release. "We are ready," Terry Myerson said.

"Today is the day that the Windows Phone team has been driving towards, and we’re very excited to say that we’ve reached the biggest milestone for our internal team – the release to manufacturing (RTM) of Windows Phone 7", Terry Myerson announced in a post on the official Windows Phone Blog.

The internal testing of the system had been finished. It included usage of the operating system by the development team itself on regular basis, and millions of hours of automated tests daily, as Terry Myerson said: "We had nearly ten thousand devices running automated tests daily, over a half million hours of active self-hosting use, over three and a half million hours of stress test passes, and eight and a half million hours of fully automated test passes."

The system is now named "Windows Phone" instead of "Windows Mobile", with a redesigned user interface and a changed development environment, which is called "Windows Phone Developer Tools". It features a combination of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASilverlight"&gt;Silverlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AXNA"&gt;XNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; technologies, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVisual%20Studio%202010"&gt;Visual Studio 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to make use of these possible in the applications developers create.

Microsoft did not confirm any planned commercial release date, calling October as an optimistic estimate.

<doc id="203779" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=203779" title="Four British energy suppliers face investigation into claims of misselling">
<h1>Four British energy suppliers face investigation into claims of misselling</h1>
According to the regulator, the obligations are serious and must be followed by energy supplies, or they will face "tougher sanctions than those available under more general consumer protection law." Ofgem has published a guide advising consumers what they should do should an energy salesperson contact them in person of by telephone. Improper sales tactics are still common in the industry&amp;mdash;in 2008 an Ofgem investigation found that 48% of gas customers and 42% of electricity customers were worse off after switching supplier on the doorstep. Npower was fined £1.8 million in 2008 by the organisation, and Ofgem insists that they are "committed to taking action" over improper sales activities by energy companies. “Suppliers have existing obligations to detect and prevent misselling and new licence conditions were brought in following our probe to further increase protection for customers," said Andrew Wright, a Senior Partner of the regulator. "We expect all suppliers to comply with these tougher obligations but if our investigations find otherwise we will take strong action.”

Head of energy at Consumer Focus, Audrey Gallacher, called the investigation "a welcome step ... to address years of customers getting a bad deal on energy prices on their doorstep. While many doorstep sales people will do a good job, the pay and rewards system continues to encourage mis-selling, despite years of regulation and voluntary initiatives. If better advice for customers and enforcement of the tougher rules doesn't end the flagrant abuse of this form of selling the big question will be whether it should be completely banned." Christine McGourty, director of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnergy%20UK"&gt;Energy UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which represents the leading gas and electricity companies, said that "the companies involved will collaborate with the Ofgem investigation and are awaiting further details from the regulator. Any sales agent in breach of the code will be struck off the approved energy sales register." &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhich%3F"&gt;Which?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; chief executive, Peter Vicary-Smith, has said he considers the situation “shocking", saying that the investigation "will do nothing to improve consumer trust in energy suppliers. We're pleased that Ofgem has promised tough measures against any firms guilty of mis-selling. We hope it uses this opportunity to tighten rules around telesales so they are in line with those for face to face sales."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASNP"&gt;SNP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Westminster Energy spokesperson &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Weir%20%28politician%29"&gt;Mike Weir MP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , however, said that the investigation "does nothing to tackle the real problem of fuel prices which leave many Scots facing great difficulty in heating their homes ... Rather than tinkering around the edges Ofgem should be looking at how to reduce prices for vulnerable households." Gareth Kloet, Head of Utilities at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConfused.com"&gt;Confused.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one of the UK’s biggest and most popular price comparison services, also welcomed the inquiry. "It is unacceptable for energy companies to mislead customers like this," he said, adding that Confused.com has previously "urged energy providers to either stop the practice of doorstep selling or make it very clear to households that better deals are available online. There is no reason why door-to-door salesmen can’t show people online deals and even help households switch to them.”

“Our research reveals customers could end up paying £167 more than they need to as door-to-door salesmen are unable to offer the discounts that are applied online. The changes that have been made to date are a welcome addition to safeguard customers; however this review has been much needed for a long time. Hopefully it will mark the end of customers being overcharged and missold," Kloet continued. "Our message to energy consumers remains the same: they should shop around online to make sure they’re getting the best deal possible and turn these salesmen away.”

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Earl"&gt;Hurricane Earl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a large tropical cyclone in the Atlantic ocean, is currently on course to strike parts of the eastern &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , including the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOuter%20Banks"&gt;Outer Banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Cod"&gt;Cape Cod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The storm began near the &lt;a href="Cape%20Verde"&gt;Cape Verde&lt;/a&gt; islands off the coast of Africa, and moved steadily to the west. It then neared the Caribbean, and caused damage in &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnguilla"&gt;Anguilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; before taking a more northwards track. As of now, Earl continues on a northward track, but is expected to turn to the east.

As hurricanes generally are difficult to predict and have vastly changing forecasts sometimes, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ will be providing with readers with live updates on Hurricane Earl. If you are in the path of this storm, remember to follow all updates and evacuation orders by local and federal governments.
