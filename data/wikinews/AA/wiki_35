Well-preserved remains of a baby &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWoolly%20Mammoth"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been found in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYamal%20Peninsula"&gt;Yamal Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASiberia"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. The baby mammoth, named Lyuba, was a six-month-old female at the time of death, approximately 10,000 years ago. 

Mammoths arose about five million years ago, in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APliocene%20Epoch"&gt;Pliocene Epoch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and are closely related to modern &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aelephant"&gt;elephants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Unlike elephants, mammoths had a thick layer of fur. 

They died out about 4,000 years ago, although the population was in substantial decline well before then with more than half the population gone by 11,000 years ago. At present, scientists do not know what caused their extinction. However, major hypotheses include factors such as climate change, hunting by humans, disease, and combinations of these factors.

The specimen is well preserved with some remaining fur and substantially intact eyes and trunk. The only part which is missing is the tail which appears to have been bitten off. There is some hope that the mammoth may be sufficiently well preserved that DNA can be extracted for cloning or for other research.

Today, at 12:00 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;) the &lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20rights"&gt;Animal rights&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals"&gt;People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals&lt;/a&gt; (PETA) staged a "naked" protest in &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Plains%2C%20New%20York"&gt;White Plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. The target of the protest was &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; fashion house, &lt;a href="w%3ABurberry"&gt;Burberry&lt;/a&gt;, and their fur practices.

Two "naked" female PETA members, wearing nothing but &lt;a href="w%3ABikini"&gt;bikini bottoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABody%20painting"&gt;body paint&lt;/a&gt; held billboards with the slogan, "When plaid goes bad." The body paint was done in the trademarked &lt;a href="w%3ABurberry%23The%20Burberry%20Check"&gt;Burberry Check&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APlaid%20%28pattern%29"&gt;plaid&lt;/a&gt; design.

Two other PETA members were there handing out leaflets and showing a video presentation. The painted protesters were spattered with far less fake blood than other documented PETA protests in this campaign.

PETA is protesting Burberry for the company's use of fur in its products and how it is obtained. The group has staged similar protests around the world in its ongoing "BloodyBurberry"-campaign.

The protest took place at the intersection of Westchester Avenue and Bloomingdale Road in front of the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Westchester"&gt;The Westchester&lt;/a&gt;, an upscale shopping mall owned by &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Property%20Group"&gt;Simon Property Group&lt;/a&gt;. Burberry has a retail store in the mall.

This corner is far from the mall's entrances and sees little pedestrian traffic. However, it does see heavy traffic by motorists, before whom the protestors were in plain sight. While ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ was on the scene, police and news media were the only other pedestrians.

The police presence was significant, numbering at least two vehicles and two &lt;a href="w%3AMounted%20police"&gt;mounted police&lt;/a&gt; officers. But since there was no crowd to control, they just hung back. Media was also there in numbers. At least two television crews could be observed.

As far as ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ can tell, Burberry has yet to make any public comment about any of the "BloodyBurberry" protests.

Noted &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; resident and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; merchant and theatre owner &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Mirvish"&gt;Ed Mirvish&lt;/a&gt; has died. On July 11, 2007, the Mirvish family released a statement confirming his passing earlier that morning at &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Michael%27s%20Hospital%20%28Toronto%29"&gt;St. Michael’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, Toronto. "Honest Ed", as he was known, was two weeks away from reaching his 93rd birthday.

"Mr. Mirvish did pass away this morning at around 1:30a.m. at St. Mike's Hospital," said his friend Russell Lazar.

The mayor of Toronto, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miller%20%28Canadian%20politician%29"&gt;David Miller&lt;/a&gt;, told ♡❤CBC News♡❤ that, "His store was about making sure that everyone could afford to live with some dignity and decency. His theatres were about bringing some joy and passion into people's lives."

Mirvish was known for his landmark discount store, &lt;a href="w%3AHonest%20Ed%27s"&gt;Honest Ed's&lt;/a&gt;, and as a patron of the arts who helped revitalize the theatre scene in Toronto.

A fire broke out earlier today at an &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;Airlines&lt;/a&gt; ramp control tower at the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20International%20Airport"&gt;Miami International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The building is currently being constructed. The fire is believed to have been sparked by hot roofing tar that spilled. The building is part of an expansion at the airport.

There fire is confined to the upper deck of the tower. There are no reports of flight delays because of the fire.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; has announced a review into the 'social effects' of gambling, throwing doubt over the government's previous plans to grant a license for a 5,000 m² 'supercasino'.

The review, to take place in September, will look at "whether regeneration in the areas for the super-casinos may be a better way of meeting their economic and social needs than the creation of super-casinos". Gordon Brown made the announcement during Prime Ministers questions, in response to a question from Labour MP &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Reed"&gt;Andy Reed&lt;/a&gt;.

The plan to allow the building of a single supercasino, and 16 smaller casinos, was set in motion by previous Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;. An independent Casino Advisory Panel had recommended in February 2007 that the supercasino license should be granted to the city of Manchester, a recommendation which the Government was expected to follow.

The new announcement by Gordon Brown throws doubt over these plans, and &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;♡❤BBC News♡❤&lt;/a&gt; are quoting an unnamed 'Whitehall source' as having commented that the supercasino plan is "dead in the water".

Results published on Tuesday which are part of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study add to the evidence about an epidemiological link between cancer and a diet high in meat, dairy, and other common Western foods (such as candy).

The study compared &lt;a href="w%3Amenopause"&gt;post-menopausal&lt;/a&gt; women living in &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; who ate a "meat-sweet" diet high in meat, dairy, and sweets to those who ate a diet high in vegetables and soy. The women on the "meat-sweet" diet were 60 percent more likely to develop &lt;a href="w%3Abreast%20cancer"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and 90 percent more likely to develop a particular type of breast cancer which is sensitive to hormones because it is &lt;a href="w%3AEstrogen%20receptor%23Cancer"&gt;estrogen-receptor positive&lt;/a&gt;. 

The "meat-sweet" diet included &lt;a href="w%3Abeef"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Alamb"&gt;lamb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Apork"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Ashrimp"&gt;shrimp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Asaltwater%20fish"&gt;saltwater fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Apoultry"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aorgan%20meat"&gt;organ meat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="w%3Adairy"&gt;dairy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Acandy"&gt;candy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Adessert"&gt;dessert&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href="w%3Abread"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;. The "vegetable-soy" diet included &lt;a href="w%3Atofu"&gt;tofu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Acauliflower"&gt;cauliflower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Abean"&gt;bean&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="w%3Abean%20sprout"&gt;bean sprout&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href="w%3Agreen%20leafy%20vegetable"&gt;green leafy vegetable&lt;/a&gt;s, but not much meat.

&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Transit%20Authority"&gt;Chicago Transit Authority&lt;/a&gt; (CTA) riders on the subway portions of the Red and Blue lines may see relief of the slow zone in the coming months. So-called "slow zones" are locations where trains travel at restricted speeds because of track work or deteriorating conditions.

The CTA is putting nearly &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;15 millions towards renovation of the O'Hare to Clark/Lake portion of the &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Line%20%28Chicago%20Transit%20Authority%29"&gt;Blue Line&lt;/a&gt; and Chicago to Belmont portions of the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Line%20%28Chicago%20Transit%20Authority%29"&gt;Red Line&lt;/a&gt;. Work will happen during off peak and overnight hours. The CTA says that one track operations and delays may occur.

"We have heard our customers' frustration with slow zones and today we are acting to address their concerns,” said Chicago Transit Board chairperson Carole Brown. "I am pleased that we are able to leverage existing contracts to begin this work and I look forward to working with state lawmakers to increase transit investment to bring our entire system to a state of good repair."

The Supreme Court in &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; has upheld the death sentence for five &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n nurses and a &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; medical intern condemned for infecting 426 children with &lt;a href="HIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;. Just one day ago, a deal to free the foreign medics was announced.

The six defendants were not present at the court ruling, while family members of the children rejoiced when the judge confirmed the verdict. "This is a victory for the Libyan judiciary system. We are awaiting the execution of the death sentence," said Al-Monseif Khalifa, a lawyer for the plaintives.

&lt;a href="E.U."&gt;E.U.&lt;/a&gt; Commission President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Barroso"&gt;José Manuel Barroso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; remains hopeful that the medics will receive clemency. "We regret that these decisions have been made, but I also want to express my confidence that a solution will be found," Barroso told the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgarian President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorgi%20Parvanov"&gt;Georgi Parvanov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called for a quick solution. He said the verdict came as no surprise, and expressed his hope for a swift final solution. The case will now move to the Supreme Judiciary Council which will hear the case on Monday, according to Libya's Foreign Minister, Mohammed Abdel-Rahman Shalgam. The Council is headed by the Justice Minister of Libya.

Late Tuesday, the Gaddafi Foundation, a non-profit run by the son of Libya's ♡❤de facto♡❤ leader &lt;a href="Muammar%20al-Gaddafi"&gt;Muammar al-Gaddafi&lt;/a&gt;, said a deal had been reached to free the health workers. The head of the Association for the Families of the HIV-Infected Children, Idriss Lagha, also said announced that a deal could be reached soon.

After the verdict today, Salah Abdessalem, a spokesman for the Gadhafi International Foundation for Charity Associations, reconfirmed to the ♡❤&lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that a settlement to free the detainees still exists, which he said was acceptable to all parties and would end the crisis, without giving further details. 

Unnamed officials who wished to remain anonymous disclosed the deal would involve financial compensation in exchange for the death sentences being commuted to a prison sentence, according to the Associated Press. E.U. officials say the European Union would agree to establish a fund of tens of millions of dollars to pay for the children's future medical care. Bulgaria and the European Union are calling it humanitarian aid instead of compensation, which would imply that their citizens would be guilty.

The convicted nurses and medical intern began working in the El-Fath Children's Hospital in &lt;a href="Benghazi"&gt;Benghazi&lt;/a&gt; in 1998, and were arrested and jailed one year later when over 400 children were found to be infected with HIV -over 50 have died since. They were sentenced to death in 2004, and again after a retrial last December which came after an international outcry about the affair.

A scientific report by professors &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuc%20Montagnier"&gt;Luc Montagnier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (one of the original discoverers of the virus causing AIDS) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVittorio%20Colizzi"&gt;Vittorio Colizzi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; used as evidence for the defence in the case said that the virus causing AIDS was widely spread in the hospital before the health workers even arrived, and that the infections were due to negligence and poor hygiene procedures in the Benghazi hospital. The prosecution introduced a report of Libyan scientists saying that this was not the case. The detainees have said that they have been tortured to make confessions.

Former First Lady &lt;a href="w%3ALady%20Bird%20Johnson"&gt;Lady Bird Johnson&lt;/a&gt; nee Claudia Alta Taylor, wife of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3ALyndon%20B.%20Johnson"&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, has died at her home in &lt;a href="w%3AAustin%2C%20Texas"&gt;Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. She was 94. 

She died of natural causes about 4:18 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;CDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-5"&gt;UTC-5&lt;/a&gt;). Her family and friends surrounded her when she passed. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABess%20Truman"&gt;Bess Truman&lt;/a&gt;, who reached the age of 97, was the only other first lady to live past 90. Lady Bird Johnson became first lady after the assassination of &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. After her husband's presidency, she became known as an advocate of various environmental projects and environmentalism in general.

As President Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, criss-crossed States by road during the 1964 presidential campaign, she informed her husband of her feelings about the roadside junkyards they saw along the way. Inspired by her comments and enthusiasm from audiences, he observed "If it's beautifying they want, it's beautifying they'll get." Recognizing that "ours is an automobile society," the President did not want to curtail roads. He wanted to make roads the "highways to the enjoyment of nature and beauty." Lady Bird thought that her love of seeing Texas highways in spring had influenced her husband. She enjoyed the results of Texan wildflower conservation programs which began in the 1930s.
One of the most prominent results of the President's beauty initiative was the &lt;a href="w%3AHighway%20Beautification%20Act%20of%201965"&gt;Highway Beautification Act of 1965&lt;/a&gt;. It created restrictions on billboards and junkyards. As expected, it had been controversial. When the House considered its version of the bill on October 7, the debate lasted into the early morning hours of October 8. A pointed, but tongue-in-cheek amendment by Representative Robert Dole (R-Kan.) to strike out the term "Secretary of Commerce" wherever it appeared in the bill and insert the words "Lady Bird" lost by a voice vote. Saying, "Beauty belongs to all the people," the President signed the bill and gave the pen to Lady Bird, along with a kiss on the cheek.

In 1982, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center to continue the mission of changing public attitudes toward native plants. In 1997 it was renamed the &lt;a href="w%3ALady%20Bird%20Johnson%20Wildflower%20Center"&gt;Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; says that the &lt;a href="w%3ASpitzer%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Spitzer Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; has detected water vapour on HD 189733b, a massive exoplanet orbiting the dwarf star &lt;a href="w%3AHD%20189733"&gt;HD 189733&lt;/a&gt;, "trillions of miles" outside our solar system. The water vapours were found in the planet's atmosphere.

"We're thrilled to have identified clear signs of water on a planet that is trillions of miles away," said Giovanna Tinetti, a &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; researcher and main author of NASA's study, at the Institute d’Astrophysique de &lt;a href="w%3AParis%2C%20France"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

The planet, termed a "wet &lt;a href="w%3AJupiter"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;", takes approximately two days to orbit its sun and its surface temperatures are estimated to be at least 1,000 Kelvin (1,340 Fahrenheit/727 Centigrade) which, according to scientists, makes it unlikely that life would exist there. The presence of water was observed by using the telescope to examine the absorption spectra as the planet transited across its star.

"Finding water on this planet implies that other planets in the universe, possibly even rocky ones, could also have water," said co-author Sean Carey of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena&lt;/a&gt;.

Similar evidence for another hot gas giant, previously gathered using the Hubble telescope, was not widely accepted due to experimental noise and similar concerns.

HD 189733b is located 63 light-years away from &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; in the constellation &lt;a href="w%3AVulpecula"&gt;Vulpecula&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=AFC%20Asian%20Cup%3A%20Indonesia%20shock%20Bahrain%2C%20China%20put%20five%20past%20Malaysia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Co-hosts &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; have defeated &lt;a href="w%3ABahrain%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; 2-1 in their opening &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; Group D fixture.

Cheered on by 60,000 predominantly-Indonesian fans at the &lt;a href="w%3ABung%20Karno%20Stadium"&gt;Bung Karno Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia took the lead in the fourteenth minute through &lt;a href="w%3ABudi%20Sudarsono"&gt;Budi Sudarsono&lt;/a&gt;.

Sudarsono received a lofted ball from midfield and pushed his first touch around the advancing Bahrain goalkeeper, &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Rahman%20Ahmed"&gt;Abdul Rahman Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;. Left with an open goal, the Indonesian striker calmly slotted home the first goal of the match.

Bahrain equalised thirteen minutes later when midfielder &lt;a href="w%3ASayed%20Mahmood%20Jalal"&gt;Sayed Mahmood Jalal&lt;/a&gt; prodded the ball into the back of the net. After a curling cross from the right-hand side, the Indonesian defence failed to clear, and the ball found its' way through the goalline scramble for Jalal to score.

The scores remained 1-1 until half time, however Indonesia took the lead again on sixty-four minutes. Midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AFirman%20Utina"&gt;Firman Utina&lt;/a&gt; drove a low, hard shot towards the Bahrain goal from 30 yards out, forcing a low save by Bahrain goalkeeper Ahmed. Ahmed's save rebounded onto the post and back out towards the penalty spot, where &lt;a href="w%3ABambang%20Pamungkas"&gt;Bambang Pamungkas&lt;/a&gt; charged onto the loose ball and placed it in the top-right hand corner of the net.

Indonesia sit atop the Group D table after just the one match, with &lt;a href="w%3AIran%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; playing the second match in the group.

In Group C, &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; became the only of the four co-hosts not to take any points from their first Group Stage match when they lost to &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20national%20football%20team"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; 5-1.

Striker &lt;a href="w%3AHan%20Peng"&gt;Han Peng&lt;/a&gt; and midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AWang%20Dong"&gt;Wang Dong&lt;/a&gt; both scored doubles for the visitors at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Stadium%2C%20Bukit%20Jalil"&gt;Bukit Jalil Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKuala%20Lumpur"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt;, taking them to equal leaders of the individual goalscoring list. 

Han Peng got China's first in the fifteenth minute when he headed home a cross from the right-hand wing. Midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AShao%20Jiayi"&gt;Shao Jiayi&lt;/a&gt; got their second after thirty-six minutes, when a pass cut back from near the goal-line reached him on the far post after leaving the Malaysian goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AAzizon%20Abdul%20Kadir"&gt;Azizon Abdul Kadir&lt;/a&gt; stranded. The score remained at 2-0 at half time.

Six minutes after the break, Wang Dong got his first of two goals when his shot from twenty yards was deflected, again leaving the Malaysian goalkeeper stranded going in the wrong direction. Han Peng got his second only four minutes later, after he got on the end of a cross from the right-hand wing by midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AMao%20Jianqing"&gt;Mao Jianqing&lt;/a&gt;.

Malaysia made the score 4-1 after &lt;a href="w%3AIndra%20Putra%20Mahayuddin"&gt;Indra Putra Mahayuddin&lt;/a&gt; scored from 25 yards. After receiving a lay-off from &lt;a href="w%3AHairuddin%20Omar"&gt;Hairuddin Omar&lt;/a&gt;, Indra Putra sent a curling strike past outstretched Chinese goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3ALi%20Leilei"&gt;Li Leilei&lt;/a&gt; and into the bottom of the net.

Wang Dong completed his double in the ninety-third and final minute of the match, with a looping header over the Malaysian goalkeeper. The pass to Wang Dong, a lofted ball from outside the penalty area, drew 'keeper Kadir off his line to allow Wang Dong to head over and into the goal.

As with Indonesia, China now sit atop Group C with a good goal difference. The other Group C teams are &lt;a href="w%3AKorea%20Republic%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Korea Republic&lt;/a&gt; play &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, who will play at the same stadium twenty-four hours after the China-Malaysia game.

A lighting failure five minutes from the end interrupted the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; Group D match between &lt;a href="w%3AKorea%20Republic%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Korea Republic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;.

The match, played at the &lt;a href="w%3ABung%20Karno%20Stadium"&gt;Bung Karno Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, was stopped for 27 minutes after the lighting on one half of the stadium suddenly turned off.

At the time of the disruption - 84 minutes 35 seconds played - the match was delicately poised at one goal apiece.

An spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20Football%20Confederation"&gt;Asian Football Confederation&lt;/a&gt; has said that the lighting failure was 'due to problems with power around Jakarta city'.

Referee &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Shield"&gt;Mark Shield&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, immediately stopped the match after the lights turned out. Under tournament rules, officials had one hour to get the lights and play restarted before the match would have to be abandoned. An emergency generator was used to restore some of the knocked-out lights to a sufficient level for playing, allowing Shield to restart play after the lengthy delay.

The match was an eventful one generally, especially after half time. Both teams played a cautious first half which was devoid of any real scoring opportunities.

However, after the break, Korea went 1-0 ahead through striker &lt;a href="w%3AChoi%20Sung-Kuk"&gt;Choi Sung-Kuk&lt;/a&gt; after sixty-six minutes. A curling cross from the left-hand wing found the head of Sung-Kuk, who moved in front of the Saudi defender and headed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner of the net.

Eleven minutes later, referee Shield awarded Saudi Arabia a &lt;a href="w%3Apenalty%20kick"&gt;penalty kick&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="w%3AMalek%20Mouath"&gt;Malek Mouath&lt;/a&gt; was adjudged to have been fouled inside the penalty box by a Korean defender. Captain &lt;a href="w%3AYasser%20Al-Qahtani"&gt;Yasser Al-Qahtani&lt;/a&gt; stepped up and converted to level the scores 1-1 after seventy-seven minutes.

After play was restarted due to the power failure, Saudi Arabia had an excellent chance to win the match with the final kick of the game. Striker &lt;a href="w%3ASaad%20Al%20Harthi"&gt;Saad Al Harthi&lt;/a&gt; missed a one-on-one opportunity with the Korean goalkeeper, pushing his shot wide.

The draw leaves hosts &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; on top of the Group D table after defeating Bahrain 2-1 in the opening match of the group.

In Group C, &lt;a href="w%3AIran%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has come back from a goal down to defeat &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; 2-1 at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Stadium%2C%20Bukit%20Jalil"&gt;Bukit Jalil Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKuala%20Lumpur"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt;.

Iran conceded the lead to Uzbekistan on sixteen minutes when Iranian defender &lt;a href="w%3ARahman%20Rezaei"&gt;Rahman Rezaei&lt;/a&gt; scored an &lt;a href="w%3Aown%20goal"&gt;own goal&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to head the ball back to his goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Roudbarian"&gt;Hassan Roudbarian&lt;/a&gt;, Rezaei only managed to head the ball over Roudbarianand into the back of his own net.

The score remained 1-0 until the fifty-fifth minute, when Iran equalised through &lt;a href="w%3ASeyed%20Jalal%20Hosseini"&gt;Seyed Jalal Hosseini&lt;/a&gt;. Hosseini headed a fast-moving &lt;a href="w%3ACorner%20kick"&gt;corner kick&lt;/a&gt; from the right hand side by &lt;a href="w%3AMehdi%20Mahdavikia"&gt;Mehdi Mahdavikia&lt;/a&gt; past Uzbekistan's defence to equalize.

Iran then went ahead after seventy-eight minutes after midfielder &lt;a href="w%3AAndranik%20Teymourian"&gt;Andranik Teymourian&lt;/a&gt; provided a through-pass which found &lt;a href="w%3AJavad%20Kazemian"&gt;Javad Kazemian&lt;/a&gt; on the edge of the penalty box. Kazemian struck his shot sweetly to beat the goalkeeper and made the scoreline 2-1.

No further goals came, however Iranian coach &lt;a href="w%3AAmir%20Ghalenoei"&gt;Amir Ghalenoei&lt;/a&gt; was sent from the sidelines by the referee due to an indiscretion. 

The result puts Iran on three points and at the top of Group C, however they trail &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20national%20football%20team"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; 5-1 a day prior, on goal difference.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; plane, Flight 136 carrying 230 passengers was traveling from &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; when it was diverted to &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport"&gt;John F. Kennedy International Airport&lt;/a&gt; due to a suspicious passenger.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATransportation%20Security%20Administration"&gt;Transportation Security Administration&lt;/a&gt; (TSA) states that "the flight crew alerted security to a suspicious person on board" and the plane was then diverted to JFK Airport while it was still en route to London. The plane made an emergency landing at 4:00 a.m. (eastern time).

The man was traveling alone, and was taken into custody after the plane landed safely. Reports also say that the unnamed individual was riding an employee bus, then boarded the plane, but does not have proper identification which says he works for the airline.

"It may very well turn out that this is nothing more than a misunderstanding with an employee who used an employee bus to get on a plane for a private flight," said Homeland Security Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chertoff"&gt;Michael Chertoff&lt;/a&gt;.

The man boarded the plane without proceeding through security screenings, but Chertoff states that the Middle Eastern man had purchased a round trip ticket for the flight.

"The individual in question was, in fact, an employee who was traveling in a private capacity," added Chertoff.

Andrea McCauley, a spokeswoman for the TSA says the flight has been canceled, and all passengers were being checked, along with the plane, but authorities did not find anything suspicious. 

Passengers were told that the plane had run out of fuel and are being reassigned to different flights.

&lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; cyclist &lt;a href="w%3AThor%20Hushovd"&gt;Thor Hushovd&lt;/a&gt; sprinted his way to a stage four victory in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.

&lt;a href="w%3AFabian%20Cancellara"&gt;Fabian Cancellara&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; maintained the overall lead, while Hushovd moved into second place, 29 seconds behind Cancellara.

Cancellara is not confident of keeping the yellow jersey. "When I get into the mountains, it's sure that it's finished," Cancellara said.

&lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; mountain specialist, and "King of the Mountains" for 2005 and 2006, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; agrees that the &lt;a href="w%3AAlps"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt; will be a turning point in the race.

"We'll definitely get some answers on those days," Rasmussen said. "Already on the Colombiere [La Colombiere Pass], there will be guys from the general classification maybe even dropping or being in trouble."

&lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; mountain specialist &lt;a href="w%3ARemy%20Di%20Gregorio"&gt;Remy Di Gregorio&lt;/a&gt; withdrew from the Tour after fracturing his elbow during stage 4.

&lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; rider &lt;a href="w%3AFilippo%20Pozzato"&gt;Filippo Pozzato&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 5.

&lt;a href="w%3AFabian%20Cancellara"&gt;Fabian Cancellara&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; kept the overall lead, again.

The 182.5&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; fifth stage from &lt;a href="w%3AChablis"&gt;Chablis&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AAutun"&gt;Autun&lt;/a&gt; featured eight climbs, including one Category 2 climb. Many of the sprinters lost contact with the peleton, but all of the major contenders finished together, apart from &lt;a href="w%3AAlexandre%20Vinokourov"&gt;Alexandre Vinokourov&lt;/a&gt;. Vinokourov crashed before the final climb, and ended up losing more than a minute to the rest of the field. 

A tailbone injury may force &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Kl%C3%B6den"&gt;Andreas Klöden&lt;/a&gt;, who is second in the overall standings, to withdraw from the Tour. Teammates Vinokourov and Klöden were both taken to the hospital.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20FC"&gt;Liverpool FC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have completed the signings of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Ham%20United"&gt;West Ham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; midfielder &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYossi%20Benayoun"&gt;Yossi Benayoun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAjax%20Amsterdam"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; forward &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Babel"&gt;Ryan Babel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The combined fee is approximately &lt;a href="Euro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;24.5 million.

These transfers raise the total to €47 million that Liverpool has spent on transfer fees this off season. Other acquisitions include &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Torres"&gt;Fernando Torres&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndrei%20Voronin"&gt;Andrei Voronin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Ajax rejected the original offer of €14.7 million for Babel, who came out of Ajax' world famous youth system. Liverpool raised the offer to about €17 million, which Ajax accepted as the transfer fee.

Liverpool has been after Benayoun for a while. They acquired him from West Ham for a fee of about €7.5 million.

Benayoun signed a contract that runs until June 2011. Liverpool coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Benitez"&gt;Rafael Benitez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been watching Benayoun since his days at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARacing%20Santander"&gt;Racing Santander&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Liga"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Benitez went on to say "It's clear he's done this very well at West Ham. Liverpool fans will remember how he played in the (2006) FA Cup final against us when he was outstanding. We thought then this was a player who is capable of stepping up to a higher level."

Babel will sign a 5-year contract on Friday after passing a medical. He admitted that he was easily convinced that Liverpool was the right club for him after listening to what they had to say.

In a press conference today, Donald Bennett, chief of police in &lt;a href="w%3APlainfield%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Plainfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, named Craig Stebic as a "person of interest" in the investigation of his wife Lisa Stebic's disappearance.

Stebic did not allow police access to the couple's children, a 10-year old and a 12-year old, which police say has hampered the investigation. 

There has been no activity on Lisa's credit cards, cell phone, or checking accounts. Investigators are focusing on the chance Lisa may be a victim of foul play. Lisa and Craig were in the middle of a divorce when she went missing on April 30, 2007.

Chief Bennett said that Craig Stebic has been of "minimal assistance to detectives and refused to participate in searches." This was a contributing factor in naming him a "person of interest."

The &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; closed today at a new record high of 13,861.73 as &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; stock markets rose sharply. This is the first time the Dow got above 13,700. Today's 2.1% rally is the index' largest single-day percentage gain in nearly four years.

Analysts cite earnings reports that exceeded forecasts as a catalyst for the buying spree. Most notably, &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, the world's largest private employer and &lt;a href="w%3ARetailing"&gt;retailer&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that same-store sales increased by 2.4%.

"Consumer are still spending so that was something for people to hang their hats on," said Hugh Moore of Guerite Advisors, when explaining the rally.

Another contributing factor is being reported to be the announced acquisition of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; aluminum company &lt;a href="w%3AAlcan"&gt;Alcan Inc.&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;38.1 billion by multinational mining company &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Tinto%20Group"&gt;Rio Tinto Group&lt;/a&gt;. This led to speculation, it is said, that &lt;a href="w%3AAlcoa"&gt;Alcoa Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, the leading aluminum producer in the US, may soon be the target of a take-over.

Other benchmark indices also posted major gains today. The &lt;a href="w%3AS%26amp%3BP%20500"&gt;S&amp;P 500 Index&lt;/a&gt; climbed 28.94 to 1,547.70, also a record high. The &lt;a href="w%3ANasdaq%20Composite"&gt;Nasdaq Composite Index&lt;/a&gt; rose 49.94 to close at 2,701.73, the highest since March of 2001.

&lt;a href="w%3AQatar%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt; have drawn with co-host &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; 1-1 in their &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; Group B match, played in front of a capacity 40,000 spectators at the &lt;a href="w%3AMy%20Dinh%20National%20Stadium"&gt;My Dinh National Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHanoi"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;.

Vietnam started strongly, although failed to create any meaningful opportunities on the Qatar goal. However, their first real chance resulted in a goal after thirty-two minutes. Vietnam striker &lt;a href="w%3APhan%20Thanh%20B%C3%ACnh"&gt;Phan Thanh Bình&lt;/a&gt; sent the ball towards goal from 25 yards, and the Qatar goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Saqr"&gt;Mohamed Saqr&lt;/a&gt; had the ball slip through his hands and trickle over the line.

The score was 1-0 at half time. After the break, Qatar had most of the chances to score. &lt;a href="w%3AMagid%20Mohamed"&gt;Magid Mohamed&lt;/a&gt; hit the post with a curling shot in the sixty-second minute, and the ball was cleared away after a goal-line scramble.

Qatar then equalized on seventy-nine minutes. Striker &lt;a href="w%3ASebasti%C3%A1n%20Quintana"&gt;Sebastián Quintana&lt;/a&gt; got his head onto the end of a deflected shot by teammate Magid, after beating Thai goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3ADuong%20Hong%20Son"&gt;Duong Hong Son&lt;/a&gt; to the ball.

The Qatar team ahd a chance to take the lead after eighty-four minutes, when Quintana played a through-ball past the defence into the feet of &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Hassan%20Afeef"&gt;Ali Hassan Afeef&lt;/a&gt;. Afeef, one-on-one with goalkeeper Hong Son, lifted his ball over the Vietnamese 'keeper only to see it hit the crossbar and land back in the field of play. Vietnam cleared the ball away and averted the danger.

The game ended 1-1, and leaves Vietnam on top of the group with four points having played two Group B games. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates%20national%20football%20team"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; play &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon (UTC) in their Group B fixture.

In Group A, co-host &lt;a href="w%3AThailand%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Thailand national football team&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AOman%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; 2-0 at the &lt;a href="w%3ARajamangala%20National%20Stadium"&gt;Rajamangala National Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;.

Substitute &lt;a href="w%3APipat%20Thonkanya"&gt;Pipat Thonkanya&lt;/a&gt; scored both goals, eight minutes apart, both from set-ups by fellow Thailand substitute &lt;a href="w%3ATeeratep%20Winothai"&gt;Teeratep Winothai&lt;/a&gt;.

The first goal, in the seventieth minute, was a low volley from six yards out. Winothai crossed the ball low and fast from the right-hand wing, and Thonkanya was on the end of the cross to shoot it home.

Thonkanya scored again in the seventy-eighth minute, after Winothai lofted a header into his path from midfield. Running with the ball, he took one touch on his chest and then half-volleyed the ball home from the edge of the penalty area. 

Thailand currently sit atop Group A on four points, with Australia to play Iraq this afternoon (UTC).

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=BBC%20apologises%20to%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II%20for%20misrepresentation%20in%20documentary&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (BBC) has apologised to &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; and photographer, &lt;a href="w%3AAnnie%20Leibovitz"&gt;Annie Leibovitz&lt;/a&gt;, after a trailer for a documentary suggested she had walked out of a portrait sitting when the photographer asked her to remove her crown.

The trailer shows a clip of the photographer telling the Queen, "I think it will look better without the crown because the garter robe is so..." The Queen responded with "Less dressy! What do you think this is?" The following clip shows the Queen walking down a corridor saying, "I'm not changing anything. I've had enough dressing like this, thank you very much." 

It has since been clarified that this second clip shows the Queen arriving at the sitting, not departing. 

In a statement the BBC said, "In this trailer there is a sequence that implies that the Queen left a sitting prematurely. This was not the case and the actual sequence of events was mis-represented. The BBC would like to apologise to both the Queen and Annie Leibovitz for any upset this may have caused."

The BBC blamed a production error for the mistake, saying, "This assembly was never intended to be seen by the public or the press. Unfortunately, this assembly was given in error to the BBC personnel who were preparing the BBC One autumn launch tape."

The company responsible for the editing of the documentary, RDF Media, also apologized to the Queen. Michael Grade, previous controller of BBC One, blamed the mistake on "young, untrained" workers who "don't understand that the basic ethic of broadcasting in this country is trust."

Photographer, Leibowitz, commenting about the session in &lt;a href="w%3AVanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt; even before the release of the trailer, said, "She doesn't really want to get dressed up any more. She just couldn't be bothered and I admired her for that."

An employee of &lt;a href="w%3ANetwork%20Rail"&gt;Network Rail&lt;/a&gt;, the company that owns and maintains the British railway infrastructure, has been arrested in connection with the &lt;a href="w%3AGrayrigg%20derailment"&gt;Grayrigg derailment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACumbria"&gt;Cumbria&lt;/a&gt;, in the north of &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, which left one passenger dead in February of this year.

The &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Trains"&gt;Virgin&lt;/a&gt; Pendolino service from &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; derailed at 20:15 &lt;a href="w%3AGreenwich%20Mean%20Time"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt; on February 23 as it passed over a set of points which an interim report by the &lt;a href="w%3ARail%20Accident%20Investigation%20Branch"&gt;Rail Accident Investigation Branch&lt;/a&gt; found were missing components and were in a poor condition. 

A spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Transport%20Police"&gt;British Transport Police&lt;/a&gt; said that the 46-year-old man from &lt;a href="w%3APreston"&gt;Preston&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on Wednesday and has been released on police &lt;a href="w%3Abail"&gt;bail&lt;/a&gt; until October 31.

Network Rail were unable to comment on the arrest.

The nine day &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Ferm%C3%ADn"&gt;San Fermín festival&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as the &lt;a href="w%3Arunning%20of%20the%20bulls"&gt;running of the bulls&lt;/a&gt; (or "el encierro" in Spanish) in &lt;a href="w%3APamplona"&gt;Pamplona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, is the most famous of all such events.

Like every year, several revelers are gored, both locals and tourists. Some 800 000 tourists were estimated to have come to Pamplona last weekend. On Thursday, 13 people were admitted to the hospital, seven of whom were gored. Three of the latter had to have surgery.
A 48-year-old man from Pamplona was in a critical condition after being gored in the chest. Other serious incidents involved a &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; man in their twenties. Runners from &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, Spain and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; also sustained injuries.

Thursday's run lasted six minutes, where a normal run is only two minutes long. Normally, the pack of bulls stays together, but in this run they separated, which is more dangerous for the runners. Since 1924, there have been 13 fatalities, the last of whom was an American in 1995.

The 825 metre run garnered international fame after &lt;a href="w%3AErnest%20Hemingway"&gt;Ernest Hemingway&lt;/a&gt; described the running in his 1926 book ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sun%20Also%20Rises"&gt;The Sun Also Rises&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The end of the run is the bullring where the matadors will deal with the bulls.

Animal rights activists protest the bull-running because they believe the tradition is cruel to the animals. Tomorrow, the eighth and final run will be held, at 8:00 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20European%20Summer%20Time"&gt;CEST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B2"&gt;UTC+2&lt;/a&gt;).

A &lt;a href="Hindu"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; prayer was used as the opening prayer in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; for the first time Thursday. The prayer was given by Chaplain Rajan Zed. Proceedings were disrupted by three &lt;a href="Christian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; protesters in the visitors gallery who shouted that there is "No Lord but Jesus Christ", adding insults and calling the Hindu prayer an "abomination." The three people involved in the incident were arrested thereafter. Under the direction of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the prayer for the Senate has been given by a variety of religions of late, although the prayer is still often given by a chaplain of a Christian denomination. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Lynn"&gt;Barry Lynn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , speaking for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmericans%20United%20for%20Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State"&gt;Americans United for Separation of Church and State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20First%20Amendment"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; advocacy group, said that the incident demonstrated the intolerance of the Christian right and that "I don't think the Senate should open with prayers, but if it's going to happen, the invocations ought to reflect the diversity of the American people." 

Zed had wanted to read the prayers in Sanskrit but did so in English instead at the direction of the Senate Chaplain Office. 

Later reports stated that the three protesters, Ante Pavkovic, Katherine Pavkovic and their daughter Christan Sugar Pavkovic, were affiliated with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Family%20Association"&gt;American Family Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a conservative Christian organization which had previously attempted to block the prayer from occurring although other reports connected them with the smaller &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Save%20America"&gt;Operation Save America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a Christian organization based in &lt;a href="Dallas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;. 

The protesters were released after being charged.

<h1>International media mogul Conrad Black convicted of fraud</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=International%20media%20mogul%20Conrad%20Black%20convicted%20of%20fraud&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

International media mogul &lt;a href="w%3AConrad%20Black"&gt;Conrad Black&lt;/a&gt; has been found guilty by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Illinois"&gt;US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; on three charges of mail fraud and one of obstruction of justice. However, the &lt;a href="w%3AJury"&gt;jury&lt;/a&gt; did clear him of the rest of the charges. Black faces a maximum of 35 years in prison and a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1 million fine at his sentencing, which is scheduled for November.
He was found not guilty of nine other charges including &lt;a href="w%3ARacketeering"&gt;racketeering&lt;/a&gt;, misuse of corporate perks and tax evasion. The 13 charges were based on allegations that Black defrauded investors in his company, Chicago-based &lt;a href="w%3ASun-Times%20Media%20Group"&gt;Hollinger International&lt;/a&gt; (now known as Sun-Times Media Group). He was accused of stealing around US$60 million from the company.

David Radler, who was the second-highest ranking officer at Hollinger at the time of the crimes, testified against Black, after admitting fraud himself. Radler testified before the court and jury, that Conrad Black had concocted a scheme where executives of Hollinger could pocket payments when selling small local newspapers that Hollinger owned, in exchange for &lt;a href="w%3ANon-compete%20clause"&gt;non-compete agreements&lt;/a&gt;.

Black's three co-defendants and former associates (Jack Boultbee, Peter Atkinson and Mark Kipnis) were all found guilty of several counts of mail fraud.
"We think the verdict vindicates the serious public interest in making sure that when insiders in a corporation deal with money entrusted to them by the shareholders, that they not engage in self-dealing, that they not break the law to benefit themselves instead of the shareholders," said U.S. Attorney &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, who prosecuted the case. 

"We intend to appeal and there are viable legal issues. We vehemently disagree with the government's position on sentencing," said Edward Greenspan, Conrad Black's attorney. "We believe, based on the conviction of the charges here, that the sentences for this type of offence are far less than what the government suggested." 

"It only takes one fraud charge and the man is disgraced and finished," said Joshua Rozenberg, legal editor of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which was once owned by Hollinger International. "He is clearly facing a lengthy prison sentence."

Black was released, pending his appeal, on a US$20 million bond. He agreed to remain in the Chicago area for at least one week. Judge Amy St. Eve confiscated his passport.

Conrad Black renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2001, to become a &lt;a href="w%3Alife%20peer"&gt;life peer&lt;/a&gt; as Baron Black of Crossharbour. He is technically a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; citizen, as he is a &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Lords"&gt;British Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Even without his Canadian citizenship, Black continues to enjoy the privileges of membership in the &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Privy%20Council%20for%20Canada"&gt;Queen's Privy Council for Canada&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Mulroney"&gt;Brian Mulroney&lt;/a&gt; gave him in 1992 which includes the use of a special diplomatic passport.

&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Boonen"&gt;Tom Boonen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 6 of the Tour de France, after beating Spaniard &lt;a href="w%3AOscar%20Freire"&gt;Oscar Freire&lt;/a&gt; in a sprint by a bike length.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; rider &lt;a href="w%3ABradley%20Wiggins"&gt;Bradley Wiggins&lt;/a&gt; tried his luck on a solo-effort from the 2 km-mark, but after reaching a maximum gap of 17½ minute at km 57, the pack reeled him with less than ten kilometres to go.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOber%C3%A1%2C%20Argentina"&gt;Oberá, Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
After the success obtained last year, the second edition of the International Festival of Cinema ♡❤Oberá en Cortos♡❤ began at &lt;a href="w%3AOber%C3%A1"&gt;Oberá&lt;/a&gt;'s theatre last Tuesday 10th. Local and provincial authorities and the vice rector of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversidad%20Nacional%20de%20Misiones"&gt;National University of Misiones&lt;/a&gt;, Aldo Montini, were present at the inaugural ceremony.

"This festival is earning a place, not only in the province, but in the region as an important event for the Regional Cultural Association Argentina - Paraguay" said Jorge Betaglio, secretary of tourism of the &lt;a href="w%3AMisiones%20province"&gt;Misiones province&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤Oberá en Cortos♡❤ is an international competition for &lt;a href="w%3AShort%20subject"&gt;short&lt;/a&gt; format films and video. It takes place between the 10th and 15th of July of this year. The movies will be shown for six days in the Oberá's theatre, the ♡❤Ex-secadero Barbaro♡❤, the San Martín square and the ♡❤Parque de las Naciones♡❤. In addition, different mobile cinemas will cross the province, to show the movies in more than fifteen municipalities to people who cannot come to the city of &lt;a href="w%3AOber%C3%A1"&gt;Oberá&lt;/a&gt;.

"This is an area we still have to keep on building, that has to do with working on the production of cultural sense and reflecting our identities," said Axel Monsú, one of the organizers of the event.

The first night, the ♡❤Murga del Monte♡❤, a group of filmmakers made up of the community members, was there to show ♡❤No lejos del Río de la Plata♡❤. This is a movie, filmed in the centre of Misiones in 1991, that reports the life of the &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; immigrants upon their arrival to these lands.

The festival is organized by the ♡❤Productora de la Tierra♡❤, a cooperative of communication and is supported by the Subsecretary of Tourism of Misiones. In addition, different workshops are carried out in two facilities of the city.

Two &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island"&gt;Long Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20State"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; teenagers, aged 15 and 17, have been charged for their alleged involvement in a suspected plot to attack their school next April, on the ninth anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3AColumbine%20High%20School%20massacre"&gt;Columbine High School shooting massacre&lt;/a&gt;.

The plot was uncovered when the 15-year-old suspect lost his journal at the &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonalds"&gt;McDonalds&lt;/a&gt; restaurant where he worked. The journal was found by a fellow classmate of the teenagers' school, who quickly turned it over to school officials.

The journal is alleged to have outlined the teenagers' plan to attack the school with guns and home-made bombs. The 15-year-old suspect's home and computers were searched and evidence was collected, which revealed that he allegedly tried to purchase black powder explosives and machine guns over the Internet.

A video was also found in which the same teenager allegedly names some students and staff he would like to attack at the school. The 17-year-old was allegedly planning to aid in the attack on the school.

The two teens were arrested and held in Long Island jail on misdemeanor conspiracy, which is punishable by up to one year in prison. The 15-year-old will appear in juvenile court on Friday and the 17-year-old suspect is expected to plead not guilty at a hearing.

The &lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Earth%20Creationism"&gt;Young Earth Creationist&lt;/a&gt; who sent threatening emails and letters to
biologists at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder"&gt;University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;/a&gt; also sent threatening letters to the University chancellor G.P.
Peterson as well as the vice-chancellor of undergraduate education and others.

The man who had sent the threats has been identified as Menachem "Michael" Korn, a former &lt;a href="w%3AOrthodox%20Jew"&gt;Orthodox Jew&lt;/a&gt; who converted to &lt;a href="w%3AMessianic%20Judaism"&gt;Messianic Judaism&lt;/a&gt; (no longer affiliated with either) and who now self-identifies as
"Christian". Claimed excerpts of the threats were posted on &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Panda%27s%20Thumb%20%28blog%29"&gt;The Panda's Thumb&lt;/a&gt;, a biology blog that focuses on "the claims of the anti-evolution movement." 

Among other statements, Korn compared evolutionary biologists to child molesters and discussed killing the "enemies of Christian society" who are "terrorists against America". A spokesperson for Colorado University said that the excerpts were "consistent" with the threats but refused to confirm if they were actual excerpts. Korn had apparently distributed fliers on campus before and harassed professors but over the last few days the threats had become more extreme.

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; has defeated &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20football%20%28soccer%29%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; 3-1 in their &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; Group A match at the &lt;a href="w%3ARajamangala%20Stadium"&gt;Rajamangala Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.

Iraq took the lead after twenty-three minutes when midfielder &lt;a href="w%3ANashat%20Akram"&gt;Nashat Akram&lt;/a&gt; scored. He curled in a free kick from around thirty yards out, and &lt;a href="w%3ASalih%20al%20Sadwn"&gt;Salih al Sadwn&lt;/a&gt; rushed towards Australian goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Schwarzer"&gt;Mark Schwarzer&lt;/a&gt;. Al Sadwn's presence sufficiently distracted Schwarzer, who dived the wrong way.

The score remained at 1-0 until half time. Two minutes after the break, Australia equalised through striker &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Viduka"&gt;Mark Viduka&lt;/a&gt;. The Australian captain managed to head a curling cross by midfielder &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Emerton"&gt;Brett Emerton&lt;/a&gt; back across Iraqi &lt;a href="w%3ANoor%20Hassan"&gt;Noor Hassan&lt;/a&gt;'s goal and into the top corner.
However, Iraq scored twice to win the match, the former through a defensive error by Australia. &lt;a href="w%3AHawar%20Mulla%20Mohammed"&gt;Hawar Mulla Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; was played through with a lovely ball from a teammate, who had attracted the Australian central defence out-of-position. Mohammed slotted the ball home from 15 yards to re-take the lead.

Iraq sealed the three Group A points when &lt;a href="w%3AKarrar%20Jassim%20Mohammed"&gt;Karrar Jassim Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; scored in the eighty-sixth minute. He managed to get on the end of a deflected shot and calmly tap the ball into an empty net, after goalkeeper Schwarzer had dived to defend the initial shot.

The win puts Iraq on equal-top of the group with hosts &lt;a href="w%3AThailand%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. If Iraq defeats or draws with &lt;a href="w%3AOman%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; in their final Group A encounter, they will progress through to the quarter-final stage. Australia must defeat Thailand to remain any chance of progressing through to the next stage.

In the event that Australia win (ie. are on four points) and Iraq win or draw (ie. are on seven or five points), Australia will progress through to the next stage on head-to-head rather than Thailand despite having a possibly-worse goal difference. Goal difference (goals for minus goals against) is only used to separate two teams if they drew in their head-to-head match in the group stage. 

If Iraq lose to Oman and Australia win, all four teams will end up on four points. It is unclear how the head-to-head rule will be applied by the AFC in this situation, and it is probable that goal difference will be used.

In Group B, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates%20national%20football%20team"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; 3-1 at the &lt;a href="w%3AMy%20Dinh%20National%20Stadium"&gt;My Dinh National Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHanoi"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.

Defending champions Japan took the lead when &lt;a href="w%3ANaohiro%20Takahara"&gt;Naohiro Takahara&lt;/a&gt; scored after twenty-two minutes. Takahara doubled their advantage five minutes later when he sent a lovely volley into the right-hand side of the net after twenty-seven minutes, leaving Emirates goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AMajed%20Maqdemi"&gt;Majed Maqdemi&lt;/a&gt; stranded.

&lt;a href="w%3AShunsuke%20Nakamura"&gt;Shunsuke Nakamura&lt;/a&gt; made it 3-0 before half time when he converted a &lt;a href="w%3Apenalty%20kick"&gt;penalty kick&lt;/a&gt; awarded to Japan on forty-two minutes. The Emirates scored a goal after sixty-six minutes through &lt;a href="w%3ASaeed%20Alkas"&gt;Saeed Alkas&lt;/a&gt;, but no comeback eventuated and the final score was 3-1 top Japan.

It leaves Japan equal on top of the Group B table with &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; on two points, with the teams locked on four points each. The winner of the match will take top spot in the group. In the event that the Japan-Vietnam match is drawn, both teams have a goal difference of +2. However, Japan have scored one more goal than Vietnam, and will take top spot in the group on that basis.

&lt;a href="w%3AQatar%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, the other team in Group B, must win against UAE and hope for a winner in the Japan-Vietnam match to progress, or else defeat the Emirates by three goals or more. Qatar drew both matches with Japan and Vietnam, meaning it will come down to goal difference if two sides are equal on four points. The UAE cannot reach the quarter-finals stage.

Police have arrested and charged a 45-year-old man from &lt;a href="w%3ADharruk%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Dharruk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Sydney"&gt;Western Sydney&lt;/a&gt; after he went on a 90 minute rampage throughout &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Western%20Sydney"&gt;Western Sydney&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href="w%3AArmoured%20Personnel%20Carrier"&gt;armoured personnel carrier&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that the APC was privately-owned and was recently restored.

The man gained attention of the police shortly after 2 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; when he was spotted destroying an electricity substation in &lt;a href="w%3AMinchinbury%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Minchinbury&lt;/a&gt;. The man then led police on a rampage through &lt;a href="w%3AMt%20Druitt%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Mt Druitt&lt;/a&gt;, Dharruk, &lt;a href="w%3AEmerton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Emerton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGlendenning%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Glendenning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APlumpton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Plumpton&lt;/a&gt; where he brought down six mobile phone towers and relay sheds.

The rampage ended in &lt;a href="w%3ADean%20Park%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Dean Park&lt;/a&gt; after the APC stalled as it was being driven towards another mobile phone tower. Police moved in and arrested the vehicle's driver.

Chief Inspector Guy Haberly from Mount Druitt Police said the man destroyed mobile phone towers by "crashing through the perimeter fence and colliding with structures causing significant damage".

The man was reportedly charged with breaking, entering and stealing; predatory driving; six counts of malicious damage; possession of a prohibited drug; use of a weapon to avoid apprehension and driving in a dangerous manner. Police refused the man bail.

Indian doctor &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Haneef"&gt;Mohammed Haneef&lt;/a&gt; has been formally charged in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; after being held without charge for the past 12 days in connection with the failed &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Glasgow%20International%20Airport%20attack"&gt;Glasgow Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20London%20car%20bombs"&gt;London car&lt;/a&gt; bombings.

Dr Haneef, a distant cousin of Kafeel and Sabeel Ahmed who are accused of plotting the attacks provided Sabeel with a &lt;a href="w%3ASubscriber%20Identity%20Module"&gt;SIM card&lt;/a&gt;. It is alleged that &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; police found the card in the possession of Mr Ahmed when he was arrested and informed Australian authorities.

During a bail hearing, the AFP claimed that Haneef had given his SIM card to the Ahmed brothers when he left the UK in July, 2006. It is alleged that he also shared a house in &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%2C%20United%20Kingdon"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; with his cousins for up to 2 two years before moving to Australia. Police opposed bail for Dr Haneef, however the magistrate has reserved her decision until Monday due to the large amount of paperwork involved in the case. Dr Haneef remains in custody.

Speaking at a news conference in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;, AFP Chief Mick Keelty told reporters that Haneef had been reckless in giving his cousins a SIM Card. He further claimed that the "allegation involves recklessness rather than intention".

Dr Haneef was arrested on July 2 at &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane%20International%20Airport"&gt;Brisbane International Airport&lt;/a&gt; where it is alleged that he was trying to leave Australia for &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; on a one-way ticket. He claims that he was going to visit his wife and newborn daughter although police have openly stated they do not accept Haneef's explanation. Up until his arrest, Dr Haneef had been working at the Gold Coast Hospital.

Under Australian counter-terrorism laws, Dr Haneef faces a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment if convicted.

<h3>Bounty for Osama bin Laden doubled</h3>

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; has voted to double the bounty placed on the capture or death of alleged &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Qaeda"&gt;al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; mastermind &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;.

The Senate approved the bounty increase, which now sits at &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;50 million, by an 87-1 vote on Friday.

It follows a series of reports which suggest that the group of terrorists behind the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20terrorist%20attacks"&gt;September 11&lt;/a&gt; that hit &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; were rebuilding its capacity to execute terrorist plots.

<h3>UN: New leads in Hariri murder investigation</h3>
A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; report has indicated that investigations into the death of former &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Lebanon"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARafiq%20Hariri"&gt;Rafiq Hariri&lt;/a&gt;, have identified a number of possible suspects.

Hariri was assassinated on February 14, 2005. Explosives equivalent to approximately 300 kg of &lt;a href="w%3ATNT"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; were detonated as his motorcade drove past the St George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;.

The UN team, which is headed by &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; prosecutor Serge Brammertz, also said in its' report that the deteriorating political situation in Lebanon is likely to adversly effect the investigation as safety and other issues require extra attention.

&lt;a href="w%3ALinus%20Gerdemann"&gt;Linus Gerdemann&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; took a large lead up the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20la%20Colombi%C3%A8re"&gt;Col de la Colombière&lt;/a&gt; and has won stage 7 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;.

Gerdemann won by 3:38 over the chasing &lt;a href="w%3APeleton"&gt;peleton&lt;/a&gt; and took over the &lt;a href="w%3AYellow%20jersey"&gt;yellow jersey&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AFabian%20Cancellara"&gt;Fabian Cancellara&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.

All the big names, thought to have a chance of winning the Tour, appeared to be in the peloton. This includes injured teammates &lt;a href="w%3AAlexandre%20Vinokourov"&gt;Alexandre Vinokourov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Kl%C3%B6den"&gt;Andreas Klöden&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3A%C3%93scar%20Freire"&gt;Óscar Freire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; withdrew ahead of today's stage with back problems.

Authorities have closed at least 14 &lt;a href="w%3ATesco"&gt;Tesco supermarkets&lt;/a&gt; located in Lancashire, Suffolk, Dyfed Powys, Fife, Leicestershire, Humberside, West Mercia, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Strathclyde and &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; after receiving a security alert. 

Witnesses say that authorities received a bomb threat and that the stores' &lt;a href="w%3Acar%20park"&gt;car parks&lt;/a&gt; have been blocked off by police. 

"Police came and told us it had received a bomb threat. They suggested we may want to close, but our manager has kept us open," said an unnamed worker at a shop near a Tesco in Barrhead, East Renfrewshire.

"Police are investigating a series of incidents in a number of locations across the country involving Tesco stores. Tesco is working with the police following a series of incidents. These stores have been temporarily closed as a precaution for public safety," said a police officer with the Hertfordshire police department. The police are treating their enquiries as a "criminal investigation."

It is not known why the shops were closed, but authorities have stated that a matter of public safety caused authorities to close the stores. No injuries are reported and police say they will remain at the stores until further notice.

Scientists reported that they had documented very fast evolution in the butterfly species &lt;a href="w%3A%20Hypolimnas%20bolina"&gt;♡❤Hypolimnas bolina♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. After infection by &lt;a href="w%3AWolbachia"&gt;♡❤Wolbachia♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, the fraction of the population that was male dropped drastically to about one percent of the total population. However, after approximately ten generations (about a year) the male population had rebounded to about 39 percent of the overall population. 

In the case of ♡❤H. bolina♡❤, infected females were unable to have male offspring since the male embryos died early on. However, a gene arose which suppressed ♡❤Wolbachia♡❤♡s ability to kill the male offspring, and this gene spread rapidly through the natural ♡❤H. bolina♡❤ population.

At this time, it is unknown if the novel gene was a mutation or a pre-existing gene. However, researchers said that regardless, the findings constituted strong evidence that parasites can drive and substantially alter evolution. The research was performed by scientists at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Berkeley"&gt;University of Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; lead by Sylvain Charlat, a post-doc at Berkeley.

♡❤Wolbachia♡❤ is a bacterium that is very effective at jumping from species to species, generally infecting arthropods such as insects. Since the bacterium resides in the &lt;a href="w%3Acytoplasm"&gt;cytoplasm&lt;/a&gt; of cells, males cannot pass ♡❤Wolbachia♡❤ onto their offspring because sperms only pass on their nucleus with the DNA, but females can. ♡❤Wolbachia♡❤ has thus adapted a number of strategies, such as killing male embryos of infected females or preventing infected males from reproducing with uninfected females.

♡❤Wolbachia♡❤ is dangerous to hosts because it is able to easily jump species barriers and so has little reason to restrain itself -if an infectious organism kills its host, it generally dies along with it. The bacterium is believed to be responsible for some extinction events as well as some speciation events.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustria%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; beat the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20U-20%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; 2-1 to advance to the Semi Finals of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20FIFA%20U20%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 FIFA U20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

The Americans opened the scoring in the 15 minute with a cross coming off the left flank to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Red%20Bull"&gt;New York Red Bull&lt;/a&gt; forward &lt;a href="w%3AJosmer%20Altidore"&gt;Josmer Altidore&lt;/a&gt;. Just before halftime, &lt;a href="w%3ARubin%20Okotie"&gt;Rubin Okotie&lt;/a&gt; leveled the score at 1-1. There was no scoring second half.

With the score level at 1 goal each, the game went into extra time. After 13 minutes into the 1st extra frame and a sending off for a second yellow card, &lt;a href="w%3AErwin%20Hoffer"&gt;Erwin Hoffer&lt;/a&gt; came off the bench and scored the game winner.

Austria will play either Czech Republic or Spain in the Semi Finals

The 2 matchday of the Austrian Bundesliga has been completed on Sunday. LASK Linz leads the Bundesliga after 1-1 draw with Austria Vienna. Rapid Vienna's match with SV Mattersburg was postponed due to the fact they played a &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup"&gt;UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt; match on Saturday.

&lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; has scored in &lt;a href="w%3Ainjury%20time"&gt;injury time&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; 2-1 in their &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; Group D fixture.

Saudi Arabia took the lead after twelve minutes, when &lt;a href="w%3AYasser%20Al-Qahtani"&gt;Yasser Al-Qahtani&lt;/a&gt; headed home a cross from the right hand side of the field by &lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Al%20Bahri"&gt;Ahmed Al Bahri&lt;/a&gt;. His header was driven low and to the left of the Indonesian goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AYandri%20Christian%20Pitoy"&gt;Yandri Christian Pitoy&lt;/a&gt;, who dived but failed to get his right hand to the ball.

Indonesia struck back and levelled eight minutes later, when &lt;a href="w%3AElie%20Aiboy"&gt;Elie Aiboy&lt;/a&gt; rounded Saudi goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AYasser%20Al%20Mosailem"&gt;Yasser Al Mosailem&lt;/a&gt; and calmly slotted the ball into the empty net. Elie received a through-ball from &lt;a href="w%3ABudi%20Sudarsono"&gt;Budi Sudarsono&lt;/a&gt; and kept his composure, going to the left of the advancing goalkeeper and taking an extra touch before putting the ball into the back of the net.

Both goalkeepers made saves to keep their sides level, with Mosailem making two late in the first half to keep Saudi Arabia level at the break. Pitoy made a couple of excellent saves late in the second half, and Indonesian defender &lt;a href="w%3AMaman%20Abdurrahman"&gt;Maman Abdurrahman&lt;/a&gt; made a precise sliding tackle to stop a one-on-one opportunity for Al Qahtani on seventy-eight minutes.

The 88,000 predominantly-Indonesian fans inside the &lt;a href="w%3ABung%20Karno%20Stadium"&gt;Bung Karno Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; were silenced by a &lt;a href="w%3ASaad%20Al-Harthi"&gt;Saad Al-Harthi&lt;/a&gt; goal in the ninety-second minute. A swinging free kick from the left hand side saw Al-Harthi leap and head the ball beyond goalkeeper Pitoy's grasp to give Saudi Arabia all three points and the lead of Group D. &lt;a href="w%3AKorea%20Republic%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Korea Republic&lt;/a&gt; play &lt;a href="w%3ABahrain%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon (UTC) in the fourth Group D fixture.

In Group C, &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; has defeat &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; 5-0 at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Stadium%2C%20Bukit%20Jalil"&gt;Bukit Jalil Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKuala%20Lumpur"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt;. It is Malaysia's second consecutive five-goal defeat, after they lost to &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20national%20football%20team"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; 5-1 in their other Group C fixture.

&lt;a href="w%3AMaksim%20Shatskikh"&gt;Maksim Shatskikh&lt;/a&gt; opened the scoring after ten minutes with a back-post header. &lt;a href="w%3ATimur%20Kapadze"&gt;Timur Kapadze&lt;/a&gt; then doubled Uzbekistan's advantage on twenty-nine minutes, before &lt;a href="w%3AUlugbek%20Bakaev"&gt;Ulugbek Bakaev&lt;/a&gt; converted a &lt;a href="w%3Apenalty%20kick"&gt;penalty kick&lt;/a&gt; just before half time to make the score 3-0.

After the break, Malaysia dug in and didn't concede again for forty minutes. On eighty-five minutes, &lt;a href="w%3AAziz%20Ibragimov"&gt;Aziz Ibragimov&lt;/a&gt; broke through to score. Shatskikh completed his double and the 5-0 result in the eighty-ninth minute

The result leaves Uzbekistan on top of Group C on three points, equal with China and &lt;a href="w%3AIran%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. The latter two play each other this afternoon (UTC).

&lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; has appeared in a new but undated video praising martyrdom. "The happy (person) is the one chosen by Allah to be a martyr," he could be seen saying.

The video had the insignia of the &lt;a href="w%3AAs-Sahab"&gt;As-Sahab&lt;/a&gt; group, considered the media production house of &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. The background looked similar to that of older videos, known to have been filmed in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

The video, entitled "Winds of Paradise", features speeches by five suicide bombers and Al-Qaeda leadership. &lt;a href="w%3ASITE%20Institute"&gt;SITE Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit organization which tracks the online activity of terrorist organizations, said that the footage was old, but did not give an estimated date.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 8 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; and has captured the overall lead. He blew away &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Arroyo"&gt;David Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Goubert"&gt;Stéphane Goubert&lt;/a&gt; on the final climb. &lt;a href="w%3AIban%20Mayo"&gt;Iban Mayo&lt;/a&gt; took second. In the end, Arroyo and Goubert were overtaken by the chase group. 

Rasmussen, the &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; mountain specialist who has won the ♡❤King of the Mountain♡❤♡s &lt;a href="w%3APolka%20dot%20jersey"&gt;polka dot jersey&lt;/a&gt; the last two years, maximized the number of points he could collect in today's mountain stage.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rogers"&gt;Michael Rogers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; had looked to be in position to take the &lt;a href="w%3AYellow%20jersey"&gt;yellow jersey&lt;/a&gt;, when he hit a barrier and hurt his wrist in the crash. &lt;a href="w%3AStuart%20O%27Grady"&gt;Stuart O'Grady&lt;/a&gt; also crashed and is out, leaving only two Australians in the Tour.

This, the third-shortest road stage in this year's Tour, was very tough. The climbing started from the outset, with two small climbs in the first 25 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;. At 75 km out, the first big test was &lt;a href="w%3ACormet%20de%20Roselend"&gt;Cormet de Roselend&lt;/a&gt; (a 19 km climb at 6%). This was followed by the &lt;a href="w%3AMont%C3%A9e%20d%27Hauteville"&gt;Montée d'Hauteville&lt;/a&gt; - the start of the &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20St%20Bernard%20Pass"&gt;Col du Petit Saint-Bernard&lt;/a&gt; - and the climb up to &lt;a href="w%3ATignes"&gt;Tignes&lt;/a&gt; (18 km at 5.5%) for a very difficult finish at a height of 2068 m.

&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Cavendish"&gt;Mark Cavendish&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; withdrew 35 km into today's stage. The sprinter had already planned to pull out, but not this soon.

Freecol, the simulation of the historical process that lead to the Declaration of Independence in North America, is the first computer game to be localized in Piedmontese language. Players of the game need to take administrative and political actions to reach its goal. 

Version 0.7.0 in Piedmontese was released on July 13, 2007. Speakers of regional languages hope this will serve as an &lt;a href="wiktionary%3Aexamplar"&gt;examplar&lt;/a&gt;, so that more localizations of the game in other regional languages will be released over time.

The localization was done on Betawiki, the platform which is also used for the localization of the &lt;a href="w%3AMediaWiki"&gt;Mediawiki&lt;/a&gt; software.

The funeral procession, which departed from state capitol in Austin, Texas, slowly moved up Austin and Hill County roads which were lined with hundreds of admirers of Lady Bird Johnson holding flowers, waving American flags or holding up the "hook 'em Horns" sign in honor of her years as a student at the University of Texas and former UT System regent as the hearse carrying her body passed enroute to the LBJ ranch located in Stonewall, TX. 

Mrs. Johnson will be buried in the family cemetery next to her late husband and ex-president Lyndon Baines Johnson who died in 1973. The funeral for Mrs. Johnson was held on Saturday at the Riverbend Centre, attended by over 1,800 people including family, friends along with former presidents &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. There were five current or former first ladies present, Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

On Sunday two separate suicide bombing attacks killed up to 31 people. The first attack took place when a police-army convoy was hit by two roadside bombs in the mountainous region near the Pakistani-Afghani border. The second bombing took place when a suicide bomber detonated in front of a police headquarters in Dera Ismail Kha killing 17 police recruits who were taking a test to join the local police force. Since the Red Mosque siege began there have been 67 people killed in bombing and shooting in Pakistan.

On Saturday 24 soldiers were killed when a suicide bomber crashed into two army vehicles in the town of Swat along the Afghani border. In that attack three civilians were killed 39 people were wounded most of them critically.

Fifteen researchers are planning to take part in a new expedition in an attempt to solve the 70 year-old mystery of &lt;a href="w%3AAmelia%20Earhart"&gt;Amelia Earhart&lt;/a&gt;, a female pilot who disappeared in 1937 after an attempt to fly around the globe.

The team will be lead by Ric Gillespie, a researcher at The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, who plans on searching the uninhabited island of &lt;a href="w%3ANikumaroro"&gt;Nikumaroro&lt;/a&gt; for the remains of Earhart's plane and her navigator, &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Noonan"&gt;Fred Noonan&lt;/a&gt;.

"You can sit around and write books and kick theories around all day. In the end, in archeology, the ground will tell you the truth," said Gillespie's wife, Pat Thrasher.

In 1937, Nikumaroro was known as Garner Island, and Gillespie believes that Earhart's plane crashed on the island while Earhart was trying to fly around the globe in her &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Model%2010%20Electra"&gt;Lockheed 10E Electra&lt;/a&gt;. Earhart was supposed to finish her journey and land on &lt;a href="w%3AHowland%20Island"&gt;Howland Island&lt;/a&gt;, but never arrived, and to this day, no trace of her remains or Noonan's, or of the plane have ever been found, but some remains of skeletons found in 1940, pieces of woman shoes and equipment have been recovered in previous trips to the island and Gillespie says that those remains are consistent with Earhart and what her plane would have been carrying at the time it disappeared.

The new expedition is centered around radio distress calls that are said to have been made by Earhart just before her plane went missing, but many researchers consider the transmissions an elaborate hoax. However; Gillespie says that when Earhart's plane ran out of fuel, Nikumaroro Island would have been the closest place to land. Nikumaroro is approximately 2½ miles long, and about 350 miles south of Howland Island. Gillespie says that both Earhart and Noonan would likely have survived "weeks or months" after the crash, but later died of starvation, lack of fresh water, or may have been severely ill.

The team hopes to begin the trip at the end of July or early August, not long after July 24, which is the 110th anniversary of Earhart's birth, and coincides with her disappearance on July 2, 1937. The expedition will take approximately 17 days to complete.

The &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; police, with support from &lt;a href="INTERPOL"&gt;INTERPOL&lt;/a&gt;, conducted a ten month investigation that used over 300 agents and 45 different courthouses located in 40 of Spain's provinces, which resulted in the arrest of 66 out of 85 people involved in an online child pornography ring.

The suspects' computers were searched, and police uncovered over 48 million photographs and video. One caught in the investigation had 21 separate hard drive discs full of content.

Officials say that on some of the websites the child pornography was posted. There were over 5,000 downloads of the images and video on those sites.

The people arrested are being questioned to see if they had any part in the abuse of any of the children in the videos and images.

&lt;a href="w%3AIran%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; have scored late to draw 2-2 with &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20national%20football%20team"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20AFC%20Asian%20Cup"&gt;2007 AFC Asian Cup&lt;/a&gt; Group C fixture.

China made a dominant start over the Iranians, and were rewarded on five minutes when &lt;a href="w%3AShao%20Jiayi"&gt;Shao Jiayi&lt;/a&gt; struck a curling free kick into the top-left hand corner of the goal, despite Iranian goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Roudbarian"&gt;Hassan Roudbarian&lt;/a&gt; getting one hand to the shot.

&lt;a href="w%3AMao%20Jianqing"&gt;Mao Jianqing&lt;/a&gt; then doubled China's advantage after thirty-six minutes. A defensive error saw an Iranian central defender become attracted to the ball rather than the attackers, and &lt;a href="w%3AZheng%20Zhi"&gt;Zheng Zhi&lt;/a&gt; crossed a ball from the right which found Mao. He took a touch off his chest and then struck the half-volley into the bottom-left hand corner.

Iran managed to equalize just before the break. A free kick was awarded to the Iranian team twenty-five yards out from China's goal, and after a short lay-off, &lt;a href="w%3AZandi"&gt;Zandi&lt;/a&gt; struck a curling strike which beat a diving &lt;a href="w%3ALi%20Leilei"&gt;Li Leilei&lt;/a&gt; in the China goal.

The Iranians then found an equalizer. Captain &lt;a href="w%3AMehdi%20Mahdavikia"&gt;Mehdi Mahdavikia&lt;/a&gt; swung a ball in from the right hand side of the field after a corner was taken short, and &lt;a href="w%3ANekounam"&gt;Nekounam&lt;/a&gt; jumped high at the near post to put Iran level after seventy-three minutes.

Iran will play &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and China meet &lt;a href="w%3AUzbekistan%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; in the final matches of the group. Given Malaysia's form in the tournament to date, it is likely that Iran will defeat the co-hosts. If this occurs, or Malaysia holds Iran to a draw, Uzbekistan must defeat China to progress to the quarter-finals, whilst a draw would be enough for the Chinese. Malaysia cannot mathematically make the next round.

In Group D, &lt;a href="w%3ABahrain%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; have scored late to defeat &lt;a href="w%3AKorea%20Republic%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Korea Republic&lt;/a&gt; 2-1.

&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Do-Heon"&gt;Kim Do-Heon&lt;/a&gt; put the Koreans one goal up after just four minutes after Bahrain failed to clear a free kick properly. However, two minutes before half time, &lt;a href="w%3ASalman%20Isa"&gt;Salman Isa&lt;/a&gt; put Bahrain level after a free kick by &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Hosain"&gt;Mohamed Hosain&lt;/a&gt; found Isa on the back post. 

The Koreans were the more aggressive team in the second half, but failed to finish their chances. In the eighty-fifth minute, Bahrain found the winner when &lt;a href="w%3AIsmaeel%20Abdullatif"&gt;Ismaeel Abdullatif&lt;/a&gt; capitalized on a defensive mistake by &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Jung-woo"&gt;Kim Jung-woo&lt;/a&gt; to score.

Korea must beat &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ABung%20Karno%20Stadium"&gt;Bung Karno Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; two goals or more and have the result of the other game, between Bahrain and &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, not end in a draw to progress to the quarter-finals. Bahrain must defeat the Saudi Arabians to progress.

<h1>US congressman causes controversy by comparing Bush to Hitler</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20congressman%20causes%20controversy%20by%20comparing%20Bush%20to%20Hitler&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Freshman Congressman &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Ellison%20%28politician%29"&gt;Keith Ellison&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;MN&lt;/a&gt;), the only Muslim in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Congress, has caused controversy after comparing &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; to Adolf Hilter, and suggesting that the Bush Administration may have been complicit in the terror attacks of 9/11. 

Speaking to a group of atheists in his home district in &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, Ellison equated the 9/11 attacks and aftermath to the 1933 &lt;a href="w%3AReichstag%20fire"&gt;Reichstag fire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, which helped cement Hitler's power.

He carefully parsed his words stating that he would not 'accuse' the Bush Administration of planning 9/11 because "you know, that's how they put you in the nut-ball box - dismiss you".

Ellison, a co-sponsor of a bill to impeach &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Cheney&lt;/a&gt; for "high crimes and misdemeanors," described the Vice President as "the very definition of totalitarianism, authoritarianism and dictatorship" and further condemned his refusal to answer Congress' questions.

Ellison's promise: "You'll always find this Muslim standing up for your right to be atheists all you want," reportedly "raised eyebrows" among the 300 present. 

Ellison later clarified that he believes that Osama bin Laden was in fact responsible for the attacks of 9/11.

Condemnation came quickly with Republican Mark Drake of Ellison's home state saying: "To compare the democratically elected leader of the United States of America to Hitler is an absolute moral outrage which trivialises the horrors of Nazi Germany."

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS), at least two strong &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; of 6.7 and 6.8 rocked the west coast of &lt;a href="w%3AHonshu%2C%20Japan"&gt;Honshu, Japan&lt;/a&gt; killing 8 people and injuring hundreds. 

A two hour fire was reported at the &lt;a href="w%3AKashiwazaki-Kariwa%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant"&gt;Kashiwazaki Nuclear Power Plant&lt;/a&gt; number 6 reactor transformer, which is the biggest nuclear power facility in the world, causing radioactive water to leak into the sea. Officials at the plant state that the water will cause no damage to the surrounding environment.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; of the first quake was located 65 km (40 miles) southwest of Niigata city, a major city on the west coast of Honshu, of 55.4 km (34.4 miles). The second quake, a 6.8, was recorded almost 12 hours later approximately 140 km (90 miles) northwest of Fukui Island, Honshu, Japan and had a depth of 350.7 km (217.9 miles).

"Many people told me they want to return to their normal lives as quickly as possible. The government will make every effort to help with recovery," said Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA) Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says that no major tsunamis are expected, but small waves could impact areas locally close to the epicenter.Small, 50 centimeter &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunamis&lt;/a&gt; "were reported on coastal areas close to epicenter," said a statement on the USGS website which also added that in Kashiwazaki, "buildings collapsed, roads and bridges were damaged." The USGS says that damage is "moderate to heavy."

"A strong earthquake has occurred, but a tsunami is not expected along the &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Washington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="British%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; coast. No tsunami warning or watch is in effect for these areas," added the NOAA statement.

After being charged on Saturday and having his bail hearing adjourned until today, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n doctor &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Haneef"&gt;Mohamed Haneef&lt;/a&gt; has been granted bail for allegedly supporting terrorists. The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20government%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian federal government&lt;/a&gt; has since cancelled Dr Haneef's work visa, causing him to be held in immigration detention.

Haneef was charged with providing support to a terrorist organisation after a &lt;a href="w%3ASubscriber%20Identity%20Moduls"&gt;SIM card&lt;/a&gt; registered to him was found in the possession of an alleged terror bomber in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdon"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. It is claimed that the two alleged bombers are distant cousins of Dr Haneef's.

Dr Haneef was granted &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;10,000 bail in the Brisbane Magistrate's Court where the magistrate said that Haneef had no known links to a terrorist organisation and that there were no allegations that the SIM card had been used in the planned attacks on &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Glasgow%20International%20Airport%20attack"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20London%20car%20bombs"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

Australian Immigration minister &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Andrews"&gt;Kevin Andrews&lt;/a&gt; said he believed Dr Haneef had failed a character test, which allows him to cancel Haneef's visa under immigration laws. "I reasonably suspect that he has or has had an association with persons engaged in criminal activity, criminal conduct, namely terrorism in the UK," said Mr Andrews.

Mr Andrews said Haneef would be detained in Brisbane pending his charges being dealt until arrangements can be made to move him to &lt;a href="w%3AVillawood%20Detention%20Centre"&gt;Villawood Detention Centre&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney.

A certificate notifying the government of Haneef's charges will be issued by the Australian Federal Police, which will allow the government to detain Haneef in immigration detention while his charges are being dealt with.

Minister Andrews defended his decision claiming it was his responsibility to cancel Haneef's visa. Andrews said that Haneef has or has had an association with people involved in criminal conduct and this constitutes failure of a character test.

When questioned on whether or not his decision was an indirect revocation of Haneef's bail the immigration minister said "The magistrate in Brisbane has a set of responsibilities which she has carried out and I'm making no comment whatsoever on the magistrate or any decision made by the magistrate".

When Haneef's criminal charges have been dealt with, the minister's move means that he will be deported when he is acquitted or upon the completion of any sentence imposed.

Haneef will reappear in court on August 31.

Transport company &lt;a href="w%3AMetronet"&gt;Metronet&lt;/a&gt;, the firm responsible for upgrading three-quarters of London tube system, is facing administration following a preliminary decision from rail arbiter &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Bolt"&gt;Chris Bolt&lt;/a&gt; which limits the amount that &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; (TfL) is obliged to pay for cost overruns to £121 million. The company had asked for £551m.

The arbitrations follows a row over who should pay for the overspend, estimated at between £1.2bn and £2bn in total. Metronet have claimed that the costs are due to changing requirements from TfL. This was disputed however by TfL and the Mayor of London, who has said previously that the costs were due to "management incompetence".

The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, has previously stated that he will not give Metronet one penny more than he is legally obliged to, and that if they go into administration TfL will step in and take control.

The company was awarded the tube contract under a &lt;a href="w%3APublic-private%20partnership"&gt;Public-private partnership&lt;/a&gt; arrangement, which was a central policy of the Labour government, but fiercely (and legally) contested by the London Mayor.

The Metronet board have said they are considering their position and will make a statement later today or tomorrow.

<h1>Kwik-E-Mart promotion drawing thousands of visitors</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Kwik-E-Mart%20promotion%20drawing%20thousands%20of%20visitors&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Driving nearly 30 miles (48 km) to visit a convenience store was not out of the question for fans of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Simpsons"&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of such fans converged on a &lt;a href="w%3A7-Eleven"&gt;7-Eleven&lt;/a&gt; store in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; to witness that store's transformation for the month of July into a &lt;a href="w%3AKwik-E-Mart"&gt;Kwik-E-Mart&lt;/a&gt;, a fictional convenience store from the popular animated television show.

As part of a marketing campaign for an &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Simpsons%20Movie"&gt;upcoming feature film&lt;/a&gt; based on the long-running TV series, twelve of more than 6,000 U.S. and Canadian 7-Eleven stores were effectively converted into the fictional store: the store signs and banners, colors, employees' uniforms and even merchandise were changed to match those shown on TV. Stores were outfitted with Simpsons-themed window displays, cardboard cutouts of the show's characters, and carried such cartoon staples as Squishees and pink donuts that matched those favored by one of the title characters, Homer Simpson.
While initial reports indicated that sales at the converted locations were up by 30%, the scene this weekend at the Los Angeles location left little doubt that the promotion was working &amp;mdash; at least for 7-Eleven. The Los Angeles store was half-encircled by a line of well over a hundred would-be visitors waiting over a half an hour to go inside the convenience store. A security guard controlled the crowd, letting only about 15 people visit the store at a time. As 7-Eleven stores operate 24 hours, this crowd control measure was a round-the-clock operation, with thousands of visitors showing up in a course of a day in a never-ending line.

One of the people in line was William, a young man from Hacienda Heights, California, who had heard about the fact that there was a Kwik-E-Mart from a friend. Driving more than 30 miles just to visit a store, he was looking forward to seeing what the store had changed. He was unable to get others in on his enthusiasm, though: a friend declined his invitation to visit the themed store since it "wasn't a big deal." After driving all the way he was prepared to wait at least a half an hour in the line: his patience likely tested as he was not even half-way to the entrance 20 minutes after lining up.
Despite the wait and the busy atmosphere, the set up was visibly enjoyable for visitors to the location. Families and groups of friends lined up to take pictures in front of plastic 3D models of Simpsons' characters on the wall of the store building. Even the neighbors put up with the circus: living just around the corner, Sharla walked over to the store and waited in line 20 minutes to get a pink movie donut and a drink. She had only positive things to say about the visit to the store, categorizing the whole experience as fun.

In two separate incidents, men posing as members of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Police%20Department"&gt;New York Police Department&lt;/a&gt; (NYPD), have invaded homes in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; area. In both cases, they robbed the residents, but in the most recent, they &lt;a href="w%3ASexual%20assault"&gt;sexually assaulted&lt;/a&gt; a woman.

On Saturday, July 14, at 1:09 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;), four men knocked on the door of a &lt;a href="w%3AYonkers%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Yonkers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, apartment. The 33-year-old male that lives there opened the door, as the men outside wore NYPD hats and t-shirts, and had &lt;a href="w%3ABadge"&gt;badges&lt;/a&gt; hanging around their necks.

The men promptly ordered the male victim to the floor. "When this guy pushed me, he had a gun in my face," the victim said. "I could see the other guy. He motioned to the others, come on, let's go, let's go." The intruders shouted "Where are the drugs?" as they ransacked the apartment.

Two of the men entered the bedroom and sexually assaulted the 30-year-old female. The couple has a five-year-old child, who was sleeping in another bedroom. "The more I resisted, the more he began to hit me," the woman said. She said she was sexually assaulted by two of the men while her boyfriend was bound and guarded.
Police said the men then left with a cell phone, a laptop computer, a diamond ring and a gold chain. Police do not believe that they were real officers. As of this afternoon, no arrests have been made.

On Thursday, July 5, shortly after six p.m. in the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20New%20York%2C%20Brooklyn"&gt;East New York&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of &lt;a href="w%3ABrooklyn"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; five men knocked on the door claiming to be "the police." When the victims opened the door, they pushed their way in demanding the family give them drugs and money. 

When police responded to a call reporting a robbery, they found the family, husband, wife and their daughter, tied up. The man suffered a head injury when he was &lt;a href="w%3APistol-whipping"&gt;pistol-whipped&lt;/a&gt;. Police say the robbers got away with a camera, jewelry, and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;5,000 in currency.

Neighbors told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANY1"&gt;NY1&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that they were stunned. "Frightened. Make you think twice before you want to open the door, you know," said one of the neighbors. "Now you be asking for all this ID and stuff and even still you're going to wonder, are they for real? So it's kind of scary."

There is no word about whether the two cases are connected. Yonkers is on the border of New York City, but is outside the &lt;a href="w%3AJurisdiction"&gt;jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt; of the NYPD.

A man identified as Aaron Richard Snyder showed up on Monday around 2:25 p.m. outside the &lt;a href="Colorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; Capitol offices of Governor Bill Ritter. He was carrying a 357-caliber 7 shot Smith and Wesson revolver with 20 extra rounds of ammunition and started screaming "I am the emperor" and "I am here to take over the state".

When he was confronted by a Colorado State trooper, Snyder opened his jacket showing that he was carrying a gun. The trooper ordered Snyder to drop the gun, but instead he moved "menancingly" in the direction of the trooper who then shot him once in the head and twice in the chest.

Snyder died from the multiple gunshot wounds on the floor of the Capitol office building. The Capitol went on a full lockdown with employees, tour groups and visitors in the building at the time ordered to stay where they were.

Governor Ritter was interviewing a judge candidate in his office at the time of the shooting. He held a press conference on the Capitol step two hours later. 

Mr. Snyder was under doctors care for delusional behavior. The Northglenn, Colorado police issued a BOL "Be On the Lookout" to all law enforcement agencies in Colorado for Snyder and his car, a 2004 black Kia, around 25 minutes before the shooting occurred.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20government%20of%20Australia"&gt;federal government&lt;/a&gt; has come under fire by prominent human rights lawyer Julian Burnside, Q.C. for using migration laws to circumvent the release of &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Haneef"&gt;Mohamed Haneef&lt;/a&gt; after he was granted bail in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; Magistrate's Court. 

Haneef is alleged to have provided support to a terrorist organisation, for leaving his mobile phone SIM card with &lt;a href="w%3ASabeel%20Ahmed"&gt;Sabeel Ahmed&lt;/a&gt; who allegedly had knowledge of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Glasgow%20International%20Airport%20attack"&gt;Glasgow attacks&lt;/a&gt;. 

Haneef's lawyers have also attacked the government's decision saying it will make it more difficult for Haneef to mount a defence should he be held in immigration detention. His lawyers are considering delaying posting his bail surety until his visa issues are resolved. This will allow Haneef to stay in Brisbane near them, his lawyers say. They have also indicated that they will appeal the government's decision.

Australian immigration minister Kevin Andrews announced yesterday that he had used his powers under the Migration Act to cancel Haneef's visa as he had failed a character check.

Mr Burnside is sceptical of Mr Andrews' motives, claiming the government would not have cancelled Haneef's visa if he had not been bailed. He said Mr Andrew's moves amount to the government interfering in the judicial process.

“They want to keep him here for trial. They waited to cancel his visa until they saw whether he got bail,” Mr Burnside told Southern Cross Broadcasting.

“If he didn’t get bail then they weren’t going to cancel the visa."

“This is a misuse of power in bad faith for the explicit purpose of trumping a magistrate’s order that he should be let out on bail."

“I think it’s disgraceful that Andrews has lent himself to doing it, because as a lawyer, he ought to know better,” said Mr Burnside.

Mr Burnside attacked the government, claiming its decision to cancel Haneef's visa tramples on some of the key foundations of democracy. He further alleged that the government was acting hypocritically. 

“We are supposed to be a democratic society. I thought the war against terrorism was an effort to preserve our democracy. But here we are trashing it left, right and centre in the name of saving it.”

Burnside also questioned the government's anti-terror laws, saying it was unusual for a person to be charged with giving someone a &lt;a href="w%3ASubscriber%20Identity%20Card"&gt;SIM card&lt;/a&gt; twelve months earlier.

&lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland's&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; called on the immigration minister to explain the reason for Haneef's visa being cancelled. Mr Beattie said that the Australian people believed the government was being heavy-handed.

"But clearly the Federal Minister for Immigration has acted in relation to particular information from the federal police."

"If there's something they have become aware of since this investigation started that's not the subject of the charge, then they should share that with the Australian people," Mr Beattie told the media.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Local caterers get ready for big business, as almost three thousand fans converge on the &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20L.%20Lawrence%20Convention%20Center"&gt;David L. Lawrence Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndependence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; weekend for the world's largest ever &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afurry%20convention"&gt;furry convention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnthrocon"&gt;Anthrocon 2007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Many hope to renew acquaintances, or meet new friends. Others look to buy from dealers and artists, or show off new artwork or costumes. Some attend to make money, or even learn a thing or two. But one thing unites them: They're all there to have fun.

<h2>Costly expansion</h2>

This year marks the second time this ten-year-old convention has been held in Pittsburgh. Members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afurry%20fandom"&gt;furry fandom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have lived in the region for years, but prior to 2006 their annual gathering took place 300 miles to the east, in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Fears of union rates kept the growing fan convention away from the Steel City for years, but Anthrocon ultimately outgrew all other options. The purchase and demolition by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATarget%20Corporation"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of its regular hotel, the Adams Mark, led to a cramped last-minute alternative for Anthrocon 2005. Convention leaders became determined to provide a better venue, no matter the cost.

And that cost is high. The convention hall alone runs to $24,000; A/V and labor costs nearly triple that before accounting for the main ballroom. The board of Anthrocon, Inc. seems to like the venue, though, and has booked it through 2009. Its chairman, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20Conway"&gt;Dr. Samuel Conway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; better known in the furry world as "Uncle Kage" &amp;mdash; seems determined to keep other fees to a minimum, taking time during the pre-con staff meeting to caution against last-minute extras.

Similar touches can be seen elsewhere; bag racks are shared with long-running sci-fi event &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilcon"&gt;Philcon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and spare paper is kept packed away for next year. It may seem like penny-pinching, but the results speak volumes: Anthrocon has kept in the black for the last three years.

Where does the money come from? Attendees pay from $35 to $50 depending on when they register - or perhaps nothing at all, if they worked as a volunteer last year. But that isn't quite enough to cover the costs.

It is Anthrocon's sponsors who make up the gap. Of the 2849 registered attendees, hundreds paid $90 or $175 for the privilege of faster registration, a convention t-shirt, and - for the 202 SuperSponsors - preferential seating and free food. This year the price includes a three-course luncheon with the convention's guests of honor; voice actor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Paulsen"&gt;Rob Paulsen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarolyn%20Kelly"&gt;Carolyn Kelly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (daughter of ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APogo%20%28comic%20strip%29"&gt;Pogo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ artist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Kelly"&gt;Walt Kelly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) and animation writer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Evanier"&gt;Mark Evanier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h2>Programming and entertainment</h2>

Three courses may not sound like much, but for some con-goers the standard fare is cheese pizza and granola bars, consumed between the many panels, workshops and special events. The vast majority of programming is provided by fans, though guests are expected to pass on their experiences in return for accommodation and travel expenses. Tutorials on arts, crafts and fiction are the order of the day, though several more exotic events do stand out.

This year's Masquerade (where costumed fans perform skits for the audience) ended with the performers dancing with the audience in the aisles to the tune of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warp"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Earlier that day members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFunday%20PawPet%20Show"&gt;Funday PawPet Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; provided a ninety-minute puppet extravaganza. Comedy plays a significant large part in the lineup, with home-bred entertainers such as Matthew Davis (or "2, The Ranting Gryphon") doling out the laughs. Dr. Conway played a part with his Story Hour &amp;mdash; a regular fixture involving personal tales with a humorous spin.

Anthrocon has historically held itself to three days of activities, though this year's holiday provided an excuse for many to arrive early. For some, the entertainment started early, too; Thursday night saw a staged reading of ♡❤Furry Tales♡❤, a unofficial musical inspired by Anthrocon 2006. The cabaret found itself swamped by furry fans, and was well-received as a comedy, though Anthrocon board members had reservations about the show's accuracy. When its creators admitted not actually having attended a furry convention, Conway told them he "knew where there was one."
Convention leaders often find themselves having to explain things to those who have heard second-hand accounts. For example, while the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFur%20and%20Loathing"&gt;fabled furpiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACSI%3A%20Crime%20Scene%20Investigation"&gt;CSI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; do exist, they're hardly the public orgy depicted &amp;mdash; you'll find furs snuggling together, but conduct in lobby areas remains firmly PG.

As for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Afursuit"&gt;fursuits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , there's no denying their popularity. Fursuits are similar in construction to mascot costumes used by companies, schools, and sports teams, however they are personal to the wearer. Surveys suggest that up to 15% of convention attendees have one, and Anthrocon 2007 is no exception, with 353 in the half-hour long Saturday parade; potentially a record for mascots in a procession. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20World%20Records"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were invited to confirm this next year, while convention staff promised more fans in the ♡❤headless lounge♡❤ to keep the costumed critters from overheating. The lounge costs Anthrocon $1,000/day to rent.

Other groups sought a different brand of comedy. Four "protesters" from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aimageboard"&gt;imageboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤7chan♡❤ stationed themselves outside a daycare center opposite the convention hotel on Saturday. Two wore &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfro"&gt;Afro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wigs and bore anti-furry banners. Most attendees treated the "raiders" as part of the entertainment, especially after it began to rain. Dr. Conway and Operations Director Douglas Muth eventually took pity on the group, lending them Anthrocon-branded umbrellas.

<h2>Audience</h2>
Anthrocon has a significant international draw. However, most are native English-speakers &amp;mdash; of the 18 countries represented at the event, the USA, Canada and the UK make up over 98% of attendees.

While other countries have their own furry events, on average they're only about one tenth the size. The largest outside of North America is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEurofurence"&gt;Eurofurence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which drew 405 in 2006. Anthrocon's closest competition is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFurther%20Confusion"&gt;Further Confusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , while Midwest FurFest in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; provides a third alternative, spurred by 35% growth last year. Anthrocon's own yearly growth was 14%.

Ontario's ♡❤Feral!♡❤ is set in a campground, but at Anthrocon hotels are a necessity. Many share four or (unofficially) more to a room, skirting the bounds of local fire codes. Part of this is due to the cost. Even at the discount rate, a night in the convention hotel is $125 after tax; furry fans are often young, with little money to spare.

Money isn't the only explanation, though. Furry fans are "social creatures", and for some Anthrocon represents the only time in the year when they can meet up with friends from around the world. When not attending a panel or watching fellow fans fursuiting, many can be found chatting, drawing or playing games in The Zoo &amp;mdash; the convention's 24-hour social space. If it weren't for the discos, some might never leave.

<h2>Art show and dealers</h2>

One prime attraction is the art show. On display are framed and unframed prints and originals, along with a few items of sculpture and even one fursuit head - and almost everything is on sale to the right bidder. Due to time constraints, only the most hotly-contested pieces go to voice auction. This year, one piece breached the $1,000 mark in the PG category - "Just one more", by California artist ♡❤Dark Natasha♡❤.

The piece was one of a set created by seven prominent furry artists to depict the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aseven%20deadly%20sins"&gt;seven deadly sins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - in this case, Greed. Adult art commanded a slightly higher price, with one work by ♡❤Taurin Fox♡❤ going for $2,000. But bargains could be had in both sections for those willing to forgo a popular name. A number of items went for the minimum bid, sometimes as low as $10 for large colored pieces.
Anthrocon does not require artists to pay for display space, though it takes a commission on sales, and will charge artists to ship them back if they are left unsold; a policy which encourages low minimums. Similarly, artists looking to sell commissions for items such as sketches and unofficial convention badges do not have to pay up-front for space in the crowded Artists' Alley &amp;mdash; though they do face the risk of not being able to get a place at all, as happened to some on Friday and Saturday.

The convention does require payment for dealers tables, at which works by others may be sold. The fee for a full table is $115, or $70 over regular pre-registration. Extra table space is significantly more expensive, to encourage variety. 245 dealers and assistants registered this year, ranging from professional artists through comic dealers, publishers, musicians, costumers and plush toy vendors.

<h2>Charity and volunteers</h2>
The convention supported Animal Friends, a local &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ano-kill%20shelter"&gt;no-kill animal shelter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Over $6,600 was raised by Sunday night. Of this, $5,053 came from a charity auction featuring 77 items donated by members of the fandom. Some, like a ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20and%20Kell"&gt;Kevin and Kell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ original, would have been at home in the regular art auction. Other donations, such as the 12-packs of Canadian Coke and the pound of beef jerky, were more esoteric.
Proceeds were down from previous years, which Charity Director Brian Harris unofficially attributed to timing; the fursuit parade ran simultaneously to the charity presentation, and overran part of the auction. While most large furry conventions sponsor charities, not all have such auctions; many simply donate a portion of their "earnings" to the cause.

The task of managing these events falls to over 130 volunteer staff members, most of whom spend around 12 to 18 hours "on duty" during the convention. But they don't do it alone. Security for the event is provided by the red-shirted Dorsai Irregulars, known since the mid-1970s for their activities in the science fiction community. The Dorsai have been associated with Anthrocon since 2002, and plan to expand to other furry conventions, including Connecticut's ♡❤FurFright♡❤. They have also begun to recruit from the furry fandom.

<h2>Local impact</h2>
Last year gave local vendors plenty to think about. Dr. Conway reported the total impact on the local economy at $2.5 million. Regardless of the actual figure, the local &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKwik-E-Mart"&gt;Kwik-E-Mart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; started taking furry fandom seriously when shelves started coming up bare.

This year, vendors thought themselves better-prepared. The Steel City Diner printed 100 shirts celebrating the convention, only to run out on Friday afternoon. The diner met their weekly sales target by Wednesday, and doubled that by Friday night, working through Sunday to keep up with demand.

Neighboring sub shop Fernando's drew blue paw-marks on the pavement to attract customers, and offered a special $5 menu for attendees. Its proprietor also came to the aid of his furry customers as they were being harassed by a local beggar &amp;mdash; who gave Fernando a mild skull fracture for his trouble.

While local cab drivers had compliments, not everyone appreciated the company. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Cubs"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; decided to cancel their booking after hearing about the con, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJ.J.%20Hardy"&gt;J.J. Hardy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMilwaukee%20Brewers"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reported being kept up by fans on Wednesday night. The Brewers lost their game the following day. 

The convention closed with next year's date &amp;mdash; June 26-29 &amp;mdash; along with the announcement of a guest: Disney animator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFloyd%20Norman"&gt;Floyd Norman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The event's theme will be "It's a Jungle Out There!"

<h1>Police officer killed, at least 18 injured in south Thailand blasts</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Police%20officer%20killed%2C%20at%20least%2018%20injured%20in%20south%20Thailand%20blasts&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Taking place in &lt;a href="w%3AYala%2C%20Thailand"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of one of Thailand's three southernmost provinces, the first blast, at around 8 a.m. local time (0100 GMT), resulted in no injuries, but drew police and journalists to the scene. Then, about 30 minutes after the initial blast, a second, more powerful bomb went off.

The explosion tore through shops and a &lt;a href="w%3AMotorcycle%20taxi"&gt;motorcycle taxi&lt;/a&gt; stand at a major intersection across the street from the city's railway station. 

Police Sergeant Subin Pruekmongkol, 48, who lost his arms and legs in the blast, was taken to Yala Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 

At least eight other police officers were wounded, two of them seriously, while four local journalists were also taken to hospital. The injury tolls varied widely, with local news reports saying at least 18 people were injured, while &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reported that up to 32 people had been hurt.

Police said the first bomb was hidden inside a motorcycle helmet and placed in the front basket of a motorbike. The second blast was set off remotely after people had flocked to the blast site. This tactic of using a smaller bomb as a lure, followed by a second stronger bomb, has become more common in the &lt;a href="south%20Thailand%20insurgency"&gt;south Thailand insurgency&lt;/a&gt;. Since attacks by separatists in Thailand's Malay Muslim-majority provinces flared up in January 2004, there are have about 2,000 people killed in bombings and almost-daily drive-by shootings.

In a separate violence earlier today in &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala Province&lt;/a&gt;, a man was fatally shot in front of a tea shop in &lt;a href="w%3AAmphoe%20Yaha"&gt;Yaha District&lt;/a&gt;.

In &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, the central government's Cabinet agreed to extend an emergency law in the southern provinces for another three months. The current round expires on Friday. The emergency powers, which are set for three-month periods, were first enacted in 2005. Among other powers, the decree allows officials the authority to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge. About 350 suspects have been rounded up and detained under the law in the past few weeks, according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Nation%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper.

&lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Gordon%20Pugh"&gt;Lewis Gordon Pugh&lt;/a&gt;, 37, a man from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has become the first person to swim at the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Pole"&gt;North pole&lt;/a&gt;. The water, 29 degrees F (-1.8 C), is believed to be the coldest waters any human has ever swam in on the planet.

"I am obviously ecstatic to have succeeded but this swim is a triumph and a tragedy. A triumph that I could swim in such ferocious conditions, but a tragedy that it's possible to swim at the North Pole," said Pugh who swam 0.6 miles in just under 19 minutes through cracks in icebergs.

Pugh says he swam at the North Pole to demonstrate the effects that &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; is playing on the &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; and is hoping that his act will gain the attention of leaders from around the world.

"The decisions which they make over the next few years will determine the biodiversity of our world. I want my children, and their children, to know that polar bears are still living in the Arctic — these creatures are on the front line up here," added Pugh.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature"&gt;World Wide Fund for Nature&lt;/a&gt; (WWF), which sponsored the swim, states that the only reason Pugh was able to swim in the freezing waters was due to global warming.

"[The swim was] a bittersweet victory, as this swim has only been possible because of climate change," said WWF U.K. spokesman, Colin Butfield. The waters were completely frozen ten years ago and the swim would have been impossible to complete.

Pugh has also swum in the waters of &lt;a href="w%3AAntarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; where he was credited to being the only person to swim so far south earning him the nickname "The Polar Bear." Pugh also swam the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.

"It was frightening. The pain was immediate and felt like my body was on fire. I was in excruciating pain from beginning to end and I nearly quit on a few occasions. It was without doubt the hardest swim of my life," added Pugh.

In the wake of yesterday's earthquakes, Japan is today reporting that leaks at the &lt;a href="w%3AKashiwazaki-Kariwa%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant"&gt;Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant&lt;/a&gt; are worse than first reported.

In addition to a leak of 315 gallons (1200 liters) of radioactive water into the &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20of%20Japan"&gt;Sea of Japan&lt;/a&gt;, reports say that drums with nuclear waste lost their lids and radioactive gases &lt;a href="w%3Acobalt-60"&gt;cobalt-60&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Achromium"&gt;chromium-51&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aiodine"&gt;iodine&lt;/a&gt; were released into the atmosphere. Several pipes are also reported to have broken.

Officials are also reporting 50 different problems at the plant of "malfunctioning and trouble," but officials would not comment further on the damage other than calling the issues "minor."

An &lt;a href="w%3AAmtrak"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt; passenger train de-railed after hitting a pickup truck in &lt;a href="w%3APlant%20City%2C%20Florida"&gt;Plant City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The driver of the pickup truck was killed on impact. The crash occurred at a marked railroad crossing inside of an industrial area, according to an Amtrak spokesperson.

None of the 133 passengers were seriously hurt, however, the train's engineer and five passengers were taken to a local hospital after suffering minor injuries. The remaining passengers were taken to a local &lt;a href="w%3Abowling%20alley"&gt;bowling alley&lt;/a&gt;. Although the train's two locomotives and nine cars de-railed, they remained upright. 

Witnesses report the train sounded its horns at the appropriate times. It was reported the pickup truck simply drove in front of the train.

The crash is the second to occur this week with a train; on Monday, a driver in a &lt;a href="w%3APontiac%20Grand%20Am"&gt;Pontiac Grand Am&lt;/a&gt; deliberately ignored the lights and crossing arms at another railroad crossing in the area, and drove around them, into the path of a different Amtrak train on the same route. The impact caused the car to go airborne. All four people in the car were killed; no one on the train was injured.

The 159.5 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; stage 9 began with a cold start to the &lt;a href="w%3AHors%20Categorie"&gt;Hors Categorie&lt;/a&gt; climb up to the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20l%27Iseran"&gt;Col de l'Iseran&lt;/a&gt; (15 km at 6%), followed by the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20du%20T%C3%A9l%C3%A9graphe"&gt;Col du Télégraphe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20du%20Galibier"&gt;Col du Galibier&lt;/a&gt; (12 km at 6.7% and 17.5 km at 7%) with a 32 km downhill finish in &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%C3%A7on"&gt;Briançon&lt;/a&gt;.

The Colombian &lt;a href="w%3ABarloworld"&gt;Barloworld&lt;/a&gt; rider was the first to top the peak of Col du Galibier and held on during the downhill finish. The chase group finished 38 seconds behind him.

Soler was excited by his stage victory: "It’s an incredible day. I’m living out a dream. I worked very hard to arrive at the finish on my own and I received the superb prize for that effort. I wanted to achieve something for myself in my Tour debut and at 24 years of age, I’ve been able to stamp my name on a stage. Nobody believed I could win here, not even me."

Pre-Tour-favorite, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexandre%20Vinokourov"&gt;Alexandre Vinokourov&lt;/a&gt;, who has been struggling since he crashed on stage 5, lost nearly three minutes the in chase for the &lt;a href="w%3AYellow%20jersey"&gt;yellow jersey&lt;/a&gt; and is now in 21st place overall.

"I did what I could," said Vinokourov. "The team worked well again and tried to reduce the gap. It was another horrible day for me."

&lt;a href="w%3ALinus%20Gerdemann"&gt;Linus Gerdemann&lt;/a&gt;, who surprised everyone in stage 7, fell out of the top ten overall and had to surrender the &lt;a href="w%3AMaillot%20blanc"&gt;white jersey&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Contador"&gt;Alberto Contador&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Georgia Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Atoxicology"&gt;toxicology&lt;/a&gt; reports reveal that the former pro-wrestler &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Benoit"&gt;Chris Benoit&lt;/a&gt; had ten times the normal level of &lt;a href="w%3Atestosterone"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="w%3Ahydrocodone"&gt;hydrocodone&lt;/a&gt; (a painkiller), and &lt;a href="w%3AXanax"&gt;Xanax&lt;/a&gt; (an &lt;a href="w%3Aanti-depressant"&gt;anti-anxiety&lt;/a&gt; medication).

Benoit also reportedly tested negative for &lt;a href="w%3Aalcohol"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;.

Benoit's wife, &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Benoit"&gt;Nancy Benoit&lt;/a&gt; also tested positive for Xanax, and the painkiller &lt;a href="w%3Ahydromorphone"&gt;hydromorphone&lt;/a&gt;. Benoit's son Daniel could not be tested due to a lack of &lt;a href="w%3Aurine"&gt;urine samples&lt;/a&gt;, but Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner who performed the autopsies on the bodies says that "Daniel Benoit was sedated at the time he died" and that "there's no reason why a seven-year-old child would be taking Xanax."

Federal authorities have charged &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Astin"&gt;Dr. Phil Astin&lt;/a&gt; with improperly dispensing medication painkillers and other drugs to two other patients. Astin has pleaded not guilty.

On Tuesday afternoon a &lt;a href="w%3ATAM%20Linhas%20A%C3%A9reas"&gt;TAM Linhas Aéreas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A320%20family"&gt;Airbus A320&lt;/a&gt; (flight #&lt;a href="w%3ATAM%20Linhas%20A%C3%A9reas%20Flight%203054"&gt;JJ3054&lt;/a&gt;) crashed while attempting a landing at Congonhas airport, in &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. The plane reportedly skidded off the wet runway, crossed a busy thoroughfare before careening into a fuel depot and warehouse ultimately bursting into flames.

"The plane accelerated when it reached the end of the runway and tried to take off again to avoid the road, but it crashed into the building and exploded," Junior Matos told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

Authorities believe that all 180 people onboard the plane have died, and a further 15 people on the ground are feared dead as well.

Earlier, there were reports from the Brazilian media that eight people, some from the plane, and some from the gas station, were taken to the local hospital for treatment and that Brazilian congressman Júlio Redecker was also on board the plane. 

Low clouds and heavy rain were reported at the time of the crash. Additionally, the runway has had a history of problems with standing water. Neither of these factors have been linked to the cause of the crash at this point.

Rodrigo Pinho, state attorney, said the authorities will thoroughly investigate "to determine the cause and to identify who was responsible".

&lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; Democratic Majority Leader from &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; has asked that the senate vote on the Levin/Reed Amendment at 11:00 a.m. (eastern time), which would begin a pullout of some U.S. troops from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in 120 days, if the amendment is passed.

Currently, the U.S. senate is pulling an all-night debate on the Iraq war to decide whether troops should be pulled out of the country.

Despite the all-night session, some senators say that the debate is nothing more than a publicity stunt.

"Our enemies aren't threatened by talk-a-thons, and our troops deserve better than publicity stunts," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMitch%20McConnell"&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a Republican Senator from &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.

"We have no alternative except to keep them in session to explain their obstruction," added Reid.

Democrats are calling for a "simple majority vote" of at least 51 in order for the amendment to go forward, while Republicans want at least 60 votes.

&lt;a href="w%3AMetronet"&gt;Metronet&lt;/a&gt;, a company set up to manage the upgrade of three-quarters of London's tube network, has gone into &lt;a href="w%3AAdministration%20%28insolvency%29"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt; (which is similar to &lt;a href="w%3AChapter%2011%2C%20Title%2011%2C%20United%20States%20Code"&gt;Chapter 11&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;) after having accrued debts of up to £2 billion, following the decision on Monday to limit the amount of extra funds that the company would receive from public funds.

A notice on the Metronet website announced that the Boards of both Metronet BCV (responsible for the upgrade of the Bakerloo, Central and Victoria lines) and Metronet SSL (responsible for upgrade of the 'sub-surface' lines) had asked the Mayor to seek the appointment of a PPP Administrator. The statement says that the decision follows a period of 'financial uncertainty', with the decision of the arbiter leaving Metronet "unable to carry out its contract".

Metronet's shareholders, the companies &lt;a href="w%3AWS_Atkins_PLC"&gt;Atkins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABalfour%20Beatty"&gt;Balfour Beatty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABombardier"&gt;Bombardier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEDF%20Energy"&gt;EDF Energy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThames%20Water"&gt;Thames Water&lt;/a&gt; had blocked access to an extra funds, and each have a limited liability of £350 million, their original equity stake.

&lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20for%20London"&gt;Transport for London&lt;/a&gt; have reassured the public that tube services will not be affected - Metronet is not responsible for day-to-day operation - but it is so far unclear what will happen to the upgrade contracts.

A freight train in &lt;a href="w%3ALviv%2C%20Ukraine"&gt;Lviv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; derailed, caught fire, and spilled a toxic chemical, releasing dangerous fumes into the air early Tuesday morning (local time), and people who live near the site of the crash are still becoming sick. Officials say that the toxic cloud, surrounding at least 14 villages near the scene, is at least 23% above benign levels.

So far 70 people, including 19 children, have been hospitalized after being poisoned by the fumes from train cars filled with &lt;a href="w%3APhosphorus"&gt;yellow phosphorous&lt;/a&gt;. That number is up from the 15 seeking medical attention on Tuesday.

"I can say we have resolved the situation by extinguishing those tankers. Now we need to talk about dealing with the aftermath of this breakdown," said &lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Yanukovych"&gt;Viktor Yanukovych&lt;/a&gt;, Ukraine's Prime Minister.

"This is a dangerous substance ... It is highly flammable and causes burns and choking," said Greenpeace &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; toxic gas expert, Alexei Kiselev.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; has stated that they will continue to monitor the gas cloud because toxic gas clouds do not "respect borders" of countries and will travel.

The train was shipping cargo from &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; when it derailed. Authorities have ruled out sabotage and terrorism from playing a role in the crash and are still investigating the accident. At least 15 cars, of the 58 the train was pulling, derailed or were overturned.

Water and local crops are said to not be affected by the chemical spill.

After a rare all-night session, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; voted today at 11 a.m. EST on the motion to invoke &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acloture"&gt;cloture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the Levin/Reed Amendment (S.Amdt. 2087) which would begin a pullout of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; troops from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, but only 52 votes were cast in favor of the amendment and 47 were cast against it, falling short of the 60 votes needed to overcome the Republican &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afilibuster"&gt;filibuster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the measure.

Cots were brought in for the Senators to catch snatches of sleep during the long night, while some slept at their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; apartments for short periods of time. Pizza was brought in for senators to eat. Seven Democrats left the Senate floor to join a candlelight vigil held outside across the street from Congress.

Had the bill passed, troops would have left Iraq 120 days after the vote, and would have been out of the country by April of 2008.

Four Republican critics of the war &amp;mdash; both of &lt;a href="Maine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;'s senators, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Collins"&gt;Susan Collins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOlympia%20Snowe"&gt;Olympia Snowe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , together with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Hagel"&gt;Chuck Hagel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Smith"&gt;Gordon Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; voted for the proposal. Collins' was a surprise vote; although a critic, she has not been favorable toward the deadline approach. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Lieberman"&gt;Joe Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Democrat"&gt;Independent Democrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; senator from &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, who caucuses with Democrats, voted with Republicans against the motion, as he has done with all Iraq war legislation this year.

Last night during the all-night senate debate, Democratic Majority Leader from &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt;, asked that the Senate vote on the bill this morning. He later voted no on the motion in order to take advantage of Senate rules to reintroduce the measure.

After the motion failed, Reid proposed that the Senate look at a series of Iraq proposals, including the failed plan, and make them subject to a simple majority vote. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMitch%20McConnell"&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Republican Minority Leader from &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; objected, and Reid withdrew the legislation from the floor. The Senate then moved on to discussing student loans and grants.

Throughout the night, the Senators took turns speaking in front of a large sign printed "Let Us Vote", speaking in favor of the amendment and against the Republicans for not allowing a simple majority vote. Republicans took turns decrying it, noting that Democrats did the same when they were the minority, and criticizing Democratic leaders.

<h2>How they voted</h2>
The following is a breakdown of how the Senators voted on the motion of cloture for the Levin/Reed Amendment (S.Amdt. 2087) grouped by state:

The driver of a propane gas tanker has died after his vehicle fell 70 feet onto a railway line in &lt;a href="w%3ACountry%20Durham"&gt;Country Durham&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The tanker left the road and smashed through a bridge near the small town of &lt;a href="w%3AWolsingham"&gt;Wolsingham&lt;/a&gt; and landed on the &lt;a href="w%3AWeardale%20Railway"&gt;Weardale Railway&lt;/a&gt; below with the driver being thrown from the cab.

The driver, who was in his twenties, had been airlifted to a hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle-upon-Tyne"&gt;Newcastle-upon-Tyne&lt;/a&gt; but later died from his injuries. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ACalor%20Gas"&gt;Calor Gas&lt;/a&gt; tanker was said to be carrying 13,000 litres of &lt;a href="w%3Aliquefied%20petroleum%20gas"&gt;liquefied petroleum gas&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the accident and nearby homes were evacuated. The fire crews who responded to the incident did not detect any gas leaking from the tanker.

Chris Hockaday, from &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Durham%20and%20Darlington%20Fire%20and%20Rescue%20Service"&gt;County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service&lt;/a&gt; described the problems they were facing, "There are a few options to consider - one is to see if we can decant the gas out into another vehicle. The problem is that it's gone off next to a bridge so it will be difficult to get any heavy lifting gear into position. We may have to right the vehicle and move it along the tracks somehow, maybe even using a train." 

The Weardale Railway operates over a five mile section of restored track between &lt;a href="w%3AStanhope%2C%20County%20Durham"&gt;Stanhope&lt;/a&gt; and Wolsingham. 

In a statement the railway company said, "There will be no further services on Weardale Railway until further notice and we apologise to our passengers for any inconvenience this may cause. We have appointed an incident manager and have alerted the Rail Accident Investigation Board and Her Majesty's Rail Inspectorate. We will not be able to assess the damage until the site of the accident has been declared safe by the fire brigade and the tanker removed from the track."

&lt;a href="w%3AC%C3%A9dric%20Vasseur"&gt;Cédric Vasseur&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 10 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;. Vasseur won a five man sprint to the finishline by the slimmest of margins.

"This morning I was on the phone to a friend and he told me, ‘Today is your day!’ And in all honesty I had the same confidence about this long stage. The victory had to be mine," said Vasseur after his victory.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; retains the overall lead, finishing the stage some 10 minutes later with the &lt;a href="w%3Apeleton"&gt;peleton&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, all of the top ten in the overall, finished with the same time, leaving the standings unchanged from yesterday.

"It was a long, hard day and all the guys are suffering in the heat, that’s quite obvious and 230 kilometers into a headwind takes its toll on everybody. My Rabobank team defended well today and we’ll have to wait and see how we go. There is another two days before we have the big test in the time trial on Saturday and then I’ll start thinking about the Pyrenees," said Michael Rasmussen.

He went on to say that he is now the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ARabobank%20%28cycling%29"&gt;Rabobank&lt;/a&gt; team: "There’s been a lot said about the situation regarding leadership between myself and Denis Menchov and I think it’s quite clear now that I’m the leader in the team now and I’m here to defend the yellow jersey for as long as possible."

&lt;a href="w%3APatrik%20Sinkewitz"&gt;Patrik Sinkewitz&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, who has already dropped out of the Tour after a crash, got more bad news when the A sample in a drug test on June 8, came back positve.

A pipe has burst in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, the largest city in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, causing a generator to explode. The explosion occurred in &lt;a href="w%3AMidtown%20Manhattan"&gt;Midtown Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Central%20Terminal"&gt;Grand Central Terminal&lt;/a&gt; (GCT) and the &lt;a href="w%3AChrysler%20Building"&gt;Chrysler Building&lt;/a&gt;, and approximately at the intersection of 41st Street and Lexington Avenue. Nearby buildings have been evacuated, and a large area has been blocked off. There are reports of a very large crater at the scene.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Police%20Department"&gt;New York Police Department&lt;/a&gt; (NYPD) has officially ruled out terrorism. Grand Central Station was quickly evacuated soon after the incident. Subway lines 4, 5 and 6 have no service in both directions between the 125th Street Station and the Bowling Green Station. 42nd Street Shuttle service has been shut completely. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Fire Department of New York&lt;/a&gt; (FDNY) received a call at 5:56 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;) reporting an explosion. More than 170 firefighters were dispatched to the scene. Witnesses reported that buildings in the nearby area shook. This was a five-alarm response.

At least 20 people have been reported injured, and one woman, Lois Baumerich, died from a &lt;a href="w%3AHeart%20attack"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. Two people are currently in critical condition. 

There are potentially harmful materials at the scene of the explosion and &lt;a href="w%3AHazardous%20material"&gt;HAZMAT&lt;/a&gt; crews are on the scene to clean up debris. There are reports that pipes were wrapped in asbestos, but the air is being tested, and results should be available late Wednesday night.

ConEdison Workers are on the scene as well, and it appears that they are working nearby.

Emergency workers are reporting that the situation is not under control. They are still unable to confirm why the pipe exploded due to the inaccessible nature of the scene at the source of the explosion. The pressure of steam has subsided and the air appears to have cleared, revealing the crater. Disruption of electricity in the surrounding area is minimal.

GCT is reported to be reopened at this time. An area was cordoned off and people trapped in the vicinity due to fears of &lt;a href="w%3Aasbestos"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt; pollution resulting from the explosion.

According to a press conference with &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;the mayor&lt;/a&gt;, the pipe involved was built in 1924, and a likely cause of the eruption and explosion was cold water leaking into the pipe, possibly from rain or from a water pipe. A tow truck had fallen into the crater left by the explosion, and the explosion also shattered glass on nearby buildings.

&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Falcons"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt; quarterback &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Vick"&gt;Michael Vick&lt;/a&gt; and three other men were indicted on Tuesday by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy related to a dog fighting operation. The charges included buying, breeding and training pit bull dogs, transporting the dogs across state lines to illegally participate in fights, and gambling on the fights.

The indictments stemmed from a search of Vick's &lt;a href="w%3ASmithfield%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Smithfield, Virginia&lt;/a&gt; home in April, in which 54 pit bulls were removed, along with equipment used in dog fighting.

The indictment said that Vick had bought the property in Smithfield for US$34,000 to run the dog fighting under the name "Bad Newz Kennels" with two other people named in the indictment. Purnell Peace, Quanis Phillips, and Tony Taylor were all named in the indictment along with Vick.

The indictment stated that Vick took part in the killing of eight dogs that didn't pass test fights, called "rolling". The pit bulls were allegedly killed by hanging, drowning and slamming at least one dog onto the ground. 

If convicted of both portions of the conspiracy charge, Vick could face six years in prison and a $350,000 fine. His property, located in &lt;a href="w%3ASurry%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Surry County&lt;/a&gt;, would be subject to forfeiture under U.S. laws dealing with illegal activities that are carried out at an interstate level. The indictment alleges that the dog fighting operation, involving American Pit Bull Terriers, spilled over into &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.

Vick has a court date on July 26 for a bond hearing and to hear the charges. Vick has said that he had a kennel operation on the property, but had no involvement or knowledge of a dog fighting ring.

Scientists from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; have concluded, in a genetic study performed on 6,000 skulls from ancient male humans from around the world, that the origin of mankind as we know it began in southeastern &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, which scientists refer to as "The Cradle of Man".

Skulls vary in size and shape as humans began to spread out from the African continent, and the scientists compared those characteristics to those of later humans along with their &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;. The oldest skull believed to have been tested was at least 40,000 years old.

"We have combined our genetic data with new measurements of a large sample of skulls to show definitively that modern humans originated from a single area in Sub-Saharan Africa," said Andrea Manica, one of the researchers at the Department of Zoology of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Cambridge"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge"&gt;Cambridge, England&lt;/a&gt;.

However, some scientists disagree with the study, calling it "mistaken".

"You can't find the origin of people by measuring the variability of their skulls. The main problem with the paper is that it takes some assumptions from genetics papers of 10 to 15 years ago that we now know are wrong. Africa is ecologically diverse, and cranial variation is a function of environments. The most important feature that is related to climate is skull size. So by correcting for climate, they are subtracting a major component of variability," said John Hawks, a researcher at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin-Madison"&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/a&gt;.

At least 17 Pakistani troops were killed Thursday when their convoy was bombed and attacked by &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; militants on the &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; border in North Waziristan, and the U.S. says that they may attack targets inside Pakistan, if they see them as being "actionable."

"We never take options off the table, and if we find actionable targets, we're going to hit them. [Terrorist hideouts are] something that's absolutely going to have to be addressed. There's no doubt that more aggressive steps need to be taken [against the terrorists]," said &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Snow"&gt;Tony Snow&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;'s Press Secretary, during a press conference today.

The U.S. believes that terrorists, who are loyal to al-Qaeda's leader &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin laden&lt;/a&gt; are currently seeking shelter in the regions near the borders of the two countries.

At least 35 civilians and 9 police officers were killed and nearly two dozen were injured in a separate bombing when a suicide car bomber blew up a &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; military convoy in Pakistan's southwest industrial district. None of the Chinese military personnel were injured or killed.

"The bomber driving a Mazda car blew himself up," said Tariq Khosa, the police chief of &lt;a href="w%3ABaluchistan%20province"&gt;Baluchistan province&lt;/a&gt; who also added that the area was "very crowded."

A gas tanker which crashed onto a preserved railway line in &lt;a href="w%3AWolsingham"&gt;Wolsingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Durham"&gt;County Durham&lt;/a&gt; in the north of &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; has been removed. Yesterday, the vehicle fell 70 feet from a road bridge onto the &lt;a href="w%3AWeardale%20Railway"&gt;Weardale Railway&lt;/a&gt; below and left the driver with serious injuries from which he later died in hospital.

The driver of the &lt;a href="w%3ACalor%20Gas"&gt;Calor Gas&lt;/a&gt; vehicle has been named as Peter Williams who was 25 and from the &lt;a href="w%3ADarlington"&gt;Darlington&lt;/a&gt; area.

The tanker was said to be carrying 13,000 litres of &lt;a href="w%3Aliquefied%20petroleum%20gas"&gt;liquefied petroleum gas&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the accident and nearby homes were evacuated due to fears the gas may leak from the vehicle. 

Chris Hockaday, from &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Durham%20and%20Darlington%20Fire%20and%20Rescue%20Service"&gt;County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service&lt;/a&gt;, described the operation to empty the tanker of gas and remove it from the scene: "The decanting finished at about 10pm and the tanker was then dragged along the track by a tractor, where it was lifted onto another vehicle by the specialist recovery company. It was then moved to a secure site for examination. The authorities left the scene at about midnight. Before decanting the gas, we had to right the vehicle, something which had to be done under great control in an operation which took about two hours."

The Weardale Railway, which operates over a five mile section of restored track between &lt;a href="w%3AStanhope%2C%20County%20Durham"&gt;Stanhope&lt;/a&gt; and Wolsingham, remains closed, but the company were optimistic about resuming services on the line.

Managing director of the Weardale Railway, Steve Raine, said "The tanker was moved late last night so we haven't yet been able to properly examine the track. However, the damage appears to be quite light, and we're hoping we can get that fixed today." He said that services were most likely to resume this Saturday.

&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Hunter%20%28cyclist%29"&gt;Robbie Hunter&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 11 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;. Hunter edged out &lt;a href="w%3AFabian%20Cancellara"&gt;Fabian Cancellara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMurilo%20Fischer"&gt;Murilo Fischer&lt;/a&gt; in a tight sprint.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; retained the overall lead finishing the stage with the first &lt;a href="w%3Apeleton"&gt;peleton&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest change in the chase for the &lt;a href="w%3AYellow%20jersey"&gt;yellow jersey&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="w%3AChristophe%20Moreau"&gt;Christophe Moreau&lt;/a&gt; losing more than three minutes on the leaders and dropping out of the top ten.

For a good portion of the stage, Wegmann, Florencio, Gilbert, Millar and Fofonov had the lead. The five-man breakaway group was gobbled up by the peleton. With 30 km to go the peleton split into two clearly defined main groups with about 1:40 separating them. The gap grew to two full minutes with 20 km to go. The second peleton finished 3:17 behind Hunter's time.

The 182.5 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; stage 11, from &lt;a href="w%3AMarseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AMontpellier"&gt;Montpellier&lt;/a&gt;, is the first of two transition stages between the Alps and the Pyrenees, with no major climbs.

In the wake of the doping test of &lt;a href="w%3APatrik%20Sinkewitz"&gt;Patrik Sinkewitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; networks &lt;a href="w%3AZDF"&gt;ZDF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AARD"&gt;ARD&lt;/a&gt; ended their live coverage of the Tour.

"With the agreement of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) a replacement solution has been found. We have leased the TV rights to Sat.1 and ProSieben," Yann Le Moenner of ASO told ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

Billing records uncovered by the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ show that &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; was paid for about 20 hours of work as a &lt;a href="w%3ALobbying%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Washington, DC lobbyist&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of a group to ease restrictive federal rules on abortion counseling in the 1990s. Recently Thompson "flatly denied" the charge and said he "did not recall doing any work for the organization."

The records show that Thompson worked part-time from 1991 to 1994 for the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, and earned about US$5,000 for work he did in 1991 and 1992.

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "a new Thompson spokeswoman, Burson Snyder, did not return calls for comment on the billing records Thursday."

The &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; web survey provider XiTiMonitor reports that in their study conducted from Monday, July 2 to Sunday, July 8, 2007 on 95,827 websites, web browser &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reached a 27.8% share in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, compared to 21.1% during the same period last year.

Firefox has its biggest market share in &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; where it amounts to 47.9% and 45.4%, respectively, while only 14.6% of people from the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and 15.2% of surfers in &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; used Firefox in this survey. The share rose most in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;: from 24.9% to 38.6% (♡❤i.e.♡❤ +13.7 points).

&lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s web browser &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; remains the most used browser in Europe with a market share of 66.5%. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpera%20%28Internet%20suite%29"&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASafari%20%28web%20browser%29"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have a 3.5% and 1.7% share respectively, with other browsers at less than 1%.

&lt;a href="Oceania"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt; remains the region with the highest usage of the &lt;a href="FLOSS"&gt;freely licensed and open source software&lt;/a&gt; browser Firefox, with 28.9%. The continent with the strongest relative increase in market share is &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, where there is a 30% increase compared to last March. Numbers from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;-based company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANet%20Applications"&gt;Net Applications Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last month showed a fall in Firefox's share from 15.42% in April to 14.54%.

Fresh off his three-day test for &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Toro%20Rosso"&gt;Scuderia Toro Rosso&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ACircuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps"&gt;Spa-Francorchamps&lt;/a&gt;, three-time &lt;a href="w%3AChamp%20Car"&gt;Champ Car World Series&lt;/a&gt; Champion &lt;a href="w%3ASebastien%20Bourdais"&gt;Sebastien Bourdais&lt;/a&gt; hops to return to championship form at this weekend’s Rexall Grand Prix of Edmonton.

Frenchman Bourdais, born and raised in &lt;a href="w%3ALe_Mans"&gt;Le Mans&lt;/a&gt;, home to one of motorsport’s Crown Jewels, &lt;a href="w%3A24_Hours_of_Le_Mans"&gt;The 24 Hours of Le Mans&lt;/a&gt;, has long aspired to driving in &lt;a href="w%3AFormula_One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt;, considered by many to be the pinnacle of racing, and his solid test results may have brought him one step closer to landing a seat with Toro Rosso for 2008.

Bourdais’ error-free test and respectable 8th fastest time earned team co-owner &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard_Berger"&gt;Gerhard Berger’s&lt;/a&gt; approval who noted "Bourdais has done everything right, which is exactly what we expected of him. He has exactly the right attitude for the job."

Scuderia Toro Rosso is part of the Red Bull stable, and is considered the ‘junior team’ to &lt;a href="w%3ARed_Bull"&gt;Red Bull Sports Drink&lt;/a&gt; billionaire owner &lt;a href="w%3ADietrich%20Mateschitz"&gt;Dietrich Mateschitz’&lt;/a&gt; primary &lt;a href="w%3ARed_Bull_Racing"&gt;Red Bull Racing&lt;/a&gt; F1 team. They recently picked up an option on Bourdais for 2008, an encouraging sign that the Frenchman may finally achieve his life-long goal of driving in F1. Toro Rosso is based on the former &lt;a href="w%3AMinardi"&gt;Minardi&lt;/a&gt; F1 team, a perennial back-marker but fan favorite. Minardi ex-owner &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Stoddard"&gt;Paul Stoddard&lt;/a&gt; now commandeers the new &lt;a href="w%3AMinardi_Team_USA"&gt;Team Minardi USA&lt;/a&gt; in Champ Car.

Back in North America, Bourdais readies himself for the Rexall Grand Prix of Edmonton, in the unusual position of being third in points standings. Three DNF’s, stronger competition, and the parity that the new &lt;a href="w%3APanoz_DP01"&gt;Panoz DP01&lt;/a&gt; has brought to the series after the years of development that Bourdais’ team, &lt;a href="w%3ANewman/Haas/Lanigan_Racing"&gt;Newman/Haas/Lanigan&lt;/a&gt; lavished on the previous &lt;a href="w%3ALola_Racing_Cars"&gt;Lola&lt;/a&gt; chassis had given them an on-track advantage, has resulted in Bourdais scrambling to claim his fourth consecutive title and the accompanying &lt;a href="w%3AVanderbilt%20Cup"&gt;Vanderbilt Cup&lt;/a&gt;, before presumably heading off to F1.

Current senator and Argentine First Lady &lt;a href="w%3ACristina%20Fernandez%20de%20Kirchner"&gt;Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner&lt;/a&gt; announced her presidential candidacy yesterday evening in &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Plata"&gt;La Plata&lt;/a&gt;, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) away from Buenos Aires.

Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the ♡❤Argentine Theatre♡❤, the same location she used to start her 2005 campaign for the Senate as member of the &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires%20province"&gt;Buenos Aires province&lt;/a&gt; delegation.

A large security detail was in place at the theatre and eight city blocks were closed to traffic for the event. Outgoing Argentine president &lt;a href="w%3AN%C3%A9stor%20Kirchner"&gt;Néstor Kirchner&lt;/a&gt;, members of his office, and provincial governors were present at the ceremony. Julio Cobos, governor of &lt;a href="w%3AMendoza%20province"&gt;Mendoza&lt;/a&gt; and possible campaign team member, was also there.

Activists from &lt;a href="w%3AQuebracho%20%28group%29"&gt;Quebracho&lt;/a&gt; mobilized in La Plata to protest the candidacy of the First Lady, and created some disturbances near the event. None of the protesters was arrested, according to an official spokesman of La Plata Police Station.

Recent polls indicate that Mrs. Kirchner has at least 40 percent voter support, which bodes well for winning on the first ballot in the upcoming October elections.

According to Argentine newspaper &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Naci%C3%B3n"&gt;♡❤La Nación♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, this speech signifies that the government is attempting to show solidarity in the midst of recent scandals: &lt;a href="w%3AFelisa%20Miceli"&gt;Felisa Miceli&lt;/a&gt;'s resignation to the Department of Economy after being accused of wrongdoing by a justice over the nearly $100,000 Argentine pesos and US$31,670 found in her office, and the alleged smuggling of weapons and irregularities in the office of the Secretary of Environment.

A representative of &lt;a href="w%3AChile%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20FIFA%20U-20%20World%20Cup"&gt;Under 20&lt;/a&gt; team was subdued by taser after their match against &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. The problem started as the Chile delegation entered the team bus.

Nathan Denette, a &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Press"&gt;CP&lt;/a&gt; photographer, was quoted, "All of a sudden we looked over and there was a big brawl that breaks out, between four or five people. Next thing you know, the bus just unloads and there's eight, 10 players come off the bus and there's just fists flying everywhere, between the cops, the security guards, a couple of ladies were involved that were security. It looked like a big dogfight. People throwing fists and cops with their billyclubs out and then all of a sudden it got out of control and a police officer grabbed his taser gun and tasered someone - I don't know if he was a player or if he was part of the team - as soon as that happened, it got even worse. We heard this big bang...it was just commotion after commotion after commotion. Some of the players were trying to get players back on the bus. But some were furious they were trying to get back off the bus. And then they opened up the windows on the bus and were throwing things at the officers. And then all of sudden, they were trying to grab them from the inside of the bus. And it just escalated."

Police handcuffed some of the Chilean players. Many players were bleeding and screaming as they were escorted back to the dressing room.

FIFA officials were at the game. However, &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; police took control of the situation.

This came after a very bad tempered 3-0 loss to continental rival Argentina where the referee and his assistants had to run to the tunnel after the game.

&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; - Joshua Brady, a former &lt;a href="w%3ASprint%20Nextel"&gt;Sprint Nextel&lt;/a&gt; customer, has had his cellular phone account shut off, but not because he wasn't paying the phone bill, or even because he was late on payments, but because a customer service representative who assisted him, began to call him outside of her job, and make death threats to him in September of 2006. She was never fired for her actions, Brady says.

Brady has agreed to be interviewed by &lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; to tell his story. All information and claims have been logged with Brady's attorney and federal authorities.

The representative from Sprint Nextel, who for safety reasons is only being identified as Jessica, was working at the company's call center in &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%2C%20Canada"&gt;Ontario, Canada&lt;/a&gt; where Brady's call to customer service was directed. According to Brady, Jessica then began to call him outside of her job duties at the call center after their first contact. 

Brady called the center around 6:00 p.m. (eastern time) on a Saturday and attempted to receive help on a billing question and to find a way to stop prank calls. Brady requested a "soc code", a code placed into the phone, that would allow for the number that was pranking him to be blocked. Unfortunately, Jessica did not know what that was, but tried unsuccessfully to find it. According to Brady, the only thing she could find was "the ANI feature call centers have."

Brady then described to Jessica the billing issue he was having. He was being charged "for text messages I was not making", even though he had unlimited text messaging with his billing plan. Meanwhile, Jessica called for a supervisor to help locate the code. As this customer service request over the phone was taking quite a bit of time, the two of them then started to discuss what two people would normally discuss if just chatting; sports, the weather, movies and music and if &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; was a nice place to go on vacation. The supervisor then came by Jessica's station with no luck on finding a code.

Later that night, around 10:30 p.m., Brady received a call. He answered it and much to his surprise, it was Jessica. He answered the phone with the usual "hello" and the voice on the other end answered with "hello Josh." Brady was "surprised" that she had not said "hello Mr. Brady."

"I then asked who it was, and she said Jessica. She told me about her day, and hoped that I did not mind her calling." Then according to Brady, she started to describe how much she hated working in a call center, and how the job "pays the bills", and asked if she could "come visit me sometime". Brady said that he "immediately started to record" the call. Brady also stated that Jessica was not aware she was being recorded, and that further conversations were recorded without her knowing.

The call lasted about 15 minutes, but Brady said she "spoke so fast and moved along through things" that he "didn't have a chance to talk if I wanted to. It [the call] ended with me interrupting her and telling her I had to go to dinner with a friend."

Brady immediately called customer care back and reported Jessica's actions to a supervisor (Jason), and the Floor Manager (Also named Jessica) at the Coos Bay call center, which is where his call happened to be directed. The advice he received was to "play along" and continue to report her actions until they could locate someone "better equipped" to handle the situation.

Jessica then began to call "about every other day or so" which turned out to be almost 30 calls, according to Brady who reported each call she made to Sprint Nextel.

Sprint Nextel then told Jessica to cease and desist all contact with Brady, but that didn't stop Jessica from contacting him. She somehow found out the screen-name of his AOL Instant Messenger account, and left messages threatening to kill him. Brady logged the messages and faxed them to Sprint, who about a week later sent Brady a letter, saying that his accounts have been terminated.

♡❤"The purpose of this letter is to inform our that our office has received a complaint regarding your recent questionable interactions with our customer care group. Recent interactions with our company have prompted us to formally contact you. Sprint Nextel terms and conditions state that "termination of services. consistent with this agreement..."♡❤, said the letter from Sprint Nextel.

Brady states that Jessica is still employed with Sprint Nextel, despite the fact that all instant messages left by Jessica were forwarded to Sprint Nextel.

As recently as July 10, 2007, as many as 1,000 accounts were terminated by Sprint Nextel because customers were complaining too much and asking too many questions about billing.

♡❤"While we have worked to resolve your issues and questions to the best of our ability, the number of inquiries you have made to us during this time had led us to determine that we are unable to meet your current wireless needs,"♡❤ said one letter to a sprint customer as recent as June 29, 2007. The letter states that the service will be terminated just one day after the letter was written despite saying they "understand switching to a new carrier causes an inconvenience."

Two weeks ago, Sprint addressed the media about the mass-cancellations. "These accounts have been researched very carefully," Sprint spokeswoman Roni Singleton said. "We feel strongly that the decisions we made, we stand by them. These decisions weren't made lightly."

"If the average person is calling less than once per month and these people are calling 40 or 50 times more, that takes away from customer service," Singleton said. "Our priority is to improve the customer experience."

Wikinews sent e-mails to Sprint Nextel on July 20 regarding the Brady incident; to date no response has been received.

♡❤♡Update:♡❤♡ On July 23, 2007, Wikinews received an email response from a Sprint representative, going to some length to explain the termination of the customers who were calling up to hundreds of times a month. No information was given on the Brady case covered in this article; "customer privacy considerations" were cited as the reason and "no comment" was Sprint's reply.

A body was found in the nose gear of a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20747"&gt;747 jet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai, China&lt;/a&gt;, which arrived in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; at 7:42 a.m. (&lt;a href="w%3APST"&gt;PST&lt;/a&gt;).

According to &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Mateo%20County%2C%20California"&gt;San Mateo County&lt;/a&gt; Coroner &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Foucrault"&gt;Robert Foucrault&lt;/a&gt;, the man appeared to be Chinese and in his 50s, and had sustained several injuries prior to his death. Foucrault says that the man could have died from lack of oxygen, &lt;a href="w%3Ahypothermia"&gt;hypothermia&lt;/a&gt;, or being crushed by the landing gear.

The man, currently unidentified, entered the plane's wheel well, and attempted to stowaway, making him the 65th similar stowaway attempt, and the 59th death resulting from the attempts, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt;.

Following the rise to power of Poland's &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aright-wing"&gt;right-wing&lt;/a&gt; government, including some openly homophobic members, Polish gay rights groups claim that thousands of Polish gays have emigrated to &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; to escape increasing &lt;a href="w%3Apersecution"&gt;persecution&lt;/a&gt; including the Health Ministry's "special committee responsible for 'curing' gays".

The Deputy Health Minister, Marek Grafowski, stated the ministry was developing guides "to assist parents and teachers so that they can recognise any warning signs of potential 'gay behaviour'." 

♡❤Guardian unlimited♡❤ reports that the Polish police have also begun compiling a database on gays in Poland. Although illegal under European Union law, this is allegedly being done under the auspices of an investigation into the gay community following a bomb threat two years ago by a gay man, who was reportedly angry when a gay rights march was banned in Warsaw.

"The police are not allowed to catalogue 'homosexual data', but it's enough to look into the police investigation associated with the bomb in order to establish a list of names and addresses," said Ewa Kulesza, a former personal data protection general inspector.

Homophobia appears to be a problem beyond the government as well. One person said his doctor had referred him to a vet when he went for a check-up. "He told me there was a specialist for people like me and gave me an address. When I got there it was a vet. I called him and he said, &amp;lsquo;♡❤What did you expect? You are an animal♡❤&amp;rsquo;.

A gay club, Le Madame, was recently shut down by Warsaw local authorities who hired private security guards to break down the doors.

&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Biedro%C5%84"&gt;Robert Biedroń&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the Polish &lt;a href="w%3ACampaign%20Against%20Homophobia"&gt;Campaign Against Homophobia&lt;/a&gt; society, believes that most of the Polish gays emigrate to the UK not for economic reasons but because of persecution in Poland. "Most of the people I know are now in England because of the current political situation. Not for economic reasons, but because of the persecution of homosexuals going on here. It's impossible for gays to be themselves in Poland", says Biedroń.

According the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;European Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; (ECJ), the supreme court of &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, the EU laws do not oblige ISPs to hand over personal data of people suspected of illegal sharing of copyrighted materials over the net.

The ECJ has been asked for a preliminary ruling on question "♡❤Does Community law...permit Member States to limit the duty of operators of electronic communications networks and services, providers of telecommunications network access and providers of data storage services to retain and make available connection and traffic information generated during the supply of an information society service to where it is required in connection with a criminal investigation or the need to protect public safety and national defence, thus excluding civil proceedings?♡❤" And its opinion, presented by advocate general Juliane Kokott, is that member states are allowed to 'exclude' revealing personal data on internet traffic in civil cases. This does not apply to criminal cases, where such compliance would be required.

Heavy rain and thunderstorms have hit several areas of the UK today, causing flash floods and disrupting some transport links. The UK &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMet%20Office"&gt;Met Office&lt;/a&gt; have issued severe weather warnings.

In London, parts of Victoria Station were inches deep in water, with rain pouring in through leaks in the roof. Many shops were forced to close, and many trains were cancelled or delayed. On the London Underground network, the Circle and District lines were suspended due to flooding, with several other lines experiencing major delays, and at least nine stations having to close. 

Many of the worst-hit areas have seen schools closed, and driving conditions have been deteriorating, with police advising extra caution whilst travelling on roads affected by standing water.

The flash flooding follows a month of unusually wet weather, in which several areas have had to evacuate people to temporary shelters set up in schools and community centres.

The 13 member larger bench of the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; reinstated Justice &lt;a href="w%3AIftikhar%20Muhammad%20Chaudhry"&gt;Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Justices%20of%20Pakistan"&gt;Chief Justice&lt;/a&gt; of Pakistan on Friday through a short order. The verdict was reached 10 to 3 in favor of Justice Chaudhry. 

Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry through a panel of senior lawyers headed by Barrister &lt;a href="w%3AAitzaz%20Ahsan"&gt;Aitezaz Ahsan&lt;/a&gt; filed a constitutional petition challenging his suspension as Chief Justice of Pakistan by President General &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; on March 9 this year. Musharraf has indicated that he will accept the court's decision.

The Pakistani lawyer community hailed the decision of the court. The Peshsawar High Court Bar Association organized even organized a procession as a mark of celebrations.

Chaudhry, an opponent of Musharraf, had been accused of abuse of power but the charges were quashed by the court's decision, seen as a blow to Musharraf's government.

<h1>Suspect in Colorado anti-evolution death threats case is missing</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Earth%20Creationist"&gt;Young Earth Creationist&lt;/a&gt; Menachem "Michael" Korn, suspected of sending death threats to various biology faculty and others at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder"&gt;University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;/a&gt;, is apparently missing or &lt;a href="w%3AOn%20the%20lam"&gt;on the lam&lt;/a&gt;. Although the police said they will not name the individual in question until the person is arrested, previous reports and comments by faculty and staff at the university made it clear that Korn is the man in question. 

Action was taken recently after the threatening behavior escalated and the letters passed beyond being a nuisance. It had gotten to the point where one graduate student and one faculty member were scared about entering the department out of concern for their safety. Korn, a former &lt;a href="w%3AMessianic%20Jew"&gt;Messianic Jew&lt;/a&gt; who now self-identifies as &lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly sent various anti-evolution letters to faculty at the university.
Pictures of Korn have now been distributed to faculty with instructions to call police if Korn is spotted. Before going missing, Korn had refused to respond in detail to media requests for his side of the story, but he had sent emails to the Denver Post and has sent copies of those emails to other media sources, such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWired"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Korn later contacted ♡❤Wired♡❤ by telephone where he claimed to be unavailable since he was "traveling" and refused to discuss the letters in detail but spent most of the discussion focusing on claimed flaws in evolution. 

A university spokesperson has speculated that one reason police have been reluctant to formally name Korn is that the threats may have not crossed the line of what legally constitute death threats. For example, Korn said that "He &lt;nowiki&gt;[pastor Jerry Gibson]&lt;/nowiki&gt; said that every true Christian should be ready and willing to take up arms to kill the enemies of Christian society. But I believe it is far more effective to take up a pen to kill the enemies of Truth." Jeffry Mitton, a professor at the University, has filed for a restraining order against Korn. 

Although the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has had vigorous debate over the &lt;a href="w%3ACreation-evolution%20controversy"&gt;Creation-evolution controversy&lt;/a&gt;, and anti-evolutionists have engaged in threats and physical violence in some heavily &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; countries such as &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, to date there have been no serious violent incidents in the United States. One possible exception is the unconfirmed attack on &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Mirecki"&gt;Paul Mirecki&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Kansas"&gt;University of Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, in 2005. However, this may have been in response to other comments made by Mirecki that were about the more general &lt;a href="w%3Aculture%20war"&gt;culture wars&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AReligious%20right"&gt;Religious right&lt;/a&gt; in the United States and not about evolution in particular.

&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Boonen"&gt;Tom Boonen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 12 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;. Boonen edged out &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Zabel"&gt;Erik Zabel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Hunter%20%28cyclist%29"&gt;Robbie Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, the winner of yesterday's stage, in a tight sprint.

Boonen continues to wear the &lt;a href="w%3AMaillot%20vert"&gt;green jersey&lt;/a&gt;, which has been his since stage 6. The green jersey is award for the points classification, which is often considered the &lt;a href="w%3ACycling%20sprinter"&gt;sprinters&lt;/a&gt; competition.

Boonen was among the favorites in this category in both 2005 and 2006, but ended up withdrawing during the Tour. Zabel has won the points classification six times, all in a row (1996 through 2001). Last year's winner was &lt;a href="w%3ARobbie%20McEwen"&gt;Robbie McEwen&lt;/a&gt;, but he retired after stage 8 with a knee injury.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; retains the overall lead, finishing the stage with the &lt;a href="w%3Apeleton"&gt;peleton&lt;/a&gt;. Saturday's stage is a time-trial, which is considered a weakness for Rasmussen as he defends his 2'35" lead.

&lt;a href="w%3APierrick%20Pierrick%20F%C3%A9drigo"&gt;Pierrick Pierrick Fédrigo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmets%20Txurruka"&gt;Amets Txurruka&lt;/a&gt; had a two-man break-away. They led by as much as 11 minutes with 85 km to go. But as so often happens, the peleton caught up with them just before the finish, and neither of them could hang on for a top ten finish.

The 178.5 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; stage 12, from &lt;a href="w%3AMontpellier"&gt;Montpellier&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ACastres"&gt;Castres&lt;/a&gt;, is the second of two transition stages between the Alps and the Pyrenees, with just one category 2 climb.

The top ten standings in the overall, remain unchanged as they all finished with the peleton.

The 48th &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Mathematical%20Olympiad"&gt;International Mathematical Olympiad&lt;/a&gt; (IMO) is taking place from July 19 to July 31 in &lt;a href="w%3AHanoi"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, the first South-east Asian country to host the annual mathematics competition for high school students since it began in 1959.

This year the actual competition will take place July 25-26, with jury meetings before those dates and excursions and a closing ceremony in the days following. The Olympiad challenges mathematically gifted youngsters with a series of problems submitted by IMO member states, and awards individual prizes.

More than 90 countries are members of the IMO, which is held in a different country each year. Other Asian countries that have hosted the Olympiad in the past include &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; (2003), &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; (2000), &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; (1998), and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; (1990). &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; will host the 2008 IMO.

The website of the 2007 contest displays an animated solution to the &lt;a href="w%3ATower%20of%20Hanoi"&gt;Tower of Hanoi&lt;/a&gt; puzzle, which involves moving disks stacked on pegs without placing a bigger disk on top of a smaller one.

Police in &lt;a href="w%3AJersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Jersey City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; say that they have found a 20 year old rocket launcher tube, capable of shooting down planes, on the front yard of a home that is reported to be directly in the path of &lt;a href="w%3ANewark%20Liberty%20International%20Airport"&gt;Newark Liberty International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Police say that the weapon was not in operating condition.

"I was shocked. I read it and it and [there was the word missile] on it. There was little 'missile' writing on it. I was afraid because of what people want to do to this country," said Niranjana Besai who was born in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and has lived in the U.S. for 25 years who discovered the weapon at about 8:00 a.m &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;) when she was leaving the house to go to work.

According to ♡❤Modern Firearms♡❤, the weapon can only be used once, saying it "is a disposable, single shot, recoilless weapon" and can hit a target with a range of "up to 150 meters [to use] against moving targets, and about 300 meters against stationary targets."

The &lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20Firearms%20and%20Explosives"&gt;Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives&lt;/a&gt; confirms that the weapon is of military issue and has been identified as a model &lt;a href="w%3AAT4"&gt;AT-4&lt;/a&gt;, primarily used as an anti-tank weapon. It is manufactured by &lt;a href="w%3ASaab%20Bofors%20Dynamics"&gt;Saab Bofors Dynamics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. No explosive devices have been located at the scene. The ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ says that the weapon was made to be used during training missions and anti-tank artillery. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Monmouth"&gt;Fort Monmouth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOceanport%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Oceanport, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; is now in possession of the weapon.

"The device has been turned over to United States Army officials at Fort Monmouth," said Jersey City police in a statement to the press which also confirmed the weapon was a U.S. military issued launcher and was "no longer operable and not considered to be a hazard to public safety."

It is not known how the weapon ended up in Besai's yard. The Joint Terrorism Task Force and &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; have confiscated the weapon, before turning it over to the army, and they are investigating the incident.

On Friday, a group of hikers and 18 boy scouts were airlifted by helicopters away from a wildfire in Nephi Canyon, &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;. The hikers and scouts escaped into a rough rocky area to keep a safe distance from the dangerous wildfire after it advanced on their campground.

The wildfire started in a campground in Salt Creek Canyon, 85 miles from &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;, and has burned 13,000 acres across 20 square miles as of Friday. The fire has burned a campground and motel, and forced the evacuation of all campgrounds and cabins in its path.

The final &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; book in the series, ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Deathly%20Hallows"&gt;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, has gone on sale today. The book was launched simultaneously across the world.

The book launched first in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, where the book went on sale from midnight. Fans in one central London bookshop started joining the queue from 10:30 p.m., which soon reached the door of the shop and out onto the street. The book chain Waterstone's held 'Harry Potter parties', giving out free glasses of wine and snacks. The mood was good-natured and jolly, with some fans dressed up in costume.

&lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; fans of the series had a launch time of 11.01 a.m. (NZST). Due to high competition among major retail chains, the book was being sold for as little as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20dollar"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 32.99 at Whitcoulls; a profit margin of four cents with each book sold. The recommended retail price was NZ$55.00. Many supermarkets in the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; cut prices even further as a publicity stunt with, for example, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AASDA"&gt;ASDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; selling copies at a loss, at about 1/4 of the recommended retail price.

It was also an early release for Australian fans of the series, at 9.01 a.m. (Sydney). A Sydney Borders store had a line reaching out halfway across the street. In Brisbane City, Borders had a line from the shop, down the street and around the corner.

150 fans in New Zealand's capital, Wellington, were waiting outside a Border's bookstore at 8.00 a.m. to be some of the first to get their hands on a copy. A bookstore nearby, Dymocks, also had a large crowd, an estimated 100 people were waiting. One person arriving there at 6.30 a.m. At one New Zealand Whitcoulls store, they had a entertainer/magician keeping fans entertained while waiting for 11.01 a.m. In Germany, however, some bookshops were disappointed with the turnout for the Harry Potter book launch events.

The Harry Potter series has already sold 325 million copies worldwide. 1.3 million of those were sold in New Zealand, a quarter of New Zealand's population. The Wikipedia article on the latest book became disabled for editing by unregistered and newly registered users within 5 minutes of the book's release.

On Thursday afternoon, 21-year-old actress &lt;a href="w%3ALindsay%20Lohan"&gt;Lindsay Lohan&lt;/a&gt; turned herself in to the &lt;a href="w%3ABeverly%20Hills%2C%20California"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt; Police Department to face charges of misdemeanor hit-and-run and the suspicion of driving under the influence. Accompanied by her lawyer, Lohan was fingerprinted and photographed by police.

On May 26 of this year, Lohan had crashed her car into a curb and hedge on &lt;a href="w%3ASunset%20Boulevard"&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and received minor injuries. She was then driven to a &lt;a href="w%3ACentury%20City%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Century City&lt;/a&gt; hospital in a friend's car. The Beverly Hills Police tracked her down at the hospital where they checked her blood-alcohol level, which was found to be above California's 0.08 percent legal limit, although the police would not disclose what level Lohan's blood-alcohol was.

After the crash, Lohan checked herself into a rehabilitation center for a 45-day stay, which was her second round of rehabilitation this year.

A court date has been scheduled for August 24, 2007.

<h1>Vietnamese police blamed for deaths of over 100 political protesters</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Vietnamese%20police%20blamed%20for%20deaths%20of%20over%20100%20political%20protesters&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An eyewitness report coming out of The Socialist Republic of &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; claims that police in &lt;a href="w%3AHo%20Chi%20Minh%20City"&gt;Ho Chi Minh City&lt;/a&gt; have detained about 200 political protesters and are being blamed for the deaths of over 100. Farmers were protesting against the government's seizure of land and for "free expression."

The protesters peacefully demonstrated outside of a government office on Wednesday, June 27 for the Vietnamese government to return property it has seized and occupied since late 1975, when the South Vietnamese government capitulated. Vietnamese living in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; are holding memorial services on Sunday, July 22 in a number of cemeteries and memorials that focus on the &lt;a href="w%3AVietam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;.

"The crackdown on this demonstration shows Hanoi continues to curtail people's rights. If Vietnam really has joined the community of nations, it should tolerate dissent, not crush it," said deputy Asia director at &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;, Sophie Richardson.

Thus far, the Vietnamese government has denied all allegations, stating that they did not detain any of the protesters, that no one was harmed, and that the protesters returned to their homes peacefully and of their own will. However, several Vietnamese in the country have been unable to contact family members who were part of the demonstration.

A Wikinewsie personally witnessed the police roundup of the demonstrators while on the way to a shop near the airport. He claims police began using nets to capture and drag the protesters away, before throwing them in the back of a Vietnamese military vehicle.

&lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt; won the pole on the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Formula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20European%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;European Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AN%C3%BCrburgring"&gt;Nürburgring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AN%C3%BCrburg"&gt;Nürburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.

Kimi's rival &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; split the two Ferraris and will start between Kimi and &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; suffered a serious crash in the third qualifying session after his tire broke in &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Schumacher&lt;/a&gt;'s S-curve and he found himself out of the track running at a tangent to the safety wall. Race officials confirmed that Lewis had been "conscious and speaking". Still, there are reasonable doubts about his fitness for the race Sunday. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt; team drivers 4th and 5th, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Webber"&gt;Mark Webber&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt;-Renault 6th, &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ARenault%20F1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; 7th and &lt;a href="w%3AToyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;'s 8th and 9th.

Before this incident Lewis was fifth, but dropped two the tenth place and will probably lose more with the car change if he'll participate in the race. It seemes that his incretible series of 9 consecutive pole finishes have come to an end.

The race will feature &lt;a href="w%3AMarcus%20Winkelhock"&gt;Marcus Winkelhock&lt;/a&gt;, the German driver replacing &lt;a href="w%3AChristijan%20Albers"&gt;Christijan Albers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASpyker%20F1"&gt;Spyker&lt;/a&gt;.

In &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, more than 2,000 people participated in the "Ten Thousand People for BIKE" bicycle parade challenge, organized by Volvic Taiwan and Body Marketing Co., Ltd. to break the previous "Largest Parade of Bicycles" record, which was set at 641 bicycles during a 2006 record attempt in &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.

VIPs invited by the organizers included the current &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Chinese Nationalist Party&lt;/a&gt; legislator &lt;a href="w%3AHuang%20Chih-Hsiung"&gt;Chih-hsiung Huang&lt;/a&gt;, the Director of the Department of Public Sports of Sports Affairs Council, Executive Yuan (R.O.C., Taiwan) Tai-lin Peng, and &lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20World%20Records"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt; referee Stuart Claxton. They witnessed the new record, and Deputy Commissioner of Sports Affairs Council, Executive Yuan (R.O.C., Taiwan) Hwang-lang Tsai led out for the starting of this event.

The record-breaking parade crossed five riverside parks (Dajia Section, Yingfeng Section, Guanshan Section, Rainbow Section, and Meiti Section) over an estimated 13.7 kilometres (3.2 km to set the new record, and 10.5 km for free riding).

The previous record was broken when the 642nd rider passed the recording gate near 8:47 a.m.. A 36-year-old engineer from Taoyuan County named Fang-tien Lin was the 642nd lucky rider. In the end, this event created a new record with 1901 riders riding in a great bicycle parade within 1 hour and 8 minutes.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pratibha%20Patil%20becomes%20the%20first%20woman%20president%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20India&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3APratibha%20Patil"&gt;Pratibha Patil&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20presidential%20election%2C%202007"&gt;12th Presidential Elections&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="India"&gt;Republic of India&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first woman &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20India"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; of the second most populous country in the world.

Patil, 72, previously governor of the state of &lt;a href="w%3ARajasthan"&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt;, had support from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Progressive%20Alliance"&gt;governing coalition&lt;/a&gt;. She won approximately two thirds of the vote, almost double the number of votes of her nearest rival &lt;a href="w%3ABhairon%20Singh%20Shekhawat"&gt;Bhairon Singh Shekhawat&lt;/a&gt;, who resigned as &lt;a href="w%3AVice-President%20of%20India"&gt;Vice-President&lt;/a&gt; after losing the poll.

Patil was a last-minute candidate who appeared when the coalition that leads the congress and the communist allies could not choose a common candidate. The supporters of Patil hope that her election could bring to the spotlight, problems that affect women in India, such as the high murder rate or domestic violence and abuse.

More than 4,500 members of the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20India"&gt;Parliament of India&lt;/a&gt; and state &lt;a href="w%3AVidhan%20Sabha"&gt;Legislative Assemblies&lt;/a&gt; were eligible to vote for the largely ceremonial office.

Patil was recently the centre of controversy after allegations that a bank gave out cheap loans to her relatives, and for her controversial statements about the Muslim veil.

The President-elect will succeed the 11th President of India, &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Kalam"&gt;Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam&lt;/a&gt;, an engineer and scientist. She is expected to be sworn in on July 25 in the Central Hall of Parliament.

The President of India, also called Rashtrapati, is the &lt;a href="w%3Ahead%20of%20state"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; and first citizen of India and the &lt;a href="w%3ACommander-in-Chief"&gt;Supreme Commander&lt;/a&gt; of the Indian . The President's role is largely ceremonial. The powers of the President of India are comparable to those of the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20monarchy"&gt;monarch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The real executive authority in India is vested in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Cabinet%20Ministers"&gt;Council of Ministers&lt;/a&gt;, headed by the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20India"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;. In 1966, &lt;a href="w%3AIndira%20Gandhi"&gt;Indira Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; became the first and to date the only female prime minister of India.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Vinokourov"&gt;Alexander Vinokourov&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 13 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;. Vinokourov finished the 54 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; individual time trial, centered around &lt;a href="w%3AAlbi"&gt;Albi&lt;/a&gt;, in a time of 1h 12' 06".

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; held on to his overall lead, finishing 11th in the stage. &lt;a href="w%3AAlejandro%20Valverde"&gt;Alejandro Valverde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIban%20Mayo"&gt;Iban Mayo&lt;/a&gt; both lost ground in the overall. &lt;a href="w%3ACadel%20Evans"&gt;Cadel Evans&lt;/a&gt; gained ground on Rasmussen and is now just one minute behind.

This stage provided the first shake-up in the standings in days. Valverde and Mayo, who were previously second and third, have dropped out of the top ten. Pre-Tour favorite, Vinokourov, was able to use his stage victory to return to the top ten for the first time since stage 2.

Rasmussen did better than some expected. Afterwards he said: "I thought I had a fair chance, but from thinking to doing that can be a long way. I was a bit in trouble in the first 15 km, but in the last 30 km I did very well."

Just yesterday, Rasmussen was suspended by the &lt;a href="w%3ADanish%20Cycling%20Federation"&gt;Danish Cycling Federation&lt;/a&gt; because of a warning from anti-doping authorities within the &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20Cycliste%20Internationale"&gt;Union Cycliste Internationale&lt;/a&gt;. There has not been a positive test, but the warning was issued for not keeping UCI informed of his whereabouts.

"I do admit I committed an administrative error," said Rasmussen. "I have already received a warning from the UCI but I am very calm and very relaxed." He continued, "I know a lot of riders who have received warnings for not giving updated information to the UCI. I'm just one out of many and it's just that I happen to have the yellow jersey."

Tomorrow's stage will take the race into the &lt;a href="w%3APyrenees"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt;. This stage starts with a category 2 climb out of &lt;a href="w%3AMazamet"&gt;Mazamet&lt;/a&gt; and then follows a relatively calm route via &lt;a href="w%3ACarcassonne"&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALimoux"&gt;Limoux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AQuillan"&gt;Quillan&lt;/a&gt; before taking on the Port de Pailhères (17 km at 7.2%) and a very difficult finish at &lt;a href="w%3APlateau-de-Beille"&gt;Plateau-de-Beille&lt;/a&gt; (16 km at 7.9%).

Bayern Munich beat Werder Bremen in Düsseldorf to advance to the League Cup Semi Finals against Stuttgart.

After an early Werder goal from Tim Borowski, the Bavarian club left their mark in the 2 part of the 1 half with 3 goals from Schweinsteiger, Altıntop and Ribéry. Ribéry converted a penalty for his 2 goal of the game. At this point, the pace of the game settled down and &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Ottl"&gt;Andreas Ottl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASandro%20Wagner"&gt;Sandro Wagner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Lell"&gt;Christian Lell&lt;/a&gt; came on as substitutes.

With 3 Bayern strikers absent due to injury, Head Coach &lt;a href="w%3AOttmar%20Hitzfeld"&gt;Ottmar Hitzfeld&lt;/a&gt; decided to go with 5 midfielders. The formation was 4-3-2-1 'Christmas Tree' shape with Bastian Schweinsteiger and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20van%20Bommel"&gt;Mark van Bommel&lt;/a&gt; behind Striker &lt;a href="w%3AMiroslav%20Klose"&gt;Miroslav Klose&lt;/a&gt;.

Two strong &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; shook the north of &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and a remote region of &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon%20Rainforest"&gt;the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) reported that the first earthquake took place at 9:27 (-3 UTC) 165 kilometers from the city of &lt;a href="w%3ACruzeiro%20do%20Sul"&gt;Cruzeiro do Sul&lt;/a&gt;, in the Amazonian state of &lt;a href="w%3AAcre"&gt;Acre&lt;/a&gt; and measured 6.1 degrees on the Richter scale.

According to Elio Murilo, sergeant of the fire brigade of Cruzeiro do Sul, the phenomenon was not felt and no injuries or property damages were reported. The telluric movement took place at a depth of 632.9 kilometers.

At 12:34 (-3 UTC) another earthquake with an intensity of 6.2 degrees in Richter scale shook the north of Argentina, and the phenomenon was also felt in some &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivian&lt;/a&gt; cities. According to the USGS, the epicentre was the &lt;a href="w%3AJujuy%20province"&gt;Jujuy region&lt;/a&gt; 140 kilometres east of Tarija (Bolivia) at a depth of 247 kilometers.

The authorities have not reported any injuries or property damage.

<h1>Emaar Properties claims Burj Dubai as world's tallest building</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Emaar%20Properties%20claims%20Burj%20Dubai%20as%20world%27s%20tallest%20building&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; (UAE) developer &lt;a href="w%3AEmaar%20Properties"&gt;Emaar Properties&lt;/a&gt; has claimed that their &lt;a href="w%3ABurj%20Dubai"&gt;Burj Dubai&lt;/a&gt; commercial and residential tower, currently under construction, has become the world's tallest building, reaching a height of 512.1 metres (or 1,680 feet) and 141 storeys.

The current official record holder, &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20101"&gt;Taipei 101&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, has a height of 508 metres and 101 storeys, and will retain the "tallest building" title for some time to come. The &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20on%20Tall%20Buildings%20and%20Urban%20Habitat"&gt;Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat&lt;/a&gt; sets the criteria for achieving height records for buildings, and will not evaluate the Burj Dubai until construction is complete in late 2008. Although final height details have been kept secret by the developer, the Burj Dubai is expected to reach nearly 700 metres in height, with approximately 160 storeys.

The current record holder for the world's tallest free-standing structure is the &lt;a href="w%3ACN%20Tower"&gt;CN Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Toronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. It has a height of 553 metres. The Burj Dubai, therefore, would claim both records when it is completed.

Once the Burj Dubai is completed, it will have required 330,000 cubic metres of concrete, 39,000 tonnes of steel and 142,000 square metres of glass, according to Emaar Properties. The building will have 56 lifts (elevators) that can move at a rate of speed of 1.75 to 10 metres per second.

Dubai is undergoing a construction boom currently with the Burj Dubai as the planned centrepiece of a $US20 billion project, which will eventually realize some 30,000 apartments and boast the world's largest shopping mall. 

There have been criticisms of the working conditions for construction workers in the UAE. A majority of the estimated 500,000 construction workers in the UAE are foreign workers from &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;.

In a 2006 report on the UAE's treatment of migrant workers, entitled ♡❤Building Towers, Cheating Workers♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; documented abuses in UAE such as, "extremely low wages, several years of indebtedness to recruitment agencies for fees that UAE law says only employers should pay, the withholding of employees’ passports, and hazardous working conditions that result in apparently high rates of death and injury."

In October of last year, Human Rights Watch delivered specific recommendations to the UAE government for improvement of working conditions. The UAE government acted swiftly on the report and put in place several improvements, which were applauded by Human Rights Watch.

However, the salaries of migrant construction workers remain in the range from $106 to $250 per month, while the national average wage is over $2,000 per month. Trade unions remain illegal in the UAE.

Messner always hoped that one day doctors would find a cure for her cancer, and was optimistic that they would saying "don't let fear rule your life. Live one day at a time, and never be afraid. I believe when I leave this earth, because I love the Lord, I'm going straight to heaven. I don't think about it, Larry, because it's a waste of good brain space."

The &lt;a href="Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;n government declared a nationwide state of emergency on Thursday in face of a heatwave that is predicted to get worse.

As forest fires rage across the country, temperatures of over 44°C (111°F) are predicted for the weekend. The emergency plan, which has been implemented for at least two weeks, reduces working hours to six hours a day, calls for special shifts for outdoors workers, and warns people to stay out of the sun and take other common sense precautions. 

The new working hours for state and public workers are from 7am to 1pm indoors, and two shifts of 7am to 11am and 6pm to 8pm outdoors. All pregnant women have been given paid leave. Although these measures are not compulsory for the private sector the government has recommended that they are adopted where possible. It is expected that lost time will be made up through Saturday working over the rest of the year.

According to Pande Lazarevski, director of the government's Crisis Management center, over 200 fires have been registered across the country, destroying roughly 2,500 hectares of land, mainly forests.

Health services have seen an increase in emergency calls and the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; has teams on stand-by.

Meteorologists have explained that the soaring temperatures are caused by a heat mass from &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, and have predicted that temperatures will start dropping next weekend.

At least 35,000 people died in the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20European%20heat%20wave"&gt;European heatwave of 2003&lt;/a&gt;.

The name &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Cailliau"&gt;Robert Cailliau&lt;/a&gt; may not ring a bell to the general public, but his invention is the reason why you are reading this: Dr. Cailliau together with his colleague &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Berners-Lee"&gt;Sir Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; invented the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Web"&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;, making the &lt;a href="internet"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; accessible so it could grow from an academic tool to a mass communication medium. Last January Dr. Cailliau retired from &lt;a href="w%3ACERN"&gt;CERN&lt;/a&gt;, the European particle physics lab where the WWW emerged.

Wikinews offered the engineer a virtual beer from his native country &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, and conducted an e-mail interview with him (which started about three weeks ago) about the history and the future of the web and his life and work.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: At the start of this interview, we would like to offer you a fresh pint on a terrace, but since this is an e-mail interview, we will limit ourselves to a virtual beer, which you can enjoy &lt;a href="w%3Anl%3AAfbeelding%3AStella%20Artois.JPG"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: Yes, I myself once (at the 2nd international WWW Conference, &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;) said that there is no such thing as a virtual beer: people will still want to sit together. Anyway, here we go.

<h2>History of the WWW</h2>

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: Why did the WWW emerge at a particle physics lab such as CERN? What need did it serve the scientific community at its origin? Was the making of the WWW a case of the right time and the right place/circumstances for someone with the right IT knowledge?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: There were quite a number of hypertext systems around: the Microcosm, Hyper-G, &lt;a href="w%3AGopher%20%28protocol%29"&gt;Gopher&lt;/a&gt;, even Xanadu. Everyone was experimenting. There were even two independent attempts inside CERN (Tim's and mine)! CERN is an infrastructure used by physicists from all kinds of universities who after their experiments at CERN go back to their institutes. A single experiment brings together many physicists from universities scattered over the globe. Obviously they stay in contact: they have been users of networks and computers for a long time.

It's therefore not so surprising that we looked for a system that would allow such a group to consult documents without having to know where the author was or which of the different computers, operating systems, usernames or passwords was needed. There was a need for an automated library.

The two attempts at CERN were personal initiatives. When I learned that Tim wanted to use the internet and had made progress towards an implementation, I immediately teamed up with him. But it remained for quite a time a project that was looked at with some apprehension by CERN management.

It was partially the result of the right people in the right place, partially chance, but partially driven by a real need. And everything happened under the benevolent eyes of Mike Sendall, Tim's boss.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: In the beginning, what challenges did you face inside and outside CERN in the development of this cutting-edge technology?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: A lot of incomprehension, later also some jealousy. And at the start it was difficult to convince the managers that it would grow into a useful tool.

There were a number of factors against us. First, the period of home-grown IT solutions was over. The trend was to buy off-the-shelf software.

Secondly, the entire future of high-energy physics was precarious: there were troubles around the &lt;a href="w%3ASuperconducting%20Super%20Collider"&gt;SSC&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Superconducting Super Collider, red.♡❤) in the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and from the plans of the &lt;a href="w%3ALarge%20Hadron%20Collider"&gt;LHC&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Large Hadron Collider, red.♡❤) it was clear that something had to give. The SSC was finally scrapped in 1993, but during the entire period the physicists were worrying about other things than hypertexts.

Thirdly, there was always the problem of justifying a project in pure computing within an institute whose mandate is very clearly the science of pure physics.

Outside CERN there was a desert of hopelessly confused networking. Universities wanted TCP/IP but the telecoms of the European countries were still governmental monopolies, and they resisted this because they were used to different payment schemes.

I remember a funny exchange between a person from &lt;a href="w%3ADeutsche%20Telekom"&gt;Deutsche Telekom&lt;/a&gt; and a group of academics at a conference: they complained about the costs and the slow links. The telecom person replied: "What do you want? We give you the best &lt;a href="w%3AX.25"&gt;X-25&lt;/a&gt; lines and then you run &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20protocol%20suite"&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/a&gt; on top of that!" But we had no choice: TCP/IP was the only protocol usable with all universities of the world.
At another occasion I asked a representative of &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20Telecom"&gt;France Telecom&lt;/a&gt; for his e-mail address. He gave me an X-400 address and I asked for an internet address. He raised his eyebrows and said: "Monsieur, vous ne pensez quand-même pas que France Telecom va soutenir l'internet?" ("Sir, I hope you do not expect that France Telecom will support the internet?"). And all that happened when the web was already a success, though indeed only in the academic world.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: Early browsers were web editors at the same time right? What browser do you use today? Does it have tabbed browsing? How does it compare to the early browsers you've worked with?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: It is true that the browser of the &lt;a href="w%3ANeXT"&gt;NeXT&lt;/a&gt; was also the editor, though it was restricted to the pages on the local server.

The current complexity of &lt;a href="w%3AXHTML"&gt;XHTML&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAjax%20%28programming%29"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACascading%20Style%20Sheets"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; etc. precludes I think the efficient combination of the functions of editing and browsing in a single application.

Something I do miss are the "next-previous" functions of the NeXT browser. Current browsers only permit you to follow a link and then to run back and forth over the path you took ("back" and "forward"). The NeXT browser had the additional function of following the next link of the previous page ("next"). That allowed me to make a page which was a list of pages to be looked at and then to walk that "path" with a click per page. It was a simple way to establish a path and save it, totally independently from the target pages and the servers. A kind of "digest".

I know, it's possible to do this with &lt;a href="w%3AJavascript"&gt;Javascript&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not easy and you can't pass such a page in a simple way to just anyone.

We also had &lt;a href="w%3Avector%20graphics"&gt;vector graphics&lt;/a&gt;. I'm afraid that SVG has failed, at least I do not see any sites that use it extensively.

Style sheets were also incorporated, not very advanced, but the idea was there. CSS did break through.

Today I use mainly &lt;a href="w%3ASafari%20%28web%20browser%29"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; because it uses CSS best and above all for the typography. Even &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Firefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; can learn from Safari's typography. Why is it that so few programs handle text well? Why is typography so lousy on the screen?

&lt;a href="w%3ATabbed%20browsing"&gt;Tabbed browsing&lt;/a&gt; is a concession to those who can't cope with a multitude of separate windows. Don't really need it. The first browsers always opened a linked page in a new window. But Windows does not use windows: it prefers full-screen. Mosaic was one of the first browsers that used a single window. Why do it simple when it's possible to complicate things?

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: Search engines have made the mass of data now on the WWW easily searchable. How initially did you foresee the data being indexed?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: Not at all! Or by hand. We had the "Virtual Library" or VL, the idea of indexing and classifying pages about a subject by voluntary work of a specialist in that subject. A kind of &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, but with only the links: the content was distributed outside the VL. The VL had a certain success, but demanded a lot of work. The appearance of search engines made the VL unimportant. 

The web broke up into servers. The original "atom" of the web was the page, now it is the server. Servers link very rarely to other servers and then almost always warn you: "You will now leave our site!". In that kind of structure you need a search engine otherwise you can't find anything. But search engines do not let you find your way in the web: they give you a reference, not a path to follow to get there.

The first search engine was built by the "Centre Universitaire d'Informatique" of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Geneva"&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/a&gt;.

I predicted that search engines would not cope in the long term. Maybe the existence of &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is only an indication that there is still only little available on the web.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: You were at the inception of the WWW together with Tim Berners-Lee; what aspects are you responsible for exactly? You've convinced CERN to release the basic code library into the &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20domain"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: In 1990 I had already left programming for ten years and was doing management. I'm also 8 years older than Tim, who himself was no longer a young programmer. It was evident that I could not compete with twenty year old Unix hackers and soon I stopped meddling with the writing of &lt;a href="w%3AC%20%28programming%20language%29"&gt;C code&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway I know only one programming language worse than C and that is Javascript.

I did influence the shapes of the web and the directions of development, but I mainly occupied myself with obtaining the resources necessary to keep the project going. I had a (meager) budget and so I got computers, offices, and above all people: young programmers who can spend a year working at CERN in the framework of its Technical Student Programme. To get all that done I had to plead often with the management.

I also understood that CERN, as a lab for physics, would never devote a division to the web. Therefore I began to contact true informatics institutes such as &lt;a href="w%3AInstitut%20national%20de%20recherche%20en%20informatique%20et%20en%20automatique"&gt;INRIA&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, red.♡❤) and &lt;a href="w%3AFraunhofer%20Society"&gt;FhG&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Fraunhofer Society, red.♡❤) , as well as contacting the European Commission. In this I was fortunately supported by Mike Sendall. Mike, who was seen as neutral by CERN management, has done more than anyone else to help the development of the web inside CERN.

On the technical side it was not always the best of understanding between me and the team. For example, I was convinced that we needed to build-in a programming language, but the developers, Tim first, were very much opposed. It had to remain completely declarative. Maybe, but the net result is that the programming-vacuum filled itself with the most horrible kluge in the history of computing: Javascript.

I also remember a big resistance against PostScript, but what do we see now? &lt;a href="w%3APortable%20Document%20Format"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; everywhere. Fortunately PDF is an open standard and it's fairly elegant, but it could have turned out much worse. SVG did not make it.
Tim, who had a longer experience with the internet world, convinced me that the web could only survive if all the code was freely available for everyone who wanted to tinker with it. In 1992-1993 I then worked patiently for some 6 months with CERN's Legal Service to draft a document that put the source code into the public domain. This also implied working to convince the management, up to the Directors, of the need to do so. The result was the document signed on 30 April 1993 that gave the WWW technology to the world.

During the same period I also perceived that the web as a technology had very many aspects. Tim drew what he called the "metro": a diagram of the relationships between the existing systems (FTP, SMTP, HTTP, ...) in the form of a stylised map resembling that of the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt;. That made me think that we needed to deal with a lot more hard computer science than our small team of four or five could intellectually handle. Therefore I began to toy with the idea of an international conference on WWW technologies. Tim was not convinced, but I went ahead.

NCSA (the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20for%20Supercomputing%20Applications"&gt;National Center for Supercomputer Applications&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.) had just released &lt;a href="w%3AMosaic%20%28web%20browser%29"&gt;Mosaic&lt;/a&gt;, first for the &lt;a href="w%3AX%20Window%20System"&gt;X-Window&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AUnix"&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt; systems, then for &lt;a href="w%3AMacintosh"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APersonal%20computer"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;. Their group not only had a lot more people, but their leader, Joseph Hardin, was a sociologist of my age. I suspected that he was thinking along the same lines, and I was right: when I launched the call for papers for the first WWW conference in December 1993, I did so just one day before NCSA would have done the same thing.
It was a Friday and on Saturday Hardin phoned me at home to discuss the matter. Fortunately our relations were good and he was also very fair by teaming up with my conference in the end.
But our team at the time was very weak: NCSA had a big success with Mosaic and they could easily have used their weight to wipe us off the map.

It was also a time to understand how underdeveloped our idea of Europe here is. We know that we have to live together on this assembly of peninsulas, but when we have to pull in the same direction then that is politically rather difficult.

Finally for two years I worked quite hard contributing to the setting up of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wide%20Web%20Consortium"&gt;Web Consortium&lt;/a&gt;. Even afterwards that took much effort and a lot of my time.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: There are some fun anecdotes about the beginning of the World Wide Web. We've just offered you a virtual beer, but the idea of the WWW started with a beer too, in this case with a (real) beer with Tim Berners-Lee, right? And there is a reason that the original WWW-logo is green, right? Why is it not called world-wide web, with a hyphen? Are there other anecdotes you want to share with our readers?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: The list is without end.

At the second conference, held by NCSA in Chicago, someone asked if it was not better to use the web for conferences instead of travelling to far places. Implusively I answered, in front of 1500 programmers in the audience, that there was no such thing as a virtual beer and therefore we preferred to meet in the flesh. That was 1994.

In 1990, months before there was a shred of code, Tim and I wanted to find a good name for the project. Sometimes, after a hard day's work in warm offices we drank a beer on the CERN cafeteria terrace before going home. On one such occasion Tim came up with "World-Wide Web". I would have preferred something shorter, but to find a catching name is not easy. I agreed to use WWW for the new document that was to go to management and "find a better name later". WWW stayed: it summarised well what it was.

Because I'm a &lt;a href="w%3ASynesthesia"&gt;synaesthete&lt;/a&gt; I see characters in colours and I perceive a W as green. I liked that. So it remained WWW. And there was indeed a logo that we used a lot in the beginning. It was made from three Ws: white, light green and darker green.
And yes, the hyphen was there for a long time too. But it confused people who were not so grammatical, and Tim finally cut the knot by stating that he had the right to decide how it was written since he had invented it: without the hyphen.

Some anecdotes were less funny: at one time I could have made Alexander Totic of NCSA come to CERN to join us. That was almost arranged when it appeared that Alex had a &lt;a href="Serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;n passport and CERN at the time did not admit Serbs.

The most recent and very positive anecdote is from October 2006: I gave the opening keynote at an Australian conference on e-learning and the internet in education. I started out by saying I knew nothing about education but would give my keynote anyway. In a later talk Jean Johnson presented NotSchool (http://www.notschool.net) and mentioned that the project "Web for Schools" of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; had been very important for her work. 

Later I asked her whether she meant the project that ended in a conference in &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; in 1995. She said yes and asked if I had been there. I then had to admit that I had started that project myself and addressed the audience at the closing session of the Dublin conference and therefore maybe I did know a little about internet in education. It was heartwarming to know that even smaller initiatives had been quite important.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: While Tim Berners-Lee wasn't enthusiastic about it, you called for the first International WWW conference. How did those conferences shape the WWW?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: The conferences still run, the 2007 one was in &lt;a href="w%3ABanff%2C%20Alberta"&gt;Banff&lt;/a&gt;. They are an occasion to meet and work very hard for a few days at the exchange of ideas. The papers of the presentations are published in well-known academic journals. That incites people to prepare well and present to colleagues. Many web technologies started at one of the conferences (proxies, VRML, ...) Working groups are established there. Because many want to go but can do so only when funded by their institute or company, it often means they have to present a paper. Vague ideas are then consolidated and cast into programming code, which otherwise might not happen.

In addition the Conference Committee soon convinced the Web Consortium to hold one of its annual meetings in conjunction with the conference. I am no longer involved with this, but at least during the years 1996 to 2004 this synergy was present and a track of the conference was devoted to the work of the Consortium. Therefore Tim was also present every year.

I always saw the Consortium as the "church" with Tim as the "pope". In the Consortium there is a set of rules for arriving at decisions after which everyone has to abide by them. There are industrial and sometimes political stakes.

The Conferences however, as long as I was member of the Committee, I saw as the "state" of "laymen"; you had freedom of expression and could propose the most wild schemes. Between church and state I prefer a complete separation.

That did not mean of course that we did not collaborate closely between Consortium and Conference Committee: there always was a delegate of the Consortium member of the Committee although that was not a requirement. We wanted both to be successful.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: Related to that, I have been told the WWW was initially to run on &lt;a href="w%3Amicropayments"&gt;micropayments&lt;/a&gt;. Who had that idea, and why do you believe it never came about?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: It never was in the original goals to use micropayments. However, for keynote speaker of the first conference (May 1994) I had invited David Schaum, an expert in digital money. I was therefore already then convinced of the need for digital money: payment with guaranteed value but not traceable origin. We still do not have anything like that. To me a much more important reason to introduce digital money than untraceability is a free market for information.

The ideas of digital payments were targeting sales of goods and payment of subscriptions. To me it is more important to break the vicious triangle of author-reader-advertiser.

In the beginning I was often completely misunderstood. There were even newspaper articles that led to hate-mail through incomprehension.

The principle of an information market with micropayments is simple and it is not new (the French &lt;a href="w%3AMinitel"&gt;Minitel&lt;/a&gt; has had it since the early 80s).

There are currently three ways to put info on the web:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. for free (but who pays my time?)
BULLET::::2. by subscription with a name and password valid for a certain length of time
BULLET::::3. by soliciting advertisers to put their ads on the site

</ol>
Manner 1 can only if I have other sources of income.

Manner 2 is used often but puts off people because of the high level of the subscription.
That bars the reader from using many different sites, e.g. to browse many newspapers. The sum of the subscriptions is too high.

For example: I sometimes want to look up a word in the &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20English%20Dictionary"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, but not so often that I find it worth my while to pay for the subscription. Therefore I can't use it at all.

Manner 3 is the most used even if that is not pleasant for the user. For example, &lt;a href="w%3AViaMichelin"&gt;Via Michelin&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent service, has recently become very irritating because it carries so much advertising, in addition animated as well so that it is difficult to concentrate on what I want to do there for all the moving stuff. Adverts, especially the animated variety, is a pest on useful sites.

With micropayments and digital money I would be able to pay Oxford a tiny sum for each time I consult the dictionary, but without having to pay a full subscription.

A good implementation of micropayments must also provide comfort: I should not have to log in or agree, my computer automatically pays behind the scenes. We are talking here of sums of less than a eurocent.

And I could of course set limits by telling the browser to warn me if I spend more than 10 Euros a day or when a site charges more than a cent for a page, etc.

In this way I could read the news in several papers without having to pay a complete subscription to each and having to log in. If they want, sites can of course also distinguish between a paying entrance after which there are no more adverts and things work faster, and an entrance that is free but full of adverts.

In short, there is then a true market for information, directly between the seller and the customer. Nothing is obligatory, but a lot more is possible. With the Euro it is now perhaps time to try an experiment with micropayments.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: The web was invented in Europe, but it grew exponentially and to some extent the invention has exploded in your face; at any point did you feel that the WWW had been hijacked by the United States?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: The web was hijacked by those who put something in it. They are the people who did not make long ideological or so-called "intellectual" reasonings but who put content there. The approach differs greatly between our European parochial little cultures. For example on the whole French companies are pretty bad on the web: there is a lot of aesthetical ado but you can't find the information you are looking for. The &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; sites, even those written in French, are much more direct and informative.

The Dutch do better than the Belgians. There is a large difference between the private sector and government agencies. The sites of the French government are a model of completeness, user friendliness and usefulness, almost completely the opposite of the sites of the private companies of the same country.

I did not make a study of this phenomenon but it seems there are two large influences: approach to life (Protestant/pragmatic/experimental/Germanic versus catholic/intellectual/cartesian/Latin ?) and language.

It's obvious that there is more available in English, say, than in Basque. But that should not surprise anyone. OK, so we have a language problem in Europe. That leads to one of my favourite subjects: language as a technology, but that's for another interview.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: How much has the web evolved since the 1970s? What factors are hindering further evolution?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: You probably mean the 90s unless you want to talk internet instead of web. Looking back and from the many conversations with web and internet pioneers, I think not much has changed fundamentally.

There was a first explosion of internet services in the 70s (e-mail, chat, file transfer, remote login, ...) then a pause with nothing much until the web involved the public at large from 1995. Two grand phases then: academic development followed by explosion in the public sphere.

We must remember two incompatible communication models: telephony (no guaranteed contact but guaranteed bandwidth) and internet (guaranteed contact but no guaranteed bandwidth). Circuit switching and packet switching. Fashion dictates that we should now do everything via TCP/IP. That's fine als long as there is no need for continuous contact (e-mail, web, download) but it is never good enough when that need is present (audio, video, TV). Not to mention tele-surgery. Would you like to be on the operating table knowing that the surgeon on the other side has just TCP/IP between his hand and the scalpel? Probably not.

There are applications that need a guaranteed bandwidth and that's not achievable with classic TCP/IP. Of course, the mathematician and the network geek will tell you that there is no difference if you make the bandwidth high enough. True, but I fear that you can also always find an application that's bandwidth hungry enough that those limits need to be put higher again.
Maybe we find a combination whereby the web is used to initiated a circuit so that the best of both approaches can be had.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: What part or period of the history of the World Wide Web did you enjoy most? Which were the most exciting times?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: Enjoy? Only afterwards, except the first conference. There was a euphoric atmosphere that I have seldom experienced. And because I started it myself, it was extremely satisfying.

The most exciting period was from end 1991 to end 1994. It was the early period where we sensed very clearly where we wanted to go but had to instill that vision in others.
It lasted until the end of WWW at CERN in December 1994. I cannot relate the whole story here, it is told in detail in the book "How the Web was Born".

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: If you could go back into time and change one thing about the start of the WWW, what would it be?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: &lt;a href="w%3AIsambard%20Kingdom%20Brunel"&gt;Isambard Kingdom Brunel&lt;/a&gt;, one of the greatest engineers of all times, wrote in 1844 at the height of the railway mania:

I thought often of that reflection: we advanced far too fast with far too many developers who ran away in far too many different directions without much thinking.
I don't want to be Cartesian here, but it would have been better if we had more time to build on our ideas before letting the beast loose.
Especially the geeks in the U.S. often behaved like cowboys: shoot first, think later. Features were implemented that looked attractive on first sight but turned out to be incompatible with other ones. For example the famous frames, that we still have not got rid of.
People failed to understand the advantage of separating content from presentation, which we had on the NeXT in some sense. Especially graphic artists refused this and that put us back by about five years.

If a careful study were made it might well show that we lost much more time and effort managing excesses than we would have spent in a more considerate and paced development.
I often had the impression I was running like mad to escape from drowning in a tsunami.

<h2>Future of the WWW</h2>
♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: I've read that scientists at CERN are currently working on &lt;a href="w%3Agrid%20computing"&gt;grid computing&lt;/a&gt;, mainly to process the huge amounts of data from the &lt;a href="w%3ALarge%20Hadron%20Collider"&gt;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a&gt; project. Do you think grid computing will be the next generation web? Are there restrictions that limit the use of grid computing, for example working over large distances?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: About grid computing I have not much to say. The first intention of the &lt;a href="w%3AARPANET"&gt;ARPANET&lt;/a&gt; and later the intenet was the use of computing resources at a distance. Grid computing is an extrapolation of that idea. I don't know if the average user will use grid computing. Most probably not. It seems to me that personal computing stands to grid computing like serial computing stands to parallel computing. There are useful applications of parallel computing, but I don't think my second processor is busy while I'm typing this. Grid computing can be used behind the scenes in certain services, but I find it hard to see what the web surfer will use it for. Google knows what to do with it, I'm sure. So I'll shut up about it.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: You've said before that you don't care a lot about the concept of &lt;a href="w%3Aweb%202.0"&gt;web 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, because it was something you envisioned from the beginning, and it was something bound to happen: correct? If not, what is your vision for The Web? What would be a real web Renaissance?
♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: Web 2.0 is something that indeed "exists", but it is not a technology. It is a social phenomenon that requires the simultaneous deployment of a number of technologies to build the so-called 2.0 websites. Delivering web content via blogs and the like is a "new" happening in which the individual participates, often in very original ways. Freely contributing to web content was one of the original goals: the web should be as easy to write as it is to read. Another function we lost due to too fast development.

I'm much more worried about data. All my data are on my home computer and I regularly back them up. I have nothing important on a server: no e-mail, no photos, videos or whatever. But I'm an exception: most people never back up their machines and actually cannot handle a computer. They use the machine as a terminal to the internet.

Services such as gmail, &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact every site having some kind of "My-..." where one leaves a bit of oneself, bring us back to the archaic model of computing: central mainframes and storage, used through terminals on which no local applications run.

This trend started to worry me with e-mail first. Because of spam most &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;ISPs&lt;/a&gt; stopped relaying mail and I began to have some trouble sending e-mail while on travel. To send mail you have to know the local smtp server. But which hotel receptionist can tell you that? They stare blankly at you, incapable of understanding that you do not use web mail, i.e. that you do not have your messages on a server.

Money is virtual, it is a number on a computer in a bank somewhere. We trust the bank: nobody has gold coins in a sock under the mattress.

But we have been working on the banking establishment for a few centuries. The last time we had a great crash (depression of 1929) not only a large number of people died of hunger, but it helped bring about the most totalitarian state we ever witnessed (the Third Reich). Since those days we have learned a lot, painfully and with lots of mishaps.

Therefore now we think that we can trust the banks and the economists with our money. The breakthrough came from government controls and international conventions.

With our data it is now as it was with money about two centuries ago: everything is in the hands of uncontrolled private companies, without any legal framework, to say nothing of international agreements.

But my data are a part of myself. I want to know how my data are managed, by whom, where, and with what guarantees. Money I may lose but then I grow my potatoes in my garden.

You speak of a web-Renaissance. That would be a brilliant light that would let us see that in the information-driven era we need to build new social structures, new forms of creating trust and we need more transparency in the processes of society.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: The principle behind wikis such as Wikipedia provides similar functionalities to early web browsers that were web editors at the same time. To which extent is this analogy correct?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: The one great difference, maybe, is that wikis run on servers, but I can of course put a wiki on my home computer or laptop. It's not really &lt;a href="w%3AWYSIWYG"&gt;wysiwyg&lt;/a&gt; but that is not so important.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: Do you see wikis as a viable long-term model, or do you expect something else to emerge? On the subjects of wikis, do you refer to Wikipedia?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: I use the Wikipedia often. I also contribute here and there. A very great work, looked at with a lot of jealousy. In almost all comments about the Wikipedia I perceive in the background some jealousy and intolerance.

There seems to be a strong reaction from those who derive their prestige from "secret" knowledge and consequently find it rather scandalous that everything is now not only lying around to be read but also often debunks their prejudices.

"The Wikipedia is full of errors": maybe, but printed books too and they do not get corrected. It is also totally unrealistic to compare the Wikipedia with a work like the &lt;a href="w%3AEncyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica"&gt;Britannica&lt;/a&gt; (for which you need a subscription because we have no micropayments). One should compare the Wikipedia with what people have in their homes (often NOTHING!) or in their heads. If the Wikipedia is as good as the Brittanica, then hats off!

Are wikis viable in the longer term? I think so. They give authors a frame to work in. Whatever comes later, that frame is important.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: You've edited your own article on Wikipedia, did you find it easy to work with? You probably don't have a lot of experience with it, but what is your impression of the &lt;a href="w%3AMediaWiki"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt; software that Wikipedia runs on?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: I find it very good. Precisely because I do not use it often it is important that it is sufficiently simple and intuitive that I do not need a manual. The wiki software fulfills this criterion and is therefore very good: the frame is important.!

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: Will it be possible to agree on common standards, with the software companies trying to push their own standards? Are there major obstacles for XML?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: We can apparently agree on common standards: OS X is full of XML and even Microsoft now uses XML for its Office products.

Proprietary standards are not bad in themselves. They let one try out new things or be efficient in some ways. I do not object to them on one condition: that there is a way to export all data in an XML form, with all the details I could control through the application transmitted to the XML in recognisable form.

The W3 Consortium succeeded in spreading the WWW standards and did even more: several commercial standards converged under its influence.
That is the good news.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: Lawmakers are lagging behind when it comes to computer- and information-technology. On your site, you say: In a society based on technology it is simply dangerous to make policy on the basis of language constructs only. What is the alternative to language-based policy?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: A few years ago I had to speak about www at the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. I was shocked that there was no way to use anything else than spoken language. No screen, no projector, no whiteboard. How can one say anything sensible about climate change without showing maps, graphs, videos? But perhaps we should first work on the scientific literacy of our politicians. Maybe that won't be necessary if the next form of government grows from web 2.0. I just discovered Newropeans (http://www.newropeans.org). Who knows. The old technology of the spoken language alone certainly no longer works.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: There were recently reports in the Belgian media about the rise of reported internet crime. Does that illustrate your call for international regulations of internet behaviour? If someone poses problematic behaviour on the internet, how should he or she be dealt with?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: What do we use in common law? The police searches for the offender and works through a number of procedures. There are rules for establishing complicity. On the net it is only different because time and space break down there.

Problematic behaviour, as you euphemistically call it, can be exhibited from anywhere and it usually goes very fast. We therefore need a world-wide law. There are however at least three large legal frameworks in conflict here: the European, the US and the Chinese systems. Making those work together is a problem that I do not see solved in time.

What upsets me too is the idea that it is the responsibility of the ISP or service to act. Recently &lt;a href="MySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; removed a number of users that were known as sex offenders. They must have used some register. Who decided that? Who transmitted the register? The reaction of &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; was right: it's not because these people had committed an offence that they should be excluded forever, certainly not when they had served their sentences. Or we should first change the law. But we see more and more cases in which commercial companies take the law in their own hands.
And that makes me worried about what the commercial sector will do in the vacuum that the governments just let be. Much more than about what governments would do.
That in turn is related to my worries over leaving my data in the hands of sites rather than having full control myself.

Let's not forget that the sex offenders maybe did nothing wrong in MySpace. The terms of MySpace are very simple: they have the right to do what they want and to exclude you when they want without reason. In addition they transfer all your data to the U.S., although they are honest enough to warn you that the protection of private data in the U.S. "may be different". No, I prefer to stay away from social sites in these circumstances.

Finally, do these sex offenders have a telephone? That is allowed? And they can use the post office? And the road system with their cars? Yeah, let's just keep on messing about.

What we need to clarify is where the rights and duties are. As guide we still have &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20de%20Secondat%2C%20baron%20de%20Montesquieu"&gt;Montesquieue&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore I have been pleading for years now for an "internet driving licence". Last week I heard something similar said in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;British House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: Wikipedia says the &lt;a href="w%3Asemantic%20web"&gt;semantic web&lt;/a&gt; "derives from W3C director Sir Tim Berners-Lee's vision of the Web as a universal medium for data, information, and knowledge exchange," yet you're not a fan of the semantic web, right? Is that because the semantic web will have as a result that "our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines"? Or, are you in favour of a spread of protocols for different types of transactions and data?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: A difficult question. I would like to have a good semantic web. But I think that the possibilities for abuse and misleading are greater with a semantic web (Tim agreed with that when I submitted the problem to him, but he is a steady believer in the goodness of humanity).

It's a theme that runs through this interview: whom can you trust and how do you make the rules that will keep "problematic behaviour" within bounds? Only a world-wide convention can help and we are far away from it.

It's also a little early to use intelligent machinery. Before we reach artificial intelligence we need to cross the desert of the half-witted machines. And you have no idea how "half witted" machines can be.

My attitude towards the semantic web is also liked to the remark that we went too fast: maybe here too we should think and experiment first before we let the beast loose!

♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: Can you predict the future of the internet? Are you optimistic, or will it be "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Matrix"&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, but worse"?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: Matrix but worse. Flight from reality is an unavoidable side effect of our brain structures. Since thousands of years people prefer to listen to fairy tales than face the boring realities. Still I think Web 2.0 is a good trend: blogs, Wikipedia, rings, all these achievements come from simple people sitting behind their home computers who share with others what they experience, and above all learn from others! This learning outside school is the biggest strength of the web and most hopegiving.

<h2>Final question</h2>
♡❤♡Wikinews♡❤♡: You've worked at CERN for 33 years: miss it? How do you spend your days now? Do you spend a lot of time on the internet? In which projects are you still involved?

♡❤♡Robert Cailliau♡❤♡: I had at least four different careers at CERN. While I spent 33 years there, it was as if I changed companies four times. What remained was the environment of colleagues who are modest. A journalist wrote about CERN:

That attitude, also that of the &lt;a href="w%3AAge%20of%20Enlightenment"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;, I would not miss for anything. It is much more satisfying to find out for yourself what really goes on than to deliver yourself to dogmas of someone else. Fortunately I have enough friends with similar attitudes both inside and outside CERN.

Do I spend a lot of time on the net? Well, "being on the net" is not an occupation. What I do is exchange ideas, read, learn, contribute (NotSchool among others) and look around. I have always done that. A good part of these activities now happen through the net, but that is just as much or as little relevant as saying that for many things I use electricity.

I devote time to a number of private projects that have been waiting for a long time and to the problems of education in scientific literacy.

A bus carrying 50 &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; people (47 &lt;a href="w%3APilgrim"&gt;pilgrims&lt;/a&gt; and a three person crew) crashed today near &lt;a href="w%3AGrenoble"&gt;Grenoble&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. According to police, there are 26 dead and 24 injured.

The Poles, many of them elderly, had been attending a pilgrimage at the nearby Notre-Dame de la Salette sanctuary. Emergency workers say the bus suffered a problem with its brakes while on a steep descent. It left the roadway and fell in a river below, where it burst into flames.

On Saturday at 8:45 p.m. (CST), a power outage due to equipment failure at the &lt;a href="w%3AJefferson%20National%20Expansion%20Memorial"&gt;Gateway Arch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; trapped 40 people in the two arch trams and 100 people in the observation center at the top of the Arch.

It took about two hours to evacuate the south tram after one of the nine cables supporting the tram car possibly snapped because of a power failure. The north side tram and people in the observation center had to walk down approximately 300 feet of steps to a freight elevator to be taken to the bottom of the Arch. They were met by anxious families who had been waiting for hours outside the Arch. Two people needed treatment for minor injuries.

The Gateway Arch will be back open Sunday with only the north tram operating. The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Park%20Service"&gt;National Park Service&lt;/a&gt; opened the Gateway Arch in 1966 and is one of the region's most popular attractions.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Contador"&gt;Alberto Contador&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 14 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; came in second and extended his overall lead by 2' 04' over &lt;a href="w%3ACadel%20Evans"&gt;Cadel Evans&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Contador moves into second ahead of Evans and 2' 23" behind Rasmussen.

Contador and Rasmussen had an animated discussion about how to share the workload up the final climb. Contador was happy to sit behind the &lt;a href="w%3AYellow%20jersey"&gt;yellow jersey&lt;/a&gt;-wearing Rasmussen, and pass him in the final sprint for the finish-line. The Dane had hoped for more help in setting the pace and extending his overall lead.

The winner of yesterday's time trial, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexandre%20Vinokourov"&gt;Alexandre Vinokourov&lt;/a&gt;, did not have a good day. &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Kl%C3%B6den"&gt;Andreas Klöden&lt;/a&gt; will likely now be the leader for &lt;a href="w%3AAstana%20Team"&gt;Astana Team&lt;/a&gt;.

This stage took the race into the &lt;a href="w%3APyrenees"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt;. This stage starts with a category 2 climb out of &lt;a href="w%3AMazamet"&gt;Mazamet&lt;/a&gt; and then follows a relatively calm route via &lt;a href="w%3ACarcassonne"&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALimoux"&gt;Limoux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AQuillan"&gt;Quillan&lt;/a&gt; before taking on the Port de Pailhères (17 km at 7.2%) and a very difficult finish at &lt;a href="w%3APlateau-de-Beille"&gt;Plateau-de-Beille&lt;/a&gt; (16 km at 7.9%).

Tomorrow's 196 km stage should be one of the major stages of the Tour, with no fewer than five major mountain passes - including the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20Port"&gt;Col de Port&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20Portet%20d%27Aspet"&gt;Col de Portet d'Aspet&lt;/a&gt; (5.7 km climb at 6.9%), the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20Ment%C3%A9"&gt;Col de Menté&lt;/a&gt; (7.0 km climb at 8.1%), the &lt;a href="w%3APort%20de%20Bal%C3%A8s"&gt;Port de Balès&lt;/a&gt; (19.5 km at 6.2%), (the first time this climb has featured in the Tour), and finally the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20Peyresourde"&gt;Col de Peyresourde&lt;/a&gt; (9.7 km climb at 7.8%) with a downhill finish in &lt;a href="w%3ALoudenvielle"&gt;Loudenvielle&lt;/a&gt;. This exhausting stage will be followed by a day of rest.

&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20European%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;European Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AN%C3%BCrburgring"&gt;Nürburgring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AN%C3%BCrburg"&gt;Nürburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.

Although light rain began to fall during the formation lap, the start was relatively clean, marred only by a collision between the two BMW Sauber drivers. As the rain began to fall more heavily, the pit lane filled up with crews from every team expecting all the drivers to change to intermediate tyres at the end of the first lap. However &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt;, who had started in pole position and was leading the race, skidded across the pit-lane entrance and back out onto the track, forcing him to drive another lap in increasingly wet conditions. 

Having opted to start the race from the pits on intermediate tyres &lt;a href="w%3AMarcus%20Winkelhock"&gt;Marcus Winkelhock&lt;/a&gt;, a rookie &lt;a href="w%3ASpyker%20F1"&gt;Spyker&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; driver on his first ever Formula One race, quickly rose to become race leader despite having started the race in last position. 

Championship leader &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, who had &lt;a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen%20will%20start%20first%20for%202007%20European%20Grand%20Prix%2C%20Lewis%20Hamilton%20suffers%20a%20crash"&gt;suffered a crash&lt;/a&gt; in the third qualifying session and started 10th on his repaired car, had a perfect start, gaining six places, but made contact with one of the BMWs on the first lap and punctured his left rear tyre. 

Within several laps the track quickly became flooded, and on lap three &lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Button"&gt;Jenson Button&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAdrian%20Sutil"&gt;Adrian Sutil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANico%20Rosberg"&gt;Nico Rosberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Speed"&gt;Scott Speed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Davidson"&gt;Anthony Davidson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AVitantonio%20Liuzzi"&gt;Antonio Liuzzi&lt;/a&gt; all aquaplaned off into the gravel trap at the same place - Liuzzi making contact with the tractor attempting to recover the other cars. The safety car was deployed for several laps but the increasingly dangerous conditions forced race officials to red-flag the race, bringing it to a complete stop until the rain cleared up, and drivers once again gathered on the starting grid for a restart. Despite needing to have his car lifted out of the gravel trap by a crane, Hamilton managed to keep his engine running, and in accordance with the rules regarding being moved from a dangerous position, was allowed to rejoin the restarting grid in last place, albeit a lap down on all the other drivers. 

After about half an hour of stoppage, Winkelhock then led the pack off in a flying start behind the safety car. He was quickly overtaken by almost every car, before retiring due to mechanical problems. 

For most of the race &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; led, pursued by world champion &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;. Hamilton was the fastest driver on the track, but even at three seconds a lap faster than the other back-markers it took him a long time to catch the pack.

Rain was predicted to recommence approximately 20 minutes before the end of the race. Renault took a gamble by bringing &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; in first for a tyre change, but they were too early, and he quickly dropped back from fifth position. Several laps later, there was a rush into the pits, with nobody wanting additional risks on the wet track. The "extreme wet" tyres reduced the pace of Massa's Ferrari and allowed Alonso to come closer and push hard on his rival.

After two laps of constant pressure and overtaking attempts, Alonso passed Massa, and held him off until the finish. The aggressive attack style chosen by Spaniard caused a slight contact between their cars.

&lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20Raikkonen"&gt;Kimi Raikkonen&lt;/a&gt; had been close behind Alonso, but his car suffered a breakdown and he had to park it alongside the track.

&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Webber"&gt;Mark Webber&lt;/a&gt; drove his &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt;-Renault to the third place. His teammate &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Coulthard"&gt;David Coulthard&lt;/a&gt; also made a nice race finishing 5th from his 20th place on the starting grid. This became the most successful result for Red Bull in this season.

Still the third place of Webber was under threat from &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Wurz"&gt;Alexander Wurz&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamsF1"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AToyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; who came closer and closer up to the finish line which they crossed with +0,263 sec distance.

The two &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt;s ended 6th and 7th. And the top eight was closed by &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; from Renault.

For the first time from his debut Lewis Hamilton finished outside the points. His consistently quick pace throughout the race raised him up to tenth place, and in a final gamble he attempted to stay out on dry tyres during the second downpour. This raised him into the points temporarily, but after several slow laps he was forced to pit, and dropped back to tenth. In the dying laps he came within several seconds of &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt;, but although he managed to pass Fisichella, Kovalaninen remained out of reach, and Hamilton had to settle for ninth place. He remains leader of the drivers' championship, but now only 2 points ahead of Alonso.

This was the first wet race since the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;2006 Hungarian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;.

The Australian Environment Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Turnbull"&gt;Malcolm Turnbull&lt;/a&gt; announced Sunday that 135,000 hectares (1350&amp;nbsp;km², or 333,592 acres) of land near &lt;a href="w%3AWeipa"&gt;Weipa&lt;/a&gt; in the far north of &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%2C%20Australia"&gt;Queensland, Australia&lt;/a&gt; will be turned in a wildlife reserve in honour of the late naturalist &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Irwin"&gt;Steve Irwin&lt;/a&gt;. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said the park was an important addition to Australia's national reserve system, and a fitting tribute to a passionate environmentalist and a great Australian.

The Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve will be a memorial managed by the Irwin family trust for environmental purposes to fulfill Irwin's vision to conserve and protect Australia's special environments by acquiring it and preserving it forever.

Steve Irwin died in September 2006 while filming an underwater television documentary series off Australia's north coast. He was stabbed in the chest by a &lt;a href="w%3Asting%20ray"&gt;sting ray&lt;/a&gt; barb while diving.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Politicians%20call%20for%20action%20after%20floods%20cause%20havoc%20in%20the%20UK&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Politicians in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; have started calling for action after months of heavy rainfall have left parts of Britain in crisis from flooding and electricity and water shortages. Environment Agency chief executive Baroness Young has called for an increased budget of around £1 billion a year to pay for flood defenses. Environment Secretary Hilary Benn has suggested that the conditions were 'unprecedented', and would overwhelm even the best flood defenses, but said that the Environment Agency's capital expenditure would be increased from £600m to £800m by 2010/11.

Opposition leaders have similarly called for more money to be spent on flood defenses. Liberal Democrat leader Menzies Campbell suggested that the flood risk was known about before it happened, and questioned the degree of preparedness in place.

Conservative leader David Cameron has called for a public inquiry into the crisis. The Conservative shadow Environment Secretary criticised a 'lack of clarity' in the command of clean up operations, and MP John Redwood has asked why the army was not mobilised in support.

The Government has ordered a Cabinet Office review of the flooding events.

After what was almost certain defeat, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APadraig%20Harrington"&gt;Padraig Harrington&lt;/a&gt; has come back to win the 136th British Open in playoff after &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASergio%20Garcia"&gt;Sergio Garcia&lt;/a&gt; missed what should have been a game winning putt. 

Harrington originally was knocked out of the game when he landed his ball twice in &lt;a href="w%3ACarnoustie%20Golf%20Links"&gt;Carnoustie Golf Links&lt;/a&gt;' infamous Burry Burn leading him to a double bogey. However, Garica bogeyed on the same hole leading to a playoff.

The two men had tied 277, seven under par.

<h1>Japan to request IAEA inspection of quake-damaged nuclear plant</h1>

&lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; officials have requested that inspectors from the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (IAEA) inspect the damage that occurred at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKashiwazaki-Kariwa%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant"&gt;Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during a strong 6.8 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amagnitude"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; on July 16. The quake caused a leak in a pipe, which sent radioactive water into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASea%20of%20Japan"&gt;Sea of Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the quake tipped over as many as 400 barrels of nuclear waste.

At least five government officials have written a letter to the Japanese Prime Minister, &lt;a href="Shinzo%20Abe"&gt;Shinzo Abe&lt;/a&gt;, requesting that the IAEA inspect the damage because local residents are experiencing "great unease" about the radiation leak that occurred after the quake hit.

"Furthermore, images of the accident have been broadcast everywhere around the world and are creating misunderstandings. It is making this country's citizens uneasy, too, and may lead to harmful rumors about the prefecture's tourism and agriculture industries," said the letter.

&lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the IAEA has offered to put together a special team of inspectors and experts to go to the country if Japanese officials request their assistance.

"The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has told the IAEA that it will accept the inspection of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant of Tokyo Electric Power Co.," said unnamed Japanese officials according to ♡❤Reuters♡❤ though inspectors are not immediately requested.

&lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; foreign ministers today opened an &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Conference"&gt;Intergovernmental Conference&lt;/a&gt; (IGC) beginning work on on a new treaty for the 27-member bloc. &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, the presiding country of the Union during the negotiations, presented its first draft of the 145 page document (with an extra 132 pages of protocols) to foreign ministers in a short ceremony opening the conference.

A mandate for the new &lt;a href="w%3AReform%20Treaty"&gt;Reform Treaty&lt;/a&gt; was agreed last month after drawn out &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Council"&gt;European Council&lt;/a&gt; negotiations in &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. Under the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; Presidency of the Union, leaders agreed to drop the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Constitution"&gt;proposed Constitution&lt;/a&gt; and its state-like elements, yet retain many of its institutional reforms: described by &lt;a href="Angela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; (German Chancellor and then-Council President) in the terms ♡❤“The fundamentals of the Constitution have been maintained in large part … We have renounced everything that makes people think of a state, like the flag and the national anthem.”♡❤ This mandate is now going to be taken by the IGC, composed of national and European government officials, and converted into a legal text.

Negotiations are expected to go smoothly. &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; had originally intended to kick up a storm over the chosen voting system, as it stood to lose from the proposed &lt;a href="w%3AQMV"&gt;QMV&lt;/a&gt; system and favoured keeping the old system or using an alternative. The negotiations concluded that the implementation of the new system would be delayed until 2014. Poland also claimed it had secured a &lt;a href="w%3AGentlemen%27s%20agreement"&gt;Gentlemen's agreement&lt;/a&gt; that it could veto decisions for a further two years, but this was denied by other members. Isolated, Poland relented and agreed to back official agreement, with a minister stating: "Our priority is not to block decisions - we're interested in easier decision-making because we want the Union to function properly." The Polish Prime Minister stated that despite some opposition in Poland, there is no threat to governments' ability to ratify the document.

The IGC should conclude in &lt;a href="w%3ALisbon"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; during October of this year and would shortly after be signed in the city; therefore, the city will give its name to the treaty. This will allow ratification throughout 2008 so it can come into force before the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament%20election%2C%202009"&gt;2009 European elections&lt;/a&gt;. Most national ratification is expected to take place without referenda, to avoid a repeat of the "no" votes that halted the European Constitution.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlexandre%20Vinokourov"&gt;Alexandre Vinokourov&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 15 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; in a time of 5h 34' 28".

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; kept his overall lead by 2' 23' over &lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Contador"&gt;Alberto Contador&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. The two extend their lead on &lt;a href="w%3ACadel%20Evans"&gt;Cadel Evans&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; by 1' 37", and more on the rest of the contenders.

Today's 196 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; stage is one of the major stages of the Tour, with no fewer than five major mountain passes - including the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20Port"&gt;Col de Port&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20Portet%20d%27Aspet"&gt;Col de Portet d'Aspet&lt;/a&gt; (5.7 km climb at 6.9%), the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20Ment%C3%A9"&gt;Col de Menté&lt;/a&gt; (7.0 km climb at 8.1%), the &lt;a href="w%3APort%20de%20Bal%C3%A8s"&gt;Port de Balès&lt;/a&gt; (19.5 km at 6.2%), (the first time this climb has featured in the Tour), and finally the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20Peyresourde"&gt;Col de Peyresourde&lt;/a&gt; (9.7 km climb at 7.8%) with a downhill finish in &lt;a href="w%3ALoudenvielle"&gt;Loudenvielle&lt;/a&gt;.

Tomorrow is a rest day for the Tour.

A security hole on the &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; web server Sunday exposed sensitive content to the public, including login information that allowed hackers to access names, phone numbers, and email addresses of at least 1.5 million people. 

♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that an &lt;a href="w%3AFTP"&gt;FTP&lt;/a&gt; server belonging to publishing company &lt;a href="w%3AZiff-Davis"&gt;Ziff-Davis&lt;/a&gt; could be accessed with a username and password found on the Fox News site, with customer details among the internal data publicly available.

The FTP site, used for collaboration between different global aspects of Ziff-Davis business, contains data ranging from expense sheets to resumes to &lt;a href="w%3Aopt-out"&gt;opt-out&lt;/a&gt; lists used by customers who wish to avoid receiving unsolicited emails. Many of the compromised files make reference to &lt;a href="w%3AAcxiom"&gt;Acxiom&lt;/a&gt;, a data management company that, in 2003, experienced a similar theft of personal information. Unlike in the 2003 breach, however, it is not believed that the files exposed due to the Fox News security oversight contain customer Social Security numbers or bank accounts. However, telephone and address details appear in the data. A number of the email addresses appearing on the list end in .gov or .mil, suggesting the named individual is a member of the U.S. government or military, respectively.

Internet vandals were quick to leave their mark on the compromised Ziff-Davis server, uploading pornography and claiming to have come from popular Internet comedy site &lt;a href="w%3AeBaum%27s%20World"&gt;eBaum's World&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Ziff-Davis access details are believed to have been on the Fox News server as a part of collaboration between the two media companies for technology news coverage.

Security expert David Utter says the Fox News mistake is an example of "sloppiness", though the hole had been patched by noon Monday. Neither Fox News nor Ziff-Davis have commented on the breach.

An &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; man from &lt;a href="w%3ATulsa"&gt;Tulsa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, was killed by a &lt;a href="w%3Abaseball"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; during a game in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas"&gt;North Little Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, against the &lt;a href="w%3AArkansas%20Travelers"&gt;Arkansas Travelers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ATulsa%20Drillers"&gt;Tulsa Drillers&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Coolbaugh"&gt;Mike Coolbaugh&lt;/a&gt;, 35, was struck and killed by a line drive while coaching first base. 

He leaves his wife, Mandy, and two young sons, Jacob and Joseph. Mandy is expecting a daughter who is to be named "Mandy" as well. Coolbaugh spent seventeen years in professional baseball. He played &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; for two seasons and &lt;a href="w%3AMinor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Minor League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; for the remainder, before becoming a coach.

Coolbaugh was coaching first base in the ninth inning, when a line drive off the bat of Tino Sanchez struck Coolbaugh in the head causing him to lose consciousness. &lt;a href="w%3ACPR"&gt;CPR&lt;/a&gt; was administered on the field. An ambulance transported Coolbaugh to Baptist Medical Center where he fell into &lt;a href="w%3Arespiratory%20arrest"&gt;respiratory arrest&lt;/a&gt;. He later died at the hospital at 10:47 p.m.

The game was then called off in the ninth inning with the Drillers behind 7-3. No make up date has been announced.

The North Little Rock Police Department are currently conducting an investigation, though all indications are that it was an accident.

&lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; (298 &amp; 282) and &lt;a href="w%3AIndia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; (201 &amp; 282-9) have drawn the first &lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test cricket&lt;/a&gt; match of the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202007"&gt;Indian tour of England&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ALord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground"&gt;Lord's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

Play was suspended due to bad light and rain just before tea on the final day with England needing just one &lt;a href="w%3AWicket"&gt;wicket&lt;/a&gt;, and India on 282-9, 98 &lt;a href="w%3ARun%20%28cricket%29"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; short of the 380 needed for victory. Rain continued to wash out the evening session and the game was forced to end as a &lt;a href="w%3AThe_result_in_cricket%23Draw"&gt;draw&lt;/a&gt;.

Before play started on the first day, England won the &lt;a href="w%3AToss%20%28cricket%29"&gt;toss&lt;/a&gt; and captain &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Vaughan"&gt;Michael Vaughan&lt;/a&gt; chose to bat first.

England took advantage of the inexperienced Indian bowling attack to quickly score 40 runs off the first five &lt;a href="w%3AOver%20%28cricket%29"&gt;overs&lt;/a&gt;, the only wicket of the morning session coming when Alastair Cook (36) fell &lt;a href="w%3ALeg%20before%20wicket"&gt;lbw&lt;/a&gt; to Sourav Ganguly. Andrew Strauss, sharing a partnership of 142 with Vaughan, just missed out on a century when he was caught at &lt;a href="w%3ASlip%20%28cricket%29"&gt;first slip&lt;/a&gt; on 96. India took two wickets late on day one, with Vaughan out for 79 and Paul Collingwood recording his first Test &lt;a href="w%3ADuck%20%28cricket%29"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;. England finished day one on 268-4 after stoppages for bad light.

Heavy rain delayed the start of the second day, and play got underway in the early afternoon. England soon collapsed to 298 all out, adding just 30 runs to the overnight total. In one incident, Kevin Pietersen started to walk off believing he had edged to Dhoni before replays showed otherwise, only to be caught making the same mistake minutes later. Sreesanth was the pick of the Indian bowlers, taking 3-67.

In response, England took two quick wickets to reduce India to 27-2 in their first &lt;a href="w%3AInnings"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt;, with Dinesh Karthik and Rahul Dravid falling cheaply. James Anderson took the key wicket of Sachin Tendulkar (37), while Test debutant Chris Tremlett caught and bowled Wasim Jaffer (58) to record his first Test wicket, leaving India on 145-4 at the close of day two.

England's bowlers reduced India to 201 all out by lunch on day three, with James Anderson taking 5-42 and Ryan Sidebottom 4-65, to leave England with a first innings lead of 97. England's second innings was disrupted by rain in the afternoon, and Zaheer Kahn took two wickets in quick succession. At the close of play England were 77-2, leading by 174 runs.

A century from Kevin Pietersen (134) pushed England's lead past 350 runs on day four despite 5-59 from R P Singh and two wickets in two balls from Zaheer Khan. England were all out for 282 runs, a lead of 379, and Chris Tremlett went for a &lt;a href="w%3APairs%20in%20test%20and%20first%20class%20cricket"&gt;Pair&lt;/a&gt; in his first Test match. India, with a second innings target of 380, lost key batsmen Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar cheaply. However they reached 137-3 by the end of the fourth day with help from a Dinesh Karthik half century.

India faltered at the start of the final day, losing Sourav Ganguly (40) and Dinesh Karthik (60). However V V S Laxman and Mahendra Dhoni (76 not out) shared a partnership of 86 to frustrate England, and gloomy conditions stopped play just before tea with England needing just one wicket for victory.

Comedian &lt;a href="w%3ADrew%20Carey"&gt;Drew Carey&lt;/a&gt; has announced that he will be the new host of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; game show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Price%20Is%20Right%20%28U.S.%20game%20show%29"&gt;The Price Is Right&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, replacing outgoing longtime host &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Barker"&gt;Bob Barker&lt;/a&gt;.

Carey revealed this on a taping of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman"&gt;The Late Show with David Letterman&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which, like ♡❤The Price is Right♡❤, airs on &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;.

"It's a done deal. I'm the new host of 'The Price Is Right'," said Carey during ♡❤The Late Show♡❤ taping which airs tonight.

Carey was previously the star of his own sitcom on rival network &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s sitcom ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Drew%20Carey%20Show"&gt;The Drew Carey Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as well as the same network's improv show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWhose%20Line%20Is%20It%20Anyway%3F"&gt;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. He was also recently named as host of another CBS game show, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APower%20of%2010"&gt;Power of 10&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Barker retired from being the host of the show for 35 years and appeared as the host for the final time on June 15.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; has learned that ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Takei"&gt;George Takei&lt;/a&gt;, who played ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHikaru%20Sulu"&gt;Sulu&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; television show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Trek%3A%20The%20Original%20Series"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, has announced on the radio talk show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACoast%20to%20Coast%20AM"&gt;Coast to Coast AM&lt;/a&gt; With &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Noory"&gt;George Noory&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Monday night that a "press conference" will be held on Thursday July 26 regarding the new ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Trek%20XI"&gt;Star Trek 11&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ movie. The movie is planned to be released in December 2008.

"I understand that there will be a press conference on Thursday, regarding the new ♡❤Star Trek♡❤ movie, and major casting announcements will be made then," said Takei.

Brad Altman of ♡❤www.georgetakei.com♡❤, has told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that the conference is scheduled to take place at the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt; Comic Convention on July 26 from 1:00 p.m. (pacific time) until 3:30 p.m.. 

The director of the new movie, &lt;a href="w%3AJ.%20J.%20Abrams"&gt;J. J. Abrams&lt;/a&gt; is expected to announce a "few surprises," says a statement posted on the ♡❤Comic-Con 2007♡❤ website.

The conference is apparently to put to rest rumors that started to circulate online that &lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Damon"&gt;Matt Damon&lt;/a&gt; was going to star in the new movie as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20T.%20Kirk"&gt;Captain James T. Kirk&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Damon later said in an interview with ♡❤ign.com♡❤ that he was "too old" to play the role and that it was nothing but an "internet rumor" and that he was not approached by anyone to be in the film.

It is rumored that &lt;a href="w%3ALeonard%20Nimoy"&gt;Leonard Nimoy&lt;/a&gt; will be cast as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASpock"&gt;Spock&lt;/a&gt;,♡❤ or that &lt;a href="w%3AZachary%20Quinto"&gt;Zachary Quinto&lt;/a&gt; will play the role. 

It is also rumored that the movie will be a prequel to the TV show. According to ♡❤IMDb♡❤ the movie is going to be "set before 'The Original Series' [when] Kirk and Spock are newly graduated Cadets fresh from Starfleet Academy and are sent on their first space mission."

A federally mandated &lt;a href="w%3AMinimum%20wage"&gt;minimum wage&lt;/a&gt; increase for &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; workers goes into effect today. The 70 cents per hour increase, from &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;5.15 to $5.85, is the first hike since 1997.

The increase, which was &lt;a href="U.S.%20minimum%20wage%20increase%20passed%20by%20Congress"&gt;approved by Congress in May&lt;/a&gt;, is the first stage of a 3-step increase over the next two years. Next summer, the minimum will increase by another 70 cents per hour, followed by another bump of 70 cents in the following summer, bringing the minimum wage to US$7.25 an hour by 2009.

The increase is aimed at helping minimum wage earners keep above the poverty level. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services"&gt;United States Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; considers anyone who earns less than $10,210 per year to be in poverty. At the previous minimum wage level, a person working 40 hours a week would only exceed this by $500 a year.

As many as 20 states took the initiative to raise minimum wages before this federal government action became effective. Those states will only be affected by the new law if they fall beneath the new federal mandate.

By comparison, today's current minimum wage for adults in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; is equivalent to almost $11.50. As of 2005, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;'s minimum wage was &lt;a href="w%3AMexican%20peso"&gt;Mex$&lt;/a&gt;4.50. The lowest minimum wage in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;C$&lt;/a&gt;6.50 in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Brunswick"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt;. The highest in Canada is in &lt;a href="w%3ANunavut"&gt;Nunavut&lt;/a&gt;, C$8.50 or US$8.15.

Many countries in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; have no minimum wage laws, but rely on employer groups and &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20union"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt;s to set minimum earnings through &lt;a href="w%3Acollective%20bargaining"&gt;collective bargaining&lt;/a&gt;. As of December 2006, the Australian standard federal minimum wage is &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;13.47 per hour, equivalent to US$11.90.

Authorities are currently working with employees of &lt;a href="w%3AAirTran%20Airways"&gt;AirTran Airways&lt;/a&gt; to find passengers who sat near a teenage girl with &lt;a href="w%3Abacterial%20meningitis"&gt;bacterial meningitis&lt;/a&gt; on AirTran flights 687 and 862 on Saturday.

After falling "seriously ill" during the second flight, from &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AWichita"&gt;Wichita&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; the girl was diagnosed with meningitis, an infection of the brain and spinal cord, at Wichita's Wesley Medical Center. 

Although meningitis cannot be transferred merely through casual contact, AirTran notified the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, and are attempting to track the passengers who sat near the girl on the two flights.

&lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; protester, was arrested inside the &lt;a href="w%3ARayburn%20House%20Office%20Building"&gt;Rayburn Building&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; along with 45 to 50 other protesters for disorderly conduct on Monday.

"The Democrats will not hold this administration accountable, so we have to hold the Democrats accountable. And I for one am going to step up to the plate and run against Nancy Pelosi," said Sheehan during her protest inside the capitol.

Sheehan and the other protesters were at the offices of &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;Rep. John Conyers Jr.&lt;/a&gt; who is the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;House Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt; chairman, demanding that President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; be &lt;a href="w%3Aimpeachment"&gt;impeached&lt;/a&gt;. Conyers would be the politician who would start impeachment hearings.

Sheehan then said she would run against &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, who is the &lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Speaker of the House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, in the next election for her seat in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; representing the state of &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

"If Nancy Pelosi doesn't do her constitutionally mandated job by midnight tonight, tomorrow I will announce that I'm going to run against her. Not only am I going to run against her, but I will beat her. Impeachment is not a fringe movement, it is mandated in our Constitution. Nancy Pelosi had no authority to take it off the table," added Sheehan.

Pelosi's Press Secretary Brenden Daly says Pelosi is working hard to make sure that the right steps are taken in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

"The speaker is focused on changing course in Iraq by bringing our troops home safely and soon and refocusing our effort on protecting Americans from terrorism, holding the Bush administration accountable and setting a 'New Direction for America,'" said Daly.

Sheehan became an anti-war protester after her son, &lt;a href="w%3ACasey%20Sheehan"&gt;Casey Sheehan&lt;/a&gt;, was killed while fighting in the Iraq War on April 4, 2004 at the age of 24. Earlier this year, on &lt;a href="w%3AMemorial%20Day"&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/a&gt;, she announced her resignation as "the 'face' of the American anti-war movement" on a personal web journal page published by the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Daily%20Kos"&gt;Daily Kos&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>UK government outlines plans for rail transport</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20government%20outlines%20plans%20for%20rail%20transport&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The government of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has outlined its plans for the development of the Britain's railway network in a &lt;a href="w%3Awhite%20paper"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt; presented to &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20England"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Transport"&gt;Secretary of State for Transport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Kelly"&gt;Ruth Kelly&lt;/a&gt;.

Ruth Kelly described the report as "the most ambitious strategy for growth on the railways in over 50 years" and announced that capacity will be increased to cope with an expected 20% growth in passenger numbers over the next seven years through a &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;10 billion investment.

The government is to continue to limit the rate of increase of regulated tickets, which include standard season and saver tickets, to a maximum of 1% above inflation, and plan to introduce a simplified ticketing structure of four basic ticket types. 

Today's announcement also extended the government's commitment made in March of this year to fund extra carriages. An additional 300 brings the total to 1,300 carriages to be acquired to relieve overcrowding. 

The impact of the investment the government has outlined will be concentrated in tackling areas of high overcrowding on the rail network. In particular, Ms Kelly has highlighted a number of key projects. These include the improvement of &lt;a href="w%3AReading%20railway%20station"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%20New%20Street%20station"&gt;Birmingham New Street&lt;/a&gt; stations and the approval of the &lt;a href="w%3AThameslink%20Programme"&gt;Thameslink modernisation programme&lt;/a&gt;. 

150 stations across the network will be upgraded and refurbished at a cost of £150 million.

The largest opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, greeted the release with much scepticism, saying that the paper contains "reheated announcements that are years later than promised". A spokeswoman for the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; described it as a "missed opportunity" to encourage more people to use trains in favour of cars or planes and suggested that much of the investment outlined in the document had been announced before.

George Muir, of the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociation%20of%20Train%20Operating%20Companies"&gt;Association of Train Operating Companies&lt;/a&gt; which represents the companies providing passenger train services on the British rail network, said that the white paper is the "first plausible plan for expanding the railway" in recent years.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fish%20consumption%20by%20New%20Yorkers%20has%20led%20to%20high%20blood%20mercury%20levels&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Some 25% of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;'s adults have elevated &lt;a href="w%3Amercury"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; levels, according to the city's Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which was released on Monday. &lt;a href="w%3AMercury%20poisoning"&gt;Mercury poisoning&lt;/a&gt;, which can result from eating contaminated animals, leads to a wide range of conditions, including kidney and neurological damage, fatigue, vision problems, and tremors.
As one example, the report found that New York City women between 20 and 49 years old had an average level of mercury of 2.64 micrograms per liter, compared to a national average of 0.83 micrograms per liter among women in a similar age group. Mercury exposure in humans can result in brain damage, birth defects, severe neurological consequences, mercurial &lt;a href="w%3Aptyalism"&gt;drooling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMinamata%20disease"&gt;Minamata disease&lt;/a&gt;, and certain behavior abnormalities.

The high blood levels of the toxin were related to higher fish consumption. City's authorities said that children under six years old and pregnant and breast-feeding women should avoid fish with high mercury contents. The types of fish that were found to have especially high levels of mercury were &lt;a href="w%3AChilean%20sea%20bass"&gt;Chilean sea bass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aswordfish"&gt;swordfish&lt;/a&gt;, and fresh &lt;a href="w%3Atuna"&gt;tuna&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="Study%20reveals%20mercury%20contamination%20throughout%20US%20food%20chain"&gt;2006 study&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Wildlife%20Federation"&gt;National Wildlife Federation&lt;/a&gt; found that, in the United States, the animals of many different species, not just fish, are contaminated with mercury at levels higher than previously thought.

&lt;a href="w%3AAstana%20Team"&gt;Astana Team&lt;/a&gt; announced today that &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Vinokourov"&gt;Alexander Vinokourov&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; failed a blood test following his victory in Saturday's time trial.

"Vino has tested positive having to do with a blood transfusion, and the team is leaving the Tour," team spokesperson Corinne Druey said. Vinokourov also won yesterday's stage.

"There is the presence of a double population of haematids, which implies there has been a blood transfusion with homological blood," read an Astana Team statement. "Tour organizers have asked Astana Cycling Team to leave the race, which has been accepted spontaneously."

Astana manager Marc Biver declared: "Vino denies any blood manipulation. He says after his crash on July 12, there may be blood anomalies." He added that his team was in shock after the events.

Vinokourov was a pre-Tour favorite, but despite winning two stages, he has dropped out of contention. However, Astana Team, which has now withdrawn, had two other riders in the top ten, &lt;a href="w%3AAndreas%20Kl%C3%B6den"&gt;Andreas Klöden&lt;/a&gt;, fifth overall, and &lt;a href="w%3AAndrey%20Kashechkin"&gt;Andrey Kashechkin&lt;/a&gt;, eighth overall.

Pat McQuaid, president of &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20Cycliste%20Internationale"&gt;Union Cycliste Internationale&lt;/a&gt; (UCI) told ♡❤Reuters♡❤: "I cannot comment on this until the result of the B sample's analysis."

"Jesus Christ, I'm speechless," said &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Millar"&gt;David Millar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, who rides for &lt;a href="w%3ASaunier%20Duval-Prodir"&gt;Saunier Duval-Prodir&lt;/a&gt;. "It makes me sad. I have the impression the riders will never understand."

When asked if the Tour was too hard on the cyclists, Tour director &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Prudhomme"&gt;Christian Prudhomme&lt;/a&gt; told reporters that "You do not cheat because it is too hard, you cheat because you want to be first."

&lt;a href="w%3ARollie%20Stiles"&gt;Rollie Stiles&lt;/a&gt;, pitcher in &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; who played for the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%20Orioles"&gt;St. Louis Browns&lt;/a&gt; from 1930 to 1933 has died at the age of 100. 

Born Rolland Mays Stiles on November 17, 1906 in Ratcliff, Arkansas, he batted and threw right-handed, and was 9-14 with an ERA of 5.92 in his three seasons. Rollie attended Southeastern State Teachers College. His first game in the Major Leagues was June 19, 1930, and his last game was October 1, 1933. Stiles' nicknames when playing baseball were "Leapin' Lena", "Lena", and "Rollie", all typical of how he signed autographs for baseball fans.

He made an appearance and gave a speech at the St. Louis Browns Reunion dinner held at the Missouri Athletic Club June 8, 2006 in St. Louis, Missouri.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 16 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; in a time of 6h 23' 21".

Rasmussen increased his overall lead by 35" over &lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Contador"&gt;Alberto Contador&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, who finished third.

After a rest day, the riders faced the third-longest, 218.5 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;, and arguably the Tour’s hardest, stage. The first challenge was the brutal &lt;a href="w%3APort%20de%20Larrau"&gt;Port de Larrau&lt;/a&gt; (14.7 km climb at 8.1%), which is just 79km into the stage. The race dips into &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; for some 50 kilometres at the summit, the fourth country visited in this year’s Tour. From there, there was little reprieve for the riders, hitting the Alto Laza and the &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20la%20Pierre%20St%20Martin"&gt;Col de la Pierre St Martin&lt;/a&gt; (14.2 km climb at 5.2%) before descending to the start of the difficult, and very steep, first-category &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20de%20Marie-Blanque"&gt;Col de Marie-Blanque&lt;/a&gt; (9.3 km climb at 7.4%). The riders then climb the infamous &lt;a href="w%3ACol%20d%27Aubisque"&gt;Col d'Aubisque&lt;/a&gt; (16.7 km climb at 7%), which will reward out-and-out climbing ability and punish the legs of all the major contenders.

The entire &lt;a href="w%3AAstana%20Team"&gt;Astana Team&lt;/a&gt; withdrew from the Tour prior to this stage due to &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Vinokourov"&gt;Alexander Vinokourov&lt;/a&gt; testing positive for &lt;a href="w%3Ablood%20doping"&gt;blood doping&lt;/a&gt;. Some riders staged a protest against doping at the start.

Another doping scandal hit the Tour today. &lt;a href="w%3ACristian%20Moreni"&gt;Cristian Moreni&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; tested positive for &lt;a href="w%3ATestosterone%23Athletic%20use"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; in a test conducted after Thursday's stage 11. Moreni was questioned by police. &lt;a href="w%3ACofidis%20%28cycling%20team%29"&gt;Cofidis&lt;/a&gt; team manager Eric Boyer told ♡❤Reuters♡❤: "He accepted his wrongdoing and did not ask for a B-sample."

Like Astana did, Cofidis has withdrawn its entire team from the Tour. François Migraine, the team president and CEO of the sponsoring insurance company, &lt;a href="w%3ACofidis"&gt;Cofidis&lt;/a&gt;, said: "It's the only thing to do in such circumstances."

Three people were hospitalized with injuries after a series of explosions at Southwest Industrial Gases, Inc., a gas facility in &lt;a href="Dallas%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. None of their injuries are considered life-threatening.

Tanks of &lt;a href="w%3AOxygen"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHelium"&gt;helium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAcetylene"&gt;acetylene&lt;/a&gt; began to explode after a connector used to join acetylene tanks during the filling process malfunctioned. The explosions sent flaming debris into the air and onto buildings and expressways. Black smoke that could be seen for miles billowed from the facility. The problem began around 9:30 a.m &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;CDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-5"&gt;UTC-5&lt;/a&gt;) at a loading dock, according to Dallas Fire Department Lt. Joel Lavender, and then spread to a trailer housing some 100,000 &lt;a href="w%3ACubic%20foot"&gt;cubic feet&lt;/a&gt; (approximately 28,300 &lt;a href="w%3ACubic%20metre"&gt;cubic metres&lt;/a&gt;) of gas.

Authorities evacuated an area that was one-half of a &lt;a href="w%3AMile"&gt;mile&lt;/a&gt; (approximately 800 &lt;a href="w%3AMetre"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt;) wide. Portions of &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2035"&gt;Interstate 35&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2030"&gt;Interstate 30&lt;/a&gt; were shut down. Flaming debris ignited small grass fires next to the roads. Tanks were reported to have landed as far away as four blocks.

Officials for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , as well as local and state environmental officials, have deemed air quality levels acceptable following the blast. &lt;a href="w%3AHazardous%20material"&gt;Hazardous material&lt;/a&gt; crews have blocked water used in the fire from entering the Dallas &lt;a href="w%3AStorm%20drain"&gt;storm drains&lt;/a&gt;. 

"I just advised my teams to get out," said Eddy Parker of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAirgas"&gt;Airgas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which operates right next to Southwest Industrial. "I didn’t really see anything other than the smoke. Then we turned and ran and just kept hearing explosions."

"Given the fact that there haven’t been any fatalities, it seems like our fire department and emergency responders did a great job. But we need to let the fire department look at why this is occurring there in that area," said City Councilman Steve Salazar.

Two of the injured men, Randal Bibb, 52, and Daniel McMurry, 56, were taken to &lt;a href="w%3AParkland%20Memorial%20Hospital"&gt;Parkland Memorial Hospital&lt;/a&gt; to be treated for upper-body burns. The third, an unidentified truck-driver, was treated and released at Methodist Dallas Medical Center. He hurt his back when he jumped from the cab of his truck.

There are no reports of injuries but conflicting reports say that the cyclists passed the area before the devices went off, while others report that the devices were detonated before the cyclists passed.

The Basque separatist group known as the &lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt; have claimed responsibility for placing the devices on the route. A telephone call was placed to authorities by someone claiming to be from the ETA who threatened to use the devices.

&lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20F.C."&gt;Liverpool FC&lt;/a&gt; revealed the plans for its new &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Park%20Stadium"&gt;Stanley Park Stadium&lt;/a&gt; today. The stadium is to be built over the next three years in &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Park%2C%20Liverpool"&gt;Stanley Park&lt;/a&gt;, to replace Liverpool's long time home at &lt;a href="w%3AAnfield"&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt;. The plans as submitted would provide for a capacity of 60,000, with a possible increase towards 80,000.

The design by &lt;a href="w%3AHKS%2C%20Inc."&gt;HKS&lt;/a&gt; is situated approximately 8 meters below the surface to lessen its impact. The cost of construction is said to be &lt;a href="w%3A%C2%A3"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;300 million.

<h1>Changes in Fred Thompson US Presidential campaign</h1>

On Tuesday and Wednesday, two of &lt;a href="Fred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; pre-campaign staffers resigned. J.T. Mastranadi, who was hired less than two weeks ago as the campaign's director of research, resigned this morning. Whereas, yesterday Thompson's top adviser, Tom Collamore, resigned "because of differences with Thompson's wife, &lt;a href="w%3AJeri%20Kehn"&gt;Jeri Kehn&lt;/a&gt;, a Naperville native."

While some reports have noted Thompson's success, according to Mark Murray, "Sources close to the presumptive campaign tell NBC News that Fred Thompson's fundraising is down 'markedly.' One claimed it has 'slowed down big-time'."

In the polls, Thompson continues to be a major contender. A July 24th poll by Washington Post-ABC News has: &lt;a href="Rudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt; 37%, &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; 16%, Fred Thompson 15%, and &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; 8%. While a July 17th poll by FOX News/Opinion Dynamics has: Rudy Giuliani 27%, John McCain 17%, Fred Thompson 17%, and Mitt Romney 10%.

<doc id="75180" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=75180" title="Tour de France: Yellow jersey Rasmussen withdrawn">
<h1>Tour de France: Yellow jersey Rasmussen withdrawn</h1>
Current yellow jersey, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; has been withdrawn from the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; by his team &lt;a href="w%3ARabobank%20%28cycling%29"&gt;Rabobank&lt;/a&gt; for lying to the team about his whereabouts in June, saying he was in &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; while he was, in fact, in &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. An Italian Tour de France commentator mentioned he had met Rasmussen in June on a training camp in Italy.

It has been reported that the hotel, where Rabobank's team was staying, was raided and searched late Wednesday by the police. There is no word on whether the search turned up anything.

Rasmussen had come under heavy fire for having received four warnings from cycling authorities before the race, because of him failing to inform about his whereabouts.

Before today's stage, which he won, Rasmussen said: "I want to make absolutely clear I've had out-of-competition tests prior to the Tour de France, 14 tests during the Tour and all the results are negative ... I do support my team in the fight against doping and [for] a clean sport."

"Michael Rasmussen has been sent home for violating the team's internal rules," said Rabobank spokesman Jacob Bergsma.

According to &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; news channel &lt;a href="w%3ATV%202%20News"&gt;TV 2 News&lt;/a&gt;, the rest of the Rabobank team will be allowed to finish the race if they wish to do so. TV 2 News also says Rasmussen has left Rabobank's hotel.

Davide Cassani, a former Tour de France cyclist and now a TV commentator for Italy, said that he had seen Rasmussen in the &lt;a href="w%3ADolomites"&gt;Dolomites&lt;/a&gt; area of the &lt;a href="w%3AAlps"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt; on both June 13 and 14, 2007. Rasmussen had filed information with his team that he was in Mexico from June 4 through June 26.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) a strong &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 6.9 earthquake has struck &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AMolucca%20Sea"&gt;Molucca Sea&lt;/a&gt; approximately 220 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;kilometers&lt;/a&gt; (135 &lt;a href="w%3AMile"&gt;miles&lt;/a&gt;) north of &lt;a href="w%3ATernate"&gt;Ternate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaluku%20Islands"&gt;Maluku Islands, Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; at a depth of 44.6 kilometers (27.7 miles).

The &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Meteorological%20Agency"&gt;Meteorological Agency&lt;/a&gt; reports the quake at a magnitude 7.0 with a depth of 50 km.

An unnamed official with the USGS says "there is a potential that a tsunami might develop, judging from the magnitude," but no tsunamis were reported.

"We have lifted the warning. After monitoring, there were no signs of tsunami," said the Indonesian head of the country's geology agency, Fauzi. Initially, Fauzi issued a tsunami warning saying "we have issued a warning that the quake could potentially trigger a tsunami."

There are no reports of injuries, deaths or damage. One resident in Ternate said that he "felt a strong tremor for almost a minute, people ran in panic from buildings. Children are crying and their mothers are screaming but there is no damage in my area."

Earlier the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA) had issued a &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; bulletin stating that local high waves could be possible, but a widespread tsunami is "not expected based on historical earthquake data."

&lt;a href="w%3AThe_Walt_Disney_Company%23Studio_Entertainment"&gt;Disney studios&lt;/a&gt; have pledged to leave all forms of smoking out of their family films in a bid to discourage the habit.

In a letter to US Congressman &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Markey"&gt;Edward Markey&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Executive &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Iger"&gt;Robert A. Iger&lt;/a&gt; stated that smoking in Disney brands will be "non-existent" from now on. He also stated that DVD's that show cigarettes will now carry anti-smoking messages.

Mr Markey said that he is pleased that "Disney is embracing a policy that is consistent with the long-term public health of the nation", and called the move by the media giant "groundbreaking".

"Now it's time for other media companies to similarly kick the habit and follow Disney's lead."

Disney films have rarely depicted smoking in recent years, although several instances in the past exist. For example, in the 1953 Disney film &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Pan%20%281953%20film%29"&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/a&gt;, there is a scene depicting smoking at a Native American camp.

&lt;a href="w%3AHertfordshire%20Constabulary"&gt;Hertfordshire police&lt;/a&gt; have charged a man with four offences after 14 &lt;a href="w%3ATesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt; supermarkets in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; were closed after the company received threats. Stores across the country were affected by the security alert earlier this month.

The man has been named as Philip McHugh, aged 51, from &lt;a href="w%3AClitheroe"&gt;Clitheroe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALancashire"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, in the north-west of &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. He has been charged with two charges of blackmail and two of making bomb hoaxes, and was due to appear at &lt;a href="w%3AStevenage"&gt;Stevenage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMagistrates%27%20Court"&gt;Magistrates' Court&lt;/a&gt; this morning. 

Assistant Chief Constable Gary Kitching from Hertfordshire police said, "Throughout the whole inquiry public safety was of paramount importance to both ourselves and Tesco. The successful charging of Philip McHugh has come about through the hard work and tenacity of officers and police staff not only from Hertfordshire but from other forces, and we thank them for their support."

Tesco's Retail and Logistics Director, David Potts commented on the investigation, saying, "Throughout this series of events, the safety of the public and our staff was always our top priority and we worked closely with the police to respond quickly and responsibly. These were of course worrying threats and I am pleased that an individual has been arrested and charged."

"I would like to thank Hertfordshire Constabulary and the other agencies involved for their efficient handling of this investigation. I would also like to thank our staff who acted so professionally during the security threats to reassure customers and get stores back open as soon as possible. The response from customers was fantastic. They were so understanding about the disruption and I am extremely grateful for their patience and continued loyalty," Mr Potts said.

Police are not looking for anyone else in connection to the incident.

At a nursing home in &lt;a href="w%3AProvidence%2C%20Rhode%20Island"&gt;Providence, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; a cat is reported to be able to sense when elderly individuals are about to die.

The cat, known as '&lt;a href="w%3AOscar%20%28cat%29"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt;' is reported to have sensed the deaths of at least 25 elderly people. According to nursing home employees, Oscar has been living at the Steere House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center for two years and seems to sense the deaths at least two to four hours before they happen, and he is rarely wrong.

"It's not that the cat is consistently there first. But the cat always does manage to make an appearance, and it always seems to be in the last two hours," said professor of community health at the home, Dr. Joan Teno.

Oscar would go from room to room on a daily basis to watch and smell the patients, eventually curling up next to one that dies within a few hours, but since most of the patients he visits are too ill they do not notice his presence.

One veterinarian and expert on cats says that cats and dogs sense things that humans are not able to sense.

"It's such a cat thing to do. Those things are hard to study. I think probably dogs and cats can sense things we can't," said &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Illinois%20College%20of%20Veterinary%20Medicine"&gt;University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, chief of veterinarian medicine at the college, Thomas Graves who also added that he does not believe it has anything to do with being a 'psychic cat' saying "there's probably a biochemical explanation."

&lt;a href="w%3AFK%20Partizan"&gt;FK Partizan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; have been kicked out of this season's &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Cup%202007-08"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; after crowd trouble during their first qualifying round match against &lt;a href="w%3AH%C5%A0K%20Zrinjski%20Mostar"&gt;Zrinjski Mostar&lt;/a&gt;. They were also fined 50,000 &lt;a href="w%3ASwiss%20francs"&gt;Swiss francs&lt;/a&gt;. Partizan Belgrade won the 1 Leg 6-1.

Trouble started early in the first half when play was stopped for ten minutes after fans from both teams clashed with riot police and stadium security while throwing rocks and flares at each other. Fans also ripped-up stadium seats. 36 people were injured and six people were arrested.

&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt;'s reasoning is that Partizan Belgrade have been fined 25 times in 36 matches over the last five years. UEFA have taken a tougher stance on fan violence having kicked out &lt;a href="w%3AFeyenoord%20Rotterdam"&gt;Feyenoord&lt;/a&gt; in last season's &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Cup%202006-07"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALegia%20Warsaw"&gt;Legia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; in this season's &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup%202007"&gt;Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Partizan Belgrade have within three days of receiving official notice of this decision to appeal.

&lt;a href="w%3ADaniele%20Bennati"&gt;Daniele Bennati&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 17 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; in a time of 4h 14' 04".

&lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Contador"&gt;Alberto Contador&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, who finished with the peleton gets the &lt;a href="w%3AYellow%20jersey"&gt;yellow jersey&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href="w%3ARabobank%20%28Cycling%29"&gt;Rabobank&lt;/a&gt; pulled the previous leader, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; from the Tour.

The 188.5 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; road stage, from &lt;a href="w%3APau%2C%20France"&gt;Pau&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ACastelsarrasin"&gt;Castelsarrasin&lt;/a&gt;, leaves the mountains behind and turns north towards &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. This stage has a series of small climbs, but should give those sprinters who have survived the chance to earn some points.

<h2>Cofidis team leaves Tour after Moreni fails blood test</h2>
High blood levels of testosterone were found in the blood of &lt;a href="w%3ACristian%20Moreni"&gt;Cristian Moreni&lt;/a&gt;, and his team &lt;a href="w%3ACofidis%20%28cycling%29"&gt;Cofidis&lt;/a&gt; consequently decided to pull all their riders out of the Tour after yesterday's stage. 

Media sources in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and other countries are discussing whether or not the Tour should be canceled. ♡❤France Soir♡❤ called the last 48 hours "a living nightmare" in a mock obituary of the 104-year-old Tour de France. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Vinokourov"&gt;Alexander Vinokourov&lt;/a&gt; and the entire &lt;a href="w%3AAstana%20Team"&gt;w:Astana Team&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday because Vinokourov failed a blood doping test conducted after Saturday's stage.

&lt;a href="w%3ARabobank"&gt;Rabobank&lt;/a&gt; pulled overall-Tour-leader &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday after winning that day's stage for violating team rules on reporting whereabouts during training. The rest of the Rabobank team is still in the Tour.

"Obviously this gives a disastrous image of the Tour de France, but at the same time, if we encourage the organizers, we can clean up French sports and in particular cycling," said French PM &lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Fillon"&gt;François Fillon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ABradley%20Wiggins"&gt;Bradley Wiggins&lt;/a&gt;, a British rider for the Cofidis team said, "I don't want to continue in the Tour de France anyway, it is not supposed to be like this."

A public network in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; has stopped broadcasting the Tour de France, and a &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; newspaper no longer covers the event. &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Anti-Doping%20Agency"&gt;World Anti-Doping Agency&lt;/a&gt; vice president Jean-François Lamour said on Wednesday that maybe cycling should no longer be an &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Games"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; discipline.

World Motor Sport Council agreed that McLaren breached the article 151c of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Sporting%20Code"&gt;International Sporting Code&lt;/a&gt; by unauthorised possession of 780 pages of Ferrari's technical documentation.

Still, if &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Ferrari%20Marlboro"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; could prove the use of those documents by McLaren to commit detriment to the championship the team will face the possibility of exclusion from not only the 2007 championship but also the 2008 championship.

&lt;a href="w%3AWake%20Forest%20University"&gt;Wake Forest University&lt;/a&gt; men's &lt;a href="w%3Abasketball"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href="w%3ASkip%20Prosser"&gt;Skip Prosser&lt;/a&gt; died Thursday morning, after collapsing while jogging on campus in &lt;a href="w%3AWinston-Salem"&gt;Winston-Salem, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. 

Prosser was taken to &lt;a href="w%3AWake%20Forest%20University%20Baptist%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, where he later died. The collapse was reported to be a result of a &lt;a href="w%3Aheart%20attack"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. He was 56 years old.

Prosser started coaching at Wake Forest in 2001. During his first four seasons, he led the Demon Deacons to the &lt;a href="w%3ANCAA"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; tournament; however, his team missed out during the past two seasons.

Before coming to Wake Forest, Prosser coached at &lt;a href="w%3AXavier%20University"&gt;Xavier&lt;/a&gt; for seven years. He had a 126-68 record at Wake Forest and an overall record of 291-146.

He is survived by his wife Nancy, and his two sons.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Administration"&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NASA) has reported that a space program worker deliberately cut the wires on a computer that was bound for the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS). The employee has yet to be identified, but works for a subcontractor for NASA.

Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA Space Operations Chief, stated that the sabotage occurred outside of Florida at an unnamed subcontractor. The same worker allegedly damaged another computer that was not bound for the space station.

"I don't want to speculate on motivation. The damage is very obvious. It's easy to detect. It's not a mystery to us," said Gerstenmaier.

The device is reported to be a recorder for the ISS that would monitor stress the station receives while it is in orbit. NASA states that it will repair the computer so it is ready for the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; Endeavour on August 7. 

Investigations are "going on and I'd rather let that get handled that way," added Gerstenmaier.

<h1>UN aid convoys face increasing attacks in Darfur</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UN%20aid%20convoys%20face%20increasing%20attacks%20in%20Darfur&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (UN) &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Programme"&gt;World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt; (WFP) raised concerns about a dramatic escalation in attacks on food aid convoys by armed bandits in the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. WFP says the attacks constrain its ability to feed the more than two million people in the area receiving aid. 

Negotiations over a UN Security Council resolution authorising a joint UN-African Union security force for the region continue but full deployment could take up to a year.

"In the last two weeks, nine food convoys have been attacked by gunmen across Darfur," said Kenro Oshidari, WFP Sudan Representative. "WFP staff and contractors are being stopped at gunpoint, dragged out of their vehicles and robbed with alarming frequency," he said. 

"These abhorrent attacks, which target the very people who are trying to help the most vulnerable in Darfur, must be brought under control," he added.

A WFP official told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that the attacks and robberies have occurred in all regions of Darfur, and that the blame can't be ascribed to a particular group. "Frequently the bandits are wearing uniforms but often in one group of bandits there may be more than one uniform. Thus, we are not pointing fingers at any one group." said Emilia Casella, WFP Spokesperson for Sudan. "We are calling on all parties to respect the neutrality of humanitarian convoys and their drivers, who are delivering food to civilians who are victims of the conflict."
According to WFP, in 2007 so far, 18 WFP convoys have been attacked - "shot at, looted, drivers robbed and/or injured". Four vehicles were stopped and the drivers and passengers robbed. Six vehicles were stolen, where the gunmen drove away with the WFP staff members still inside, though they were later released. "There were no major physical injuries, but naturally such experiences are very traumatic," said Casella. "These incidents have occurred in all three of the Darfurs, in areas controlled by various groups or the government."

In the week of July 15-21, there were five incidents in South Darfur, during which a total of seven trucks were looted of approximately 10.5 tonnes of food assistance.

The Darfur operation is the WFP's largest humanitarian mission, with about 790 staff working to feed more than two million people every month.

The WFP indicated that it has been difficult to hire and retain the commercial trucking companies used to move food and supplies throughout the region due to the risks involved in the service. WFP Public Affairs Officer in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; Jennifer Parmelee told Wikinews that "hiring reliable transport in other insecure environments, [such as] &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, is extremely challenging."

Air service is employed for remote locations and where delivery by road has become too dangerous.

Parmelee told Wikinews that the "increasing insecurity will almost certainly further constrain [WFP's] ability to operate in Darfur - it already has." WFP Spokesperson for Sudan, Emilia Casella, indicated that "humanitarian access is likely to be increasingly difficult due to insecurity." However, the situation has not prevented all aid delivery. "Despite insecurity and access problems, WFP food assistance reached about 2.6 million people in Darfur last month," said Casella.
<h3>Proposed African Union-UN hybrid force</h3>
A UN resolution on the deployment of a hybrid &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; (AU) and UN force of 26,000 troops is working its way through the UN. &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; presented revisions to the draft, which dropped a threat of "further measures" against Sudan for obstructing peace efforts, though Sudan's ambassador, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem, has objected to the revisions.

A deadline of December 31 exists to transfer authority in Sudan's Darfur region from the AU to the proposed AU-UN force. Full deployment of all 26,000 troops would take up to one year.

The draft resolution would allow the use of force to protect the mission's personnel and humanitarian workers and would "protect civilians under threat of physical violence".

Jennifer Parmelee of the WFP suggests that the deployment of the hybrid force under such a mandate would be a positive development in the aid agency's ability to carry out their humanitarian assistance. "Sure an expanded AU/UN peacekeeping force would help." said Parmelee. "As it is, AU is stretched very very thin, and...is unable to accompany most of our convoys."

According to WFP, there are approximately 12,000 humanitarian workers in Darfur, which is a drop in numbers even though the need for aid workers has increased.

At least two storm sewer workers in &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;St. Paul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; went missing when a severe thunderstorm hit the city on Thursday causing a 150 foot deep storm sewer to flood. At least seven other workers made it out of the sewer.

"Nine went down and seven came out," said the fire chief of St. Paul, Mark Mueller.

The workers were part of ♡❤Lametti and Sons♡❤, a private agency employed to repair the city's storm drains. At approximately 3:00 p.m. (central time), they were ordered to evacuate the drains. The flooding began as the last of the men were climbing to the surface, but when the seventh man turned around, the other two were gone.

A search was conducted, but nothing was found and another search will take place on Friday when authorities will begin to search areas of the &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi%20River"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;.

The names of the men are not known.

Three people were killed and another three seriously injured in a blast at &lt;a href="w%3AMojave%20Spaceport"&gt;Mojave Spaceport&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The blast occurred on Thursday at 2:34 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-7"&gt;UTC-7&lt;/a&gt;) while &lt;a href="w%3AScaled%20Composites"&gt;Scaled Composites&lt;/a&gt; was conducting cold flow test of a &lt;a href="w%3Arocket%20engine"&gt;rocket engine&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Tony Diffenbaugh of the &lt;a href="w%3AKern%20County"&gt;Kern County&lt;/a&gt; Fire Department, two of the victims died immediately in the blast, while the third succumbed to his injuries at the hospital.

"Our units arrived on the scene at a remote test site in the northeast portion of the airport. What they found was six victims of an apparent explosion with various traumatic and burn injuries," Diffenbaugh said.

&lt;a href="w%3ABurt%20Rutan"&gt;Burt Rutan&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Scaled Composites, said a press conference: "We just don't know" why the explosion occurred, nitrous oxide usually is "not considered a hazardous material."

Scaled Composites is in a partnership with &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Branson"&gt;Richard Branson&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Galactic"&gt;Virgin Galactic&lt;/a&gt; to build &lt;a href="w%3AScaled%20Composites%20SpaceShipTwo"&gt;SpaceShipTwo&lt;/a&gt;, which hopes to become the first commercially available passenger &lt;a href="w%3APrivate%20spaceflight"&gt;spaceflight&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20tourism"&gt;space tourism&lt;/a&gt;.

The accident comes just days after &lt;a href="w%3ANorthrop%20Grumman"&gt;Northrop Grumman&lt;/a&gt; announced it would increase its stake in Scaled Composites to 100%.

&lt;a href="w%3ASandy%20Casar"&gt;Sandy Casar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 18 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; in a time of 5h 13' 31". &lt;a href="w%3AAxel%20Merckx"&gt;Axel Merckx&lt;/a&gt; came in second.

Sandy Casar, Alex Merckx, &lt;a href="w%3ALaurent%20Lefevre"&gt;Laurent Lefevre&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Boogerd"&gt;Michael Boogerd&lt;/a&gt; took control of the stage with a break-away that gave them a 10-minute lead on the &lt;a href="w%3Apeleton"&gt;peleton&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Contador"&gt;Alberto Contador&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, who finished with the peleton keeps the &lt;a href="w%3AYellow%20jersey"&gt;yellow jersey&lt;/a&gt;. This 211 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; long stage, with a few small climbs near the start, was considered by many as the last chance for any surprises.

&lt;a href="w%3ACadel%20Evans"&gt;Cadel Evans&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, who is second overall, shaved off 3 seconds of the advantage that Contador holds over him, by finishing in a smaller group that finished just ahead of the peleton.

"I hope I don't lose because of three seconds," said Contador. "This yellow jersey is very important. It's important that I have it tonight. I'm not a time-trial specialist but I'll do all I can not to lose one minute, 50 seconds."

Tomorrow's stage is the second time trial stage, with long straight stretches, some beautiful sections of unbending road, some slight inclines and again favours the soloists. It is 55.5 km long and runs from &lt;a href="w%3ACognac"&gt;Cognac&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AAngoul%C3%AAme"&gt;Angoulême&lt;/a&gt;. Sunday, will be the grand finale, as the race enters Paris to complete the eight laps of the &lt;a href="w%3AChamps-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es%20stage%20in%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;traditional circuit&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href="w%3AChamps-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es"&gt;Champs-Élysées&lt;/a&gt;.

Meanwhile, former yellow jersey leader, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Rasmussen"&gt;Michael Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt;, insists that he did not lie about his whereabouts. "I feel I've won the Tour de France... but victory has been stolen from me." He also said that he will not retire, but continue his career.

The four stars of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABratz%20%282007%20film%29"&gt;Bratz&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ appeared Thursday in Toronto on the television series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMuchOnDemand"&gt;MuchOnDemand&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, to promote their new film.

While a great deal of computer animated, direct-to-DVD ♡❤Bratz♡❤ films have been made, as has a relatively successful television series, ♡❤Bratz: The Movie♡❤ is the first time the characters have appeared in live action.

The film centres around four "BFF"s, best friends forever, Yasmin (&lt;a href="w%3ANathalia%20Ramos"&gt;Nathalia Ramos&lt;/a&gt;), Jade (&lt;a href="w%3AJanel%20Parrish"&gt;Janel Parrish&lt;/a&gt;), Sasha (&lt;a href="w%3ALogan%20Browning"&gt;Logan Browning&lt;/a&gt;) and Cloe (&lt;a href="w%3ASkyler%20Shaye"&gt;Skyler Shaye&lt;/a&gt;). Each has a distinct personality, talents, and fashion sense, which each friend supported. But entering high school, they suddenly face being lumped into social cliques, enforced by senior Meredith Baxter Dimly. Torn apart, they eventual decide to find peer pressure head-on, as "the Bratz".

Director &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McNamara"&gt;Sean McNamara&lt;/a&gt; commented in press materials, "The producers, writers and I hung out and talked about the fact that we had all lost friendships during high school, not because you want to but you start meeting new people and start hanging out with people that are into the same things as you."

"This theme of cliques still happens even when you grow up, it's in the business world — hey they are everywhere," McNamara continued. "I think that's what I'm trying to say with this movie is that you don't have to be part of a clique exclusively. You can have friends all over the place and still be with kids that are into what you’re into... be with your jock friends, your science friends, whomever."

Actress Logan Browning comments, "Friendships are so important because you can think that you can go to school and be by yourself and be the coolest girl but without true friends, you’re going to be stuck in your life."

The movie is produced by Avi Arad, a producer of the ♡❤Spider-Man♡❤ and ♡❤X-Men♡❤ trilogies, ♡❤The Hulk♡❤, ♡❤The Fantastic Four♡❤, ♡❤The Punisher♡❤, and ♡❤Ghost Rider♡❤.

Arad feels that "If we can unite kids without taking away their individuality, that's fantastic."

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMuchOnDemand"&gt;MuchOnDemand&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is a long-running program MuchMusic, Canada's primary music channel. The program airs every weekday at 5 pm ET, as an hour-long per broadcast viewer interactive television program.

Four people are dead after two news &lt;a href="w%3Ahelicopter"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt; crashed in &lt;a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The helicopters were covering a high-speed chase within the city, when, at the same time as the suspect left his car in order to carjack another car, the two choppers inadvertently crashed into each other. Wikinews has learned that the two helicopters belong to independent TV station &lt;a href="w%3AKTVK"&gt;KTVK&lt;/a&gt; (Channel 3), and &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; affiliate &lt;a href="w%3AKNXV-TV"&gt;KNXV&lt;/a&gt; (Channel 15).

There is still no word on an exact cause of the collision, however, the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;FAA&lt;/a&gt; is reviewing tapes to see if the helicopter pilots were communicating with air traffic controllers at the time.

On a tape of radio transmissions from the Channel 15 helicopter, pilot Craig Smith (of KNXV-TV) can be heard asking, "Where's 3? Like how far? Oh jeez", followed by "3, I'm right over you. 15's right over you." Moments later, the sound of the crash was heard over the air on Channel 15's signal, which then went to static.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEmpire%20State%20Games"&gt;Empire State Games&lt;/a&gt; is an annual &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Games"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt;-style competition for &lt;a href="w%3Aamateur"&gt;amateur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aathlete"&gt;athletes&lt;/a&gt; from the state of &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, encompassing several divisions allowing athletes of all ages to compete. In 2007, it is hosted by &lt;a href="w%3AWestchester%20County%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Westchester County&lt;/a&gt; and takes place July 25-29, 2007. In all, some 6,000 athletes are expected to participate.

"I think the Empire State Games is one of the best things that's happened to Westchester County," Buster LaBarbera, 74, of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Rochelle"&gt;New Rochelle&lt;/a&gt; said. "It's good for the economy and it's just a great thing."

&lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island"&gt;Long Island&lt;/a&gt; had made a bid to host the games but lost out to Westchester. "Once done, it's done," said Bob Kenney, region director for Long Island, at the opening ceremonies. "We can't look back. We can't hold grudges." Long Island may submit a bid for the games in 2010 according to Kenney.

Saturday, the &lt;a href="w%3ACriterium"&gt;Criterium&lt;/a&gt; cycling events took place in &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Plains%2C%20New%20York"&gt;White Plains&lt;/a&gt;. Starting at 7:00 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;), races for both men and women began at Martine Avenue at Court Street in downtown White Plains.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n prosecutors have dropped charges against Dr &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Haneef"&gt;Mohamed Haneef&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n doctor held in Australia in connection with &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Glasgow%20International%20Airport%20attack"&gt;last month's attack&lt;/a&gt; on Glasgow airport. 

The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Bugg, said on Friday that a review he carried out found that there was insufficient evidence to support the charges of providing material support to terrorism laid against Dr. Haneef and that "embarrassing" mistakes were made. 

Dr Haneef was released from &lt;a href="wikt%3Agaol%23English"&gt;gaol&lt;/a&gt; and into "residential detention" until Immigration Minister &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Andrews%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;Kevin Andrews&lt;/a&gt; reviews his earlier decision to cancel Haneef's visa.

Mr Bugg said that a prosecutor had told a &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; court incorrect information. He said that one of his prosecutors told the court that the &lt;a href="w%3ASubscriber%20Identity%20Module"&gt;SIM card&lt;/a&gt; at the centre of the affair was found in a Jeep which was laden with explosives and driven into Glasgow International Airport on June 30. 

"The first related to the SIM card and was based on a misunderstanding of the facts," Bugg said.

"The second related to the residence of Dr. Haneef in the U.K. and was based on incorrect material provided by the AFP."

Australian Federal Police chief Mick Kelty denied that the AFP had made any mistakes and said investigations would continue. He refused to rule out laying further charges against Dr Haneef.

Australian Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews who previously suspended Dr Haneef's work visa after he was granted bail has said he will review his decision to cancel the visa on character grounds. Mr Andrews said that Haneef had to reside in a place of his choosing and was free to move about the community but had to report to Immigration officials daily by telephone and in person every few days.

Speaking last night, Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; attempted to distance his government from the affair claiming that his government had no control over how the police operate. 

Australian civil rights groups and political parties have strongly criticised the handling of the investigations.

Haneef accompanied by his lawyer Peter Russo and his cousin Imran Siddiqui when he flew out of &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane%20Airport"&gt;Brisbane Airport&lt;/a&gt; on Thai Airways flight TG 992 to &lt;a href="Bangalore"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ALevi%20Leipheimer"&gt;Levi Leipheimer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has won stage 19 of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2007 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; in a time of 1h 2' 44".

"I feel this is maybe the best day of my life," said Leipheimer. "It's my first Tour de France stage win and after this I think I deserve to stand on the podium in Paris."

&lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Contador"&gt;Alberto Contador&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; keeps the &lt;a href="w%3AYellow%20jersey"&gt;yellow jersey&lt;/a&gt;. He is now only 23 seconds ahead of &lt;a href="w%3ACadel%20Evans"&gt;Cadel Evans&lt;/a&gt;, who took second place in this 55.5 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; individual time trial stage.

Leipheimer is in third overall, only 31 seconds behind Contador and 8 seconds behind Evans. When were the top three this close heading into the final stage? As close as it is, there will probably be no change at the top tomorrow.

"I've done all I could," said Evans. "I lost 55 seconds in the ascent of the Col de Peyresourde - that is where I lost the Tour," he added, recalling stage 15.

"I'm not going to attack Cadel on Sunday. He's a better sprinter anyway." said Leipheimer, who seems to enjoy that his team &lt;a href="w%3ADiscovery%20Channel%20Pro%20Cycling%20Team"&gt;Discovery Channel Pro Cycling&lt;/a&gt; has almost certainly won, not only the yellow jersey for Contador, but also the team classification where they hold a massive advantage. "We've won this Tour and have two stage wins," he said.

Described in press materials as a "low budget" production, the crew of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABratz%3A%20The%20Movie"&gt;Bratz: The Movie&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ turned to a busy LA high school to film the picture's main scenes.

Shot in 30 days, during February and March 2007, the film had to work around the roughly 3,500 students at Santee Educational Complex in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Los%20Angeles"&gt;South Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, California. Most productions, like ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20School%20Musical"&gt;High School Musical&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADegrassi%3A%20The%20Next%20Generation"&gt;Degrassi: The Next Generation&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, do principal photography shoots during the summer. Since the Bratz film had a summer release, and the Santee school goes year-round, such a pattern was impossible.

Director Sean McNamara "was adamant about using this school", named in the film as "Carry Nation High", said production designer Rusty Smith. "We knew it was going to be complicated, and it was, but we pulled it off. I'm sure it was a big distraction for us to be there and it's really a compliment to the principal and the students’ cooperation because we couldn’t have done it without them."

One of the stars, Chelsea Staub, agreed. "I was amazed at how orderly and respectful the students at Santee High were during our invasion." She admits that she "would have had issues walking by our heavenly omelet station every morning," if she were a Santee student.

Such good behavior could be deemed extra surprising considering the school, which opened in 2005, is located in an area known for its amount of gangs. Some students walk through 50 different gang "territories" on the way to school, 18 of which have documented members enrolled as students. Students have brought AK-47s to class, and jumped police officers for their guns. A two day melee at the school, whose principal is a former cop, resulted in 34 arrests and 10 hospitalizations, mostly for pepper-spray-related injuries. Half of the instructors, as of March 2006, were in their first year of teaching.

The school board superintendent and &lt;a href="w%3AMayor%20of%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles mayor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAntonio%20Villaraigosa"&gt;Antonio Villaraigosa&lt;/a&gt; rode the bus to the first day the bus was routed through the neighbourhood; a photographer for the ♡❤Los Angeles Times♡❤ caught a 10th grader &lt;a href="w%3AGraffiti%23Styles"&gt;tagging&lt;/a&gt; a window. The first gun shots rang out the second day the school was open.

♡❤Bratz: The Movie♡❤ is a story based on an internationally successful line of dolls. Three "best friends forever" are forced by the queen bee of the high school to separate into various existing cliques. Growing lonely, they rebel by choosing to be true to themselves.

"Filming at a real high school was interesting because you could see real cliques and compare them to the simulated cliques in the movie," commented Logan Browning, one of the movie's stars, herself a senior in high school.

Staub, who plays the antagonist Meredith, also felt the real-life location was beneficial to the movie. "All the sounds and background images helped make it real for me. The shifting echoes of students on the bleachers and school bells that released the chaos of kids changing classes made me feel like I was truly a part of the high school experience as opposed to doing a scene on a soundstage."

"The presence of that school and the way it's laid out, almost like a prison, became a major character in the film," said production designer Rusty Smith. (Interestingly, Meredith's mantra in the movie is "take no prisoners".) The school, devoid of color, easily contrasted against the vibrant and unique bedrooms of the Bratz girls. "We knew it was going to be complicated and it was but we pulled it off. I'm sure it was a big distraction for us to be there and it's really a compliment to the principal and the students' cooperation because we couldn't have done it without them."

A 16-foot high sculpture was added to the school courtyard, to help transform it into Carry Nation. The sculpture was of Nation, the most infamous and formidable member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in pre-prohibition America, wielding her hatchet in one hand and Bible in the other.

The production also filmed in the residential neighborhood of Studio City, and The Grove, a popular shopping centre at the heart of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Hollywood%2C%20California"&gt;West Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, both areas of &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.

The film opens in theaters across the United States and Canada on August 3, in the United Kingdom on August 17, in Spain on August 24, and Australia and New Zealand September 20.

Bayern Munich won their 6 League Cup with a goal from &lt;a href="w%3AMiroslav%20Klose"&gt;Miroslav Klose&lt;/a&gt; on a defensive mix-up in &lt;a href="w%3ALeipzig"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AHamit%20Altintop"&gt;Hamit Altintop&lt;/a&gt; hit the crossbar with 20 minutes left. The game picked up pace in the second half, but Bayern Munich controlled the match to collect the trophy and the €2 million prize money.

With &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20van%20Bommel"&gt;Mark van Bommel&lt;/a&gt; out through suspension and &lt;a href="w%3AFranck%20Ribery"&gt;Franck Ribery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABastian%20Schweinsteiger"&gt;Bastian Schweinsteiger&lt;/a&gt; out due to injury, starting 11 showed six changes to the side which defeated &lt;a href="w%3AVfB%20Stuttgart"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; in Wednesday’s semi-final.

Stunt pilot and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corps"&gt;Marine&lt;/a&gt; veteran &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20LeRoy"&gt;Jim LeRoy&lt;/a&gt;, age 46, died on Saturday, 28 July 2007 at the &lt;a href="w%3ADayton"&gt;Dayton&lt;/a&gt; Air Show in &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, while performing in his signature &lt;a href="w%3APitts%20Special"&gt;S2S Bulldog Pitts aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, with his companion pilot in a stunt routine. The two planes executed a looping cross near to the ground, but while LeRoy's companion pulled up, LeRoy's Bulldog never did, hitting the ground and skidding to a stop, engulfed in flames.

After airport fire trucks put out the blaze, LeRoy was airlifted out of the crash site by a &lt;a href="w%3AUH-60%20Black%20Hawk"&gt;Black Hawk&lt;/a&gt; helicopter, which had been on medical standby for the show. After the crash, the air show's announcer (also a pastor) led the crowd in a prayer for Jim's survival and healing. LeRoy died while the helicopter was making its way to Miami Valley Hospital.

The portion of the show was just prior to when the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Air%20Force%20Thunderbirds"&gt;Thunderbirds&lt;/a&gt; would have flown, who stepped down to allow airport security and the &lt;a href="w%3ATransportation%20Security%20Administration"&gt;TSA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;FAA&lt;/a&gt; to conduct their investigation. Videos of the crash were requested by the agencies. The show was then closed for the day, to allow the investigation to continue, and airport police stood by to "remove cars as fast as possible."

The final 146 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; stage saw the riders leave from &lt;a href="w%3AMarcoussis"&gt;Marcoussis&lt;/a&gt; to enter to complete the eight laps of the &lt;a href="w%3AChamps-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es%20stage%20in%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;traditional circuit&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href="w%3AChamps-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es"&gt;Champs-Élysées&lt;/a&gt;.

Texas congressman &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; defeated fellow Presidential hopefuls Giuliani, McCain and Romney at the Georgetown County Straw Poll yesterday. Paul placed second after unofficial candidate &lt;a href="Fred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; despite being the predicted victor.
Unlike most other county convention straw polls, the Georgetown County Straw Party Poll does not require you to be a registered voter in the county to cast a ballot. You merely need to purchase a $10 ticket and be 18 or older by November 2008 to vote in the poll.
"Coming right before the big Iowa straw poll, I think presidential candidates, particularly those not participating in Iowa, will be looking for a boost from a win or high placing our poll. South Carolina is very important in that historically, it is the state that chooses the Republican presidential nominee," said Georgetown County Party Chairman Tom Swatzel. The Ron Paul campaign has already launched a Call Iowa program in anticipation of the major August 11th straw poll.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASchool%20of%20Mathematics%2C%20University%20of%20Manchester"&gt;School of Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Manchester"&gt;University of Manchester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; finished moving in to its new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Turing%20Building"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Monday. The building is named after one of its most widely known academics, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Turing"&gt;Alan Turing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one of the founders of computer science and a Reader in Mathematics at Manchester.

Although Turing is one of the city and university's most famous sons, there are very few things named in his honour. The city council was criticised for naming an uninspiring piece of by-pass Alan Turing Way, and a statue erected by public subscription bears a plaque pointing out the failure of the computing industry to contribute.

The new building deliberately attempts to provide a conducive atmosphere for mathematical collaboration with a design that aims to promote chance encounter in public spaces. It also aims to save energy with solar panels fitted to the roof.

The building also houses the Astronomy and Astrophysics Group, and the Photon Sciences Institute.

A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlybe"&gt;Flybe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABombardier%20Q400"&gt;Bombardier Q400&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had to make an emergency landing at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh%20Airport"&gt;Edinburgh Airport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; after it had engine troubles on its scheduled flight from Manchester.

Thirty-six passengers were onboard flight BE7220 when the captain made the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMayday%20%28distress%20signal%29"&gt;Mayday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; call to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aair%20traffic%20control"&gt;air traffic control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at approximately 07:40 BST. The captain was forced to shut down one of the plane's two turboprop engines before finally landing safely at Edinburgh Airport at 07:50 BST.

Upon landing the plane was met by fire engines and other emergency vehicles before taxiing to the terminal building.

Jim Mulhall, a passenger on board the plane said, "When the captain told us they were going to cut an engine everyone went quiet, probably because they were apprehensive."

Normal operations at the airport have since resumed, while the aircraft is expected to resume commercial flying this afternoon.

&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20of%20Japan"&gt;Democratic Party of Japan&lt;/a&gt; (DPJ) could claim victory in Sunday's &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Councillors"&gt;House of Councillors&lt;/a&gt; elections. The House of Councillors is the upper house in the &lt;a href="w%3ABicameralism"&gt;bicameral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADiet%20of%20Japan"&gt;National Diet of Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Of the 242 seats, DPJ went from 82 to 109 seats, making it the largest party in the House of Councillors.

This gain came largely at the expense of the ruling &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Japan%29"&gt;Liberal Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (LDP), which went from 119 seats to 83. Also losing seats was LDP's coalition partner, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Komeito%20Party"&gt;New Komeito Party&lt;/a&gt; (NKP), which lost 4 councillor seats and now holds 20.

&lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Japan"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Shinzo%20Abe"&gt;Shinzo Abe&lt;/a&gt; said that while he takes the result of the election "very seriously," he does not intend to resign his post.

"We must take these results very seriously and reflecting on what we must reflect on," Abe said at a news conference. "I want to fulfill my responsibility to proceed with reform to build the nation and promote economic growth that the people can feel."

The election result will not force the government out of power, since the LDP holds 296 of the 480 seats in the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Japan"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, Abe said that he would reshuffle the cabinet. "Voters said we must reflect on our shortcomings and refresh the line-up," Abe said. "I plan to reshuffle the Cabinet and top party posts at an appropriate time."

"The election expressed the frustrations of the people. He really needs to accept the results of the election and think about the future. This might include quitting," 38-year-old civil servant Akihiro Kodaira told ♡❤Reuters♡❤.

&lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; director Ingmar Bergman, a filmmaker widely regarded as one of the great masters of modern cinema, died today at his home on &lt;a href="w%3AF%C3%A5r%C3%B6"&gt;Fårö&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGotland"&gt;Gotland&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden. He was 89. The exact cause of death is not known.

"It's an unbelievable loss for Sweden, but even more so internationally," Astrid Söderbergh Widding, president of The Ingmar Bergman Foundation, told ♡❤Associated Press♡❤.

"This is an enormous loss, not only for artistic Sweden but because he was one of the most well-known Swedes in the world," Jon Asp, a spokesperson for the Ingmar Bergman Foundation, said in a telephone interview with ♡❤Bloomberg♡❤. "Had it not been for his struggles in the 40s and 50s, Swedish directors such as Jan Troell and Bo Widerberg may not have been able to make films."

"He was one of the world's biggest personalities. There were &lt;a href="w%3AAkira%20Kurosawa"&gt;Kurosawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFederico%20Fellini"&gt;Fellini&lt;/a&gt; and then Bergman. Now he is also gone," &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; director &lt;a href="w%3ABille%20August"&gt;Bille August&lt;/a&gt; said to ♡❤Associated Press♡❤. "It is a great loss. I am in shock."

&lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; director &lt;a href="w%3AIstv%C3%A1n%20Szab%C3%B3"&gt;István Szabó&lt;/a&gt; told ♡❤MTI♡❤: "The Bergman films are to viewers like the novels of a great novelist, the poems of a great poet or the works of a great drama writer ... He valued contact with the audience very much and the story which can be told to them, while he did not attribute a great value to stories which can only be understood by snobs and highly qualified aesthetes."

<h3>Biography</h3>
Born Ernst Ingmar Bergman in 1918 in &lt;a href="w%3AUppsala"&gt;Uppsala&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden to a &lt;a href="w%3ALutheranism"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; minister of Danish descent, Bergman grew up surrounded by religious imagery and discussion. He had a strict upbringing and went through two five-month stretches of mandatory military service. He attended Stockholm High School and &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm%20University"&gt;Stockholm University&lt;/a&gt;, without completing his degree in literature and art. He instead became interested in theatre and later in &lt;a href="film"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite his devout upbringing, Bergman said that he lost his faith at age eight but did not come to terms with this until later in his filmmaking career.

Since the early sixties Bergman lived much of his life on the island of Fårö, where he made a number of his films. In 2004 he said he would never again leave the island.

He was married five times and had nine children.

<h3>Career</h3>
Although Bergman was universally famous for his contribution to cinema, he was an active and productive stage director all his life, and was manager and director of a number of the most prestigious theatres in Sweden.

As a director, Bergman favored intuition over intellect, and chose to be unaggressive in dealing with actors. Bergman saw himself as having a great responsibility toward them, viewing them as collaborators often in a psychologically vulnerable position. He stated that a director must be both honest and supportive in order to allow others their best work.

His films usually deal with &lt;a href="w%3Aexistentialism"&gt;existential&lt;/a&gt; questions of mortality, loneliness, and &lt;a href="w%3Afaith"&gt;faith&lt;/a&gt;; they also tend to be direct and not overtly stylized. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APersona%20%28movie%29"&gt;Persona&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, one of Bergman's most famous films, is unusual among Bergman's work in being both existentialist and &lt;a href="w%3Aavant-garde"&gt;avant-garde&lt;/a&gt;.

Bergman usually wrote his own &lt;a href="w%3Ascreenplay"&gt;scripts&lt;/a&gt;, thinking about them for months or years before starting the actual process of writing, which he viewed as somewhat tedious. His earlier films are carefully structured, and are either based on his &lt;a href="w%3APlay"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;s or written in collaboration with other authors.

Bergman stated that in his later works, when on occasion his actors would want to do things differently from his own intentions, he would let them, noting that the results were often "disastrous" when he did not do so. As his career progressed, Bergman increasingly let his actors &lt;a href="w%3Aimprovisation"&gt;improvise&lt;/a&gt; their dialogue. In his latest films, he wrote just the ideas informing the scene and allowed his actors to determine exact dialogue.

<h3>Selected filmography</h3>
Ingmar Bergman, who made over 50 films, rarely watched them. "I don't watch my own films very often. I become so jittery and ready to cry ... and miserable. I think it's awful," Bergman said.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; met &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ACamp%20David"&gt;Camp David&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; for their first formal talks since Brown took office in June.

Gordon Brown arrived at Camp David on Sunday, July 30. Monday, they addressed the press in a joint press conference. According to reports, the talks focused on &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;, world trade and &lt;a href="climate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, amid speculation whether the two leaders could work together. Correspondents say they appeared relaxed as they faced reporters after their talks.
Both reiterated a commitment to fighting terrorism, which Prime Minister Brown called "a crime against humanity", and discussed ways of making sure that the two countries' security systems are "properly aligned" and share information.

President Bush spoke of waging an ideological struggle between those who "believe in freedom and justice and human rights and human dignity, and cold-blooded killers who will kill innocent people to achieve their objectives" and said that defending the "young democracies" of Afghanistan and Iraq was a way to defeat "an ideology of darkness" with a "more hopeful ideology". 

"It's very important for us to make it clear to those who are in harm's way that these missions will be driven not by local politics but by conditions on the ground," the President added.
<h2>Iraq</h2>
Prime Minister Brown acknowledged a responsibility to support the Iraqi government and said the U.S. and the U.K. had a threefold aim: security for the Iraqi people, political reconciliation, and a stake for Iraqis in their future. 

The Prime Minister spoke of a step by step transfer of control to the Iraqi government and security forces, with the British forces moving from a combat to overwatch mode in three of the four provinces under their responsibility. He said military commanders will determine when a similar transition will be made for the remaining province - Basra and that the recommendation will be placed before parliament. The head of the British military said last week that that the transfer is likely by the year end. 

Seven of Iraq's 18 provinces, mostly in the Shia dominated south and the Kurdish north, are now formally under the control of Iraqi government and security forces. On being asked if U.S. deployment will continue till after the presidential elections next year, President Bush reiterated that this was going to take a long time, and said he will not prejudge a report by U.S. Commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, on how the recent troop 'surge' has altered the security situation.

UK Prime Minister proposed setting up a Basra economic development agency to bring jobs and businesses - "economic hope" for the region, and offered financial support for the project. 

<h2>Darfur, Iran and the Middle East</h2>

Both leaders expressed strong concern over the situation in Darfur, and agreed to step up pressure to end the violence in the region by expediting a U.N. resolution mandating a U.N.-African Union peace force. 

Meanwhile, at the U.N. Security Council, a revised draft resolution is being circulated today that drops language critical of Sudan government forces and scales back the peace-keeping force's mandate to monitor arms violation, following Sudan's objections. The peacekeeping force is to assume responsibility by the year's end but it will take up to a year to be fully deployed.

"We're agreed on encouragement for early peace talks, a call to cease violence on the ground, an end to aerial bombing of civilians, and support for economic development if this happens, and further sanctions if this does not happen.", Prime Minister Brown said.

Prime Minister Brown expressed support for President Bush's "bold initiative" in the Middle East peace process and said the two leaders agreed that sanctions against Iran were working and that they were prepared to toughen sanction with a new U.N. resolutions. 

<h2>Trade and aid</h2>
Both leaders expressed support for measures to combat poverty, lack of education and healthcare, particularly malaria and HIV/AIDS, including ways to bring public and private sectors, faith groups and civil society to achieve the &lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Development%20Goals"&gt;Millennium Development Goals&lt;/a&gt;.

Prime Minister Brown, who has already spoken to several leaders around the world regarding the &lt;a href="w%3ADoha%20round"&gt;Doha round&lt;/a&gt; of trade talks, said contact between world leaders will be stepped up to quickly reach an agreement, which both leaders stressed was an important goal that they were optimistic of attaining.
Climate change was an important issue and needs to be tackled in the context of sustainable development as well as energy security, Prime Minister Brown said, and said that this agenda, agreed at this year's G8 in Germany, would be discussed in meetings over the next few months.

Presidential hopeful &lt;a href="Fred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt; reports that he raised US$3 million in June for his all-but-certain &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; bid. According to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, this sum falls short of the $5 million goal set for June, which was the first month he set out to fundraise. 

The $3 million dollars was more than what several other Republicans raised, but falls well short of the $6.5 million raised by &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; in a single day in January in his first month of exploring a bid. 

The reported figure does not include collections from several large fundraising events held in July.

While Thompson has attracted the backing of top Republican figures, including &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Matalin"&gt;Mary Matalin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALiz%20Cheney"&gt;Liz Cheney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20P.%20Bush"&gt;George P. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Politico"&gt;The Politico&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ quotes a key Republican supporter doubting the campaign's prospects.

But a Thompson advisor told the ♡❤Politico♡❤ that the money raised is enough to test the waters and is not meant for running a full-fledged campaign, adding that Thompson himself is "feeling great" and the campaign is going "full speed ahead".

Thompson's campaign manager and several aides quit recently in a staff shake-up reportedly initiated by &lt;a href="w%3AJeri%20Kehn"&gt;Jeri Kehn&lt;/a&gt;, Thompson's second wife. A lawyer and former spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Kehn encouraged Thompson to explore a bid and plays a key role in the campaign's day to day operations, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASunday%20Telegraph"&gt;Sunday Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports. Kehn also draws attention to the 25-year age gap between her and Thompson and to Thompson's reputation, following his divorce, as a "ladies' man", which "may not play well with the &lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20conservative"&gt;social conservatives&lt;/a&gt;".

Citing "league sources," both &lt;a href="w%3ACNN%20Sports%20Illustrated"&gt;♡❤CNN/SI♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Globe"&gt;♡❤Boston Globe♡❤&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Garnett"&gt;Kevin Garnett&lt;/a&gt; is going to the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Celtics"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt; in a trade involving at least six players. This transaction in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' premier professional basketball league &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Basketball%20Association"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt;, which is contingent on a contract negotiation, would be considered major.

The &lt;a href="w%3AForward%20%28basketball%29"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;, known as "Big Ticket", who has spent his entire twelve season career playing for the &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Timberwolves"&gt;Minnesota Timberwolves&lt;/a&gt;, will join fellow all-stars &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Pierce"&gt;Paul Pierce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Allen"&gt;Ray Allen&lt;/a&gt; to give Boston a boost in the Eastern Conference.

Although the deal is yet to be announced formally by either team, many news agencies are reporting that the deal has been finalized. Kevin Garnett will go to Boston, in exchange for Celtic players &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jefferson"&gt;Al Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASebastian%20Telfair"&gt;Sebastian Telfair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Green"&gt;Gerald Green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Gomes"&gt;Ryan Gomes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ATheo%20Ratliff"&gt;Theo Ratliff&lt;/a&gt;, along with two future &lt;a href="w%3ANBA%20draft"&gt;NBA draft picks&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Chief Justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Roberts"&gt;John Roberts&lt;/a&gt; was hospitalized after having a seizure in his summer home in &lt;a href="Maine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;. A statement released by Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg stated that Justice Roberts took a minor fall from the seizure, and has been transported to the Penobscot Bay Medical Center. In addition, she said that Justice Roberts has undergone a, "thorough neurological evaluation, which revealed no cause for concern." 

Justice Roberts, 52, had a similar incident in 1993, when he suffered a "isolated, idiosyncratic &lt;a href="w%3ASeizure"&gt;seizure&lt;/a&gt;," according to White House doctors. 

The Justice was returning from a boat ride at around 2 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;) Monday when he fell on a dock near his home in Port Clyde on Maine's Hupper Island, Arberg said. He was taken by boat to the mainland, and transferred to an ambulance, said St. George Fire Chief Tim Polky. Doctors have determined that this incident was caused by "a benign idiopathic seizure." Both descriptions, according to Arberg, hint that doctors could not determine the cause of the seizures, or link them to any known condition.

&lt;a href="w%3AIndia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; have beaten &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; by seven wickets in the second &lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test cricket&lt;/a&gt; match of the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202007"&gt;Indian tour of England&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ATrent%20Bridge"&gt;Trent Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANottingham"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite the loss of three &lt;a href="w%3AWicket"&gt;wickets&lt;/a&gt; on the final day, the Indian batsmen comfortably reached the 73 &lt;a href="w%3ARun%20%28cricket%29"&gt;run&lt;/a&gt; target set by England.

India lead the three-match series 1-0 after the first Test ended in a draw, and England must win the final Test at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Oval"&gt;The Oval&lt;/a&gt; to avoid their first home Test series defeat since 2001.

The start of play was delayed on the first day as the &lt;a href="w%3AOutfield"&gt;outfield&lt;/a&gt; was wet following heavy rain. Before play finally got underway after lunch on Friday, India won the &lt;a href="w%3AToss%20%28cricket%29"&gt;toss&lt;/a&gt; and captain &lt;a href="w%3ARahul%20Dravid"&gt;Rahul Dravid&lt;/a&gt; chose to field first.

Zaheer Khan made two breakthroughs early in the England &lt;a href="w%3AInnings"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt; to dismiss Andrew Strauss and captain Michael Vaughan. R P Singh then trapped Kevin Pietersen &lt;a href="w%3ALeg%20before%20wicket"&gt;lbw&lt;/a&gt; to reduce England to 47-3. Although Paul Collingwood and Alastair Cook shared a partnership of 54, India's bowlers found some swing and reduced England to 169-7 at the close of day one.

On the second day England were soon bowled out for just 198, with Zaheer Khan leading the bowling attack with 4-59. In response, the England bowlers did little to trouble the Indian batsmen, and Dinesh Karthik and Wasim Jaffer soon reached half centuries. The breakthrough came just before Tea when Jaffer was caught off Tremlett's bowling, while Karthik followed just after the interval. India soon surpassed England's first innings total, and Sachin Tendulkar scored a fifty and his 11,000th run in Test cricket. A partnership of 97 was brought to an end when Rahul Dravid was caught by Ian Bell, and bad weather forced the close of play soon afterwards with India on 254-3.

England struggled in the field on day three as India's lead passed 100. Sourav Ganguly scored fifty and shared a partnership of 96 with Sachin Tendulkar. After lunch, Tendulkar was dismissed by a controversial lbw decision, nine runs short of his century. After V. V. S. Laxman was dismissed for 54, India's tail-enders did not add much to their total and they were eventually bowled out for 481, leading England by 283 runs. Monty Panesar took 4-101 and Chris Tremlett took 3-80. Play ended for the day sixteen &lt;a href="w%3AOver%20%28cricket%29"&gt;overs&lt;/a&gt; into England's second innings, with England still 240 runs behind on 43-0.

Michael Vaughan scored 124 runs on day four and shared a 112 run stand with Paul Collingwood (63), and Andrew Strauss scored 55. However England's last seven wickets fell for just 68 runs with Zaheer Khan taking 5-75. England were all out for 355, leaving India to chase a target of just 73 in their second innings. Three overs of India's second innings were played before the close of play on day four, with India on 10-0, needing just 63 runs for victory.

Indian bowler Sreesanth was fined half of his match fee for colliding with England batsman Michael Vaughan during the fourth day's play, breaking the &lt;a href="w%3AICC%20Cricket%20Code%20of%20Conduct"&gt;ICC Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; which prohibits "Inappropriate and deliberate physical contact between players during play". The match was also marred by incidents of &lt;a href="w%3ASledging%20%28cricket%29"&gt;sledging&lt;/a&gt;. 

On the final day India were hardly troubled in reaching their target although Chris Tremlett took three wickets, including that of Sachin Tendulkar for just one run.

Popular social networking website &lt;a href="Facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; went down for unknown upgrades, possibly to circumvent multiple holes that were published in a &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20paper"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt; earlier. From roughly 1:00 to 4:15 pm ET, users reported the site was down.

Blogs have speculated it may be simply a server upgrade, or it may be new features. One web development blogger has even raised the theory that the site was hacked, with the login box showing multiple random email addresses, through "&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;input&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;" coding. Another user replied to this posting, saying that they were even able to read the other, random user's inbox. Both a blogger who works at a computing company's office in Johannesburg, South Africa and a Norwegian news outlet reported similar troubles. Many blogs received comments from people with similar circumstances, worldwide.

A white paper by Adrienne Felt, posted on July 27, 2007, explained step-by-step how to use an exploit to hijack a user's account. The white paper was then partially censored by the author, until the vulnerability has been fixed by Facebook. Regardless of whether the change was prompted by this paper, both the XSS hole and problem with forms described by the author were fixed during the upgrade.

The site read "We're upgrading. We'll be back soon." with no further explanation.

This is the first known global outage for the site.

This comes as a rival site, ConnectU, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook founder &lt;a href="Mark%20Zuckerberg"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly stealing the idea and the code. The hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.

Also on Wednesday, the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Hat%20Briefings"&gt;Black Hat Briefings&lt;/a&gt; computer security conference begins. The conference unites people from "government agencies and global corporations with the underground's most respected hackers."

The Habele Outer Island Education announced Tuesday that it will be awarding over US$3,500 in tuition assistance scholarships to students from the Outer Islands of Yap State, in the Federated States of Micronesia.

The fund is a South Carolina based 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation, administered by unpaid volunteers, including many returned Peace Corps Volunteers who have served time in Micronesia's public schools.

The scholarships were awarded to two female high school students from the Atoll of Ulithi. These students will be traveling to the neighboring Republic of Palau to attend classes at the private all-girls Bethanaia High School.

Habele was incorporated in 2006, and began informal scholarships three years earlier in 2003. In addition to providing scholarships to students who attend private schools, the organization also gathers and distributes donations of school supplies to the public schools in the Outer Islands of Yap.

The &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; NBA team the &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Cavaliers"&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers&lt;/a&gt; and its partner Flash Seats filed a federal lawsuit on Monday in &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; against leading ticket seller Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster is being accused of violating &lt;a href="w%3Aanti-trust%20laws"&gt;anti-trust laws&lt;/a&gt;. According to TicketNews.com, Flash Seats provides an electronic, paperless ticketing system to Cavaliers season ticket holders, and the lawsuit is moving “to stop Ticketmaster’s ongoing campaign to utilize its substantial market power in ticketing service to exclude actual and potential competition.”

The Cavs and Flash Seats allege that Ticketmaster is “coercively seeking to enforce its primary-ticketing contracts" (relating to the direct sale of tickets to the public) with the Cavaliers and other customers, by allegedly trying to make the Cavs “use only Ticketmaster’s own secondary-ticketing program (relating to the resale of tickets) or none at all.”

Ticketmaster President and CEO Sean Moriarty, in response to the lawsuit filed Monday by the Cleveland Cavaliers and Flash Seats, said the Cavs “breached their contract” with Ticketmaster when the team turned to Flash Seats for the handling of secondary ticket sales.

“The Cavaliers' and Flash Seats' lawsuit aims to deflect attention from the fact that the Cavaliers and Ticketmaster fairly negotiated a contract for Ticketmaster to serve as the team’s exclusive primary and secondary ticketing company,” Moriarty said in a prepared statement.

<h1>UN to send troops to Darfur, Sudan</h1>

At least 26,000 &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (UN) troops will be sent to the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; under resolution 1769 in an attempt to stop violence from spreading and to protect civilians from the fighting. The force includes at least 19,555 troops and nearly 7,000 civilian police officers in a force being called the "United Nations-African Union Mission" (UNAMID). The UN &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; voted unanimously to send troops to the region.

At least 200,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting in the region and more than two million have been displaced. 

Troops will be sent to the region under Chapter 7 of the UN charter which states that the UN "shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security." 

Language authorizing the troops to seize illegal weapons caches and mentions of possible future sanctions if Sudan does not co-operate was removed during negotiations. The resolution does allow troops to monitor weapon caches. 

"If any party blocks progress and the killings continue, I and others will redouble our efforts to impose further sanctions. The plan for Darfur from now on is to achieve a cease-fire, including an end to aerial bombings of civilians; drive forward peace talks ... and, as peace is established, offer to begin to invest in recovery and reconstruction," said the new &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday while visiting the UN headquarters in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.

Troops are expected to be in the region no later than December of this year but may take up to a year to fully deploy. This will be the largest peacekeeping force ever deployed and cost over US$2 billion per year to keep the force in the region. The resolution does not allow for more than 26,000 troops to be deployed.

&lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt; has succeeded in purchasing the &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20%26amp%3B%20Company"&gt;Dow Jones &amp; Company&lt;/a&gt;, the 125-year-old financial information firm and publisher of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Wall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; in a three month long US$5 billion takeover bid. &lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt; is the chairman and chief executive officer of News Corporation. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20W.%20Barron"&gt;Bancroft family&lt;/a&gt;, which owns 64.2% of the Dow Jones' voting power met Tuesday and finalized the deal amid opposition from some key members who were fearful that Journal's reputation and content would be altered. Last week, the board of the Dow Jones approved the sale, a $60-a-share bid which represents a 67% premium above Dow Jones's share price at the time of the offer. Yesterday, the News Corp. board gathered and gave the thumbs up for the acquisition, leaving only the Bancrofts to decide on the outcome.

Dow Jones, which also owns &lt;a href="w%3ABarron%27s%20Magazine"&gt;Barron's Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, has been owned by the Bancroft family since 1902. 

Murdoch announced News Corporation's bid in May, and has maintained his company's position because of the lack of rivals. A Bancroft representative had approached other potential buyers, including billionaires &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Buffett"&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, who both declined. 

To address concerns that the Journal will be negatively altered, Murdoch plans to add four new pages of coverage, and has agreed to form a committee to decide on hiring or firing any editors.

News Corp. owns and operates dozens of large media companies, including the &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Sky%20Broadcasting"&gt;British Sky Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; television networks, newspapers &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Post"&gt;The New York Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Australian"&gt;The Australian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sun%20%28newspaper%29"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;, magazines &lt;a href="w%3ATV%20Guide"&gt;TV Guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Weekly%20Standard"&gt;The Weekly Standard&lt;/a&gt;, as well as internet assets such as &lt;a href="w%3AMyspace"&gt;Myspace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APhotobucket"&gt;Photobucket&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Statistics%20Office"&gt;National Statistics Office&lt;/a&gt; begins its twelfth population census today. Close to 40,000 enumerators will interview people in house-to-house visits to collect demographic data. 

The Population Census (POPCEN) 2007 will gather information on age, sex, marital status, education, and other demographic characteristics and is scheduled to last till August 25. 

All areas, ranging from exclusive subdivisions and condominiums to institutional populations such as those living in hospitals, sanitaria, penitentiary, military camps, convents, and seminaries will be covered, the NSO said in a press release. 

The population count by province, city, municipality and barangay is scheduled to be released on February 28, 2008. 

"The final count shall be considered official for all purposes upon proclamation by the President of the Philippines," the statement said.

NSO Administrator Carmelita N. Ericta urged the public to co-operate with the operation, "please allow our authorized census enumerators to take a few minutes of your time for the interview which will last for about 15 to 30 minutes."

The last census was taken in 2000. The NSO estimates the country’s population as of July 2005 as over 87 million.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) at least two &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 7.2 and 5.1 have rocked the island of &lt;a href="w%3AVanuatu"&gt;Vanuatu&lt;/a&gt;.

The first 7.2 quake was recorded at 4:08 a.m., Thursday morning local time (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B11"&gt;UTC+11&lt;/a&gt;), 55 kilometers (35 miles) east, southeast of &lt;a href="w%3ALuganville"&gt;Luganville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEspiritu%20Santo"&gt;Espiritu Santo&lt;/a&gt;, Vanuatu with a depth of 144.8 km (90.0 miles). The second 5.1 quake was recorded at 47 km (29 miles) east, northeast of Santo (Luganville), Vanuatu with a depth of 149.3 km (92.8 miles) and it struck nearly one hour later at 5:07 a.m.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; has issued a &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; bulletin for the first quake saying that "based on all available data a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami not expected," but that small waves could be expected locally near the quake's &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt;.

So far there are no reports of injuries, deaths or damage, but the USGS reports that damage could be "moderate to heavy."

"No reports of damage or casualties have been received at this time; however, this earthquake may have caused damage due to its location and size," said a statement by the USGS on its website.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; half of the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; government, also known as the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Accord%20Front"&gt;Sunni Accordance Front&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, is withdrawing from the Iraqi government. Reports are also saying that Iraqi's Deputy Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ASalam%20al-Zaubai"&gt;Salam al-Zaubai&lt;/a&gt;, will resign after more than 70 people were killed in suicide bombings in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;.

According to reports, the Front is withdrawing from the government because Iraq's Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ANuri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nuri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;, has not responded to at least a dozen demands made by the Front. They include having more of a "say" in the security and protection of Iraq, and call for the release of prisoners who are not being charged with crimes.

"The government is continuing with its arrogance, refusing to change its stand and has slammed shut the door to any meaningful reforms necessary for saving Iraq. We had hoped that the government would respond to these demands or at least acknowledge the failure of its policies, which led Iraq to a level of misery it had not seen in modern history. But its stand did not surprise us at all," said one of the leaders of the front, Rafaa al-Issawi, to reporters during a press conference.

The Iraqi government released a statement denying the Fronts claims, stating "our goal has been always the continuation of the active political participation and that everybody shoulders his [Maliki] responsibility in running the country and making the decisions. We will maintain contacts with all blocs, including the Accordance Front."

The Front is made up of 44 members, all of whom held a seat in the parliament of Iraq which totaled 275.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Argentine%20President%20harshly%20criticizes%20US%20border%20fence&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; President, &lt;a href="w%3ANestor%20Kirchner"&gt;Nestor Kirchner&lt;/a&gt;, criticized the United States' &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%E2%80%93Mexico%20barrier"&gt;border fence&lt;/a&gt; plan. He was reading his speech about the Argentine economic recovery, when he startlingly stopped and called the US border fence along the frontier between &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; an "insult."

"In name of the Argentine Nation and addressing this honorable Congress I want to make clear the repudiation of the Argentine people and of who is speaking to you and of those who accompany me toward the despicable fence that is being built in the frontier between the Mexican sister nation and the Republic... or the Nation of the United States," said the President to 40 deputies and senators, who got up from their seats and heavily applauded him.

"It's not just an insult to our sister nation of Mexico, but to all the nations of Latin America and all the nations of the world," he added later. Furthermore, he asked &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; to consider "sincerely" the issue. "We plead that in the meantime, those building the fence of shame please reconsider."

Both &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;US Congress&lt;/a&gt; have passed a law for the building of 700-mile fence along the border between USA and Mexico in order to impede illegal immigration.

<h1>Highway bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, collapses</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Highway%20bridge%20in%20Minneapolis%2C%20Minnesota%2C%20collapses&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2035W%20%28Minnesota%29"&gt;Interstate 35W&lt;/a&gt; Mississippi River &lt;a href="w%3AI-35W%20%26amp%3B%20Mississippi%20River%20Bridge"&gt;eight-lane bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Minneapolis, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; has collapsed on both sides of the highway over the &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi%20River"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt; during rush hour. 

Previous reports indicated at least nine people had died, but Minneapolis police revised this to four during a 7:30 a.m. (local time) press conference. Tim Dolan, the Minneapolis Police Chief later stated that "several [adding to the four] people are confirmed dead at the scene," but would not elaborate on how many. At least 79 have been injured and at least 8 are still missing, still believed to be in the rubble. 

The road was busy with bumper-to-bumper traffic in four lanes when the entire 1907 foot (581 m) steel arch bridge collapsed. At least 50 cars were traveling on the bridge, including a school bus. The Red Cross said that 60 children were aboard a school bus, and that ten of those were admitted to a hospital. 
The entire length of the bridge over the river collapsed at 6:05 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;CDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-5"&gt;UTC-5&lt;/a&gt;). The bridge, built in 1967, cleared the water level by 64 feet; the deck surface and pavement were considerably higher.

Reports say that people may be trapped in the water. Further, "many voids may contain survivors, but we cannot search those voids until it's safe," said Jim Clack, Minneapolis Fire Chief, during a press conference. 

"One has died from drowning," said a doctor from the medical center during an 8:00 pm press conference, who also said that so far 22 are in "yellow condition" and at least six are in "critical condition." 
Minneapolis officials have stated during an earlier press conference that "people are being sent downtown and all survivors are off the bridge. We are seeking help from the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;." and "[...]at least 60 children are receiving trauma care some with severe injures, some with minor injuries."
Most of the injured have been received by &lt;a href="w%3AHennepin%20County%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Hennepin County Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Minneapolis for medical treatment. Area hospitals are requesting all off duty staff and all Minneapolis ambulances to report. Residents are being encouraged to stay away from the area to let emergency crews do their work.

It is not known what caused the collapse, but there was construction being performed on the bridge's road surface which included the use of jackhammers and the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; has ruled out terrorism.

"Although it is much too early to make any determination of the cause, we have no reason at this time to believe there is any nexus to terrorism," said Paul McCabe, an FBI spokesman.

In 2001 a stress inspection was done and &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Department%20of%20Transportation"&gt;Minnesota Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; stated that the bridge "should not have any problems with fatigue cracking in the foreseeable future."

Typically an eight-lane bridge, the bridge was reduced to four lanes (two in each direction) during the current construction. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) had just announced overnight lane reductions on the bridge to one lane in each direction for the late evening hours of July 31 and August 1.

<h2>Mayor's Statement</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AR.%20T.%20Rybak"&gt;R. T. Rybak&lt;/a&gt;, the Mayor of Minneapolis, has issued a statement, posted on the front page of his website saying, "Our heartfelt grief goes out to the families and loved ones of those who perished in tonight's I-35W bridge collapsed [sic] over the Mississippi River. The impact of this tragic disaster is felt by every resident of Minneapolis as we pray for those lost to this terrible accident.

"We are deeply grateful to Minneapolis' brave emergency first responders who risked their lives to immediately respond to this disaster and rescue those caught in the collapse. Their dedication and service will not be forgotten.

"I am directing every available City resource to guarantee that our emergency response teams work to ensure that nearby infrastructure, streets and bridges are safe. We will also work with our state and federal partners to complete a full and thorough investigation into the cause off [sic] this disaster."

<h2>U.S. President and Transportation Secretary remarks</h2>
&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said in a press conference at 10:50 a.m. (eastern time), "I understand what it is like to carry the burden of grieving people. We are in prayer for those who suffered. I thank my fellow citizens for helping those who are suffering. We in the federal government must respond and respond robustly to help the people there not only recover but to make sure that lifeline of activity, that bridge, gets rebuilt as quickly as possible."

&lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Peters%20%28politician%29"&gt;Mary E. Peters&lt;/a&gt;, the Secretary of Transportation, arrived in the Minneapolis area to survey the damage caused by the collapse.

"We will take every step possible to make sure something like this will never happen again," said Peters who also stated that at least US$5 million is set aside to clean up the wreckage and to help with rebuilding the flow of traffic in the area. Peters later signed off on an advisory to the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Highway%20Administration"&gt;Federal Highway Administration&lt;/a&gt;. It urges state transportation departments to do inspections on bridges, similar to the one which just collapsed in Minneapolis.

<h2>Detour Routes Announced</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Department%20of%20Transportation"&gt;Minnesota Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; is urging commuters to follow signed detours around the collapsed bridge. The official detour will be to use Minnesota Highway 280 and Interstate 94 to bypass the damaged section of Interstate 35W. Highway 280 will be temporarily converted to freeway operation by closing the intersection at Broadway Ave. and County Road B and green lighting all highway 280 traffic through that intersection. Interstate 35W will be closed between the Mississippi River and Stinson/New Brighton Blvd. The northbound lanes of 35W north of Interstate 94 will also be closed.

<h2>Bus service altered</h2>
Metro Transit announced that extra buses will be added north of Minneapolis due to the altered traffic situation. Additional buses will run from 6 am to 9 am at the following park-and-ride locations:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Foley Boulevard in Coon Rapids (between Coon Rapids Blvd. and East River Rd. near Hwy. 610), served by Routes 850 and 852.
BULLET::::- Maplewood Mall (near Beam and Southlawn avenues), served by Route 270
BULLET::::- Northtown Shopping Center in Blaine (at 85th and Jefferson), served by Routes 824, 852 and 854
BULLET::::- 63rd Avenue/County Road 81 (Bottineau Blvd.) in Brooklyn Center, served by Routes 758 and 767
BULLET::::- Rosedale Shopping Center in Roseville, served by Route 260
BULLET::::- Roseville City Hall (County Rd. C and Civic Center Dr.)./Grace Lutheran Church (Hamline Ave. at County Rd. B2), served by Route 261.

</ul>
<h2>Minnesota Twins</h2>
A baseball game between the &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Twins"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City%20Royals"&gt;Kansas City Royals&lt;/a&gt; was minutes from starting when the nearby bridge collapsed. Because most of the fans were already at the stadium, it was decided to play the game because releasing thousands of cars would greatly interfere with the numerous rescue vehicles at work in the area. There was a moment of prayer held before the Wednesday game and fans were encouraged to stay off their cell phones. Most of the rescue work had been completed before the game ended. Thursday's Twins-Royals game, as well as the ceremonial ground-breaking for their &lt;a href="w%3ATwins%20Ballpark"&gt;new ball park&lt;/a&gt;, have been postponed due to the collapse. Minneapolis officials earlier stated the "Metrodome is safe."

<h1>Fred Thompson's 'exploration’ causes confusion on USA election rules</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fred%20Thompson%27s%20%27exploration%E2%80%99%20causes%20confusion%20on%20USA%20election%20rules&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The day after &lt;a href="Fred%20Thompson"&gt;Fred Thompson&lt;/a&gt;'s "exploratory committee" announced that it raised just over US$3 million dollars, the type of fundraising is causing "confusion" over &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Election%20Commission"&gt;Federal Election Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FEC) rules for the "exploratory" status.

&lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Quarterly"&gt;CQ Politics&lt;/a&gt; reports, "Friends of Fred Thompson" also is registered with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; as a “527” political organization, so named because it is regulated under Section 527 of the tax code." Once Thompson decides to become a candidate, he must then meet FEC disclosure requirements. CQ Politics noted, "two issues — whether Thompson has raised more money than could be expected to be used for exploratory activities, and whether his months of 'testing the waters' have been a 'protracted period of time' as outlined by federal law as qualifying someone as a candidate — Thompson could have trouble." According to Paul Ryan, FEC program director for the &lt;a href="w%3ACampaign%20Legal%20Center"&gt;Campaign Legal Center&lt;/a&gt;, "Reasonable minds could disagree." 

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ noted, "Campaign finance experts said yesterday that if Thompson were to wait until Sept. 6 to launch a campaign, he would be legally permitted to delay filing a finance report with the Federal Election Commission until Jan. 31." Nonetheless, "Thompson campaign officials stressed his commitment to disclosure."

In addition to the personnel changes previously reported, today a top fundraising consultant, Kim Kaegi, resigned from the Thompson campaign. According to the AP, "Kaegi called it a 'stretch' to speculate that her departure was related to lower-than-expected totals."

<h1>Community of Christ sues over RLDS church name</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Community%20of%20Christ%20sues%20over%20RLDS%20church%20name&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ACommunity%20of%20Christ"&gt;Community of Christ&lt;/a&gt; is suing the South Restoration Branch in &lt;a href="w%3ARaytown"&gt;Raytown&lt;/a&gt;, Missouri over their use of the name "&lt;a href="w%3AReorganized%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter%20Day%20Saints"&gt;Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&lt;/a&gt;" and the "RLDS" initials, used to identify the Community of Christ until 2001. 

The document filed on Monday to the U.S. District Court, Western District of Missouri, alleges six counts of federal trademark infringement, false designation of origin, federal trademark dilution, common law unfair competition, common law trademark infringement and state trademark dilution. The Community of Christ is seeking a preliminary injunction, which would prevent use of the name until the case is settled. 

Several other &lt;a href="w%3ARestoration%20Branches"&gt;Restoration Branches&lt;/a&gt; have also been using the name but no legal action has been taken against them at this time.

The Joint Conference of Restoration Branches voted in April this year to use the RLDS name, as recommended by their Succession Committee. It is not yet known whether the Raytown South Branch is associated with this effort or whether this will effect any other Restoration Branches who are or have been using the RLDS name.

The Reorganized Church, founded in 1860 by &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Smith%20III"&gt;Joseph Smith III&lt;/a&gt; grew out of the original Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints founded by &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Smith%20Jr."&gt;Joseph Smith Jr.&lt;/a&gt; in 1830. Historically, the RLDS have claimed to believe in the original tenets of the Latter Day Saint movement, and do not adhere to major &lt;a href="w%3AMormonism"&gt;Mormon doctrines&lt;/a&gt;. 

In the 1980s, a split occurred between conservative and liberal factions resulting in the "RLDS" which subsequently renamed itself the "Community of Christ" and which up to recent times has been uncontested as the legal successor to the original RLDS church, and the Restoration Branches, a scattered group of local churches who became separate from the main organization in protest of what they saw as incorrect changes to fundamental doctrines. 

Many members of Restoration Branches believe they have been disenfranchised in church government by the Community of Christ, citing the rights of branches listed in the ♡❤Articles of Incorporation of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.♡❤ (1872) They argue that the methods employed to institute a policy called "Supreme Directional Control" violated the branches and individual members rights to voice and vote in the deliberative assemblies of church government.

It was confirmed by the shows host &lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Walters"&gt;Barbara Walters&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday's show who said that Goldberg will begin to co-host on September 4, the shows season premiere. Shortly after the announcement, Goldberg made an appearance on the show.

"I love this show! I love coming on it. I love hanging out with you guys," said Goldberg who also said that she does not plan to have a feud with any of the other co-hosts.

"Who knows? Anybody could say 'I don't like her.' That's OK. I just won't come to your home," added Goldberg.

When O'Donnell co-hosted ♡❤The View♡❤, she sparked a feud with &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; after O'Donnell called Trump a "pimp" in her personal blog by saying that Trump "has no right to be the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America."

Goldberg has starred in such films as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Color%20Purple%20%28film%29"&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1985), ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGhost%20%28film%29"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (1990) and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASister%20Act"&gt;Sister Act&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ One and Two (1992 &amp; 1993)

An advertisement for &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, posted on the internet by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAs-Sahab"&gt;As-Sahab&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ propaganda campaign for al-Qaeda, has warned of a "big surprise" by the terrorist group.

The ad reportedly shows digitally altered images of &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan's&lt;/a&gt; President, &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, in front of the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, which happens to be on fire in the background and a U.S. presidential motorcade is also in the background. Images of &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al%20Zawahri"&gt;Ayman al Zawahri&lt;/a&gt; are also flashed across the advertisement.

The message then says "wait for the big surprise," but does not add anymore information. It ends with a simple "Soon -- God willing."

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n expedition &lt;a href="w%3AArktika%202007"&gt;Arktika 2007&lt;/a&gt; made the first descent to the ocean bottom below the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Pole"&gt;North Pole&lt;/a&gt;, and planted a titanium flag of Russia on the seabed.

Submarines have in the past traveled below the Arctic ice cap, but this is the first time man has reached the seabed below the North Pole. The Mir-1 and a second Mir-2 submarine face the challenge of diving 13,980 feet (4,261 metres) deep, and then having to resurface at the exact location where they've submerged, because they are not strong enough to penetrate the ice themselves. The nuclear ice-breaker vessel Rossiya is keeping the ice open for the research ship and the submarines.

The expedition ship Akademik Fyodorov is carrying over 100 scientists to the North Pole. "Apart from the purely scientific goal of a comprehensive study of the climate and seabed at the North Pole, this expedition may help Russia to enlarge its territory by more than one million square kilometers," the Russia's &lt;a href="w%3AArctic%20and%20Antarctic%20Research%20Institute"&gt;Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; said. The mini-submarine Mir-1 has successfully reached the Arctic seabed. "Our mission is to remind the whole world that Russia is a great polar and research power," said expedition leader and deputy speaker of the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Duma"&gt;Russian parliament&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArtur%20Chilingarov"&gt;Artur Chilingarov&lt;/a&gt;, who has been named presidential envoy to the Arctic by Russian President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Political reactions</h2>
Some Western politicians have portrayed the planting of Russia's flag on the seabed as Russia's territorial claim. &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; (through &lt;a href="w%3AGreenland"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;) have an &lt;a href="w%3AExclusive%20Economic%20Zone"&gt;Exclusive Economic Zone&lt;/a&gt; 200 miles north of their Arctic coastline, established under international laws. Russia is claiming a larger area, extending to the North Pole, saying that a continental shelf called the &lt;a href="w%3ALomonosov%20Ridge"&gt;Lomonosov Ridge&lt;/a&gt; runs from Siberia on the Arctic seabed to the North Pole. As such, it would be an extension of Russian territory.

In 2001, Russia made a case with the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; to extend its boundaries to the Arctic, but the U.N. requested more scientific data to strengthen the Russian case. The current mission is collecting evidence to submit another request in 2009, under the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Convention%20on%20the%20Law%20of%20the%20Sea"&gt;UN Convention on the Law of the Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Canada and Denmark last year sent out a joint mission to establish whether the Lomonosov Ridge is connected to their territories, and Norway is investigating this possibility too. Last May, U.S. senator &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Lugar"&gt;Richard Lugar&lt;/a&gt; (Rep, Indiana) said that it would be difficult to negotiate about Russia's claims as long as the U.S. has not ratified the Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASergey%20Lavrov"&gt;Sergey Lavrov&lt;/a&gt; said that any issues about Russia's claims would be resolved "in strict compliance with international law."

The claimed territory could contain undiscovered natural resources such as oil and gas, media sources speculate.

The actor has been found guilty on 15 counts of downloading . A jury of four women and seven men took two hours and forty minutes to reach a verdict at Crown Court. Judge Philip Statman said that Langham will remain in custody till his sentencing on September 14.

Langham, 58, from , claimed that he had been studying porn sites, researching for a character called, "Pedro," for the television series ♡❤♡❤. However, co-star claimed he had no knowledge of this research. Langham refused to answer questions about certain images found on his computer.

During his time in court, Langham claimed that he was abused at the age of eight during a holiday to . He also said his brothers and sisters were abused, and that he felt no shame at looking at child pornography. Langham said he pleaded not guilty because he did not want to be labelled a, "Paedophile".

Langham however was cleared of charges of indecently assaulting an underage girl. The girl claimed that Langham took her virginity at the age of 14, but Judge Statman said, "The Crown accepts that there is no evidence to support these particular counts on the indictment."

Langham said, in a statement read out by his solicitor, "I am absolutely delighted my name has been cleared of all the charges I have consistently denied. I have been found guilty on charges I have made admission to from the moment of my first arrest. I am grateful to the jury for their careful deliberation and I would also like to thank the press for their restraint in not making the lives of my wife, children and family difficult during this time and I implore them to continue to grant my family the privacy they need. I am afraid I am unable to comment further until sentence on the 14 September."

Derek Cuff, Deputy Inspector of Kent Police said, "Let us not forget that child abuse images circulating on the internet are real situations involving real children, who are sexually abused for other's gain and self-gratification. Viewing such images simply perpetuates child abuse. The jury had to view some images that had to be selected carefully - but what they saw and heard in evidence is harrowing and disturbing. I think this itself puts some measure of perspective on the level of child abuse we are dealing with."

This will affect the filming of the next series of the ♡❤♡❤, where Langham plays Hugh Abbot MP. The last two special episodes did not star Langham due to his arrest. Writer hoped that if Langham was found not guilty, he would be able to appear in his show again.

The third annual conference for users of the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; projects, &lt;a href="w%3AWikimania"&gt;♡❤Wikimania♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, began today in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. Over 1,100 people registered from 98 countries. Fifty-five percent of attendees were from Taiwan. There are over 100 presenters holding a total of 65 sessions.

&lt;a href="w%3AFlorence%20Devouard"&gt;Florence Devouard&lt;/a&gt;, Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, in the opening to the conference, reviewed what has been accomplished in the past year. Among the accomplishments are the creation of the Wikimedia Taiwan chapter, and the creation of &lt;a href="w%3AWikiversity"&gt;Wikiversity&lt;/a&gt;. Florence also said that the Russian Wikipedia was the fastest growing Wikipedia, with the Chinese Wikipedia coming second. There still is huge disparity in language though, with projects such as the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrikaans"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt; Wikipedia having 6 million native speakers, but less than 8,000 articles

An estimation of the current total assets of the foundation was stated to be around $3.5 million. Florence Devouard also discussed the need for scalable sources of revenue for the foundation. These sources, she stressed, must be consistent with the foundation's non profit status, with the &lt;a href="FLOSS"&gt;open/free content movement&lt;/a&gt; and with community wishes. Potential revenue sources include the continued sale of live datafeeds, a print on demand service, board games, puzzles and other merchandising. She stated that the foundation will not sell DVDs or paper versions due to legal risks.

Also, Jimmy Wales, in the press conference, mentioned that in mainland &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, lots of media or information is still unfree or not to be unveiled, such as Baido.com, so that may restrict the development or providing of freely contents and correct information, and is surely not a good example. And then he'll come to visit mainland China to solve those problems of freely contents developments.

Other speakers included &lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Mako%20Hill"&gt;Benjamin Mako Hill&lt;/a&gt; discussing the definition of free culture, Kat Walsh on Wikimedia foundation use of free content, Samuel Klein on the &lt;a href="w%3AOLPC"&gt;one laptop per child&lt;/a&gt; and addressing systemic bias, &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Beesley"&gt;Angela Beesley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGil%20Penchina"&gt;Gil Penchina&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AWikia"&gt;Wikia&lt;/a&gt;.

Richard Stanek addressed reporters in a news conference on Friday morning, officially revising the death toll from the &lt;a href="w%3AI-35W%20Mississippi%20River%20bridge%23Collapse"&gt;collapse of the I-35W bridge&lt;/a&gt; to five, up from four. This fifth victim was pulled from the wreckage of a tractor trailer rig which had been engulfed in flame.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ABloomberg%20L.P."&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; the number of missing persons is currently eight.

Later that night, &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Olbermann"&gt;Keith Olbermann&lt;/a&gt; reported that the toll has risen again to six. This victim died after having been hospitalized.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Society%20of%20Civil%20Engineers"&gt;American Society of Civil Engineers&lt;/a&gt; (ASCE), in its 2005 report card said that the $59.4 billion spent annually to improve transportation infrastructure condition is well below the $94 billion needed.

<h1>US stock markets fall amid credit fears</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20stock%20markets%20fall%20amid%20credit%20fears&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; fell more than 280 points, Friday, to 13181.91, just two weeks after soaring to a historic record of 14,000. Two other major indexes, the &lt;a href="w%3ANasdaq"&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20and%20Poor%20500"&gt;Standard and Poor 500&lt;/a&gt;, fell more than 2% in a widespread market sell-off. 

Shares of &lt;a href="w%3ABear%20Stearns"&gt;Bear Stearns&lt;/a&gt;, the largest &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; underwriter of mortgage bonds, fell 6.3% today, resulting from &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20and%20Poor%27s"&gt;Standard and Poor's&lt;/a&gt; altering its outlook toward the company to "negative" from "stable". The investment banking firm recently saw two of its major hedge funds sink after exposure to the sub-prime mortgage decline. Standard and Poor's report said the firm may have problems, including its hedge funds, that could hurt the firm "for an extended period."

The company held a press conference at noon, but was unable to salvage its stock, leading to heavy losses in the rest of the financial sector. Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro remarked that the credit market was in the worst condition he had seen in 22 years. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Express"&gt;American Express&lt;/a&gt; shares fell 5.6%, while homebuilder &lt;a href="w%3AHovnanian%20Enterprises"&gt;Hovnanian Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; fell 9.4% in the sell-off which impacted all the indexes. 
&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Home%20Mortgage"&gt;American Home Mortgage Investment Corporation&lt;/a&gt; shares fell 52.07% in the session after announcing plans to close most operations and lay off over 6000 employees. The company has also lost its lending license in four states including New York.

"It is with great sadness that American Home has had to take this action," Chief Executive Michael Strauss said in a statement. "Unfortunately, the market conditions in both the secondary mortgage market as well as the national real estate market have deteriorated to the point that we have no realistic alternative."

Analysts say that the weakness in the stock markets and economy in general could prompt the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; to lower interest rates, consequently allowing inflation to rise, but that it would also support stocks and ease borrowing. The Fed has not changed interest rates since June 2006.

Bai Yun, a &lt;a href="w%3AGiant%20panda"&gt;Giant Panda&lt;/a&gt;, has given birth Friday at the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Zoo"&gt;San Diego Zoo&lt;/a&gt;, after two and a half hours in labor. After birth, the cub was immediately taken into the arms of its mother. 

Bai Yun has had three other cubs, Hua Mei, 1999, Mei Sheng, 2003, and &lt;a href="w%3ASu%20Lin"&gt;Su Lin&lt;/a&gt;, 2005.

The newborn cub's gender is not yet known - zookeepers want to avoid going close to the cub for a few days, and are watching on a closed-circuit camera. 

While Bai Yun has been relatively fertile in captivity, other animals have had difficulty mating. Since these pandas possess extremely low hormonal desires for sex, scientists in China have recently developed a method involving "panda porn" to induce the animals into mating. 

Bai Yun, however, seems to be getting along just fine, producing her previous two cubs with a male panda named Gao Gao.

Dr. Ron Swaisgood, who helped deliver the newest cub, has said that “Gao Gao is a very proficient mater.”

A body found in the &lt;a href="w%3ACradle%20Mountain"&gt;Cradle Mountain&lt;/a&gt; national park on the 2nd of August has yet to be recovered because of rough weather in the winter months. A recovery begun on Thursday the 2 August was discontinued because of unfavourable weather conditions. 

It is assumed that the body is that of Kasper Sorensen, who went missing on the 5th of July while trying to hike up to the summit. The body was found in an area already searched by rescuers for the tourist, but the area was previously covered in thick snow with heavy storms.
Mr Sorensen was a &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; tourist backpacking around &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; as part of a half year round the world holiday.

Inspector Brian Edmonds from the &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3ATasmanian%20Police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; said to &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20Radio"&gt;ABC Radio&lt;/a&gt;, that when retrieved the body will have to be formally identified by the coroner, but the method of identification will depend on the coroner's decision.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%20spacecraft"&gt;Phoenix spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; has launched from the &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station"&gt;Cape Canaveral Air Force Station&lt;/a&gt;, atop a &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20II"&gt;Delta II&lt;/a&gt; 7925 rocket, on the first leg of its mission to land on &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;. Lift-off occurred from &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2017"&gt;LC-17A&lt;/a&gt;, at 5:26:34 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEDT"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-4"&gt;UTC-4&lt;/a&gt;). The spacecraft separated from its carrier rocket about 85 minutes after launch.

The mission is the first in NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AMars%20Scout"&gt;Mars Scout&lt;/a&gt; program. It was originally scheduled to launch on August 3, but was delayed 24 hours due to a weather concern preventing second stage fueling on August 1.

&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; drivers &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; will start from top of &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Hungarian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; race tomorrow at the &lt;a href="w%3AHungaroring"&gt;Hungaroring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABudapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;.

Exactly as it was in the &lt;a href="McLaren%20Mercedes%20drivers%20will%20start%20from%20top%20of%202007%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Monaco Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year Alonso stayed in the shadow of his young companion, but at the end of the third he made a successful flying lap on a fresh tyres and won the pole for tomorrow beating Hamilton only by 0.107 of a second.

There was some controversy over this achievement, as Hamilton was unable to start his final lap when Alonso, for unclear reasons, remained standing still at the pit for several seconds after his pit stop finished, with Hamilton forced to wait behind him.

&lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt; surprised the spectators by beating &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; driver.

Ferrari itself got poor results - &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; suffered a car problem, his engine stalled at the far end of the pit-lane, he was unable to compete in the final qualifying session and will start only 14th.

The weekend started reminiscent of the espionage allegation scandal between McLaren and Ferrari teams, when Alonso was freed up from the FIA's official press conference.

<h1>Asian monsoon rains force millions to flee</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Asian%20monsoon%20rains%20force%20millions%20to%20flee&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Torrential &lt;a href="w%3Amonsoon"&gt;monsoon&lt;/a&gt; rains for the past 11 days have inundated parts of Southeast Asia, heavily flooding areas of &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; and affecting over 20 million people. 

An estimated 1,400 have been killed across the region, as waterborne diseases have proliferated and become highly virulent in the humid and wet conditions. 

The United Nations Children's Fund, &lt;a href="w%3AUNICEF"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt;, is currently providing relief to affected areas. 

<h2>India</h2>
In the Northern Indian states of &lt;a href="w%3ABihar"&gt;Bihar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUttar%20Pradesh"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, as many as 12.5 million people have been displaced or affected by flooding. Clashes with police in Bihar have left 20 villagers injured and one man dead, since many are staging protests after being forced from their homes. UNICEF estimates as many as 1,103 may have died in 138 districts throughout northern India. 

Hospitals are reaching dangerous volumes as disease is sickening thousands. Many are ill from dehydration, exposure and dysentery. 

Aid workers warn that &lt;a href="malaria"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; is a serious risk. 

The Indian Air Force began dropping aid packages containing medical supplies and food yesterday.

Santosh Mishra, a villager in the Gondra district of Uttar Pradesh remarked, "I have not seen such flooding in the last 24 years." Bodies of two students of the &lt;a href="w%3AIIM%20Indore"&gt;IIM Indore&lt;/a&gt; swept in the flash floods in &lt;a href="w%3AIndore"&gt;Indore&lt;/a&gt; were recovered.

<h2>Nepal</h2>
UNICEF reported that 84 people have died and some 270,000 people have been displaced by floods and landslides in 32 districts in the last two weeks. Flood waters this year have remained stationary, and are not flowing as in the past, they also said. This could lead to landslides and further damage to thousands of poorly constructed adobe homes. Thousands of acres of agricultural land have already been destroyed. 

Clean water, is a primary concern, as much of the water has been contaminated with disease.

<h2>Bangladesh</h2>
Flooding has affected 41 of its 64 districts. The Associate Press reports that over 5 million have been displaced and that 46 have died. 

The capital, &lt;a href="w%3ADhaka"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;, has seen some flooding, but officials fear that soon the city will be completely inundated since torrential rains show no sign of abating. 

<h2>Relief efforts</h2>
UNICEF is working with the governments of affected nations to coordinate aid, providing water purification tablets, emergency medical supplies, and various MRE's (Meals Ready to Eat). The Nepalese ministry of finance has released additional funds for continued aid work. 

The conditions in the region do not seem promising, since more rain is forecast Saturday, and early next week.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Brazil%20to%20invest%20US%20%243.6bn%20on%20slums&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; on Friday announced a &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20real"&gt;R$&lt;/a&gt; 6.86 billion (about &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;3.6 billion) investment to bring running water, roads, improved housing, sewage and other services to the so-called &lt;a href="w%3AFavela"&gt;favelas&lt;/a&gt;, or metropolitan slum areas in 13 states of his country. 

According to the President, it is the first time a project aimed at the "biggest degradation focuses" becomes part of the Brazilian political culture. The federal government would contribute 5.9 billion Reais (3.14 billion USD), the rest would come from local governments. The total program would involve 504 billion Reais (268 billion USD).

Last January, the second government of President Lula announced the ♡❤Program for the Acceleration of Growth♡❤ (PAC in the portuguese acronym). "This phase of the PAC has three aspects: environmental, public health, with the decrease of illnesses, and income, improving the incomes of the population of those cities," explained the President's Chief of Cabinet, Dilma Rousseff. 

The project is also aimed at weakening the grip of drug traffickers and other criminal organizations on life in the slums. "If the state doesn't fulfill its role and does not provide (adequate) conditions for the people, drug traffickers and organized crime will. So we want to compete with organized crime, and we are sure that we will beat it when we manage to bring benefits to the poorest places," President Lula da Silva said last month in &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Bernardo%20do%20Campo"&gt;São Bernardo do Campo&lt;/a&gt;, just days after 19 were killed in clashes between police and criminals in a slum.

Last month, the state security chief of &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; said that the shantytowns were "at the mercy of a parallel state, where criminals dictate their will," pledging to conduct more police raids to counter this trend. In a speech in Rio de Janeiro in July, the President acknowledged the difficulties fighting the organized crime: "We have to confront (gangs) knowing that many times they are better prepared than the police, with more modern guns than the police."

In Rio de Janeiro alone, 20% of the city's population, or 1.5 million inhabitants, are estimated to live in one of the 752 favelas.

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Beckham"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Galaxy"&gt;Los Angeles Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; will miss his scheduled &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Soccer"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt; debut tomorrow when the Galaxy will face &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20FC"&gt;Toronto FC&lt;/a&gt;.

Beckham signed a five year contract with the Galaxy in January 2007, but due to injuries, was only able to play for 12 minutes so far in a friendly match against the &lt;a href="w%3AFA%20Premier%20League"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20FC"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. 

On June 6, he sprained his left ankle in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20football%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;'s game against &lt;a href="w%3AEstonia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;. Four days later, Beckham pulled several ligaments while he played for &lt;a href="w%3AReal%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; in the team's final game of the season on June 17. At the time of the accident, he was on three injections of painkillers. Teammate &lt;a href="w%3ALandon%20Donovan"&gt;Landon Donovan&lt;/a&gt; said about Beckham's ankle, "When he got here, it was like a balloon."

Beckham was greeted by about 20 video cameras and 100 media at a news conference in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. He handled all 13 questions in stride, deflecting fan criticism by stating that he would be with the Galaxy for five more years.

Ever since the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Government"&gt;Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to take over funding of the Mersey hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ADevonport%2C%20Tasmania"&gt;Devonport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, the state government and some federal MPs have criticised this act as a stunt in the prelude to the federal election to be called by November.

But Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has said the act was only to safeguard the facilities of the hospital from being downgraded by the Tasmanian government, in giving an extra AUD$45 million.

The &lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;n government has slammed the takeover as only intended to win votes for the marginal seat of &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Braddon%20%28state%29"&gt;Braddon&lt;/a&gt;, and that a takeover of the 600 hospitals is unrealistic as they would soon turn into a farcical state. 

Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; of the greens for Tasmania has said the action was only a vote buying ploy and that there was no consultation with medical personnel or plan on how to spend the money.

&lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; wins the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Hungarian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AHungaroring"&gt;Hungaroring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABudapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;.

After the &lt;a href="McLaren%20Mercedes%20drivers%20snatch%20the%20front%20row%20for%202007%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;pole-position of his teammate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; was discarded to 6th place by the stewards overnight for a non-sporting behaviour of Alonso's unusual 20 seconds delay on his last pit stop, Hamilton became the leader on the starting grid. Also, McLaren faced another penalty of not scoring any points in the Constructors' Championship, which will be appealed later, team spokesman says.

Leading from start to finish, Hamilton was under heavy pressure from &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;. The Finn was able to come very close to McLaren rooky, but not to overtake him finishing second.

&lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt; started second from the dirty side of the track allowing Kimi to pass him easily enough. German driver made a clear race upon the near finish where he was under heavy pressure from Alonso, but remained in his third place while Alonso himself jumped to the fourth from the 6th starting place. This became the second podium finish for Nick on &lt;a href="w%3AHungarian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Hungarian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;.

Unlucky race for &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;, Kimi's teammate, who suffered a problems earlier in qualification not fully able to compete in the race also (13th place).

Second BMW driver, Poland &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; finished fifth ahead of &lt;a href="w%3ARalf%20Schumacher"&gt;Ralf Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AToyota%20F1"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANico%20Rosberg"&gt;Nico Rosberg&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamsF1"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt;-Toyota and &lt;a href="w%3AHeikki%20Kovalainen"&gt;Heikki Kovalainen&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ARenaultF1"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; teams with Heikki closing top eight.

A man from the east &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n city of was force-fed 50 bananas, after he swallowed a gold necklace he stole worth around 45,000 ($1,110).

Sheikh Mohsin, 36, stole the necklace from a businessman's wife whilst she was toy shopping. When arrested, he denied he stole the necklace, but an proved that necklace was inside him. In an attempt to get the necklace back, doctors advised the police to feed him bananas, saying they would act as a .

Mohsin was fed 50 bananas, but the laxative effect failed to take place. The police then fed him rice, chicken and bread. He was x-rayed twice during the day, and it was not until the fifth attempt when the necklace was finally excreted.

A sweeper was paid 50 rupees ($1) for recovering the necklace from the toilet, and Mohsin was forced to clean it. Moshin pled for release but this was refused. He will be put in court in Kolkata on August 6, where he could face up to three months imprisonment for "snatching".

&lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20Hill"&gt;Oliver Hill&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; Civil Rights lawyer died today at the age of 100. Hill was attending breakfast, when he died "peacefully," said a friend of Hill's family, Joseph Morrissey. The cause is not yet known.

"As a pioneer for civil rights, an accomplished attorney, and a war veteran, Mr. Hill's dedication to serving the commonwealth and the country never failed," said &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Governor, &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Kaine"&gt;Tim Kaine&lt;/a&gt; in a statement released to the press.

Hill won African American teachers the right to have equal pay in 1940, which was the first civil rights case he won in his career.

He was also the first African American to be elected to the city council in &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Richmond, Virginia&lt;/a&gt; in 1948. 
Hill also filed several lawsuits against racial segregation in the U.S. public school systems in 1954. Those lawsuits later became as the '&lt;a href="w%3ABrown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education"&gt;Brown vs. Board&lt;/a&gt;' which overturned laws dating back to 1896 which ruled that separate schools for &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;African Americans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20American"&gt;White Americans&lt;/a&gt; were "unequal."

This new twist is expected to make them feel guilt and shame and prevent them from repeating the offense, no matter how minor. ♡❤(Hello) Kitty♡❤ is a cute icon for young girls. It's not something macho police officers want covering their biceps. This is to help build discipline. We should not let small offences go unnoticed."

At least six miners are trapped approximately 1700 feet underground in a &lt;a href="w%3Acoal"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; mine in &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; after portions of the shaft collapsed. The mine is owned by Utah American Energy and is close to the town of Huntington, Emery County, 160 km south of Salt Lake City.

Robert Murray, The CEO, President, Director and owner of Murray Energy and the owner of Utah American Energy, said during a press conference at 5:00 p.m. (eastern time), an "&lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; caused the collapse at about 3:00 a.m. (mountain time)." 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) recorded what is allegedly a &lt;a href="w%3Amagnitude"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 3.9 earthquake at 2:48 a.m. (mountain time) on Monday morning 21 km (13 miles) east, southeast of &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Pleasant%2C%20Utah"&gt;Mount Pleasant, Utah&lt;/a&gt;, but the director of the USGS seismology stations Walter Arabasz, says that no earthquake caused the collapse.

Murray states that at least "two mining machines will be brought in to clean out the debris" at the beginning of the collapse and that he will "spare no expense" in rescuing the men.

"We have four rescue teams working to free the trapped miners. We will try four ways to get to the miners which include drilling 1,700 feet from the top of the mountain. We will also drill a hole" in a neighboring mine shaft sealed in 2004 after it was finished being mined that is "about 100 feet from the miners."

A capacity crowd in &lt;a href="w%3AWacker%20Arena"&gt;Wacker Arena&lt;/a&gt; saw Bayern Munich beat Wacker Burghausen in a shootout to advance to the 2 Round of this season's DFB Cup.

Bayern Munich pour shot after shot on Wacker Burghausen's goalkeeper ,Manuel Riemann, only to see the 3 Division club take the lead in the 61 Minute when Wacker Burghausen striker, Thomas Neubert, looped a header over Oliver Kahn.

Just 17 seconds had passed when Ribery took a shot that missed by inches . Riemann made his first save from Altintop on three minutes, However, almost gave Burghausen the lead when Hungarian midfielder Levente Schultz forced Oliver Kahn into a save near the post.
<h2>Quotations</h2>
♡❤♡Ottmar Hitzfeld:♡❤♡ ”We basically played well. We played convincing football and made further progress. The problem was wastefulness. Sometimes we were unlucky, and sometimes we were denied by an outstanding Manuel Riemann. Compliments to Burghausen, they played above themselves, they were totally motivated, quick, aggressive, and they kept our defenders busy too. It was a cracking tie with everything you want from the Cup. But the match also showed we still have a lot of work to do. We have to do a lot more than simply turn up, even the last doubter must be convinced of that by now.“

♡❤♡Oliver Kahn:♡❤♡ “All I’ve been doing for the last 14 years is remain focused until I’m needed. Obviously, you’re always pleased when you save a couple of penalties. Wacker fought till they dropped, but I have to say I saw a fantastic Bayern team, playing fantastic football, but failing to put away its chances.“

♡❤♡Philipp Lahm:♡❤♡ “It was decent stuff from us. We created any number of chances and we were very solid at the back, but it’s always hard work when you fail to take your chances.“

♡❤♡Mark Van Bommel:♡❤♡ “We weren’t great, but we weren’t bad either. You normally lose matches where you have 20 shots but none of them goes in. Young Riemann was lucky in that we kept shooting at him, and when we didn’t, we hit the bar or the post.“

♡❤♡Ingo Anderbrügge (Wacker coach):♡❤♡ “I don’t see it in a negative light at all. Obviously you’re disappointed after you’ve been one penalty away from a massive upset. My lads showed we have a decent team again. I’m proud of the way they managed to match Bayern for so long. That’ll give us confidence for the league. Manuel Riemann is a pretty sorted guy for his age, he could have a bright future ahead of him.“

♡❤♡Manuel Riemann (Wacker keeper):♡❤♡ “Disappointment is the main emotion at the moment, because we were so close to a miracle. But I want to praise the team for the fight we put up.”

The &lt;a href="w%3AAcademic%20Ranking%20of%20World%20Universities"&gt;Academic Ranking of World Universities&lt;/a&gt; was published for 2007 by &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai%20Jiao%20Tong%20University"&gt;Shanghai Jiao Tong University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. This year the top four universities are &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%20Berkeley"&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Cambridge"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, compared to last year Cambridge has slipped from second to fourth place with the order of the top three &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; universities unchanged.

The league tables began in 2003 as an effort to measure the gap between Chinese and "World class" universities. In 2007 the highest ranking Chinese University is &lt;a href="w%3ATsinghua%20University"&gt;Tsinghua University&lt;/a&gt; at equal 151–202nd place, an improvement from 201–250th place in 2003.

The ranking takes account of factors such as the number of &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize"&gt;Nobel laureates&lt;/a&gt;, highly cited authors and publications in the journals of &lt;a href="w%3ANature_%28journal%29"&gt;♡❤Nature♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20%28journal%29"&gt;♡❤Science♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. Its authors admit that the methodology is skewed towards science over arts and humanities and favours English speaking countries. In the top 19 all are from the U.S. except Oxford and Cambridge from the UK, with &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; at 20th the first university from a non-English speaking country.

<h1>Largest exoplanet so far is discovered</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Largest%20exoplanet%20so%20far%20is%20discovered&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The largest or exoplanet has been discovered orbiting the star , around 1,435 light years away. The planet, named , after the (TrES) is 1.7 times the size of the planet . TrES-4 also has a lower mass than Jupiter and an extremely low of 0.2 grams per cubic centimetre, which is less than a wine cork. Georgi Mandushev of the &lt;a href="w%3ALowell%20Observatory"&gt;Lowell Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; said, "It's way lower than the density of water."

TrES-4 orbits its star at a distance of only 7 million km (4.5 million miles), meaning that the temperature of the planet is estimated at 1,327°&lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt; (approximately 1,600&lt;a href="w%3AKelvin"&gt;K&lt;/a&gt; or 2,300°&lt;a href="w%3AFarenheit"&gt;F&lt;/a&gt;).

Mandushev went on to say, "Because of the planet's relatively weak pull on its upper atmosphere, some of the atmosphere probably escapes in a comet-like tail."

Due to the planet's size, current theories about superheated giant planets find it hard to explain why it is so large. Francis O'Donovan, a graduate student in astronomy at the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; which operates one of the TrES telescopes said, "We continue to be surprised by how relatively large these giant planets can be. But if we can explain the sizes of these bloated planets in their harsh environments, it may help us better understand our own Solar System planets and their formation."

The parents of the missing girl &lt;a href="w%3AMadeleine%20McCann"&gt;Madeleine McCann&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; are now reported to be the main suspects in her disappearance and death after the finding of blood samples from a "deceased person" were found in the vacation apartment where Madeleine was staying, the night she was reported to have disappeared from the Praia da Luz resort on May 3.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADiario%20de%20Noticias"&gt;Diario de Noticias&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, says that Madeleine died "accidentally" inside her parent's apartment while asleep and that she was sleeping with her brothers. It is also reported that someone had attempted to clean up the blood stains inside the apartment.

Traces of "almost invisible" blood were discovered by police dogs and detectives using ultraviolet lights. Police are attempting to run a &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; analysis on the blood, but have not confirmed or denied that the blood is Madeleine's.

The newspaper also states that authorities are asking for some family members and friends close to Madeleine to come back to Portugal and be interviewed by police.

Despite the newspaper's claims, Madeleine's parents, Gerry and Kate McCann denied all reports and accusations that they were suspects in Madeleine's disappearance. Portuguese police also deny the reports.

"The family are not suspects. This is the official position," said a spokesman for the Portuguese police, Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa.

"We're not naive, but on numerous occasions the Portuguese police have assured us they were looking for Madeleine alive and not Madeleine having been murdered. I don't know of any information that's changed that," said Mr. McCann with his wife Kate adding, "Last week when we met with the police they said, 'We are looking for a living child.' It is not us who committed the crime, but people will always criticize."

A giant, smiling man was fished out of the sea in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; resort of on Tuesday. Workers at a drinks stall recovered the 2.5-metre (8-foot) tall toy which had a yellow head and a blue body.

"We saw something bobbing about in the sea and we decided to take it out of the water. It was a life-sized Lego toy," said one worker at the stand. At least one witness says that the toy came from the direction of &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.

Upon his chest are the words 'No Real Than You Are', the meaning of which is still unknown, but one website says that the giant toy is a promotional stunt for an artist by the name of Ego Leonard who is believed to be "aiming to document small pieces of beauty from round the world."

It seems the giant toy was built for "Dance Valley" http://www.egoleonard.com/dancevalley/dancevalley.html . It is not known how he ended up in the sea, but has since been placed on display at the drink stand.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGlasgow"&gt;Glascow&lt;/a&gt; club will find out their next opponents on Wednesday, when &lt;a href="w%3AFK%20Crvena%20Zvezda"&gt;Crvena Zvezda&lt;/a&gt; play &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Levadia%20Tallinn"&gt;Levadia Tallinn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATallinn"&gt;Tallinn&lt;/a&gt;. Crvena Zvezda won the 1 leg 1-0.

&lt;a href="w%3ADinamo%20Zagreb"&gt;Dinamo Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; will play &lt;a href="w%3AWerder%20Bremen"&gt;Werder Bremen&lt;/a&gt; in the 3 Qualifying Round after beating &lt;a href="w%3ANK%20Dom%C5%BEale"&gt;NK Domžale&lt;/a&gt; 5-2 on aggregate in the second qualifying round.

&lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Copenhagen"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3ABeitar%20Jerusalem"&gt;Beitar Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; in extra time to advance to face &lt;a href="w%3ABenfica"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt; of Portugal. &lt;a href="w%3AMarcus%20Allb%C3%A4ck"&gt;Marcus Allbäck&lt;/a&gt; scored the goal to send the Danish side through.

&lt;a href="w%3ATampere%20United"&gt;Tampere United&lt;/a&gt; of Finland will compete in the third qualifying round of UEFA Champions League for the first time after beating &lt;a href="w%3ALevski%20Sofia"&gt;Levski Sofia&lt;/a&gt; 2-0 on aggregate.

Korean government announced the second summit between the two divided &lt;a href="w%3AKorea"&gt;Koreas&lt;/a&gt; will be held on Aug. 28. For the summit, Roh, president of South Korea will visit the North Korean capital for three days.

North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency also announced at the same time that the two Koreas are to hold a preparing meeting of the summit in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. 

The two countries last held the first summit in June 2000, when Mr. Kim met then South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung in Pyongyang. The two nations remain technically at war because their 1950s conflict ended only in a truce. This summit is expected to make an end of the state of the war.

The ♡❤Encyclopædia Britannica♡❤, first published in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in , has been critical about Wikipedia in the past due to the way it is written. Whilst the ♡❤Encyclopædia Britannica♡❤ is written by a team of identified contributors, 19 full-time editors and over 4,000 expert contributors, Wikipedia can be written by anyone who has access to an internet connection. The ♡❤Encyclopædia Britannica♡❤ claims that the differences between Wikipedia and ♡❤Encyclopedia Britannica♡❤s editorial policies make ♡❤Encyclopedia Britannica♡❤ more accurate than Wikipedia.

One study carried out by the news department of the scientific journal ♡❤♡❤, a study of 42 selected science articles showed that Wikipedia had 162 errors, whilst the ♡❤Encyclopædia Britannica♡❤ had 123. The ♡❤Encyclopædia Britannica♡❤ responded by saying that the study was misleading because certain articles were not taken from the Encyclopædia, some articles were combinations of several articles, others were simply excerpts.

Wikipedia's &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AFeatured%20articles"&gt;featured articles&lt;/a&gt; are to be examples of the site's finest work. Out of over 1.9 million articles that exist as of writing, there are only 1,535 featured articles. These are indicated with a bronze star in the top-right hand corner of the article.

Yesterday &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Giants"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt; LF &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Bonds"&gt;Barry Bonds&lt;/a&gt; hit a 435-foot home run, his 756th, off a pitch from &lt;a href="w%3A%20Mike%20Bacsik"&gt;Mike Bacsick&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Washington%20Nationals"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt;, breaking the all-time career home run record, formerly held by &lt;a href="w%3AHank%20Aaron"&gt;Hank Aaron&lt;/a&gt;.

The pitch, the seventh of the at-bat, was a 3-2 pitch, which Bonds hit into the right-center field bleachers. Matt Murphy, a 22-year-old from &lt;a href="w%3AQueens"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, got the ball and was promptly protected and escorted away from the mayhem by a group of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; police officers.

After Bonds finished his home-run trot, a ten-minute delay in the game marked the occasion. This included a brief video by Aaron congratulating Bonds on breaking the record which Aaron had held for 33 years. An impromptu emotional statement by Bonds on the field, with &lt;a href="w%3AWillie%20Mays"&gt;Willie Mays&lt;/a&gt; at his side, followed.

"I move over now and offer my best wishes to Barry and his family on this historic achievement," said Aaron in his video-taped statement, which was played on the scoreboard.

After the game Bacsik said of Bonds, "He's the greatest of all time ... Giving it up to Barry Bonds is nothing to be ashamed of."

Speculation about banned, performance-enhancing drugs have followed Bonds in recent years. But he said to his critics, "This record is not tainted at all -- at all. Period." He also said to reporters, "You guys can say whatever you want."

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20states%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) a powerful magnitude 7.5 &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; struck &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;'s main island, &lt;a href="w%3AJava"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, at 5:05 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, which is just after midnight locally.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; was located 100 kilometers (65 miles) east of &lt;a href="Jakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; and was at a depth of 289.2 km (179.7 miles). The &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; said that no &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; is expected as the depth of the quake exceeded 280 km.

There are no reports of damage, injuries or deaths.

"No reports of damage or casualties have been received at this time. Because this earthquake is located about 290 km below the surface of the earth, it will have been felt strongly over a wide area, but is not likely to cause severe damage. We have received reports that the earthquake was felt in much of Java and in parts of &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;", said a statement posted on the USGS website.

Preliminary reports by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) say that a magnitude 5.3 &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; has struck &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; at 00:55 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; (8:55 a.m. local time). Other reports say that the magnitude was 5.7.

The epicenter was reported to be 40 kilometers (25 miles) east, northeast of &lt;a href="w%3AKao-hsiung"&gt;Kao-hsiung&lt;/a&gt;, Taiwan at a depth of 35 km (21.7 miles), but the Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan says that the depth was only 5 km.

So far there are no reports of damage, injuries or deaths, but reports say that buildings located in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; swayed and shook during the quake.

Taiwan is currently recovering from &lt;a href="w%3Atropical%20storm"&gt;tropical storm&lt;/a&gt; 'Pabuk' and is expected to be hit by another one named 'Wutip'.

The quake struck just after the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; held its third annual ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikimania"&gt;Wikimania&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ convention in downtown Taipei.

In September of 1999, 2300 people were killed in central Taiwan after a magnitude 7.6 quake. Another quake in 2006 struck just off the shores of Kao-hsiung with a magnitude of 6.7, which severed telephone and internet lines in the sea.

During heavy rainstorms that flooded rail lines and subways, a tornado touched down in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; reports. It sustained winds around 111 mph to 135 mph, causing damage to buildings and vehicles. Starting from the Bay Ridge area, the tornado continued for two miles through &lt;a href="w%3ABrooklyn"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;. At least one person was killed. 

The roof of a &lt;a href="w%3ANissan"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; dealership had been ripped off, as was that of a Brooklyn church. At least 16 homes were damaged. 

Torrential rain had drenched the region early Wednesday, causing delays at Newark, JFK, and LaGuardia airports. Wind and rain caused major slowdowns in the mass transit lines, virtually halting services. 
The brunt of the storm struck the city during morning rush hour, a time when hundreds of thousands of vehicles and people are in transit to work. Police Commissioner &lt;a href="Raymond%20Kelly"&gt;Raymond Kelly&lt;/a&gt; said that in some flooded subways, police resorted to crowd control tactics to stop rioting. 

Trees were torn from the ground and some cars were crushed.

In a damage assessment tour of Brooklyn, Mayor &lt;a href="Michael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; remarked, “I don’t know that God had rush hour in mind when the storms hit.” 

The &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Transit%20Authority"&gt;Metropolitan Transit Authority&lt;/a&gt; expects service to return to normal by Thursday. At a press conference MTA chairman Elliot "Lee" Sander said the pumps located citywide in the rail and subway lines are adequate to handle 1.5 inches of rain per hour. He said the rain, however, came "too fast and with little warning." 

"The storm took us by surprise because it was not predicted by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;."

Investigators say that flaws in the design of the &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2035W%20%28Minnesota%29"&gt;Interstate 35W&lt;/a&gt; bridge in &lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Minneapolis, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; may have caused it to collapse and that the design flaw is not "unique" to the Minneapolis bridge.

According to an ongoing investigation by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; (NTSB), the flaw was found in the &lt;a href="w%3AGusset"&gt;steel plates&lt;/a&gt; connected to &lt;a href="w%3Agirder"&gt;girders&lt;/a&gt;, which are large support beams used in construction and connect the plates together. It is reported that extra stress from construction equipment might have caused the plates to separate, causing the bridge to collapse.

The flaw has not yet been confirmed to be the source of the disaster, and the NTSB says that the investigation could take several months to fully be completed.

At least six people were killed and at least eight are missing, whilst over 100 are injured after the bridge collapsed on August 1.

"Just like they told us that our bridges were safe, they also want us to swallow that our power grid is in no danger of a system-wide, no-power-for-weeks crash", said tenured power grid expert Donald McCormick, a senior contractor with &lt;a href="w%3AHydro%20One"&gt;Hydro One&lt;/a&gt;, an Ontario, Canada based electricity provider.

Mr. McCormick indicated that in reality though, there’s no question that the system of grids that supply power throughout the continent are in much worse shape than the majority of bridges, levees and borders in Canada and U.S. He has over two decades of experience in all aspects of power grid construction, infrastructure, maintenance, and distribution. During a recent interview, Mr. McCormick compared the ten major interconnected power regions that comprise the "North American Grid", to a string of Christmas lights that’s been active non-stop since the 1950s. Mr. McCormick's qualifications include being a licensed red seal interprovincial/interstate electrical engineer and he's worked at numerous power generating stations mainly in Canada, but also across the U.S. He's participated in building regional infrastructure related to both generation and distribution. Additionally, Mr. McCormick is Orange Level qualified as an Atomic Radiation Worker (ARW) registered in Geneva, Switzerland.

Mr. McCormick offered his candid assessment of today’s continental "power grid" by making several observations about this critical, civilization-supporting industry. His power plant experience includes both nuclear and coal, and he’s a certified expert in alternative fuel technologies such as wind, solar and hydrogen. He said that, from nuclear to coal, the majority of power generating plants operating across North America have momentous deficiencies, and the collective 10-region “power grid” has not been maintained properly (across the board) since the 1960s. Population growth has created a state in which North American power consumption is far greater than what is being yielded by current technological capacity to generate consumable energy. Mr. McCormick indicated that the infamous &lt;a href="w%3ANortheast%20Blackout%20of%202003"&gt;August 2003 blackout&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Northeastern U.S., Mid-Eastern U.S. and most of Ontario suffered stifling, life-interrupting blackouts, was just the beginning of something much more significant. In reference to the ♡❤North American Power Grid Initiative♡❤, he said that it’s nothing more than a case of, "too little, too late".

"You’re frequently seeing substandard parts and equipment being employed, on sites across the continent, and being used for sensitive construction projects, often related to components integral to the grid system itself. North American nuclear energy generating plants are among the worst when it comes to safety violations, not only endangering on-site employees with blatant disregard but also literally thousands of people with regard to unregulated, unnoticed pollution and waste being dumped in rivers, lakes and oceans, into the atmosphere and, more specifically, our entire ecosystem," said McCormick.

Mr. McCormick strongly feels that another major breakdown of the grid system may occur by the end of this year, and he further stated that he’s also concerned that domestic power grid system is in grave danger of being undermined by terrorists.

&lt;a href="w%3ALuciano%20Pavarotti"&gt;Luciano Pavarotti&lt;/a&gt;, 71, a world-famous &lt;a href="w%3Aopera"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; singer has been admitted to the hospital due to a high fever. The cause of the fever is currently unknown, however some reports say that he is being treated for &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;. His condition is being reported as stable.

"He [Pavarotti] is currently under observation and his condition is satisfactory," said a spokesman at the Modena University Polyclinic in &lt;a href="w%3AModena"&gt;Modena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. He is reportedly being treated in the hospital's cancer ward and hallways have been blocked off and are being protected by private guards.

Pavarotti was admitted on Wednesday for observation, and the hospital states that he could be released "in the next few days." He was on vacation in &lt;a href="w%3APesaro"&gt;Pesaro&lt;/a&gt;, staying at one of his homes when he fell ill.

Pavarotti had been diagnosed with &lt;a href="w%3Apancreatic%20cancer"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2006 underwent surgery to remove a cancerous mass. According to Nicoletta Mantovani, Pavarotti's wife, he has also been receiving radiation treatments.

"I can now say he is doing well. He's reacting well to a fifth cycle of radiotherapy. He's fighting like a lion and he has never lost his heart, also because a family he adores is by his side," said Mantovani.

After the starting of "Global Human Rights Torch Relay" project in Athens, &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, Epochtimes &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; and Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; (CIPFG) held "Human Rights Torch Relay Night" at 228 Memorial Park, Taipei City in the evening of August 10. In addition to musical performances, the evening show includes an impromptu opera and ending chorus to revealed the problem of human rights at PRC China.

The "Global Human Rights Torch Relay" project was founded by over 300 people from many fields of expertise including politics, human rights, free culture, and medicine. Organized by CIPFG, more than 32 countries and 150 cities and counties echoed this project. This torch of hope symbolized protection of human rights and respect of human life, and also protested the 2008 Olympics held in China without human rights and many unfair discrimination.

The newly-elected Chairman of Taiwan Solidarity Union Kuen-hui Huang criticized Mainland China in oppressing human rights, and international status of Taiwan such as economic, sports, NPO/NGOs, and politics, that couldn't be accepted by many countries ruled by law. He also mentioned that Mainland China hold Olympic Games is surely a sarcasm.

Also, a lawyer of CIPFG said that Mass Media in Taiwan didn't revealed the truth of oppressing human rights in Mainland China and also promoted Beijing 2008 with "We Are Ready" slogan. If they still support Beijing 2008 with those way above, Taiwan will be in a great crisis and no one can see the truth of Mainland China.

After the evening declaration of the "Global Human Rights Torch Relay", CIPFG and Epochtimes Global will launch "World Human Rights" Web and still promote "Global Human Rights Torch Relay" for accepting registration of welcoming the Torch to Taiwan.

A third man has died today from injuries sustained in the crash of an &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Air%20Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AA%C3%A9rospatiale%20Puma"&gt;Aérospatiale Puma&lt;/a&gt; helicopter in the county of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Yorkshire"&gt;North Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this week. Twelve people were on board the aircraft when it crashed near &lt;a href="w%3ACatterick%20Garrison"&gt;Catterick Garrison&lt;/a&gt; army base on Wednesday evening during what is said to have been a routine training exercise.

The man has not been named but is understood to be a soldier from the Infantry Training Battalion at Catterick. Brigadier David Clements of the Commandant Infantry Training Centre said "We are all deeply saddened by the news that one of the recruits involved in Wednesday's helicopter accident has died as a result of the injuries he sustained. His family were with him when he passed away. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this most difficult time." 

Flight Lieutenant David Sale, aged 28, and Sergeant Phillip Burfoot, aged 27, died at the scene of the crash.

Global stock markets fell today, in a mass sell-off stemming from the &lt;a href="w%3ASubprime"&gt;sub-prime mortgage&lt;/a&gt; crisis in the United States. The &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; rebounded late in the day after falling more than 250 points, ending the day down about 31 points. The UK's &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE-100"&gt;FTSE-100&lt;/a&gt; index fell 232.90 points to 6038.30, and Japan's &lt;a href="w%3ANikkei%20225"&gt;Nikkei 225&lt;/a&gt; fell 406.51 points to 16764.09. 

Central banks across the world are injecting funds into their banking systems to add liquidity, fearing that many financial firms with subprime ties will be &lt;a href="w%3Ainsolvent"&gt;insolvent&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday, the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Federal%20Reserve"&gt;U.S. Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; transferred US$24 billion to temporary reserves, following the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Central%20Bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt;, which authorized a record €83.6 billion addition to its banks, its biggest cash infusion ever. On Friday, the Fed entered into a $38 billion repurchase agreement of mortgage-backed securities, easing stockholder worries. Also on Friday, the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Japan"&gt;Bank of Japan&lt;/a&gt; injected ¥1 trillion into Japan's financial system. 

The Federal Reserve met this week, but decided to maintain its target rate of 5.25%, although on Friday the federal funds rate was hovering around 6%, indicating a drop in liquidity. 

The volatile week began last Friday with &lt;a href="w%3ABear%20Stearns"&gt;Bear Stearns&lt;/a&gt; tumbling as a result from its complete loss of two major hedge funds worth more than $1.5 billion. The hedge funds had been dangerously exposed to the massive sub-prime mortgage failure, and the company announced it was unable to return any money to investors. 

&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Mutual"&gt;Washington Mutual&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACountrywide%20Financial"&gt;Countrywide Financial&lt;/a&gt;, both very large U.S. home loan lenders, saw shares fall. Countrywide Financial made a statement this week, saying they will be forced to retain a greater proportion of mortgage. &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Home%20Mortgage%20Investment%20Corp"&gt;American Home Mortgage Investment Corp&lt;/a&gt;, another large lender, recently filed for bankruptcy. The U.S. housing market has been declining for more than two years after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 17 times. Now, lenders are in a quagmire from millions of people who are unable to repay loans after taking adjustable rate mortgages, teaser rates, interest-only mortgages, or piggyback rates. 

&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Cramer"&gt;Jim Cramer&lt;/a&gt;, of CNBC's &lt;a href="w%3AMad%20Money"&gt;Mad Money&lt;/a&gt;, remarked that as many as seven million people will lose their homes from bad mortgages. Last Friday, Cramer went on a tirade on CNBC's &lt;a href="w%3AStreet%20Signs"&gt;Street Signs&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the "&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Fed&lt;/a&gt; was asleep" and called for them to lower rates immediately. 

Asian and European markets have become increasingly entangled in the subprime mortgage crisis in the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ADeutsche%20Bank"&gt;Deutsche Bank&lt;/a&gt; of Germany lost almost $3.5 billion in share value, forcing the government to organize a bail-out. France's largest bank, &lt;a href="w%3ABNP%20Paribas"&gt;BNP Paribas SA&lt;/a&gt;, halted withdrawals from three large investment funds which were crippled by sub-prime exposure.

Eight &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; migrant workers sacked from a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADomino%27s%20Pizza"&gt;Domino's Pizza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; franchise in Derby, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; are said to have taken home virtually no pay for months because of illegal deductions.

The claim is refuted by the company who said in a statement "We have begun a thorough investigation during which we have scrutinised the franchisee's employment practices. This took place with his full co-operation. The franchisee concerned is confident that he possesses the evidence required to refute these allegations. To the extent that we have been informed of all allegations and have reviewed all available evidence, we also believe this to be the case."

The sacked workers are being supported in their claim by the workers union Unite. The union say the "there appeared to be a deliberate strategy of keeping the workers in debt to the company through a series of crippling deductions. The deductions included payments to cover the contract purchase of a car from their employer, insurance for the vehicle provided through their employer, and exorbitant rent for substandard accommodation, again provided through their employer. In addition, some workers had to pay fees of up to £180 for an "introduction" to the company. One worker earned just £5 in four months because of the constant and hefty deductions out of his wage packet. When the workers protested they were sacked."

<h1>'Gouge' found on wing of Space Shuttle Endeavour</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27Gouge%27%20found%20on%20wing%20of%20Space%20Shuttle%20Endeavour&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has stated that a three inch gouge has been found in the heat shield on one of &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Endeavour"&gt;Space Shuttle Endeavour&lt;/a&gt;'s wings. The gouge was spotted as the shuttle approached the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS) and captured on camera by ISS astronauts.

According to NASA, the gouge was found on a six-inch thick tile on the starboard wing of the heat shield and that it may have been caused by ice and not foam. NASA is worried because the hole appears to be deep.

"What does this mean? I don’t know at this point. There are three prongs to our assessment, first we will conduct a thermal analysis based on the damage, check the flight history and test the area. We would never take it lightly to send astronauts to the underside of the vehicle to do anything," said the mission management team chairman, John Shannon who also said that until the damage is inspected, "it's way too early to determine whether any repairs are required."

If the damage is found to be irreversible and cannot be fixed, the crew of Endeavour would stay on the ISS. NASA says that supplies would last until a rescue mission could be launched October 8 by sending up &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;.

During lift off of Endeavour on August 8, cameras had shown moisture which had gathered on the camera's lens, but NASA states that the object which caused the damage was not caught on camera. At least nine pieces of debris were reported to have been filmed while the shuttle took off, but NASA says that only three of those pieces of debris had a possibility of hitting the shuttle.

Astronauts are expected to use a laser that is attached to the shuttle's robotic arm to measure the exact depth and size of the gouge on Sunday. The tile could be repaired by affixing a metal plate over the tile, filling it with putty, or sealing the gouge.

A posting on the internet has stated that &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; is planning a &lt;a href="w%3Adirty%20bomb"&gt;dirty bomb&lt;/a&gt; attack on &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York City, New York&lt;/a&gt; (NYC) in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

In a statement to the press, NYC police stated that the posting was an "unverified radiological threat" against New York City. Police also stated that the city's threat level will remain at "orange" and will not be changed. NYC police have also stepped up security at bridges, tunnels and subways as a precaution.

♡❤Debka.com♡❤ or ♡❤DEBKAfile♡❤, an &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; website, was claiming the that they picked up the threat by "a rush of electronic chatter on al Qaeda sites Thursday, Aug. 8." DEBKA also claims that one of the threats states that "trucks loaded with radio-active material [will be used] against America’s biggest city and financial nerve center." 

The site also claims that other cities such as &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; as targets for dirty bomb attacks.

No date or time has been reported for the attack. On August 2, a terrorist advertisement posted on the internet by the As-Sahab propaganda campaign for al-Qaeda, warned of a coming "big surprise." No date was specified for that claim either.

&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Wilson"&gt;Anthony Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, journalist and record label owner, died of a heart attack on the 10th August, after receiving treatment for cancer.

He died at the Christie Hospital, aged 57 and is survived by his partner, Yvette Livesey. 

Wilson was receiving private medical treatment due to the recommended drug, &lt;a href="w%3ASunitinib"&gt;Sunitinib&lt;/a&gt;, not being available through the publicly funded &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Health%20Service"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt;.

A video has surfaced on the website &lt;a href="w%3ALiveleak"&gt;♡❤LiveLeak.com♡❤&lt;/a&gt; that shows what appears to be more than a dozen &lt;a href="UFO"&gt;Unidentified flying object&lt;/a&gt;s (UFOs) in a &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haitian&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood.

The video was reportedly filmed on August 6 and was uploaded to ♡❤LiveLeak♡❤ on August 10, then hosted on &lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;♡❤YouTube.com♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. It is not known who filmed the alleged UFOs. &lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;♡❤Wikinews♡❤&lt;/a&gt; has attempted to contact the uploader of the video by e-mail, but has not yet received a response.

The beginning of the video appears to show two large UFOs flying over a woman who is taping the objects with a video camera. The objects, shaped like flowers when viewed from the ground, make a faint roaring noise as they pass over. They continue to fly towards a mountain range where they fly in formation to meet up with what look likes to be more than 12 other UFOs. The video then stops. 

One website is dubbing the video as a fake, saying that it's using &lt;a href="w%3AComputer-generated%20imagery"&gt;Computer-generated imagery&lt;/a&gt; (CGI). One image on the website ♡❤AboveTopSecret.com♡❤ claims that the images of palm trees in one snapshot of the video are multiple copies of a single template. Another examination apparently shows that the UFOs are pasted in over the video.

Hana Sahal, a 22-year-old nursing student from &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, and her nearly two-year-old daughter were found dead after the &lt;a href="Highway%20bridge%20in%20Minneapolis%2C%20Minnesota%2C%20collapses"&gt;collapse of the I-35W bridge&lt;/a&gt; in Minneapolis. Sahal was five months pregnant. With other remains discovered Friday, the death toll from the collapase is now at least nine.

Sahal died due to head injuries caused by the bridge's collapse. Omar Jamal, the director of the &lt;a href="w%3ASomali%20Justics%20Advocacy%20Center"&gt;Somali Justice Advocacy Center&lt;/a&gt; said that authorities informed Sahal's family of the death on Friday.

Minneapolis received US$5 million in emergency aid the morning after the disaster, and a further $5 million was secured by Minnesota's congressional delegation to set up alternative transportation options for motorists.

According to authorities, all remains that have been found have been identified, although there still may be people trapped in the bridge.

The 69,000 capacity crowd at the &lt;a href="w%3AAllianz%20Arena"&gt;Allianz Arena&lt;/a&gt; of football (soccer) fans watched Bayern pummel the Rostock goal to go top of the table.

The match was academic after Klose's 66 minute goal when Rostock keeper Stefan Wächter spilled a Philipp Lahm shot and when he also took his career 1.Bundesliga total to 99 goals with a header in the 85 minute.

The victory gave Bayern an early advantage over &lt;a href="w%3AVfB%20Stuttgart"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Schalke%2004"&gt;Schalke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWerder%20Bremen"&gt;Werder Bremen&lt;/a&gt;, who finished 1, 2 and 3 respectively last season.

<h2>Quotations</h2>
♡❤♡Ottmar Hitzfeld:♡❤♡ “We’ve delivered the goods today. , we knew the dangers posed by so-called underdogs, and Rostock have won three times in Munich in the past. We were very focused from the start, but there were four or five breaks where we saw that Hansa can play football. We gave them too much space, and I wasn’t pleased by that. The second half wasn’t easy either, because we didn’t get the second goal until late on. I’m delighted the risk with Toni worked out. He was a constant threat, and his presence also made Klose more effective. It’s good when strikers get off the mark in the first match, it takes the pressure off.“

♡❤♡Miroslav Klose:♡❤♡ “It was pretty good stuff for the first match, but no more than that. My partnership with Luca Toni’s already working very well. I hope we can keep it up, but we’ve got to do more with our chances, and work harder as a unit when we lose possession.“

♡❤♡Luca Toni:♡❤♡ “I haven’t been able to train with the team a great deal, but I really feel at home here. I believe things are going to go well. Obviously, it’s fantastic playing alongside Miroslav Klose, you’ve got to be delighted at having a partner as good as him.“

♡❤♡Frank Pagelsdorf (Hansa Rostock):♡❤♡ “Our school report for today would have noted that we were present. Bayern thoroughly deserved the margin of victory. We came here with big plans, but we couldn’t put them into action. We let them play far too much football, especially down the flanks in the second half.“

&lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Agovernor"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; and Republican presidential candidate &lt;a href="Mitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; won a recent &lt;a href="w%3Astraw%20poll"&gt;straw poll&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, gaining 31.6 percent of the votes, with &lt;a href="Mike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; following with 18.1 percent.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Cox"&gt;John Cox&lt;/a&gt; finished the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; straw poll in last place, ending with less than 0.5 percent of the vote.

Over 14,000 valid ballots were cast in the straw poll, which was conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3AIowa%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Iowa Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;. 

Earlier, a malfunctioning voting machine used in the Iowa straw poll forced at least 1,500 ballots to be counted by hand.
